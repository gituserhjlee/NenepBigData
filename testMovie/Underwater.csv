0,"A typical creature feature which is pretty much like a 90s creature features without any new or surprising elements about a crew of drilling company trying to survive a mysterious earthquake that is destroying the facilities.I approach every film with a neutral ground, yet this one is a none worthy movie that is lacking all the element of being good or interesting, from the cast choices, Kristen Stewart which I have no idea why she's still being cast in anything, least to say she still looks like a guy and in this one it's even worse, she looks literally like a boy...with below-average yo average acting talent at best! the story is repetitive, the horror - if there's any - depends only on the typical jump scares not the story elements, you can't relate to any of the characters, the sound is a disaster and the cinematography is unclear and foggy and the directing is all over the place. Least to say, it's not worth watching."
1,"Agreed, no character development but they did get straight into the action, from start to finish.There was some minor, trivial things that irritated me, for sure, but undeserved of the poopy ratings.I was entertained, which is the purpose for watching any movie. Armchair critics can go for a swim in the Mariana Trench. This movie was good."
2,"I'm really shocked the critics slammed this film, and at its low IMDb rating. My blood pressure and anxiety levels were red-zone from start 00:01 to 95:00 ending.Sure this film was The Abyss meets Aliens with a bit of The Poseidon Adventure, a lot of Pacific Rim and a dash of The Meg, but that's what made it fun! Don't people realize that 99.99% of original film ideas have already been done?Now add the fact that the two writers and directer are basically newb filmmakers, and were able to put this huge production together... mad respect and props! 🙌Acting was great with the proper amount of comic relief from the one character, and Stewart nailed her role. Cinematography was excellent, S/VFX outstanding, score on point, pacing amazing, and the 95 min runtime was perfect. I actually wanted more!Man, people need to chill and research the filmmakers of films, and to see this was a newb production, and give props were due. They have to start somewhere. There's been a ton of garbage out there coming from seasoned filmmakers, so this was refreshingly exciting and entertaining - start to finish.It's a well deserved 8/10 from me, and if anyone is questioning this review as being fake, click my username to see my 1000+ ratings and 800+ reviews, and read my bio on how to properly rate a film. Then go see this one!"
3,"Good acting, some character drama, the lowest point is T.J. Miller with his jokes, but in a nutshell the movie is like i said, watchable from time to time."
4,"As a fan of William Eubank's 2014 film ""The Signal"" I was pretty excited for this. The Signal offered a lot of thrills and suspense and a twist ending that leaves you gobsmacked.Underwater did not quite live up to the same shock value. Less build-up or development to make much of it float anywhere above mediocre. The setting, scenery, and cinematography and music however is stunning.This is the love child of Alien, Cloverfield, A Quiet Place, The Abyss, Soma, DeepStar Six, HP Lovecraft Etc. But doesn't carry as much weight."
5,"Remember three years ago, there was a movie called Life acted by Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal & Rebecca Ferguson? Okay, but instead of venturing into space, let's dive into water. And that's what you get from this movie, just that this is worse from Life. Not that it is bad either.Underwater feels very similar to Life in a way that it keeps the direction all the same. Plus, the lighting will also remind you of the 2017 movie.The storyline goes as these engineers who are looking for resources 7 miles below the ocean are unexpectedly bombarded with floods within their facilities and as time runs out, they must find a way to get back to land without knowing that something is lingering in the dark waiting to devour them. Basic storyline, formulaic one-by-one technique but its spotlight mostly covers on the intense escapade to find their way back to the shore. No worries, it's better than those 47 Meters movies.As everyone is wondering how Stewart performs, her acting here is not bad but not great too. It's acceptable. For a not-so-serious sci-fi film, she pulls this off quite decently. The tension is there, it's always there, and it manages to increase its intensity by styling the camera work and also the lighting effect. It does not rely fully on cheap jump scares.The best thing about Underwater has got to be its starting point. The film does not drag the movie with 30 minutes development before anything starts to occur. It goes straight to its main plot; 'survival is the key'. But here what it suffers, the development only shows its strength by half of the film and by that time, it's already too late for the audience to even give a thing about the characters.Now let's get to the slo-mo parts. They utilize this aspect quite a lot in the beginning and final 10 mins. Usually, we would get irritated by how much it sprinkles onto every scene but Underwater gets it right. And for a thriller/sci-fi, Underwater increases its thrilling factor by slowing down its motion picture. Adding to that, it looks cool.What I dislike the most is Underwater brings very little to the table. It's short with merely 90 minutes and instead of flooding the audience with many sub-stories, it leaves you feeling almost empty with only drops of information to satisfy our experience.By the final 20 minutes, you will be wondering if this is a spin-off to Godzilla. I thought the unknown species were gonna be realistically scary, but nope ,it rejects the notion to push that scary button and entertains the audience with a yet another tame PG-13 monster. But I can guarantee that the ending will not be as depressing as Life. Life has a good ending for those who want to find different satisfaction. For Underwater, it will please most of the audience thought it ends quite abruptly.Verdict: Underwater is a not-so-exciting adventure that tries to find its resources more than what other movies of the similar genre have provided, but in the end, the only thing you might find here is a sea of mineral water."
6,"As you might guess from the title - not alot of creativity on display here. Basically 'Alien' crossed with 'Quarantine' set on the bottom of the Pacific. Though the movie has zero Lovecraftian qualities, the megalithic monster is as good a Cthulhu as we can ask for, however (typical of CG monstrosities) scenes are too dark and too close up to make out appreciable details. Performances are smothered by the instantaneous catastrophe at the very start of the movie; characters are in crisis mode throughout with no opportunities for emotion or arch to shine through. The unrelenting panic and tension makes the few moments of cynical comic relief feel grossly inappropriate. The 'sci' in the sci-fi is also drowned out by monotonous panic; characters hurriedly press buttons, rewire circuit boards, and hop in and out of atmospheric diving suits without conventional exposition for the layman viewer. Not fully seeing the creature proved a severe strength in 'Alien', but not knowing what characters are doing or why makes it hard to follow any film. Look out for Neil deGrasse Tyson's scathing fact-checks soon.If you want a deep-sea thriller with fantastic story, bold characters, and edge-of-your-seat panic, check out 1989's THE ABYSS."
7,"....horrendous acting, no explanation for what happens, lacks a great deal of real scares, and is constantly shot in dark to save money, you can expect about 20 shill regular reviewers to tell you it was one of the best movies they ever saw, or the very over used ""better than expected"" in their reviews. The check from Fox/Disney is in the mail!Let me start with Stewart. She cannot act. People aren't bothering to go to her movies. She can change her hair, makeup, dress, it's still the same blank looks.They go right into the action. Their underwater station is imploding. Why? We never find out, why bother? This is set 7 miles underwater. A human cannot withstand this pressure. Not even for a 5 seconds! This depth would destroy a nuclear sub! Those are made out of reinforced high grade metal.The comparisons to Alien are a slap in the face to that movie!It's all about survival with no explanation as to how all this happened. Possibly you'll look to survive too, by leaving in the middle.One last point, this movie wrapped up 3 years ago! That's always a bad sign."
8,Kristen Stewart plays the heroine in this moderate budgeted film that takes place underwater during a massive weird earthquake that is devouring the world she and her friends live in. It's not as scary as is it given its family friendly PG-13 rating but its a decent rental.
9,"Deep sea explorations are something that have always fascinated me. We've gone to the moon and beyond, yet there are places deep below the ocean floor that have yet to be discovered, harboring any number of creatures not seen by human eyes. ""Underwater"" tries to play off that premise, but fails to execute it successfully in any really meaningful way.For a very basic overview, this movie focuses on a deep-water drilling station within the Marianas Trench. Ostensibly shadowing one worker, Norah (Kristin Stewart), it tells the story of how their drills tap into something that nearly wrecks the whole operation. With everything on the fritz and workers forced to ocean-walk from place to place, it quickly becomes clear they are being stalked by some sort of presence dredged up from the depths.First and foremost, ""Underwater"" could most easily be described as an ""Alien"" clone, swapping space for the ocean floor and Sigourney Weaver for Stewart (right down to the haircut and skimpy clothing, in all honesty). Unfortunately, while that concept was new and fresh in the 1970s, it doesn't work that way in 2020.So, what would have been needed to make this film solid was a great script, and there isn't even a speck of that here. Very clearly, this was the studio saying ""let's make an Alien clone, and we'll paste in the details as we go along"". It's both sad and disappointing, as there are indeed elements of interest present. Deep-water exploration is fascinating, drilling for resources at those depths could have been examined from a colonizing sort of perspective, and/or the psychological effects of spending so much time under the pressures of the sea. Sadly, none of those potential topics are provided anything more than lip service.As such, ""Underwater"" plays out more like a horror creature-feature. It is simply a group of people being chased around from point to point by a menacing figure that is finally revealed in the end. The design or technical specs of the monster is intriguing, to be sure, but when there is literally nothing else to care about it doesn't amount to much in the end.Overall, this is a very poorly conceived film and I can see why it is floundering at the box office. Not original enough to be scary, and not plot/character rich enough (by far) to be interesting in any other ways. A brutal combination. Only the concept will keep you watching whatsoever."
10,"There is a game that was released some years ago called Soma. It was made by the same people who made Amnesia and it is a quality scary game. This movie follows the same path you take of escape in that game and it give you a real feel of what it would be like to be in that atmosphere. Of course the closest thing you'd get to living through that yourself would be that game because obviously no one has lived through it irl. Also Kristen Stewart is too me what Brad Pitt is to women, so this movie has me caring about the actors in advance. TJ Miller is also a hilarious actor and he is funny in this he is much needed comedy from an otherwise dark drama anyone who says otherwise can fight me."
11,"The film jumps in with no back story just crash bang wallop, noise noise noise shakey camera. It makes the Meg look like Jaws."
12,"It is a travesty to compare masterpiece ""Alien"" to this mediocre film. As many reviewers stated: bad acting, bad script, no originality, even the effects are boring, it was too dark to see anything. The monsters are not even scary. At certain point i was rooting for the creature to eat all of them just to be done with this stupidity (don't even get me started on the science part). Conclusion: wait for rental"
13,"It may be damning with faint praise, but it's better than I thought it would be. If you love sci-fi/fantasy/action genre films and don't go in expecting a masterpiece, you could have a good time. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in craft. It looks great, has fine actors doing good work, and nice production design. Kristen Stewart shows she has the chops to carry a movie, even without a stellar story, and it delivers enough good action and tension to make up for its shortcomings."
14,"This was bad, really really bad. Movies steals, er borrows heavily from Aliens, The Descent, The Meg and never stays on point long enough to follow.1. First of all, Kirsten Stewart cannot act. We already knew that from the Twilight series, but figured with a different genre, writer and director maybe she could halfway manage(like Kneau Reeves in the Wick movies). Answer? No. From scared, depressed, death, excitement or curiosity, her face never changed or showed any visible emotion. Sadness.2. Director definitely took the Game of Thrones route of showing what you believe is action but in complete darkness, quick editing and shaking cam so that you have no idea what is going on. In several scences, you could not tell that someone was missing(nor did you care anymore).3. Yes, there has to be manufactured drama so a movie can exist, but a movie should not depend on manufactured drama from beginning to end. In movies where people are astronauts or divers, it takes years of training and psychological analysis to even be picked. Here all the of crew are SERIOUSLY mentally and/or emotionally incapacitated and this is quickly established in each character's initial statements.4. Science? Do not get me started.You are yelling at the screen and really have no sympathy of care for any of the characters, just a multi-million dollar waste."
15,"The last film distributed by 20th Century Fox before they were rebranded as 20th Century Studios by Disney, Underwater was shot in early 2017 for $50 million and then sat on a shelf for over two years. Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.At an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.Written by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic ""group of isolated people getting picked off one by one"". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.Sure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled ""too deep"" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.Kicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.Aesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.Elsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.In terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.Although Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature."
16,"Kristen Stewart is working in an underwater facility when it all goes horribly wrong.Oh no all the escape pods are taken so the survivors will have to don diving suits, catch a lift to the bottom of the ocean and walk home.
It should be fine as long as the waters aren't filled with some nasty monsters released by the drilling.
whoops!The action is immediate and hard hitting and thrilling.This has all the elements you can imagine, people getting stuck under things, oxygen running out, rooms filling with water, sea creatures mauling people etc.
The effects are great, the monsters interesting and it is all done quite well.""Quite well"" is the problem.
This film looks like it is going to be amazing and it is hard not to get excited about it.
So when it takes a paddle around lake-mediocrity it feels really, really bad.The characters are stark and relatable but you get no build up so you are always playing catch up with them and the relationships between them were a little unclear.
Kristen Stewart's character has a sub plot that should be really meaningful but just feels tacked on as it is relayed through the mediums of chitchat and locker junk.You get no feel of where the survivors are going so a lot of the plot relies on aptly placed road signs and a patronising version of Alexa, who is zero help to the crew, until it needs to explain how the film is going to end - which it does in patronising detail even drawing us a little picture.This is a pretty good disaster/monster flick but it feels like a lot of potential has been wasted - which makes me think less of this film than I should.The production and performances are all good.
Kristen Stewart is very good, but maybe she is stereotyped in my eyes as it took me twenty minutes to shake the feeling that she was on her way to a Halloween party dressed as ""the real slim shady"" when this all kicked off.A good enough movie but with a tiny bit more work and a little more nerve this would have easily been an absolute classic people were talking about for the next fifty years."
17,"The movie starts with a bang, not even 5 minutes into it the disaster starts the whole station is flooded, we get bits and piece of survivors here and there, they all meet in a lab room and decide the next step for survival.There is absolutely no character development, who are they you barely know, then the monster appear, start raising hell but even then there is not a lot of monster action either.....What cause the explosion, in the first place..... its never really explained, its not a mix of alien either, nor any underwater movie ever made it does stand on its own, the FX are amazing but a part from that there is no plot story, only going to one spot to the other in hope of survival....."
18,"Underwater (3.5 out of 5 stars).Underwater is a science fiction horror film that delivers a claustrophobia thriller with a good cast ensemble and performances, edgy music score, and a direction that feels like this film is trying to bring back a 1980s sci fi thriller like Alien movies, The Thing, or The Abyss (minus the creatures in this movie). I will say the film packs a punch with putting you into the action in the opening scene when an underwater facility is torn apart. Survivors Norah (Kristen Stewart), Paul (T.J. Miller), Lucien (Vincent Cassel), Emily (Jessica Henwick), and Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) are trying to make a way to the other station to find the evacuation pods. While the earthquake that shook the facility was not an ordinary quake. The drilling station has awakened something on the oceans surface with creatures that are trying to hunt the remaining survivors.May not be a fresh plot or concept idea. Underwater facility drilling in the oceans surface. Releasing some giant monstrous beast. And an army of humanoid creatures. The concept and plot is still exciting. As a group of survivors are trying to survive and escape from the stations before it collapses onto each other. They will go into claustrophobic settings of crawling into tight spaces. Or walking out onto the ocean surface with big underwater suits. Which the camera pans into their faces making it feel claustrophobia with the darkness out in the deep sea. Which anything can come into their faces at any given moment. I will say the film is intense and thrilling not really scary at all. It does try for a few jump scares with something running towards you. Or popping out in front of the screen.The cast ensemble was good. Kristen Stewart's performance is good playing Norah, a character that is struggling on leaving people behind in life and death situations. Stewart is coming along way with her acting. And she worked great in delivering the role. The music score by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts worked well delivering an edgy sci fi horror movie tone. Director William Eubank did a good job in creating a sci fi horror film. The movie begins with action and never stops for a breath until the credits roll. The first half is about characters trying to survive the wreckage. While the other half is the people getting killed off by a creature which barely shows. And they are trying to survive and escape.I will say my one issue with the movie is the quick editing cuts when the creatures are attacking them. The lighting is dark as it is cause they are out on the sea floor. It is a lot of fast editing cuts and shaky camera movements which can make it a little confusing. Sure, it was probably done to create the intensity direction on what is going on.Overall, Underwater is a pretty fair film. It could be a lot worse. It turns out to be a worthy sci fi horror film that is worth watching if your into those kind of movies. It is fast paced with action, has a good cast ensemble, and puts you onto the edge of your seat."
19,"This film could have been an interesting take on the monster movie genre, but so much of this movie was filmed with a macro lens that all you see are bubble heads, and nothing of the surrounding areas, set pieces, creatures, lighting effects, and so forth.And that's a shame really. I understand they were trying to go for a claustrophobic feel, but Alien (the movie) did that way better without resorting to super-duper-mega-close-ups all the darn time.3/10...at best."
20,"A potentially satisfying movie ruined by a terrible cinematography and an absolutely pathetic and messed up digital colour grade. What a shame! I miss this theme a lot and I really wanted to enjoy it, but it's all lazy and there's very little to appreciate. I guess that The Abyss is still ahead of time, even in its most basic technical aspects of image capture."
21,"I went into the theater thinking nothing of it and came out thinking it's good.
It's a strange type of mediocre. The film hits just the right marks but it does not get you excited just sparked enough to enjoy it.
Underwater moves too fast to be boring, which is good for this suspenseful film, but it also moves too fast to truly take notice of the cast of characters.
Some highlights of the cast are. Vincent Cassell, who was amazing as the station's captain. Makes we wish there was a new Star Trek or other science fiction series that needed a captain cause he would kill.
Another Highlight is TJ Miller. I'm surprise his name got on the poster cause I herd he was one of those guys in Hollywood that got canceled. The thing is, he is a supporting actor used for comedy relief and on this horror-like film, he did his job to perfection as the type of character who points out when they are in a horror cliche right on cue.
I should mention Kristan Stewart but I was not really impressed with her starring role because the advantage of being the star did nothing to improve her acting. Sorry, I'm just not impressed with anything she's done.
This movie is the closet that's ever happen. I can never say I don't like a kristan Stewart film cause I found this movie very watchable."
22,"I expected something of a mildly interesting monster flick to keep me entertained but... nope.
This film has a feeling that everything is moving in breakneck speed and provides little to no explanation as to why everything is happening.
Zero character development and bad direction all around.
Steward does what she does best: that one face with no emotion.
The rest characters are tolerable but have no depth written to them so... yeah.
The creatures are interesting but have no explanation attached to them so I couldn't understand the whys and hows.
Do not waste your time. There are plenty of decent stuff to watch besides this gigantic waste of time."
23,"It is not Oscar worthy but damn, its got TJ Miller in it with a stuffed bunny what else can you want. It is entertaining and lets leave it at that."
24,"We had Alien and Ripley-Sigourney WeaverNow we have Underwater and Kristen Stewart.Even a misogynist would root and care for Ripley and her fight for survival;With Kristen Stewart I find myself rooting for the monster.Hollywood messed up, again, something that could have been interesting because of casting choices."
25,This film is literally unbearable and boring. So predictable to see a group of people trapped underwater and making a way to escape. I just left the hall halfway.
26,They could have done a lot more with what they had. It has great visuals and cinematography but unfortunately thats all. Still worth a watch if u like sci-fi horror movies.
27,"Interesting to read that this movie languished for three years before being released, it would have been hard to justify it's continued existence. This contributes virtually nothing to the entertainment industry. Since underwater movies are a rarity one immediately compares it to The Abyss which had much more excitement, suspense, interest, charm, flair and mystery. Underwater has none of those things, shallow characters, little in the way of plot, awful CGI, nothing new under the sun. How many stupid clingy, bangy scenarios do we have to wade through in order to reach the end? The main character was well cast and played by Kristin Stewart, who puts in a solid performance but nothing can prevent this lack lustre clunker from sinking to the bottom of the ocean and remaining there forever. To describe this film as average does a disservice to average, forgettable, instantly forgettable."
28,"What a pleasant surprise especially in January. Kristen Stewart stars as a young woman living seven miles beneath the surface on a drilling station that ends up unearthing some terrifying creatures. The movie starts off with a bang as the station she's in begins to implode. Immediately it's a race against time as she hooks up with other survivors and the captain devises a plan that will have them walking across the dark ocean floor where they're not alone. With a rich, dark and sometimes intentionally muddled cinematography you are introduced to a spacious, endless world filled with floating debris that feels both wide and frighteningly claustrophobic. Funny guy TJ Miller, the awesome Vincent Cassel and cutie John Gallagher Jr. fill out some of the other supporting roles. Theres not a lot of setup but director William Eubank of the Signal establishes an intense, edge of your seat atmosphere accompanied by stylish cinematography and a mounting sense of dread. The movie is fun and is filled with homages to Alien and lovecraft all the while creating something new of it's own. The culmination of events left me wanting just a tiny bit more but I loved the retro feel as well as throwing itself so wholeheartedly into being an aquatic horror enormous sized creature feature. Although the story and characters aren't developed as well as you would hope the situational genre entry is anchored by a strong bad ass and against type lead performance from Kristen Stewart. This is one I'll definitely be seeing again in theaters."
29,"I'm huge fan of creature feature horrors, especially ones set in space or underwater.
To say this movie is a disappointment is a big understatement.
Bland characters, bad casting, almost no character introductions, I didn't care about any of them, did't even remember one name, disappointing creature design, just... how did this happen?
Yes its watchable but will I remember this movie? Absolutely not. This is not how you do it. Also, Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress.
What a ""great"" start of 2020."
30,"Underwater is a location-based thriller that's beyond easy to lose yourself within. Kristen Stewart enthusiastically fights against sea monsters of an extraterrestrial brand, while also combating natural dangers that come along with humans invading where they should not.Have we forgotten how most movies are reinventions of existing inspirations?Yes it's ""Alien but underwater,"" and that's a good thing given how a top-notch Kristen Stewart leads us on a terrifying dive into the deepest reaches of aquatic horror."
31,"Studio: ""Let's attach some edgy actors to this middling project, spend 80 million on it, and hope audiences don't notice we completely neglected character development or an interesting plot that has even a hint of originality.""Here we have a protagonist we get to see for a mere few minutes before we're thrust headlong into disaster. At that point, we know absolutely nothing about the characters and we're supposed to care about their struggle to survive.I don't think so.Not to mention the Mariana Trench has more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level and we're supposed to believe humans can walk around down there with suits on.Go back to screenwriting school."
32,This is a non original story. But the real problem is that it is not well directed and has a bad screenplay too. It is not exciting at all. It's a shameful and scandalous bad copy of Alien that is not worthy to talk about it.More than underwater is underwear.
33,Total junk. I've seen less wooden acting at a puppet show.
34,"Not every word written by man should be turned into a movie. 80,000,000 budget? Come on, no way.By looking at my review history you would think I would just stop watching movies. By the look of it eventually I will not have a choice. Good movies do not need my help to succeed so there is no point to review them. Wasting this type of money on something like this film though should be a crime. That is why I review these carp movies.People should get fed up and start boycotting this drivel. I guarantee there are still good original scripts. There is a trend of corporations now being scarred to offend these trash and cave in to these weird failure movies.Eventually the money will dry up, hopefully."
35,"I enjoyed this movie,KRISTEN STEWART never looked better & executed the character well,yes you do get a sense of the ALIEN franchise and that's OK because it doesn't rip the franchise off,I loved the deep diving suits that make the crew look like they are about to fight in some futuristic SCI-FI battle,this movie shines a light on the reality that DEEP SPACE is not the only uncharted plain that man explores and the DEEP SEA is its equal in every sense and maybe more than that,the expectation of life 6 million light years away is intriguing but only 6.9 miles deep in our own oceans is were this oil rig crew will discover the unknown...ENJOYABLE"
36,"Basically, this movie is about Kristen Stewart walking around the entire movie in her underwear with an Ellen DeGeneres haircut .Somehow during a catastrophe she is able to later change into some sort of dominatrix underwear costume toward the end of the film and for some unknown reason, keeps bending over and picking things up while the camera quickly pans over her buttocks and upper body.The entire story was something a 5 year old would come up with and Kristen Stewart's acting was so bad that I think she either HATED the role or she is so caught up in her strange life that she can NO LONGER ACT. I mean it's that bad!Either way, here is the layout.1) Kristen Stewart keeps looking at a picture of her African American Boyfriend throughout the entire film for some unknown reason.
2) Gay tension between Kristen Stewart and another female lead (even though Stewart is supposedly engaged to a black man).
3) The leader of the exploration team has an accent to, of course, give him credibility..
4) The sole white guy is a bumbling idiot.
5) The profanity is through the roofAll in all, the movie is beyond a let down and I am glad Kristen Stewart made a few good movies before her career completely died by being in this film."
37,"There are better under water movies.Dull trite.Oops, sorry my review is too short apparently. How can I expand on dull, boring, slow, badly scripted, I want to chew my own hand off waste of time.This was worse than eating a fast food burger."
38,"How does this perpetual box office loser get these roles?!?!?!
Kristen Stewart can't act. She continues to litter Hollywood with her horrible craft. She ruins what could have been a very intriguing movie. It had promise. Now promise me never to put Kristen Stewart in another movie role. Time for her to retire....go work at Walmart or something."
39,"Difficult too believe all these years after the amazing film Abyss , with all the modern writers, that such a boring film can be made .Not worth your time go watch The abyss."
40,"This is a total crap, copy of alien but a very bad copy. The screenplay is super simple and the director did a very bad job. Overall dont watch this crap."
41,"Tried to give this a chance, promising start, Kirsten Stewart.. but it was too painful, I don't know what happens but I can honestly say I don't care. Mindless, bad acting, bad writing.. how did this pass? Avoid."
42,"First of all, this movie is about the giant structure that lays deep down in the ocean but nowhere in the movie did we get to appreciate that. Everything was focused on the small stuffs. Honestly, nothing in the movie really took my breath away. I felt really bored. Acting was also bad. I didnt connect with any of the characters. The movie was also too dark; all I saw was people walking around on the ocean floor. Highly not recommended."
43,"Since the release date of this movie actually back in 2017, they don't want to compete with Life or Alien : Covenant in the same year, so they released it this year."
44,"Please don't waste your time watching this, it's unbelievably bad. The story is disjointed and woolly. The editing is so dreadful you can't tell what's going on - worst I've seen in ages. Normally I'd write more info in a review but I simply can't be bothered. 'Nuff said."
45,Kept looking at my phone for the time. Got soooo bored. No characters development. I couldn't even give you the names of any of the characters. Watching it really was a waste of time
46,"I always like to welcome a new monster into the world of sci-fi so getting me to schedule a meeting is no problem. In this case, I forked out movie cinema money for the big theater experience and was not disappointed. You have a tense, action filled little hour and a half of the world of the underwater and all its surprises and wonders. Add earthquakes, trench movements and some unknown previous undiscovered life-form out there and you have covered the price of admission. There are parts you can critique but I noticed I was gripping the arm rests and had some jump or heavy focus moments that drown (pun) out any take-aways. The actors covered it and the sets impressive as to be realistic. As to the life-form itself, hey anything that has to put up with pressures, cold water, predator activity and lots of Acts of nature and intrusions by mankind has to be in itself one bad entity for endurance or survival sake. Think survival of the fittest. Everything alive today represents the strongest and best of its kind as a rule. No exceptions here. This is a snack movie for two reasons: something to do in-between the action and something to eat during it. so have a large portion or more than one and include a tasty drink"
47,Don't waste your time with this title. The acting is mediocre at best....
48,"REVIEW - UNDERWATERUK RELEASE DATE 7 February 20Cloverfield,
Godzilla,
Alien,
The Abyiss.The above films either were great, had parts of them that were great or since being released have become just great films to watch.Each building the suspence up in their own way and making you actually care what happens to the characters not to mention the stories, unfortunately......Literally this film is a rip off from all of the above in one way that doesn't carry across the suspence and you certainly don't care what happens to any of the characters except one, the little stuffed bunny.It's such a shame really because this film could have done so much more but just didn't lazy writing.Acting except for the stuffed bunny was acceptable but it just become boring towards the predictable end.Certainly one to see if it's on TV.Rating 6 out of 10"
49,"The realm of horror, as I have said before, is an avenue that allows the darkest fathoms of the imagination to come to life. Horrors and fears can take on many forms and in some cases the directors capture that terror in the perfect balance. On the other hand, the modern cinema also ruins the genre when cheap gimmicks fail to scare and become the focus. So what is tonight's film all about? Well Robbie K is here to offer some thoughts and insight as he makes spoiler free review of:
LIKES:The Decent Comedy
Decent Acting/And Time Worthy Characters
Great Pace
Suspense Moments
Creature Design
The Atmosphere
The Story Is OkayDISLIKES:The Predictability
T.J. Miller Forced Some Times
The Chaotic Camera Work at Times
Suspension Of Disbelief At Times
The Worthlessness of Most Of the CrewSUMMARY:When it comes to a horror movie you can't help but want to laugh through the movie. Okay, I need to think of a better transition, but the film succeeds on throwing that comedic relief at just the right moments to help change the energy of the scene. That aside, the real strength of the movie comes in the cohesiveness of all the little parts that this genre thrives on when done right. First the acting! While not award winning, I was very happy to have characters that had more layers than the typical creature fodder Sci Fi Channel has made famous. Underwater's crew is different though, as Steward leads the bunch in a thrilling adventure that puts science skills to the test. Several members make logical decisions, there is great interaction amidst the crew, and the teamwork they show actually paints characters that are worth investing your time in. And through this adventure, let's just say there are a lot of things that will test your connection to them. This film moves quickly, a brisk pace that never dwells long enough for boredom, and takes few detours in the quest to escape the denizens of the deep. Mixing well with the pace comes very suspenseful moments that utilize so many special effects to paint the terrifying canvas of the deep in new ways that will insight nightmares. Some of the moments are all about the setting itself, while others integrate the creatures and allow the use of imagination to paint the terror. It works fantastically well, and when the revelation of the creatures finally arises, the design does not fail to impress. Monsters are made of nightmares like this, and they are utilized to a fine degree that does not overshadow the rest of the tale, but still gives you plenty of creature love. Yet what really ties everything for me is the atmosphere itself. Underwater uses its name well, and helps blend the adventure into sections that together form a cataclysmic environment. There are few safe havens in this movie, with the beasts lurking around every corner, and when they aren't the environment itself is ready to douse the life out of them. Throw in the use of shadows, fantastic sound editing, and again the tease with imagination that designs that environment. Finally, there is actually a point to all the chaos, with a logical connecting line that actually grants purpose to the antics at hand. Underwater takes the familiar story, and changes the acts to help keep the adventure fresh and dynamic.Amidst all the treasure, there are some rusted metals that tarnish the movie for this reviewer. For one the story is pretty predictable, still following most of the rules and trends that the SyFy channel movies do. A few twists do help stir the sediment up a bit, but you have an idea where it is going. Thankfully, this predictability is lessened due to the intensity of the scenes themselves. As mentioned above, there is comedic relief, and while enjoyable at times, there are other times where the awkward joke is too forced or beaten over the head for it to really work. This works in movies like Deadpool, and while I think it's curb to show how he is dealing with the stressful situation, there are times I would have liked to see a little more from this character other than another joke. These are probably minor dislikes for me, so I'll move on to a few of the things that were more bothersome for me. As many of you know, I'm not the biggest fan of chaotic camera work when it comes to details. While this added to the intensity of the scene, I felt Underwater went a little too crazy at times, using the swirling madness, and shadows a little too much to deprive the details I wanted to see. This aspect improved near the ending, but the middle parts had a hard time finding the balance between stable and maddening angles. Next, the suspension of disbelief sometimes is a little laughable for me in this film. I know, in this genre one must be ready to do this, but hear me out a little. Again with no spoilers, Underwater sort of does not play by its own rules it establishes at the beginning. The creatures behavior is erratic, sometimes being aggressive and other times not, which is sort of explained at the times, but then overwritten for me. Other times it's about how convenient things work out or don't work out, which though adds to the intensity of the scene, will in retrospective seem a bit cheesy at how things happen to play out. If this does not bother you or take away from the suspense, no worries then, but near the end in particular is where I particularly found them stretching their convenience muscles a little too far. Finally, though the movie is much better with crafting their characters than other creature features, it still has not quite put the finesse in everyone. For a crew of scientists, drillers, and deep-sea explorers, only one or two really show off the scientific skills that were promised. Kristen Stewart's character is the most equipped to handle the job and maybe the Captain, but the rest well, they don't quite hit the mark for epic battles.THE VERDICT:Overall, the creature feature is one of the best to emerge from the depths of the Hollywood ocean. Underwater takes us back to the days of classic film storytelling, where a story is designed to tether the scares, special effects of scenery and modern computer work add for decent scare factors, and the intensity of the sequences help net your interest in characters that aren't just shark fodder like a classic SyFy movie. While there are still some predictability issues, and the suspension of disbelief starts cooking up things, there are not too many issues that most fans of this genre will be affected. Again, I'm not particular fond of chaos swirling camera work, but I again admit it adds to the moments and at least gets balanced. Give all the CGI work, the decent story, and performances, this guy encourages you to head to the theater for this one to enjoy to the most, but if not definitely check it out at home.My scores are:Action/Drama/Horror: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"
50,"I think we can all agree we don't need any more Kristen Stewart playing the sexy, emotionally struggling character anymore. Please, enough of this role. Secondly, the sci-fi bits of the movie are that a drill is underwater, and the drill station's interiors are ""sci-fi-y"", like something in outer space kinda of deal. I appreciated all 5 or 6 seconds of shots that appeared throughout the hour and a half long movie. Lastly, the ending was not in-tune with what ""the scientist"" brought us to consider. Nothing new in this movie. Just an older Kristen Stewart, and underwater setting for ""things gone wrong and there's a monster"". Because of course there is a monster, otherwise where would the agency be. And a lot of walking. And stopping. And walking. And ""oh no, he died"". What a waste. Looked like this was made in the 90's. Trope movie. :/"
51,"1. No character development2. The movie is shaky (I had motion sickness from the very first scene in the movie)3. So noisy, can't hear a word or a thing (only hear the background all the time)4. So dark (can't see a thing)5. No explanation"
52,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Nice sets, engaging tension, good alien design anf execution. Likeable characters and even when I thought Kristen Stewart was only outperformed in the skill of one-face acting by Frodo and Darth Vader, she is surprisingly good in this one! No idea why this movie is so badly rated. I thought it was well executed and very ""Aliens-esque"" enjoyable."
53,"Where do I begin, absolutely no context with the beginning, just gets straight into it. Kinda like I will with this review, not only did this movie lack a plot but it also lacked any kind of substance with the script. You created a movie with Kristen Stewart as the lead role and gave her little to no depth as a character. There's not much worse then Kristen Stewart's acting but at least the director should have known that she's a type cast and she's only good for certain roles. This was not one of them. You needed someone to carry this movie considering there was only 5 actors and they all had low energy except for the one funny guy. When I say this movie was unbearable to watch I'm not saying it lightly. I mean e for effort on trying to be original but the difference between extraordinary and ordinary is that little extra and the extra effort to make this good was nowhere to be found"
54,"We luckily have an unlimited pass so we see a lot of movies both good and bad.. this one is most obviously on the bad list..there's no real plot, we're never properly introduced to any real story line or characters, we have NO idea why they're drilling or what they're drilling, and well.. the only thing that kept it afloat was TJ Miller and his one liners.it was obviously a filler movie while the actors were filming something else (ie the lead actresses haircut being the same cut in her other movie coming soon.....)The alien design is lacking and they keep it in the dark most of the scenes it/they are even inDo yourself a favor and just rewatch Alien or The Abyss..it's essentially a poor mashup of the two."
55,"Something is wrong with he new generation. They don't have a sense of reality. This movie has bad camera, bad script and just a copy of an old movie."
56,To be honest this an effort that will be quickly forgotten and is not really worth watching. It's all been done before and done better. I found the abrupt style of the opening to be too jarring and not work well. The enemies are unremarkable don't really provoke much of a reaction if you have seen an alien movie for example. The ending itself also constitutes the reuse of a tired cliche. You'll probably regret watching it.
57,Not bad but not so good watchable in your free time
58,"Underwater, was a film I found particularly frustrating as it seems to build a nice atmosphere and do some interesting things in its opening scene, it builds a solid foundation for our protagonist played by Kristen Stewart and gives us an interesting world. The best part of this film is most definitely her performance which is very good and multi layered.However there are so many things that make this movie such a disappointment, I found most of the supporting cast particularly frustrating, especially TJ millers character who can't help but crack jokes every single line he has, even in scenes that are supposed to be emotional for all the characters involved. The film thinks its being scary but all its doing is giving you cheap jump scares through its music. Seriously every time the camera hovered over the monsters it gives us the typical jump scare music. The writing in the film is also really bad which may be a reason why most of the characters are unlikeable. This also is one of the most cliched predictable movies ever, I pretty much knew what was going to happen to every character as soon as they were introduced and it went down exactly how I thought it would. Also I noticed a lot of shaky cam and shoddy editing in scenes where the characters were being chased or attacked.Overall Underwater was a film where if the director decided to go in a different direction, highlighting the claustrophobia of being trapped deep underwater and utilising Kristen Stewart's great performance into something more involved with this concept, Underwater could have been truly great, however we are left with a typical horror movie that you have seen in many different forms over the years with one good performance and that is from Kristen Stewart."
59,"Before seeing this movie, I had read reviews (not on IMDB) that panned this film, and essentially called it garbage. Being a fan of sci-fi/horror films, I had made my mind up to see the film, despite the poor reviews. I don't know what movie those critics had watched, but I found myself liking to this movie very much.I am not a huge Kristen Stewart fan; actually, I think she's kind of a flake. She turns in a solid performance, and makes for a fairly decent action star. T.J. Miller plays his usual funny guy that dies character, much as he had done in ""Cloverfield"". Everyone played their parts well.The tension and suspense start fairly early in the movie, and pretty much maintain a taut edge until the final few moments. The film has elements of ""Alien"", ""The Abyss"", and ""Cloverfield"". The ending leaves room for a sequel and if a sequel is made, I will definitely go and see it."
60,It would take me longer to explain everything wrong with this movie than the length of the film. Trust me. Just watch the preview. That's the absolute best 2 minutes you will get out of it.
61,"Just back from seeing this tonight & felt the film could've been far greater after seeing a last chance screening.The film follows a group of engineers trapped in an underwater facility 7 miles below the sea after something attacks them. They then must find a way back to the surface before the facility explodes & kills them all.I found the film to be random, primarily because it lacked depth & explanation. Like why was the creature attacking them in the first place? What were the engineers doing in the first place, never mind who the engineers were themselves. There was no kind of ""point"" or ""reason"" behind it, at all. I will however give it to the filmmakers, the film did literally throw you into the action & didn't waste any time in doing so, but honestly I would've liked a proper introduction, backstory & some character development.The camerawork was too close up to make out where the characters were, never mind what rooms(s), sections or locations around the facility they were in. Up, down, left, right where? It was pretty disorientating & annoying. The lighting also didn't help with this & only added to the camerawork issue. Furthermore, the creature itself fell victim to the 2 above issues, camerawork & lighting, you could barely get an idea of what the creature looked like, never mind how big it was or what it was for that matter. Even when you did see the creature it was a bit too alien like for an underwater creature.While the deaths were bloody, they were pretty boring & naff. While the suspense was good, the payoffs weren't all that. However, the dark sinister mood & little bit of eye candy for us lads was something. The ending wasn't too bad, but as I said at the start the point of the film was lost & the why could've been easily addressed. The pacing was a little off too.Overall, an ok horror, sci-fi film that could do with a substantial amount of improvement. The film felt too random, pointless, bland due to the lacking in depth & backstory which could've saved this one, that & a few unique, cool & bloody deaths could've made this film way better than it actually was. 4/10"
62,"Underwater wouldn't even fare as a theatrical release, it has DTV quality. The sets feel cheap and low budget, the cinematography lifeless. It has no atmosphere for being underwater that is its biggest crime. But the acting. Kristen is terrible. TJ Miller, yes that guy who committed terrorist acts, still gets put in movies. I wish I could get a refund. We have seen this same script about eight hundred times."
63,Great idea. Kristen Stewart has shown that she can't carry a lead role. She's the one dimensional equivalent of Shia LaBeouf. How is she getting these roles??? Her movies are bombing at the box office.
64,"Director William Eubank takes a French captain and a bunch of good-looking Millennials to the bottom of the sea. That sounds dumb but I was actually engaged the whole time. Well, most of the time.When Disney purchased 20th Century Fox, the release date for this movie was pushed to January 2020. The film was shot clear back in 2017 when a similar movie called Life hit theaters. Did you see that one? Instead of going out to space like that film, guess where this movie takes place? Exactly...UNDERWATER. Same movie, basically. Still entertaining.
You can watch my full movie review on YouTube on the Movie Review Mom channel!"
65,"Really a very bad movie in every aspect ,I couldn't enjoy it at all, such a waste of time !Bad acting, bad Directing, bad story and a very bad scenario !Don't recommend it to anyone ...,!"
66,"I had such great anticipation for this movie and then I watched it....where was the scifi action and terror? Maybe they forgot to add that with reshoots. This movie is a pure waste of time unless you like boring movies with a bunch of unnecessary noise. Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress and her role in this movie solidified that. Just a boring character with no point. The movie as a whole has no backstory. Great premise though but definitely wasn't what I watched. Speaking of, the monster in this movie...ummm I'm still trying to figure it out. Although I think it could have been a great idea with different writers and a better lead. Hope you enjoy alot of closeups."
67,"After seeing other indetwater creatures flicks like DeepStar Six, Leviathan, the Abyss and others, I didn't expect something new. But, it isn't about the theme. It's about the treatment of the story.Without giving details, you can experience the tension, the fear and the desesperation of the characters, specially Norah, by Krysten Stewary, which gives a good performace, for my surprise.I had a good time seeing it, even if it isn't a novelty in the creature films history."
68,"I can understand that the director is trying to ""things you couldn't see could be scary"" idea. But the execution failed. Didn't feel any thrill.The plot is lackluster. Almost has no goal from the beginning. Just a long drag.
A journey without destination or purpose.Don't waste your time. There are better ones out there."
69,"This could have been a great movie but its just boring. This story is just mixed up and is in chaos. Story is similar to alien,the pyramid but they were good movies. The movie itself is too dark and dull. There's nothing new here. The meg is a much better movie"
70,"« Underwater » aka the film made two years ago where Kristen Stewart confronts critters from the hell of the abyss. It's easy, it's cool, it's tense, it's well done, and it's highly recommended for any fan of this kind of program: Alien, Abyss, Deep Blue Sea, Life and Leviathan (1989). A real pleasure, too rare to be shunned. He takes a few codes from these films, but offers something new (in his mix). The film is really guts. Like « Crawl » last year, « Unterwater » turns out to be a tight, visceral and sensitive B series, which goes straight to the point. Claustro and mysterious atmosphere at will, production design in « Bioshock » sauce, without forgetting an excellent Kristen Stewart , it is always a pleasure to find this actress. A good surprise very oriented « horror film » !"
71,"Underwater is a perfect example of a movie that's more enjoyable once you shut off your brain and just go along for the ride. I went in with low expectations after some of the reviews left here, but upon watching the film myself those reviews seem unnecessarily harsh.This movie isn't perfect by any means, but it's not the drivel other reviewers make it out to be. There is no character development, and there's an awkward subplot concerning the captains dead daughter that just... doesn't go anywhere. At a certain point, as long as a movie is enjoyable, there's no harm in focusing on style over substance.I also don't get the criticism that the movie is unoriginal. When is the last time you saw a film that didn't borrow story points or ideas from other movies? Yes, Kristen Stewart is doing her best Ripley from Alien impression. Yes, other films have depicted aliens/creatures along the ocean floor. And unfortunately the movie won't win best original screenplay at the academy awards, but I generally watch movies looking for a fun time and try to leave my prejudice at the door.The part of the film that worked the least for me was TJ Miller. Any tension in a scene is completely undone by him shooting off some dumb quip or the camera turning to him to catch a ""funny"" expression. Much like all of his other roles, Miller is there to spout off one liners and have an incredibly punchable face. Moviegoers have progressed past the need for TJ Miller.If you're looking for a way to spend 90 minutes, you could certainly do a lot worse."
72,"I'm afraid this turkey sank. Not because of the far-fetched premise; sure the phenomenal water pressures of the Mariana Trench where Underwater is set does make this hard to believe. But not so long ago we've had Hollywood drilling right through the core of the Earth, and even venturing into a black hole. Ridiculous, right? But this is not a documentary. It's. Science. Fiction.Not a fail because of acting, either. Vincent Cassel is solid, as always. TJ Miller plays the annoying buffoon, as per usual, and adds a bit of fun. A super-fit Kristen Stewart is the standout and you'll see a range of emotions flash over her face including horror, anger, determination, resignation, triumph, despair - if only the anti-Stewart trolls cared to look! The hard working cast and their stuntpersons take a battering in the action-filled plot right from the start.Underwater fails because it generates no suspense. The screenplay and the direction leave it floundering. 91 minutes seems a lot more.Much of the movie is visually dark but where that worked so well in creating drama for a film like Alien, with Underwater it flops. Special effects, sound and editing are good, but alas to no avail; they can make a good movie into a great one but can't save a dud. Leave this one at the bottom of the sea."
73,"Movie start with credits where they show, how being that deep in the ocean can effect someones psyche and in the first shot we see stewart talking about she doesn't know if she is a sleep or awake, is it night or is it day. And these are all good threads to follow in an underwater action/horror flick. instead, movie doesn't even bother with those aspects ever again and focus on ripping of ailen (unsuccessfully).this movie didn't need any ailens, underwater pressure was an obstacle enough. If we get to know who these characters are and what were their inner conflicts we as the viewer would care much more about the people dying than we did. and our main character didn't have any inner conflict or any mistakes that we know of so we can root for her to get her redemption. People in the reviews talk a lot about stewarts acting but even if you cast the most talented actress on the planet on that role, what does she have to go on? she had a boy friend who is lost while diving? oh god.. what a lazy story that creates more questions than answers, in fact here are my questions:If her boyfriend died while diving, why did she choose this job?
Did her boyfriend dying had no effect on our hero?
Why should we as viewers care about this boyfriend while we never saw their relationships? ...In short, I would care about this movie much more if it started with whole cast interacting with one another, get to know them and feel sorry for them when they die. Plus, if it started as a slow pace thriller and ramp up to the earthquake (not ailens..) it would be much more entertaining (at least for me)."
74,"Holy moly, what a steaming pile of garbage!I guess the budget was blown on the visuals. Nothing left for building characters or giving them useful dialogue. Beginning and middle were horrible. Got a little better towards the end -- but an all-around waste of time.This story has already been told a hundred times with better acting, characters, and writing. Don't bother."
75,"This movie has a lot of good and bad mixed in with it. Sadly I feel like the bad pulls the movie down far too much.In regards to the positives, I really enjoyed the setting. I have always liked movies with creatures lurking in the dark, ready to claim their next victim at any moment. The movie did this well and used the extremely dark ocean floor in interesting ways that I felt really made the movie interesting. I also loved the diving suits that were utilized in the film. They had a great design that was very satisfying to me.There were two areas where this movie faulted for me. The first was in its character development and interactions. There was always something that seemed to be propelling the plot forward in a manner that felt rushed. Because of this it was hard to get any development that makes you feel for the characters in any significant ways. I felt this was a big drawback especially since it seems like the characters had potential to be very interesting. The second area this movie failed was in its last act. The movie has a drastic development that took me out of the movie. I really did not enjoy it and I felt it detracted from the movie greatly. I can see some people liking this development but I feel like the majority will not.Overall this is an average movie that could be a fun one time watch if you cannot seem to find anything else. This movie could have been much better but I feel like it ruined promising potential with poor choices."
76,"On a underwater station somewhere between the surface and the bottom and the station is made of reinforced concrete, the bathroom has ceramic tiles. Yep now thanks"
77,The kindest thing I could think for this movie is that it's a case study in movie tropes. From Kristen Stewarts glasses and super hacking skills to her heroic sacrifice at the end. Don't even ask what happens to the token black dude that nobody knew and the half Asian chick.It's kind of Alien crossed with the Kursk supposedly in the Mariana Trench. There are a few jump scares and tense moments but no attempt to be even remotely scientifically realistic.Someone said Kristen Stewart was good well I guess in the context of her career this may be her greatest ever performance.
78,"This film seemed to be just an excuse for Kristin Stewart to run around in her barely- there underwear. UGG. Besides that this is a (and this is pretty hard to do) BORING monster film. Saw this and The Turning this weekend, what a waste of time and money.As other reviewers have probably mentioned this is like an underwater ALIEN without any of the suspense, acting or thrills.Or, just like the ABYSS with bad monster instead of good monsters. Total time sucker with no reward. Avoid this film!"
79,"Apparently everyone is a movie critic and some were super hard on this movie but I found it to be action packed from the first couple of minutes and it kept my interest the entire time! If the preview for the movie seems like something you would like, then you will enjoy it!"
80,"Underwater does a lot of things well. It takes inspiration from films like Aliens and blends in elements, reminiscent of the deep sea horror fantasy, found in the works of H.P. Lovecraft.The result is an inherently watchable film that's fast, frightening and creepily chilling, whilst still managing to be exciting and oddly uplifting.8/10 from me."
81,"Heres another movie that could have had a lot of potential but they dropped the ball. Do we care who dies in this movie? No because there was no character development. They know nothing about the creatures and don't even try to figure them out. It is NOT aliens, Abyss, Godzilla not even Leviathan. Not even close. Nobody is tough or smart, no leaders, And I wish I knew how the light never goes out in their suits. Dark, shaky, difficult to watch. Lets not forget the amount of pressure there is at that depth, 7 miles down about 15,000psi. None of that matters in this Hollywood movie. They botched it."
82,"But i got nothing at all!!!
this movie is boring A.F. one would think that this girl who has been acting since she was ten years old or something would have learned how to act by now....but no.
not a single moment in this movie was entertaining to me.
she is a sight to behold in her little outfit near the end of the movie but thats just about it. in fact all the actors where un-interesting and none of them make you care for the character they play.
big flop!"
83,"I saw ""Underwater"", starring Kristen Stewart-Charlie's Angels_2019, Jumper; T.J. Miller-the Deadpool movies, Rock of Ages; Vincent Cassel-Jason Bourne, Eastern Promises and Jessica Henwick-Iron Fist_tv, Game of Thrones_tv.
This is an entertaining underwater creature feature. At the beginning of the movie, you get a quick synopsis of what has been going on. A research facility located about 7 miles below the surface of the ocean has a crew of about 300 people doing all kinds of researching. Primarily, they are drilling into the ocean floor and there are several different laboratories, several hundred feet apart. Kristen is in one of them when an earthquake hits and causes about 70% damage to the facility she is in. She looks for other survivors which include T.J., Vincent and Jessica and they decide that their best bet is to get to one of the other stations-the escape pods in their facility are damaged-and find a way to the surface. Their only option is to walk on the ocean floor-in pressurized oxygen suits, of course-but they soon find out that they are not alone in the water. It seems that the quake must have awaken some subterranean creatures and they don't like being awakened. Plus, Kristen and company are running low on oxygen in their suits. There is a message quickly glossed over about not being down there in the first place and doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like drilling, but it is quick. Like I said earlier, it is entertaining.
It's rated PG-13 for sci_fi action, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
84,"Ok - so not a huge Kristen fan - but gave this one a shot. This movie isn't ""Amazing"" - but it's not bad. I enjoyed the creature special effects - and general plot line. Acting was pretty good as well.Overall - worth a watch. - It's a lot like the ""Abyss"" movie - kind along the same kind of lines."
85,"You can watch this movie, but will you be able to see anything? Nope. Blurry, dark, jumpy - a disaster aspiring to be another ""Alien"" without putting in the work, Underwater feels like eating air. Once it was over, I literally felt nothing. It was as if it never happened.Sure the action starts early with an earthquake putting the characters in danger right off the bat, but with that, each character is as forgettable as the next. Essentially numbers - not people.The audio is muffled and inaudible (to mimic ...you guessed it...being underwater). Continuing with that Blair Witch underwater theme - the visuals are dark, shaky, and filmed with a green hue. Couple that with a continuous blinking - and this leaves you straining to hear what's being said from one underwater spacesuit to the other, and straining to see what the heck is happening.Underwater will leave you as expressionless and complacent as Kristen Stewart's acting."
86,"I wante to like this film, but most of the movie is presented in murky water, I could barely see what I was looking at, the monsters were great but I barely got to see them and the monologues of the central character are just so... lame, for lack of a better word. Saw the ending coming from a mile away too."
87,Lucky the cinema's seat was comfortable I had a nice nap while watching it you can guess how bad the movie is first 5 mins of it
88,"This movie had some suspense, but something seemed off. Maybe it was the poor acting, the bad one liners, I'm not sure, but it's not worth seeing."
89,Don't see monsters until last scene and scrappy cgi
90,"I thought it MIGHT be exciting, which, some parts were, and I looked up reviews on IMDb and YouTube, and I thought I'd give it a go.As mentioned, some parts were exciting, but a lot of it wasn't. Poor character stories that did not work well with the plot, a lot was unexplained, the recording of the sound/voice track was terrible - I could barely hear the conversations that were happening and they were not whispering.I'll admit, I jumped on occasion, and I was a bit tense in some scenes, but it was a poor movie, and a lot just did not make sense."
91,"Well, I think I said enough. Boring. I don't even know what's happening. Some visual effects with no story at all.
I mean si-fi is more than visual effects & crazy suits. I'm sorry I came to watch this movie."
92,"If you gave it more depth, lore and mystery could be a good movie but it has absolutely nothing like that.
Am I supposed to know that the monster that comes out is Cthullu? How? For a graffiti that appears on a wall in a film frame?
The plot is void, everything is supposed to be secret, so much that they didn't even know what the movie was about.
The character that does not stop joking you completely out of the movie.
The best is the setting and the scene in which one explodes from the pressure.
I have read people who compare this with alien ... Have you seen the same movie as me?"
93,"Greetings again from the darkness. The opening credits have an ""X-Files"" look and feel. Newspaper headlines and redacted reports zip by ... in fact, the rapid cuts are so quick that very few viewers will be able to keep up. Even if you haven't finished your Evelyn Woods speed-reading course, the gist is clear: there is a (very) deep-water drilling lab located 36,000 feet below the ocean's surface. Yep, that's almost 7 miles deep for the crew of 316, and some mysterious bad things may or may not be lurking. That's really our only set-up ... unless you want to count Kristen Stewart brushing her teeth.It's literally less than 5 minutes in when the rig is rocked by an explosion of some kind. We are told the structure is 70% damaged. The survivors are quickly identified. Nora (Ms. Stewart) and Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) are together in the immediate aftermath. Nora is a mechanical engineer and computer whiz. They soon come across a co-worker buried in rubble. It's wise-cracking TJ Miller and his (actual) stuffed bunny. Next up are the Captain (Vincent Cassel) and lovebirds Emily (Jessica Henwick) and Smith (John Gallagher Jr). With no time for early character development, we learn tidbits as their perilous journey hopefully leads them towards rescue. Of course anyone who has ever watched a movie can tell you, they won't all make it. Maybe the 8 year old girl sitting in the row behind me wouldn't know that ... but no parent should take their 8 year old to a PG-13 movie that has ""terror"" in the parental warnings.Director William Eubank and co-writers Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad create plenty of tension, danger and suspense. The movie is at its best when they let the moment speak. It's the dialogue that is mostly cringe-worthy, as well as the predictable and unnecessary jump-scares. These people are stranded miles deep in the ocean and are running out of oxygen and options ... and are being chased by something they can't identify. The visual effects are successful in generating the environment of danger and claustrophobia.It's in the little things where the film falters. When we first see the Captain, he has his arm in a sling. He's obviously injured. Once the bulky underwater suits are donned, his bad arm seems just fine ... he's even pulling one of the others with a rope! Nora makes a big deal about being the ""smallest"" of the group and volunteers to explore a narrow passage. The problem is that they are all wearing the same suits - a fact that should negate any advantage of Ms., Stewart's slim, toned body. Lastly, the film has borrowed heavily from James Cameron's classic ALIEN. In fact, it has been referred to as ""Underwater Alien"". Of course, this film isn't nearly as well-rounded or complete as that one ... but then few are.Mr. Eubank's film is a sci-fi/horror mash-up, but it's really more a survival thriller than science fiction or creature feature, although the sea creatures have their moments. Cinematographer Bojan Bozelli does a nice job in keeping with the 'play it straight' approach, and his camera work is complemented by the electronic score from Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts. Ms. Stewart and her buzzed blond hair hold their own amidst the danger. A blatant lecture about how we are going places (deep sea) we shouldn't go and doing things (drilling) we shouldn't do is included for those who might not figure it out on their own, but mostly we spend our time trying to figure out how to survive the deep sea pressure with little oxygen and no escape pods. Just leave the 8-year olds at home."
94,"I had a sinking feeling (excuse the pun) about this movie from the word go. It's a lazy approach to 'mansplain' the whole set up for the movie through digital news posts during the main titles. It feels more patronising to the audience than having main titles and then a 'Star Wars-style' synopsis.Once into the movie, director William Eubank gives us the bare minimum of character set-up for our heroine while she brushes her teeth*. (And no way did she even follow the British Dental Association recommendation of two minutes brushing!) (* Interestingly, the trailer seems to show some above water scenes/dialogue and introductions to the rest of the crew that never made the final cut.)And then....BAM!!!I was thinking that the manic action that follows was some sort of dream or flashback. But no. We are pitched headlong into the story without pause as disaster strikes. It all feels positively indecent.For we are seven miles down in the Mariana trench, when a drilling station springs a leak.Now call me a cynic, but I would have *thought* that, at that depth, a single leak would implode the whole station in about 10 seconds flat. But then that wouldn't be cinematic enough, and would be a much shorter movie!And there are numerous other scientific implausibilities. For example, diving helmets that appear to be able to withstand 15,750 psi of pressure (I Googled it) can be smashed-in by a woman by just bashing it.Sigh.We are in 'Alien-lite' territory again. Just as in last year's ""The Meg"", those pesky humans have disturbed something in its home territory.... and it's suitably pissed-off. The action centres on hippy-chick engineer Norah (Kristen Stewart). The script neatly describes her as a ""flat-chested elfin creature""... a fact which every male in the audience has thought (come on guys, admit it , you did!) from the immediately preceding scene.It was never entirely clear to me what skills Norah was supposed to have.... it seemed to flex from diving to electrical engineering to computer engineering.Stewart is a handy actress to have in a movie, but here she is mostly relegated to lots of shots of her athletic body running through corridors in her skimpy crop-top and knickers.Supporting Stewart are veteran French actor Vincent Cassel as the mission captain; ""the funny one"" Paul (T.J. Miller); the trusty male action figure Smith (John Gallagher Jr.); and Emily - the 'less-flat chested but screamy one' (Jessica Henwick). Emily also gets to run around in a T-shirt and knickers: you kind of quickly get to know the audience the film is trying to appeal to.As will be obvious if you've seen any of these types of film before, not all of these folks are going to make it.As this movie is presumably filmed in a small water tank in a Louisiana studio. Clearly the memo said ""fill it with murky water so the audience can't see the sides"". ""And just for good measure, let's film it with hand-help rapidly moving cameras"". The result is that a lot of the time, when there was a burst of frenetic underwater action, I had NO IDEA what was actually going on.In this way, the movie reminded me of the shark B-movie ""47 Metres Down"" from a few years ago.This is certainly not ""Alien"". Although similarly set, this is not ""The Abyss"" either. It's most similar perhaps to ""Life"", but without the clever twist ending.It's also not a truly TERRIBLE movie either. But unfortunately this is one of the most ""meh"" action movies I've seen in the past year. It's just brain-crushingly forgettable.There was only one vaguely memorable shot in the whole movie: a final shot of Kristen Stewart. But that just serves to make me think.... 'Stewart deserves much better than this'.For a movie concerning itself with a lack of oxygen, watching this felt like a waste of it.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
95,"We all agree that the depths of the ocean are an uncertain and even terrifying world. At Underwater, led by William Eubank, we get into the skin of a group of scientists in the Mariana Trench who are threatened after an earthquake catastrophically damaged a station and, as they try to take refuge, they realize that they are not alone.The premise is interesting; quite, I would add. It has the potential to play with our fears, but unfortunately never does it at all. Yes, there are scenes where the suspense leaves you at the edge of the seat, but, I repeat, the climax is never reached.There are no admirable performances. The two most experienced artists, Kristen Stewart and Vincent Cassel, fail to stand out and so there is not a plus to the film. Much has to do, of course, the tight and horrible script. If I had to give a consolation star, it would be to T. J. Miller, who plays the typical funny of the group, but at least he does his job well.So what's good about the movie? I would say that it has two strengths that try to save the situation: production design and photography.With respect to the first one, in certain scenes it is possible to capture a feeling of overwhelm and confinement through the realistic narrow places (to achieve this sensation the photograph is excellent, too). On the contrary, when the shot is made in the vast ocean or in the endless seabed, it also feels real. With respect to the second one, apart from capturing the moments of claustrophobia, it is simply great how it is achieved with first-person views to see absolutely nothing in the dark ocean floor. Nothing, just lights and the occasional shadow of the monster from which we want to escape. Without a doubt, a strong point of the film.Thus, a film that looks so good in the roles, is actually 'meh'. Having only airs (and monsters) from movies like Alien and Cloverfield is not enough."
96,"Coming from someone who works in the oil and gas industry offshore and also as a former commercial diver, this was extremely painful to watch.
Don't even get me started on the technology and science part. Realism, in any remote fashion, is completely thrown out the window. As far as putting people down at that depth in an underwater drilling rig...uhh never-mind.
Two words for Kristen Stewart, ""eat something!"" I've seen more meat on a butcher's apron. You have the body of a seven year-old.
Two more words, ""acting school!"" A disjointed and shallow story line, with absolutely no character development. The creatures are obscured by darkness and so is the plot. Hard pass."
97,"The whole movie is just flatlined. No excitement. No scare. Unexciting and unemotional.The best part of the whole movie is the sets.The actors put nothing into their performances. It's like they were forced into this for contractual reasons.After the actors and sets they spent nothing on the creatures, music, sound effects, director, or writer.Abyss and leviathan are Oscar winners by comparison."
98,"I was excited for this film; the trailers made it look like classic alien mayhem. But after a highly intense build up, the film slowly transcends into an action/comedy rather than scifi/horror like I would have wanted. It's disappointing to see that the film never quite sticks to a genre and never knows what it wants to be."
99,"Close-ups.
Shaky cam.
Blurred vision.95% of the time, i didn't understand what i was watching.
It baffles me that directors believe this is a good way to tell a story."
100,"This movie could have been decent. It was ruined by these mumbling millennials. What language are they speaking? Seriously. T.J Miller babbles on like a lobotomized Dennis Miller, while Kristen Stewart is mostly unintelligible for most of the film. The scene where Norah catches up with Emily on the sea floor. I challenge anyone to translate ANYTHING Stewart says in this scene. Sure, this movie is flawed in other cinematic ways. I don't think this film was trying to be more than it is: A derivative, Lovecraftian suspense film. However, it's exasperating having to flip on subtitles to understand an English-speaking actor."
101,"This Sci-Fi flick was filmed in the dark in someone's bathroom. It's not scary. It's not interesting. It!s.... well nothing really. I watched this because I thought Kristin Stewart only made worthy movies. I was wrong, and Kristin's performance fell flat. You would find counting cloud formations more intriguing than this movie. It's a total waste of your time. The movie reminded me if the 50's movies that delayed showing you the monster until the last 5 minutes. By that time you were usually asleep."
102,"Godzilla like movie, and I am not talking about the good old Godzilla movies, I am talking about the ugly recent ones. The movie is supposed to scare you with some very cliche scenes. No anticipation, no story at all, destruction starts in the first 5 minutes. And the science behind everything, it is very very stupid."
103,"Enthralling terrifying and very effective horror! Quite suspenseful most of the way through, well written and cinematography is so great. I loved Underwater very much; I think it deserves high ratings. I hope other fans of Sci-Fi/Horror appreciate the film if not that's unfortunate. Seriously stop hating on my review the movie was great!"
104,"Could have been really great but failed in many things... character development, story, music, there isnt really a plot, it's just a flat thing that uses way too many clichés and its too predictable.... and Ye Stweart is the best part - _-
I think that alone says a lot for this movie...."
105,Found it Boring right from the opening. The Underwater scenes were to dark and competently low tech SGI.
106,Just garbage in every way. Straight into the action in the first 60 seconds. No buildup and very confusing to know what was going on. Don't waste your time.
107,"Generally I don't write too many reviews but I thought this movie was worth logging on and recommending.Underwater doesn't break the mold in any way but what it does deliver is a fairly solid bit of sci-fi horror with some pretty great acting from Kristen Stewart.The first half of the movie felt like it captured the charm of those 90's sci fi disaster movies, it unravels a bit towards the end as the suspense is somewhat blown once you have the monsters on screen a little too much.Stewarts charactor in this was by far the most interesting part, she really plays into the panic of the whole situation and helps draw you in.Overall, it won't blow your mind but it's worth a watch at home."
108,"Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water ""Kepler"" drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity."
109,"Terrible.
Not even going to explain why.
Just terrible.
skip it."
110,"Don't get me wrong The Signal was a fantastic movie. This was frustrating.This however was a mess. It took the plot of several other stores ie. Dead Space, Cloverfield, Alien, The Abyss, and Pitch Black merged them all together and managed to some how fail.The lack of science used was brutal. No one around could explain anything about the organisms.A ton of nonsensical plot tangents that even a suspension of disbelief could aid. The character development was stale and not one of them will grow on you. Way too heavy on the CGI. CGI does not build the atmosphere you think it does.Whatever writer managed to make T.J Miller unfunny as well, I'm impressed.When I saw The Signal I thought ""Man this director is going somewhere."" I really hope he comes out and tells us there's an uncut version of Underwater that is twenty times better and the studio nuked his child here.I thought it was strange an underwater suspense movie was an hour thirty. Usually anything good in space or underwater horror needs a lot of time to build the suspense and dread. Instead of building it, it focuses on jump scares.My final disappointment with this was the darkness and cutaways from anything interesting about to happen.I highly doubt this is salvageable on any kind of editing floor but you should definitely go back and watch The Signal instead. Hopefully Eubanks doesn't get bounced out of Hollywood so he can get another crack at making something solid again. Good SciFi directors are something scarce lately.TLDR watch The Signal, skip this."
111,"One of the best Lovecraft ""adaptation"" or I rather say, one of the best movies based on his world. Well executed, not boring and good acting along the way.Highly recommended!"
112,First 30-40 minutes of the movie are pretty strong with some spooky moments. Once you've seen the monsters once though it gets really old really quick and there are a bunch of stupid character decisions. The acting is fine and TJ Miller had a couple of lines that actually made me laugh. Other than that the films takes itself far too seriously and just reminded me of a slightly worse underwater version of the movie Life.
113,"The pace is fast and intense, the thrill is there and make me jump twice. I love this movie , it's sci-fi and it's a movie, anything can happen 🙂 tight place and underwater, successfully trigger the ones with phobia"
114,"It had the potential of being Extremely Terrifying with the Underwater setting and the sea monsters.Potential Points it Severely Missed:° With the Underwater setting it could have been terrifying° The Sea Monsters design was a Joke therefore they were not scary.It was dull, it was boring. I was sitting there waiting for something to happen and it looked like something epic and terrifying was coming soon, ok it didn't happen at that moment but then maybe the next scene something epic and terrifying was coming and it just didn't. Nothing happened.There were a few jokes here and there but because of the foundation of being a borefest, you couldn't give a rats about the jokes.I love Kristen Stewart, she is pleasant to look at and I can see why she took this role because of the potential it had but in hindsight, she should never have been a part of this movie."
115,"Screaming here and there
Water here and there
Some stupid conversations here and there
No real catchy plot
I almot fell asleep watching it
Only screaming woke me up
Im giving it 5 stars because i like lovecraft horror style ."
116,"An underwater station is in danger, when a big disaster breaks out and some of the surviving crew members struggle to get out alive, but they are gonna find out is that they are not quite alone.It does everything you would expect from an underwater thriller. Has good jump scares, and also makes you feel the scary feeling like your not quite alone. Kristen Stewart does give a memorable performance, so does Vincent Cassel, and T.J. Miller who provides most of the one lines."
117,"I'm a sci-fi fan and the bar is pretty low for me on sci-fi movies. The trailer looked like it might be a typical underwater monster movie ... nothing new but that's fine with me.What I wasn't expecting was something that looked great on the surface but was a train wreck on screen. It turns out that both director and writer are relative novices when it comes to movies ... and this is the sad mess that resulted.It's amazing that they blew through $80M without someone noticing things were going south. Somehow they made ""B"" movies and low-budget sci-fi look great in comparison. It's not because of bad special effects or production values (they were good), but rather the complete lack of character development, poor scene planning and empty story-telling. It's barely watchable.If you look around, there is no audience or critical rating for this movie that indicates it's anything more than mediocre. Don't waste your time on this one, watch a rerun of any other sci-fi movie instead."
118,I've seen a lot of comments complaining about Kristen Stewart but honestly she is nowhere as bad as people say. In fact she's actually very good in this film to match a fast pace claustrophobic story influenced by Leviathan/Alien/others. While there are cliche moments throughout there are enough thrills and turns within the plot to keep your interest. The best part is the creature though which is actually very vicious and intimidating with a very intriguing origin. The cgi utilized is very well executed as well which these days can be up in the air in films. Overall it's a welcome addition to the deep sea horror genre.
119,"""Underwater"" almost immediately thrust the audience into a panic situation. Not even a word had been uttered before the underwater rig was imploding. After the major damage was done 70% of the underwater station was compromised and presumably over 300 crew members were dead. We were left following six.It was a remarkable set design, you can tell a lot of money and time went into it. The six crew members had to navigate a mass of twisted metal, hanging wires, busted concrete, and everything else that is reminiscent of a demolition site. And that was when they were inside.I can say that every character was one that you could pull for. There wasn't the jerk, the coward, or the double-crosser. They were all characteristically unique, yet all good teammates. There were four men and two women and you know not everyone is surviving. If all six did survive it would take a miracle considering that they were contending with being nearly seven miles underwater, they were cut off from topside, hardly anything worked, they had to abandon the rig they were in for another rig, and oh yeah... there were some deep sea creatures to avoid as well.I don't think I've seen an underwater movie this claustrophobic and desperate since ""Deep Blue Sea,"" and ""The Abyss"" before that. This movie didn't rely on script so much as it relied on atmosphere. It was all about the desperateness of the place and the situation. I honestly didn't think I'd like it judging from the trailers, but I was willing to give it a try. Glad I did."
120,"Clearly this is a deep sea rip off of Alien, or a least extremely inspired by the classic. The genre list includes mystery, so for me I was waiting for a twist, or at least something to figure out. The film opens without any character development, which makes it difficult to root for/care about anyone. It relies heavily on jump scares, if you like that type of thing."
121,"I love the original movie Abyss, and that's why I love to watch similar movies. Underwater remembered me in some ways to Abyss but not in a good way.
First, the movie is extremely dark so I barely could see what happened.
Second, the characters all are superficial. Including the main ones. I didn't feel anything for any of them.
Last, I didn't like the use of the cheap CGI here. Directors and Producers should know at this point that you can create a great movie without abusing of CGI.
So, overall a flawless attempt to create something good here. My advice is go for the original Abyss instead of this one. It's not necessary to watch the Ali Express copy."
122,"This movie lacks identity! Is it something like the Alien mixed with ET with a flavour of the Terminator. The movie leaves the audiences confused! Is it a horror movie, an action packed movie, or a science fiction? Whatever it suppose to be , it is not good! It is missing a theme and the story line is weak."
123,"A bad remake of ""Deepstar Six"". Terrible acting - especially Stewart - who I do not understand how she stays in the acting business."
124,"Sci-fi horror.A research lab, 7 miles underwater is falling apart, maybe an earthquake is the cause of the damage! The inhabitants need to get back to the surface. They need to reach their escape pods in another part of the murky facility as soon as possible in their diving suits.Tense in places, but you've seen much better versions of this movie before, a bit from Abyss, a bit from Alien, nowhere near as good as either.Can't see how this was released, it has a feel of a B-Movie, with a few cheap jump scares. Disappointing!"
125,"The Stream: Poor, boring and obvious plot development leads to a lack of empathy for the characters or their menaceThe Big Screen: The typical lifeless performance by Kristen Stewart strangely wasn't horribleThe Final Bill: Wait to view this on a streaming service if you can't find anything else to watch after scrolling a while.-S2S: Movie ReviewsGlub Glub Glub.... that's bottom of the ocean talk for ""Welcome to Stream to Big Screen"". This week we were able to review the movie, Underwater. Underwater features Kristen Stewart as mechanical engineer, Norah, who gets trapped in the world's largest and deepest drilling site and laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. Norah and the rest of her crew of aquatic researchers must find their way to safety and back to the surface before the laboratory, or worse, kills them. The Director, William Eubank, who has two previous directing credits to his name for The Signal (2014) and Love (2011) which didn't do anything in theaters, also has another upcoming feature, Tautona, which sounds quite interesting. Interestingly enough, Eubank has a common theme in his films of space or the deepest part of the ocean or cave. Uninterestingly enough for Underwater, the film seems to be following his other films into obscurity.Let's brighten this review up before it gets dark like the bottom of the ocean. This will be quick. Kristen Stewart was her typical lifeless, seemingly drugged, emotionless self. Surprisingly, that didn't ruin the movie. Kristen does a solid job leading us to the end of the movie as she is the main focus. The only other character of note is a crew member played by T.J. Miller. Without T.J., the film would've gone without it's comic relief. Thank you, T.J. That's all for the positives folks.Other than that, the film lacks development. If you should choose to see the movie, truly pay attention to the opening credits and newspaper articles like I did. The headlines of those articles basically give you the background of the film and that's all you get. The movie felt rushed. Strangely, the movie also slows down at times to bring anticipation and those moments also fail. The film lacks direction and development. There are context clues and slight discussion in the movie but none of it leads you to even really dive into the movie (you see what i did there *nudge nudge*). The little bit we get about each character's background only highlights every predictable character trope.Now, I must admit that I do love a bad movie. My wife and I set up date nights to try to find a good terrible movie on a streaming service, and Underwater doesn't even fill that slot. It's one of those movies that is trying so hard to be good, and it's just failing at all aspects.Now, watching the trailer, you will know and see that there is a creature that is attacking the crew. If you haven't seen the trailer, please watch it below. From the trailer, the creature looks like trash and during the actual movie, IT GETS NO BETTER. In fact, it gets worse. The movie really skimped on CGI, but the parts they did pay for I will admit were slightly cool. Needless to say, the creature you came to see attack them isn't even worth the money.This movie is nowhere near worth watching in the theater. They tried hard to give us suspense, comic relief, and a ""scary monster"" but it all failed, except a few giggles and a couple moments that made you say ""ooooooo"". At best, this movie gets one single popped corn. Check Underwater out after a solid 10-15 minutes of scrolling through your favorite streaming app and prepare to underwhelmed."
126,"This might be the worst underwater Sci Fi ever and for a film with a serious budget right up there with the worst Sci Fi full stop. The premise is completely stupid and the tech so childish and unrealistic it's not worth commenting on. If you seriously have nothing to do and can watch it for free go for it, if not don't."
127,Movie would have been a lot better if they would have left out the doofus that's clearly just in it to lighten the movie and provide comedic relief for some bizarre unnecessary reason. Like it's just so out of place and it hard to take the rest of the movie seriously because of it.
128,"The film starts off with a bang within 1 minute & boom, the plot for the film has already been set & the film starts immediately in the mining base that is slowly blowing up bit by bit. There is no story or anything lone those lines, what you have is the ending of a film in a way, its almost like Titanic without the first hour of the film, it jumps straight into the sinking stage. Which is a shame because the film has a very cool theme to it with the mining at the bottom of the ocean Marina trench with lots of cool machinery, i would of loved to see a bit more back story to do with that then followed by the blowing up phase of the film.There is no character development as it just gets on with the film, people they find along the way just tag along & don't really do anything, you don't feel sad when someone dies or doesn't make it because you know that people are gonna die along the way as fast they find new people, what gets me is that they said it has a crew size of 316 or close & the escape pods can only hold 1 person, there barely any of this pods around so how on earth did all 316 people escape.Apart from the film its self the theme & setting of the film is very good, we have a deep base at the bottom of the ocean mining for stuff, the pressure of the water is insane, the unknown is uncertain, theres deep pounding music & sounds to scare the hell outta you as you would be that far down in the sea with no guaranteed escape & no help from the outside world, your down there for months at a time with artificial light & sheer darkness outside the windows. In parts of the film they have to go outside & cross some the sea floor to get to another part of the base, them parts are really scary & totally change the feel for the film, you walk out of the base to total darkness, with these monster things roaming around that have awoken from the drilling.But behind the cool theming it is a very generic film that you knew what was going to happen, i feel like with a bigger budget it could of been much better story & character wise.Age - 25

129,Another Kristin Stewart bomb. The monster is lame and the script is boring. Very hard to watch
130,"I like this movie because it is a very thrilling film. It's a mix of drama, comedy and horror. The whole film is filled with jump scares and excitement that kept me on the edge of my seat. Underwater is a 95 minute long movie.This movie is about a drilling crew that lives in a facility all the way down in the Mariana Trench, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean. The Mariana Trench is one of the deepest part of the ocean, basically like the Grand Canyon but in the ocean. Suddenly the facility suffers a type of earthquake, which the crew thinks has happened. Six survivors go through a difficult journey in order to get to the life pods and survive the catastrophe. It happens that it was not an earthquake that destroyed the facility, it is a kind of sea creature that is too big and powerful for them to defeat.My favorite part of Underwater is when the crew discovers a new life form. It takes the crew and the audience by surprise. The costumes are very creative. They look like a heavy type of astronaut suit. The graphics are incredible. The underwater scenes look very realistic. A few scenes are too dark to figure out what is going on. There is fowl language, blood and gore - perfect for horror fans. The acting is perfect, especially Kristen Stewart (Nora) who keeps the audience in suspense. Vincent Cassel (the Captain) and T. J. Miller (crew member) are spectacular too.The moral of this story is to know our limits and respect other living beings' habitats. Humans are very curious to know more or learn more, to the point that we cross the line and trespass other living beings' homes. It's good to have more knowledge, but it is also good to know our limits.I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 12 to 18, plus older adults. People with bad hearts or epilepsy should not watch this movie.Reviewed by Ethan P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by tweens and teens, go to kidsfirst dot org."
131,"90 minutes of Kristen 'lump of wood' Stewart Composing an email in her head.The premises of this movies was interesting. Aliens crossed with The Abyss. I can go for that. But WOW this was garbage.I knew going in it wouldn't be great. Any movie with lump of wood in is going to suck but this was just atrocious. I gave up after 20 minutes because quite frankly no one cares about what happens to her character. There was no emotion, no engagement, no life. How does she keep getting work?Don't waste your time."
132,Should have gone straight to DVD. Tries and does not deliver where others did. Only watch when you have exhausted your A movies collection.
133,"Sci-fi thrillers have a bad reputation when it comes to making money at the box office. They're either extremely well made and praised by critics all over the globe, some also get totally crushed by the competition in the same opening weekend, others are just complete and utter trash. 'Underwater', bringing absolutely nothing original to the table - although it thinks it does -, isn't all bad.A crew of aquatic researchers work together to get to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory. But the crew has more than the ocean seabed to fear. What has been sort of spoiled in tv-spots and other promotional videos, is that something is hunting these researchers. We follow mechanic Norah (Kristen Stewart), who's survival skills are put to test, when these tremors and whatever lurks outside their ""safe space"" relentlessly keeps trying to kill what doesn't belong belong this deep in the ocean. Six-point-something-miles-deep to be more specific. As many might or might not know, the bottom of Earth's platform has so many secrets, and that's exactly what 'Underwater' uses to try and scare its audience.Writers Brian Duffield (The Babysitter) and Adam Cozad (The Legend of Tarzan) have trouble bringing anything remotely interesting to the big screen. Clearly inspired by sci-fi classics like 'Alien' and 'The Abyss', Underwater doesn't even try to stand out. The only standouts here are K-Stew and co-star Vincent Cassel (Black Swan) - who do a phenomenal job at showing fear while kicking ass. Another standout for the film is its cinematography. Bojan Bazelli (A Cure for Wellness) has an eye for angles and dives into that fear of claustrophobia with impressive closeups of the desperate crew's facial expressions. Although the sets are quite limited, the costume design of the diving suits is something worth mentioning.What's so problematic with Underwater, is its build up to something exciting and thrilling, yet as soon as that tension is underway to get you covered in goosebumps and burst into a series of hot flashes, it cuts away to a black screen and time jumps to another location. This doesn't only make it very confusing for the viewer to keep track with where our survivalists are at that given moment in time, but it also pulls you out of the story completely. For a 95-minute long film, Underwater feels much longer than it actually is and when the second half dives into a sea of CGI-creatures (and water - it never really looks like as if these actors are actually underwater), it turns into a total 'Alien' rip off - subaquatic Ripley included.Unfortunately Underwater is just a bit blasé. Loud screeching jump scares and an uninspired screenplay, turn William Eubank's $80 million sci-fi thriller into another genre-film forever stuck at the bottom of the bargain bin at your local Kmart. Director, cast and most of the crew will for sure get back to shore in given lifeboats, while yet another post-Fox-merge-title gets thrown to the sharks."
134,"What went wrong:1. The movie starts at what should've been about the halfway point; we're thrust into the story just when all hell breaks loose, with no background for the characters or the narrative. We're given no chance to become invested in either the situation or to connect with the players.2. Roughly half the film is impossible to comprehend visually, both because of the murky, muddy scenes, and because of the rapid edits. Murky also relates to the sound, where a great deal of the dialogue, especially when they're in their underwater space suits, is unintelligible.3. The antagonists are ridiculous, given that at this depth, they too would be crushed by the pressure; and The Big Boy baddie is just completely unbelievable.Kristin Stewart is clearly making a conscious move back to mainstream films, as opposed to the arty but rarely seen films she'd recently focused on, but she needs to choose better projects if her plan's going to work."
135,"And I like Kirsten Stewart, but she was not the right actor for this, but that was the least of the problems"
136,"I see a lot of reviews of this movie saying that it is bad because it's not as good as Alien, Life, and so on. If you go into movies comparing it to another then nothing will ever live up to expectations. This movie is very good in my opinion. Of course we have seen this idea done before but quite honestly never really like this!This movie never gives you a break and never lets up on the action. You expect certain things out of this movie and quite often they have events that not many would expect.There are small things in the movie that hint to a bigger picture and dives deep into the characters we follow. Kristen Stewart gives a very good performance playing a strong character that cares deeply for her friends. All of the characters are very believable in there role. Even the jokester TJ Miller. He never takes the comic relief to a point where it becomes annoying.In conclusion, if you want to see this movie I suggest watching it without expectations or comparisons! The movie is a lot of fun and has characters that are very interesting to follow and learn about. Happy moviegoing!"
137,Going into this one it could have went either way. Well it went the wrong way. Tons of non-stop action that at most times does not make any sense. The acting and comedy element was solid but that is about all I can say on the positive side.
138,"Shakey cam darkness and boring, its like a low budget netflix movie, endless closeups in dark water with heavy breathing and panic faces of generic characters who behave as stupidly as required for a lazy plot writer. Its hard to believe the world of the film, the purpose of the characters nothing is fleshed out, so it feels like nothing, it feels like bad abyss cosplay."
139,"It's 1 of my top 25 worst movies ever!!! I know everybody has different taste,but seriously 6???"
140,"Its a question we ask ourselves when we wake up and it all comes flooding in. Devin decided to sit in his backyard for 24 hours. He began at 12:02 midnight, the moon was directly overhead. He pushed his head so he could get a good look. It was a crescent moon. And he said: ""12:02 AM, the moon is sharp, I'm still waiting for everything."" Devin gripped his throat and slid his hand down to give his stomach a punch. And then it was the suns turn. Devin's body was moving all over, but what stood out most were his arms. They wiggled like spaghetti. His neighbor (WILLO) peering over the fence with squinting eyes. Willo lit a cigarette. She said: ""Devin, Devin, can you hear me, I want you gone."""
141,"Didn't have high expectations but was surprised. The cast did a good job and the monsters were pretty cool. Can't say that it is as good as Aliens or many of the other classics, but for all the bad horrors that I've watched recently I was happy that this one was done wellDefinitely worth checking out."
142,"Most of the films being released it starts with action and never finishes, leaving out any to get to know the characters or relationships.And can we just stop with the Benetton united ad cast. That isn't how the world is or works. If you believe that any of this cast actually would work underwater you need to walk outside into the real world. Stop casting these ridiculous people in roles they would never do in real life.""Alien(s)"" meets ""Abyss"", literally, but a horribly executed version. Can we stop with the copies of old classics?And the acting is so horrible. Stewart is a horrible actress. Everything about this is a joke."
143,"Semi naked Kristen Stewart, weird French violent Vincent Cassel and some relatively known meat for the secondary character in an underwater adventure. It could have been, if not a classic, something decent. Unfortunately they used zero effort to flesh out the characters, so in the end they seemed just numbers. The entire setup... flashback news reports in papers. The aftermath? More papers. The story, just some people trying to survive and doing it by luck alone. It could have been more like The Abyss, but instead it was a bad remake of Deepstar Six. Too bad.Also, pressure and water don't work that way."
144,"When I first saw this movie trailer I thought with myself that it would be a total crap. And boy, I was right!
Though it is indeed a crap, it has its moments (sorta).
The problem, see, I really got a thing for monster movies. Underwater monsters? Yay, take my money and gimme a ticket!
Though I really like this kind of flick, I must review it not as a moviegoer but as a solid cinephile I think I am.
For a positive, poor Kristen and her fellow divers got no chance for a break. The action is nonstop and fast-paced. There are jump scares all through the movie (there were this guy and his girlfriend only a seat away from me and she jump-scared the whole movie). Some tension and a claustrophobic feeling is also there. The diving suits are nice, reminded me of Gears of War suits, but if you understand a little bit of what means deep diving, dude, those suits are a no go. They're 36000 feet into the abyss (which is quite accurate, as the deepest place in the oceans is the Challenger Deep), so, no way a person would be able to walk the ocean floor at this deep with such garments. It's just not plausible.
The FX are cheap. They're not bad... but you cant actually see the monsters, as in the deeps of the ocean, one cant see a feet away of his face. So the FX team didn't have much of a trouble regarding texture, lighting and other details.
Characters got no charisma, they're bland and souless, you don't get attached to none of them. TJ MIller's character is a comic relief, but by no means such enterprise would hire a person like his character to work on a scietific station. I mean, why would Nasa send Jim Carey to the Space Station? His charecter makes no sense at all. The creatures got eyes and are humanoid. It also makes no sense. There are severeal plot wholes throughout the movie.
I only recomend this movie if you're a horror/sif-fi addicted like me. Otherwise, dont waste your time."
145,I'm a big SciFi fan. I had fun watching this movie. It starts off fast and doesn't really let up. Kristen Stewart was really good in this.
146,"I had my eyes on this movie ever since the trailer had dropped, i suppressed any kind of cynicism, can you blame me? We're in 2020 and it's really hard to find a good horror flick that can strike a balance to make it worthwhile, don't get me wrong, there have been a lot of good horror flicks but for every good horror flick we might as well have fifty stinkers.But i digress, this movie isn't a stinker, not at all. It's something very familiar, maybe cliche at times but there is a ingredient in this movie that works in its favor, and i don't want to compare it to Alien, but to hell with it, i might as well.I found the acting to be strong, the characters gave me a reason to give a damn about their survival, there was enough banter and development for such a short time, i can't praise this enough, this is something that more movies should do, actual characters, not self-insert or tropes just because the plot needs it.The atmosphere was well made, maybe a bit too well for a person who suffers from Thalassobophia, so take that as you will. And i'm getting back to the whole alien comparison as this movies uses ''less is more'' approach which i'm glad it did.
Monster designs were interesting even though i couldn't see much, which i guess is the point anyway so that might be a minor complaint, but it didn't ruin the overall enjoyment for me.Final verdict: I hope to see more movies as engaging as this, so far it's the first good horror flick in 2020, that's not saying much but it's got to start somewhere. If you're a fan of Alien, you will feel right at home, if you really despise alien, yeah better watch something else.I'll give it a 8/10, maybe it's overly generous of a rating, but I'm honestly tired of seeing so many horror movies miss the point."
147,It's a creative underwater horror and suspense movie. Solid acting even though there is some lazy scripting occasionally. IMO it's great entertainment. The camera work was a little rough at times.
148,This film had me hooked from the very opening and felt like a claustrophobic video game at times. It made me want to see more.
149,This movie is so unoriginal and boring. Big hype for no reason. Watch it have nothing else to during the lockdown.
150,Even as a way to pass an hour and a half... This is... Terrible!
151,Very disappointing. The story is irritating and the cinematography is too dark. Couldn't make out what was going on most of the time. If they are going to make a movie why not make it clearer! Quite a lot of the movie was boring. When something exciting happened it was over too fast. The squid like monster seemed a bit like a blast from the past.I am a K Stew fan but she wasn't great here. Only someone with such a pretty face could pull of that crew cut. Her diction needs to improve. She speaks too fast. Didn't catch some of what she was saying. She didn't seem to express fear that well. Even the supporiting character played by Jessica Henwick was better at emoting fear. Didn't really make the other characters interesting.Need to look to Koreans on how to make a good monster movie.
152,"9/10 I must say i expected something solid frozen m the trailer, but was honestly surprised at how effective this film turned out. I enjoyed director William Eubank's ambitious eye for futuristic sci/fi in his other films; LOVE and The Signal, but he upped the ante to gargantuan heights in this film. Eubanks should be a director to watch for the Sci/fi thriller genre as he is absolutely brilliant with his keen eye for detail and intense visuals. Apparently this film was shot in 2017 but Fox studios waited on it. There is definitely influence throughout from films such as Alien, Leviathan, The Abyss, Sphere, and even Cloverfield, but it utilizes those inherent aspects perfectly to still have its own incredibly vicious identity.The film starts with insane intensity and never lets up with action and thrills in its massively detailed set pieces and terrific deigned brutal creatures. The cast is uncanny but surprisingly charming, intriguing, and funny at times. I think part of this film's unfortunate partial sabotage ratings/bad box office (15Mworld on 80M budget) comes from people misjudging Kristen Stewart for this particular role. She doesn't deserve the hate she gets and is actually phenomenal in this story with a great deal of emotion and perseverance. TJ Miller is the comedy relief and hilarious as always. Vincent Cassel is his solid standard self, and the others are solid as well.As things progress in depths things get viscerally chaotic with some of the coolest creatures I've seen and I've seen them all as a big sci/fi guy. The creature designs are impeccable, and i give the visual effects team great respect for conjuring up such ballistically sinister deep sea monsters. After so many films it has to be difficult to keep coming up with unique concepts for these creatures but they had huge imagination with these. Trust me when I say the final act is GARGANTUAN in itself.Overall this film is a visual feast for the eyes and ears (soundtrack/sound fx amazing as well) of most Sci/fi/thriller/action/horror fans especially creature/monster fans. I think this will go down as one of the better deep sea horror's when people finally see it. Don't let the misleading low ratings fool you, as this is a fantastic film."
153,"What on Earth could they have possibly spent $80M on? 80,000,000 bottles of spring water? The books on this one need to be audited. And why was Kristen Stewart wearing eye makeup 7 miles down, much less getting it to stay on the entire movie? How do the leads in movies get cuts on their faces that never bleed? Where can I get a helmet that magically appears when I need to put it on again, even though I wasn't carrying it nor was it attached to my suit? And was Kristen Stewart's sports/training bra even necessary? The only other film I've seen her in was that one in Paris and her twin brother is a ghost or something, but at least she went topless in that, and those perky little A Cups were pretty sweet. This flick really, really blew on every conceivable level."
154,"I've seen worse movies but that is not exactly a ringing endorsement. It's not a particularly compelling movie, but in some ways is possibly entertaining. The mediocrity is part of the problem. In addition, whoever wrote the script doesn't seem sure about what kind of message they want to send. At various moments characters decry going too deep to drill oil, and that people are not meant to do so, and these ideas constitute a classic eco-horror theme of environmentalism; but then at other times, like during the climactic moments, in which the unimaginative and typical approach of destroying all monsters is taken, the messaging is exactly the opposite.This can't have been an easy shoot, with most of the action taking place wet. There are also some attempts at character development, and the creatures are suitably Lovecraftian. But none of this is enough to salvage this movie from anything other than forgettable mediocrity."
155,"I don't know how you take an almost completely perfect horror environment and mess it up but some how they did. The first mistake was casting the most stale, dull actress. They introduce the disaster quicker than a unsolicited picture on snapchat, they introduce characters that you're supposed to like with the weakest back story thats barely eluded to and make it seem you've known them for years. How in the world do you bomb a perfect movie set up? I'm just astonished. The CGI was at best early 2000s quality and completely overwhelms most of the show. The monster makes absolutely no sense and completely takes away from the horror. Never, ever cast Stewart in your movie if you want it to be anything other than what the dog makes in the morning on its walk. The only reason this movie got its two star review from me was the the stuffed rabbit and the originality of the suits and location."
156,It was not bad could have shown more of the creatures
157,This film isn't very engaging. Terrible acting accompanied by a terrible script. Some average special effects. I would normally sit through bad movies just out of respect but this was a tough watch.
158,This movie was decent but it could've been better with any other actress besides Kristen Stewart. Her acting is really bad and it looks like she's always constipated.
159,"Viewers dive right into the action with this sci-fi horror piece about a small band of surviving crew members at the bottom of the ocean, fighting to make it back to the surface after a horrific drilling incident releases hostile sub-human creatures. The largest disappointment with this film, is the overall response from viewers. It's not nearly as bad as many make it out to be. In fact, there's a lot to praise this movie for.The cons: CGI in abundance here, as usual for a visually-focused sci-fi thriller. There are moments when practical special effects could have been used to make it seem more ""realistic"". However, that being said, the CGI wasn't bad at all. At times the water and lighting made it difficult to make sense of what was occurring on screen. The plot is quite predictable, it's obvious not a lot of thought went into it. Characters were all either one-dimensional or wooden. It definitely felt like a modern, high-budgeted B-movie. You can tell when movies are made largely for the purpose of generating revenue, and this feels like one of those. Yes, plot holes and implausibility exist. But I dare you to point out ONE sci-fi thriller/horror that didn't have at least a handful of such traits, and was generally well received.The pros: It was an effective thriller/horror, quite intense at parts. Despite the CGI crutch, the special effects were fun and interesting. There were some solid scares, a few of which I'm sure a lot of people missed unless they were paying attention. Such moments were well done, and possibly caused a viewer to exclaim ""whoa, did something just move right there?"", or ""were those eyes?!?"", and ""did anyone else see that??"". The murkiness of the water, and lack of lighting DID make it difficult to see at parts, but that, I'm sure, was intentional, and added to the bleakness of the environment. There were entertaining character deaths which, let's be honest, is something EVERYONE enjoys vicariously in films such as this. And yes, we all were skeptical of the film because of who was cast as the lead. And while Kristen Stewart has not progressed as proficiently as her ""Twilight"" counterpart, Robert Pattinson, her acting was not bad at all, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast.Summed up, it's an enjoyable ""popcorn flick."" Definitely not one to take seriously, so if you hated it, it could be that you didn't follow the one rule of watching these kinds of movies: Cast aside your disbelief, and just enjoy the ride.
Movies similar to this: Sphere, The Abyss, Prometheus, The Meg, DeepStar Six, Leviathan, Below (2002), Deep Rising"
160,"3/10 - bland, dark sci-fi horror's only saving grace is its cast's performances"
161,"There is no suspense build up, no character development, and you can't see what's happening most of the time. This is nothing like Alien! Alien was frightening and the people in the spaceship had individual talents as far as operations were concerned. It was believable. You got to see their personalities. I wasn't frightened once during Underwater. The only really good glimpse I had of the monster, it did resemble the Alien when it jumped out of the guys stomach. That's the only similarity. This was cheaply made. I really can't believe people who have seen well made movies like Alien and others could give this rave reviews."
162,"This film could have a lot better if the started out with a 20 minute intro into the cast. So the film would have been close to a 2 hours movie where we are at least slightly familiar with the cast. Instead of going right into disaster of the earthquake that traps the cast in the underwater facility. Moreover, the cinematography is weak which makes it difficult to follow the under water scenes. They could have saved T.J. Millers character instead of killing him off pretty quickly into the movie. He was the most entertaining character in this movie. Also, the science was inaccurate, the smaller creatures would not be able to go between pressurizations of the inside water and outside water without exploding due to the extensive pressure of 7 miles deep under the ocean. If they had added introduction and better cinematography and corrected the science this film could have been a 7-7.5 rating overall."
163,"The caption pretty much describes the movie in entirety.. Quick takeaways, convenient darknesses and non-convincing acting sink this flick down to the depths of the ocean bed."
164,"We were not given anytime to get to know the characters.
In Aliens we got to know Ripley, Hudson, Hicks, Vazquez, and the rest of the crew as they sat around the table eating a meal then being briefed about the mission.Just an okay movie. The acting was just okay. I was never a big fan of Kristen Stewart. The set was too dark because of the small budget.Hey Vazquez have you ever been mistaken for a man?
No. Have you?"
165,"UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another ""underwater base"" flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it's a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can't make out what's going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they're really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER's okay, but you'd be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie."
166,"It's difficult. As an Alien clone (you know, running down alleyways, is that a shadow or something actually scary with a few jump scares along the way) Underwater is a perfectly enjoyable tick the box bit of escapism. Yet...Ok. Let's stick with Alien for a bit longer because it serves to highlight a couple of issues with Underwater perfectly. The writers of Alien knew that a build up gives time to develop the setting, understand your characters and ultimately create atmosphere. They also knew that if you show too much of the creature too early on then it begins to lose it mystery. And few things can be more terrifying than the blanks our minds fill in. Underwater just throws you in at the deep end (apologies) with only some brief news tidbits and character remarks to fill in the lore. And while the makers were initially hesitant to show what the protagonists are up against in Underwater, after they do, they then show the creatures at every available opportunity.It has all the trappings of an excellent, claustrophobic psychological horror and with creatures you crave to know more about. Yet it just goes down the quick rollercoaster adrenaline ride. Which is fine. It's 90 minutes long so it doesn't overstay it's welcome and it does a serviceable job at getting the pulse raising. But certainly, it is an opportunity missed."
167,"Pretty standard fare but without the benefit of backstory, character development, purpose and reason etc etc. It starts, it happens, it finishes. But if you go in with low expectations then you won't be disappointed.However, where this film completely falls flat on its face is TJ Miller. Miller essentially plays the same character in every film; he's unfunny and talentless and watching him in a scene Vincent Cassel is uncomfortable. One can act, the other cannot.All in all, pretty mediocre."
168,"These type of films are rare, few and far between. To see one that has been executed like a true horror is refreshing.The atmosphere is chilling. It's a new classic for me. So what if it's 'not original', the fact it's executed this type of genre really well is what I love about it.Please ignore some of the negative reviews on here. See it for yourself and you will see what I mean."
169,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie! The trailer looked a bit generic but the movie exceeded expectations! I screamed, I jumped, I held my breath and hugged myself... Just what I wanted out of a fun, thrilling day at the theater. A shame it didn't do better. IMO it is better than 80% of the routine, unimaginative, flat action thrillers Hollywood has spit out recently! The writing and characters were great! Will watch again for a good time!"
170,"I don't like movies that have to do with underwear scenes or anything underwater but once I saw that Kristen Stewart was in this I knew I had to see it. Anything she is in is amazing. I love her.
Throughout the whole movie my heart was racing and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next! All I have to say is that you HAVE to see it! It was awesome and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray/DVD.
Hope you enjoy it!"
171,"Not great, but not bad. Some good dialogue, decent action, a little suspense, nice evening out. Average."
172,"Underwater is hot garbage. A boring, jump scare filled and lazy horror film that borrows way too much from better films. The premise of scientists being stuck underwater with alien monsters hunting them is genius because this is a very creepy location and as someone who is terrified of the ocean, I thought they could do something unique with it but they don't. They rely on stupid jump scares. There was one cool shot but that's about it. The performances are uninspired and the characters are shockingly bland. The visuals were alright but they were completely uninspired. Overall, Underwater is a really lame and uninspired horror film that could've been something unique but wasn't."
173,"This took me by surprise. I awaited a Chtulhu film for God knows how long. Everything is impressive: visuals, soundtrack, jump scares, atmosphere.The only glaring flaw IMO: there are no characters. They are actors reading lines. There is ZERO development regarding that. Zero minutes of peace until chaos hits the fan. The movie already begins when bad stuff ensues. No fifteen minutes of a happy crew like we usually get.Kristen's acting, which usually puts me off, was also fine here.We finally have a film that rivals The Abyss!"
174,"Where the pressure is 1100 Kg per cm2, the bonus must certainly be good to finish drilling on the bottom of the Mariana trench, including the bonus for taking your personal problems with you; is the first thing I thought of these 300 technicians suddenly blown away by the opening of a Pandora's box but perhaps so far from sunlight it was to be expected. The film expresses art, it is technically flawless from the costumes of Dorotka Sapinska passing through the scenography of Naaman Marshall (art director of The Dark Knight) cinematographed by the Montenegrin Bojan Bazelli, ASC assisted by our Roberto De Angelis to the Steadycam (Public Enemies) to the special effects of the British Moving Picture Company (MPC) start to escape and the feeling to get trapped for 95' is accompanied by the splendid electronic scores of the ever better Marco Beltrami (The Thing 2011, Scream) & Brandon Roberts (Soundtrack only available in digital download) Although William Eubank's UNDERWATER is influenced by masterpieces like Alien, I felt clearly a sound of the Nostromo in their main room at the beginning of the film passing to admire Kristen in briefs for the last 10 minutes of film, the most banal error that can be done is to waste time comparing this outstanding movie to the already done forgetting what is being watching; if you do it in this spirit, you can only want to see it again and again because it is a unique film, a well-written, solid Lovecraftian nightmare that keeps you going until the last implosion."
175,"I thought this was very entertaining... pretty clean with no nudity and explicitly language was very minimal. I think major Hollywood producers are starting to realize who spends the money on their movies. Mainstream America enjoys movies like Underwater and Alien which this reminds me of. I think Kristen Stewart does an amazing job as her counterpart in Alien did... what... 30 years ago? Anyway... I have highly recommend this movie as light hearted escapism entertainment. It's not a deep philosophical ""change everyone's opinion of their existence"" movie but very enjoyable with a beer and popcorn."
176,"I honestly don't know where to start...the cheap shaky camera affects to try and induce a scary atmosphere, the quite horrific acting by all the cast, or just the cheap B Movie cinematography the whole way through the film.Absolutely avoid at all costs, this is horrific. Oh, and Kristen Stewart is an awful actress..."
177,I was pleasantly surprised. Neat and well made. The movie is straight to the point. It doesn't meander into a complicated storyline but shows the characters they way they are. Quick action scenes with some thrills. The underwater scenes were not too murky or dark. It is not horrifying either. You are immersed into what will happen next. Good acing by Kirsten. Overall a good entertainer. I recommend for thrill seekers. Cheers.
178,"While the film doesn't bring a ton of new ideas to the underwater horror subgenre (with the exception of a visual scale we haven't seen before) there is a lot to love about this movie if only for its clear affinity for the titles that came before it; chiefly Deep Star Six, Leviathan, and The Rift (all of which were made around 1989). Kristen Stewart really shines in the title role, and the creature stuff is awesome with strong Lovecraftian influence. This however is where you crave more imagination as the film only grazes the surface of what's possible. At the same time, it can be seen as a strength, inspiring the imagination to greater depths. If you haven't seen Stuart Gordon's Dagon, I highly recommend it. A little more meat on the bone for those who want to go a little deeper.Unfortunately the film's less than stellar performance at the box office could be attributed to the fact that the 80s are gone, and the masses are more interested in Dr. Pimple Popper online, or whichever million different rabbit holes of content we're overwhelmed with these days. I would also say the film's marketing made an error in burying the fact that it was a monster flick. Monster fans will love this thing, yet it's sold like it's another bland sci-fi snooze fest.Definitely worth a look for genre fans. See it on the big screen while you can."
179,"This movie was intense from start to finish!
No spoilers... But I seriously felt like I needed a Valium with a chaser of whiskey to calm my nerves. Loved it!"
180,Garbage Garbage Garbage Garbage apart from the underwear sequences (sexist I know - & I apologise) but I found absolutely NOTHING else that I enjoyed - so I am digging deep (oops - sorry for the pun) to justify the 1 star I gave this tripeSome may like this type of schlock - I cannot believe the positive ratings here at IMDBHowever If you have brain and perhaps if you are male - - you may find you might agree with my summationI tried to warn you NOT to see it - but if you must - at least you know what to look for lol hahaa
181,"You might end up deceived by the idea that the plot is about mining in the Mariana Trench, but here the good idea end - everything is predictable, it's something you've already seen in other movies. There's no real tension, no real thrill, no real action - nothing. Not to mention drama. It's just that something happened and you never understand why and what are those creatures. The acting is fine, but since there is nothing impressive about the movie, I recommend to never go to cinema watching it. It's something to be seen on the TV if nothing better for the moment."
182,"It's in my top 20 pointless movies of my lifetime and I'm almost 40!!! I'b be interested how many people who gave high ratings worked,or friends with someone worked in production of this masterpiece."
183,"This movie is quite entertaining and is not tying to be anything other than what it is, an entertaining movie. Pace was good, characters fun and some jumps as well. Great popcorn flick."
184,"Sure, the film offers nothing new.
But it was fun for me to watch from the start to the end.
It doesn't try to be more then entertaining trip with tension for people who like that kind of movie.
The beginning was a surprise after the standard alien shot. It is fast.
The cast is good. Music good. Effects ok, enough.
Perfect to watch in the night. And i am happy that they don't make the movie longer then necessary."
185,I love movies set in limited space. So I might be a tiny bit biased in my opinion. I was hoping for an Abyss/Aliens movie but this felt a little different. I really wish they would have gone R rating with this one. There was absolutely no reason to make this PG-13. Kids are not going to see this movie. After watching the special features I found it interesting how this was made effects-wise. I cant see this being a go-to movie for me but I would watch it again for sure. There were some scenes that were a little confusing when things amp up. I like K Stewart when shes given the right roles and I think this was a good one.
186,"This is not a typical Hollywood action, and it's not really a horror either. Nothing is explained in the beginning (unless you are paying attention during the credit parts). However, I think this lack of introduction is an interesting artistic choice. Because if you give it some time, each of the actors portray very different characters and they all have reasons to be loveable (yes even the stone faced Stewart). I also felt that the tone reflects the realistic feel of the emergency, which is shattered a little at the end with the sci-fi monster bit. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.
As unsupervised as I am that the Hollywoodgobbling masses did not eat this up, I am surprised the critics didn't read between the lines of this movies, because if your looking there are several interesting philosophical questions posed along with some social commentary."
187,Been craving a great creature movie for awhile now and this movie delivered even with a little fizzle of an ending
188,"I watched it before reading the reviews . I'm rather annoyed with all the negative reviews. If you like creature movies you will like this movie. I feel like everyone that has an issue is expecting every movie like this to be as good as Alien. Biggest complaint I read was all the shots being blurry. They are 7 miles under the ocean, it's going to be damn dark! This movie will not offer anything you don't expect from it, but if you watch the Trailer and it gets you interested than you will enjoy the movie."
189,"Reminding not only of Lovecraft and Giger, but Goya and Dreier, to name a few. And Ms Stewart is definitely bigger than life, the greatest of a kind, a face of the whole generation."
190,"Don't listen to the critics. If you are a fan of Sci-fi/Horror this is the movie for you. absolutely loved it !! Intense aquatic horror. Watch it, enjoy it !!"
191,You have to go & see underwater it is an interesting movie to see it would be a good movie for you to see with friends.
192,"A little surprised to see such harsh reviews on this one. Yes, it does have problems, a lot of it has been done before, and the giant monster is basically a deep sea version of the Cloverfield monster. If you're someone with a legitimate fear of deep bodies of water however, I think this movie may hit you a little harder than others.Yes, the jump scares are excessive. Truth be told though, if it were myself down there in the depths, I would jump if a harmless fish swam by my face. When you're that far under, everything is scary, and I think that's what the movie was trying to emphasise. I also admit there are a few scenes that are slow and the camera is set on something difficult to see, or when it gets eerily quiet and you're almost counting on a jump scare. However, there was one specific angle where one of the wendigo-like creature charged at the camera in a spiral motion, and even though it made me jump, I still said ""Okay, that was pretty cool"".And since I've already spoiled a bit, I was not expecting that punch in the final minutes. I know I probably wasn't supposed to find it so funny, but I couldn't help but laugh at it.I genuinely enjoyed the sets and surroundings of this film. I thought Kristen Stewart did a great job, the other actors did fine as well. Conceptually it's a pretty basic survival story, and while elements of this film have been done before, I still think they come together nicely to make a pretty neat film. At least worth a watch in my opinion."
193,"I overall enjoyed this movie, apparently quite a bit more than the average viewer, and am surprised it isn't rated higher for what it is and what it held itself out to be.The setting of the movie definitely worked for me and the creature design was great. The movie used some of the typical tricks to create tension, but not in a way that it was overly relied upon. Between the risks of underwater structures failing and the unknown creatures, there were plenty of thrills throughout.I think it could have benefitted from a longer finale that had the protagonist do more than just press some buttons to take out the creatures. The murkiness of the water in the ocean floor scenes worked but was a little much at times, even if accurate for such a situation, as seeing the creatures more clearly as they approached or in the background would have been appreciated and could have added to the tension at times. After all, it is a monster movie but I don't feel like I got many clear looks at any of them.Nevertheless, it was a tense 90 minutes that didn't waste time getting into the action and didn't let up until the end. I also appreciated that the origin of the creatures isn't over explained, as I'd rather fill in the blanks than be provided with an inevitably flawed explanation. Other than noted above, all the elements of the movie and performances were solid. As a fan of the Sci-fi/Horror genre, I was left satisfied and wanting more.Although it seems unlikely, a sequel was set up at the end and a movie that builds upon what this one did right could be awesome.7.5/10"
194,"Yes, It's not The Abyss or Alien, it makes you think of those superior movies, of course.But this is not a bad movie, it does have it's moments. It kept me entertained.Done better? Yes, for sure. Bad movie? No.When you like these kinda movies, try and see it."
195,"This was good if you want to just chill, in quarantine, need to get through a bucket of popcorn. Yes, this movie quite didn't know what it wanted to be. It was 2001: A Space Odyssey, it was The Abyss, hell, it was even a little Ad Astra, but guess what, it's ok. Just sit back, enjoy this group's adventure."
196,"From minute one you are in the middle of the action , no development in characters , but who cares , tipical B movie with very decent sea monsters and lot of dangerous situations , if you like Deep Star Six or Leviathan this is your movie."
197,"I like how the content is made, the acting is reasonable and believable also. This is not really a thrill movie or much to the horror but it brings a fair feeling to me how it is when facing the death underwater. The characters are also good and I dont expect much twist from the beginning so it turns out okay.
Some people complain about acting but I dont know what should be done anyway, I saw somebody even compare it to The Abyss 1989, it's really horrible nowadays when people compare movies in the old decades and even to tell the old one is better? Look at how we have advanced in all the scenes and cinema effects, details, we even have better looking actors and actresses so just a bit of cliche content shouldnt bring this movie below 5.
I respect the effort to make the movie and I also find it enjoyable so it's 8 to me"
198,It was as good as i hoped it would be. The monsters are fantastic and Kristen Stewart was pretty badass.
199,"People saying Kristen cant play are same people judging robert pattinson, all they see is twillight and thats it for them. She is a good actor and i love her in every movie. This is one of them. This movie was better than i expected , tense from very beginning, and as someone scared of depth of water, i felt strong anxiety waching this . I know it was similar to movies before but none before made me feel this way. Im very dissapointed about this ratings people gave this movie."
200,"Simple as that. Its an action thriller, and if you are an Alien/Cloverfield fan you will definitely enjoy this movie.Nothing mind blowing.
Cliche? Yep.Having said that, i enjoyed the movie cause it has no fillers at all. Other viewers are shovelling because there is no character development, and its done with laziness. Seriously now? You are expecting character development from an Alien/ Cloverfield clone movie? Also, have you watched the cgi & the effects? Some people complain, just to complain.Its not a classic, but its pretty damn good."
201,"This film is great, after perusing through the other reviews I am afraid I have to disagree.This was an intense film right off the bat, sound and cinematography were incredible, fantastic performances all around, got me in a couple of jumps. The set design was also amazing, making the obvious comparison to Alien, but kinda all good sci-fi's have this level of detail. Whatever about character building, there is exactly enough to make you care, but also not enough to make you miss when they are gone.I think someone said it was too dark... HilariousAnyways, defo worth a watch, very enjoyable make sure you turn the light off and the sound up!"
202,"Would have liked it to be longer. Action, Suspense spot on amazing. I hate Kristen's acting in other movies but in this one she nailed it. Amazing acting.
Definitely worth a watchIt should have been 2hrs."
203,"What's not to like? I got exactly what I was hoping for. A thrilling, high-production-value horror-suspense movie, that is honestly pretty good even from an objective standpoint.People rating this a 6 and under are honestly just cynical about Kristen Steward having the lead role. Did Cloverfield explain where its monsters came from? Basically no, right? This movie has about the same depth of exposition in that regard, if not a bit more. Sometimes a full-on backstory isn't necessary.When I saw the trailer, I was like, ""Yes! This actually looks good, I want to see it!"" I'm glad I did.It's not exactly a terribly original story, but if you saw the trailer, you knew that. It's not derivative, lazy or uninspired by any means.With regards to acting chops, lets be honest. I'm no Kristen fanboy, but very few actors and actresses are on the level of Leonardo DiCaprio or Michael Caine. Her acting was fine, and I had no gripes with it. I would see more of her in future roles like this if I am quite honest. She has improved from her Bella Swan days. The rest of the cast was also good to great, especially the Captain.With regards to the science of it all, I'm pretty sure that any kind of suit for use on the sea floor, especially at that depth, would have to have some sort of hydraulic exoskeleton in order for people to move around at all, period, due to the immense water pressure. But, the suits are big and sturdy enough to where you can reasonably assume that the hydraulics exist within the suit. It's not a big deal. They got the compressed, specially liquefied air canisters right, so I'm happy.There are some actual  moments. Effects are great, slow-motion effects are done properly, and the mood and tone of the film is nicely foreboding.Give it a shot, unless you've already typecast Kristen to the point of no return."
204,"After the first half of this film I honestly thought it had been underestimated and was building to a great film, sadly that was as good as it got, as the film was sadly let down by the second half.It did just seem a blatant attempt to recreate alien but underwater, from the clothing to the monsters. However the plot and acting feel well short of that high bar.It's an ok film, is just a shame the ending didn't live up to the start."
205,The movie started off great and it has potential to be better and scary it just died out the movie progressively got less scary and entertaining
206,"Despite it being derivative, Underwater is a great sci-fi horror that's tense, fast paced and extremely enjoyable. Kristen Stewart gives a great lead performance with really good supporting performances from T. J. Miller and Vincent Cassel. William Eubank's direction is great and its extremely well filmed. The CG is surprisingly impressive and the music by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts is fantastic."
207,"You get all the information you're going to be given in the opening credits. Understanding anymore of the plot is educated guessing... about 80% of the dialogue is mumble, the rest is buried underneath all the sound effects.Why is Kristen Stewart in knickers and a bra whenever she's not in the suit? Why does the camera spend so much time focussing on Kristen Stewart's almost naked body? Why is TJ Miller the exact same character in everything he does? Exactly what was it that happened to the fiancé?I'd stick to watching The Abyss."
208,It borrows a lot from a number of film but it is very well done and all of the small cast do add to the film. It strays just enough from influences to not be completely predictable and to make this whilst not phenomenal in my experience a thoroughly enjoyable affair. Even the special effects were reasonable for a change for a movie of this style.
209,"I loved this film, it gave me exactly what I wanted... suspense, action, deaths. It was really well made, believable and got straight into the story. Good characters, good acting and I was thoroughly entertained."
210,"I'm excited to see what else William Eubank has to offer going forward. Underwater clearly demonstrates Eubanks skill as a director blending everything we love from classic sci-fi and Thrillers to create something that kept my muscles tensed and eyes wide open.When looking at the plot 'Underwater' offers nothing new if you've seen Alien, The Abyss, The Sphere, Life or Gravity but the aesthetics and tension are all there.With a fairly short run time for movies these days Underwater uses it's time efficiently. The first hour will leave you claustrophobic with a fear of drowning or decompressing wasting no time getting into the films plot.I left Underwater satisfied and would say it's worth a watch in the currently oversaturated market of Film and Tv. Performances are on point and characters act as one would expect.Good movie."
211,"TL;DR: No character development whatsoever, no world building, no exploration of antagonists, no memorable moments, nothing made sense. Okay VFX.This movie had potential, although when it went from 0-100 within the first few minutes of the movie with no foreshadowing or explanation as to why, I knew I've just been jipped. After those first few minutes the movie takes place almost entirely in darkness, unable to see anything aside from the lights on the characters' diving suits or other lights on the facilities scattered around the ocean floor.The ""monsters"" are never explored and just serve to accomodate a cheap jumpscare and be the obligatory antagonist for Kristen Stewart to inevitably overcome while being one of the last survivors on this doomed research facility (which you still know nothing about).Characters were non-existent. You never see anyone alive outside of the main crew, and I didn't know anyone's name until the credits rolled. I recognized a couple actors and a couple voices, none of which were very good or delivered their material with any sort of care or enthusiasm.The biggest thing I felt was confusion as I had nothing but questions. What research happens at this station? Who are any of these characters, why are we focusing on them, and why should I care about them? What are these weird creatures that are stalking them throughout the movie? Were the creatures responsible for the station tearing apart, or was it really just an earthquake? What happened after the last two escaped? Neither of them ever tried to expose what happened? You might say just watch the movie and it'll answer everything; too bad none of these questions are ever addressed.Looking at some other reviews here and it is blatantly obvious who was paid to review this movie. The absolute audacity to compare this movie to the likes of Alien is an insult to that legendary movie and the entire sci-fi/horror genre. It's not 'better than expected', it's not a 'must watch', it's not memorable, it's not impactful, it's not even coherent. It's barely a shell of a narrative that deserves every bit of harsh criticism that comes its way. Avoid this movie, although if you ignore that warning, I guarantee you won't remember much of it the next day."
212,"I can't swim, I panic sometimes when I get into a pool. This movie had the twilight star go underwater for a change and the movie wasn't bad at all. Definitely had me on the edge of my seat, can't even imagine being in the position they were in haha."
213,"I love underwater horror and thrillers so i was kinda looking forward to this film. I loved the similar movies that this was in the same category as Leviathan and Deep Star Six, but from the start i was always saying to myself they were better even with the fact there both over 20 years this films elder.
I have never been a fan of Stewarts acting ability.. all her movies feature the same mannerisms and voice inflections she always looks like she is still in a twilight movie.
I had to force myself to finish this movie....
My opinion is give me Leviathan or Deep Star Six any day."
214,"I went to watch the movie on the big screen expecting a decent underwater monster thriller movie. But was kind of disappointed, the movie had only a couple of scares, few claustrophobic sequences and didn't have the atmospheric thrills that one would associate with such films. The monsters were strange looking and couple of them are shown so gigantic that you wonder how they never surfaced and went undetected on earth so far. The ending is also a letdown.What works is Kirsten Stewart as the lead protagonist. She is excellent and Vincent Cassel supports in a brief role. There are few scary scenes and most of the underwater sequences are filmed very well.So, this is just another monster movie but without many thrills. Give it a miss."
215,"It is fun. It's not that bad. The atmosphere is so scary and cinematography is soo good. But the story and the characters are really empty. If you take a closer look to the story, nothing was there. But! although, it is fun! go see it!."
216,"Stewart and Miller do a great job in this movie. It all kicks off in a hurry and it just keeps going after that. Run of the mill action sci fi flick but it was enjoyable.
🎬"
217,"The trailer and poster promises a claustrophobic sci fi horror involving an underwater threat. On these fronts the movie fully delivers. After just a few minutes of the opening shots, the movie does not waste its time to get to business. It is my first time to see Kristen Stewart perform (since I consciously avoided watching the Twilight Series), and am amazed by her performance. She balances resourcesfulness with stoic vulnerability. Thus she leaves you worrying how she would get through the ordeal more than expecting her to kick ass or play hero. Vincent Cassel was also great and had a very commanding presence. Having seen him play villains, I am surprised that he could be such a soothing presence in face of danger. What is brilliant about the movie is somehow, they make us care. For this reason, every death, or impending danger keeps us at the edge of our seats. There is hardly any time for character development, but the movie knows what it wants and focuses more on suspense and scares. Within helmet shots, and underwater POV shots were very effective in delivering chills, a nd claustrophobia. So much so, you would gasp for breathe the same time Stewart literally gets some air to breathe. In short, Underwater is a very lean sci fi horror that delivers both slow burning, and thumping suspense. The ending also fits the tone of the movie well, so if you want to enjoy a good underwater horror, go see it."
218,"This movie does many things right and many things wrong. Watch it, its worth it, its a bunch of millennials trapped in deep ocean. You see we have so many movies about deep space exploration but rarely any well done movies about deep sea exploration.Watch it, its fresh"
219,Nothing ground breaking in the story and yes its a mashup of 3 or 4 different movies you have seen before. But its a mashup that is done really well and its very entertaining from begining to end.Theres a little twist I didnt see coming as well.
220,"It's up to you whether you want to go see it or not, but I can tell you one thing - Underwater is not a good film and you will most likely not enjoy it.I got used to the fact that sci-fi is not the domain of nerds any more. Everybody can write whatever stuff and think that they are writing good and intelligent sci-fi. So let's get this straight out of the way - in case of Underwater we are not talking about suspension of disbelief, it's utterly ripped from reality. They don't even bother with technicalities and this makes this film harder to watch.The biggest undermining factor is the script. The premise is there, and it is somewhat plausible. I mean, you can switch off some parts of your brain to enjoy this, but they just won't let you. All the establishment you get is some text explanation in the beginning, then you're done. The pacing is insane, you just get thrown into the movie. Be sure not to blink and no bathroom breaks cause you'll miss a lot. I missed the trailers, and I walked in during the starting credits, so when the movie jumped on me it felt like I missed half of the film. It does not mess around.Imagine having Vincent Cassel in your film and give him absolutely no character? He literally has nothing to do. Oh wait, there are no characters in this at all. We have some token character types (the panicker, the joker, the plot device) but not that many and they are only revealed through ""hey, you're the guy who..."" or other random amateur sceenwriting explanatory monologues (these really get ridiculous at times). All the dialogues are horrendous. I also love how T. J. Miller's character casually laughs that he can use the credit card of a dead person they found underwater when they find his wallet WITH HIS FAMILY PICTURE, yeah, horrible death is funny.The story doesn't make sense and is full of holes, I don't want to waste time to talk about all of these just cause there's a lot.If you're still willing to watch this be sure to prepare yourself and stay concentrated since it's nearly impossible to tell what is going on half of the time. It's very murky, which was probably intentional, but half of the time you are not sure what is supposed to be happening to whom. In my country we have only dubbed foreign films and the voices were kinda similar so it was even worse in my case. Sometimes I was unable to tell who was alive and who was dead at that moment. This was very confusing for a film that literally has no script or characters.By the end it gets so stupid I couldn't stop laughing. It was unable to reach even the Prometheus' level of stupidity in terms of character actions (and the Prometheus' characters were pretty stupid already).I really want to say something positive about this film, so I guess I can say that the production design was good (even though the creature design made no sense in terms of how underwater fauna would naturally look like).Other than that, Kristen Stewart was great to look at (and they spend a lot of time showing her) and this is pretty much it.What sucks is that I've seen William Eubank's other films, he had some good low-budget science fiction (like The Signal, which was very ok).I actually found myself rushing out of the theater when this was over. Never was I so fast to get away from a bad film, thanks, Underwater."
221,"You've seen this setup in everything you've watched this year:The first scene introduces us to our defeminized protagonist ""scientist"" (remember if you're woke, being feminine is evil) who proceeds to talk about her ""smart"" partner not believing in time and then goes on to *selflessly* endanger the lives of every single survivor in a master act of virtue when disaster strikes.Next we meet our dark skinned character (naturally he is flawless) and finally we get our corrupt, selfish white male whose first line is sexist. Because duh, CIS white male = evil.Once you ignore the undereducated hollywood squad including the same manipulative propaganda tropes you've seen all year, the film itself is a pretty good reimagining. Nothing new here but believable perfomances from Cassell and Athie"
222,"""Underwater"" works best while making viewers feel claustrophobic, but in the end this is a boring rip off of great films of the same genre.
.
In this sci-fi horror film, a crew of underwater researchers must find safety when creatures attack them after an earthquake.
.
Did I mention that ""Underwater"" is boring and a rip off? Yeah, it really is. The first twenty minutes of the film are quite entertaining but after that, it's a complete downward spiral that sinks into oblivion. It tries too hard to be like ""Alien"" in the water, when it should really be something original on its own. Deep flaws, clichés and poor jump scares make ""Underwater"" one to forget. Welcome to January movie releases, folks."
223,"I watched this film at a free screening. Underwater basically knows what kind of movie it is. Character development is minimal but it jumps straight into the action. While the plot might be derivative and not original , it still manages to be entertaining. The atmosphere of the film is tense and claustrophobic. The underwater scenes are technically well shot with great production values. The acting is competent. Don't expect this movie to be classic films like Alien and Aliens. This is a simple popcorn monster movie for January, nothing more nothing less! It is totally watchable."
224,This movie is above average... They didn't even mention from where did these creatures came from or when ...
225,"The movie is captivating, original stuff, Kristen looks super good, the monsters are scary, the ending was too heroic. I really liked this movie."
226,"Not a lot of people seemed to enjoy this Underwater adventure, and I don't really blame them.
The movie had good potential which kinda got ruined near the end of the movie. I still liked the ending personally, I just think there was not enough of it, the crucial ending contents needed to be explored more! In the beginning the movie is very engaging, around the middle part it slows down a bit but I actually enjoyed that since it is a movie about venturing into the lonely dark depths of underwater abyss and like I said, I enjoyed the reveal near the end. But I can see people getting bored of the movie in general by that time.
Conclusion: Its not everyone's cup of tea! I would only recommend it to people who are interested in these type of slow, tension building movies with little pay-off and those who are desperately looking for a movie that has underwater experience and is within the horror genre because to be honest there are only a couple other such movies out there that I can think of."
227,"The film was very well done in my opinion. I liked how they quickly set up the plot in no time and kept it action-packed to the core. For not a second was the film out of intensity, and a powerful performance coming from Kristen Stewart only made it more fun to watch.Underwater does have its share of jump-scares, but they genuinely work. At least for me, they did. The visual effects were pretty good for a film that's meant to be darkly lit for the major duration. The action sequences were impressive, and it's good to see Kristen Stewart in action movies. The film is crisply edited and manages to pack action, drama, horror and suspense without going overboard.Trust me, if you're just looking for an entertaining sci-fi action horror film, it won't disappoint you."
228,I went into this one without expectations. And I loved it. It was so exciting. We were on the edge of our seat. Well done everybody who made this picture. Great action/science fiction movie. Thank you.
229,"Take the movie at face value, for the sci-fi action thriller it is, and for the atmosphere it pulls you in.Dont overthink it or try to use current technology and human knowledge to judge it, if you do that then using the same principle you simply cannot watch star wars, alien, terminator, etc..8/10"
230,"Intense scenes, good ending, a lot of Sci fi.
I wanted more clear atmosphere though but it was okay. 7/10"
231,If you finding any classic deep see horror you aren in right place. Story line makes sense and the plot was well collaborated.
232,"I've seen this compared to Aliens but it's actually closer to the first Alien, more focused on atmosphere and build-up of dread than on action. Not that Underwater comes even close to Ridley Scott's masterpiece, but it's a competent effort by director William Eubank, whose previous film, The Signal, was well-shot but poorly-written. Eubank wisely sticks to direction only here and does a solid job.After a disaster in an underwater station in the depths of the Mariana Trench, six survivors attempt to return to the surface. As if the situation was not bad enough, with the reactor overheating and oxygen running out, mysterious sea creatures begin to stalk them. There is a sort-of twist in the last act which I won't spoil but fellow Lovecraft fans may appreciate.I do wish the movie had taken its time at the beginning and had the confidence to start slower, introducing the characters, the setting and the first unsettling signs of something wrong (say, sighting strange creatures BEFORE the catastrophe). Instead, two minutes after the opening credits the whole station blows up. It feels rushed; it's like Alien starting with the facehugger, a big miscalculation in terms of dramatic structure. The ""foreplay"" is what makes the scary parts resonate. Oddly enough, it's the opposite problem of The Signal, which had a decent build-up but fell apart around the midpoint.Still, the middle part of Underwater is, to its credit, quite unnerving. Not the kind of film which redefines horror but a fair choice if you enjoy the genre.6,5/10"
233,"I just got out of Underwater.This was made in 2017, before Disney bought Fox, now I don't think Disney care about this movie, as they are just dumping it out with minimum publicity. I have seen two posters, and I only seen the trailer here.Now, I actually thought it was ok, in fact I enjoyed it, It's as cliche as it gets, but it it gets straight to it, the explanation for why they are their is told over the opening credits, so no exposition is needed!! It is insanely claustrophobic and has a few moments of genuine intensity and it is entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of issues with it (I hated Stewart's voice over!! Not seems totally out of place) but it was not as bad as I expected and I was mostly entertained throughout. About 40/50 minutes in, I said to my girlfriend ""I'm actually enjoying this"" but once you see the creature, it kind of lost something.Kristen Stewart was ok, not as good as she was in Charlies Angels, because I found her funny in that, but she was ok. She seems to be much better in things like Seberg than more commercial movies like this. She is no Sigourney Weaver, that is for sure.As for the running around in her underwear her jacket is not fastened during the opening and you see her in get stripped down getting in and out of her suit (as you do all the cast) the end is the longest period, where they get out of their suits and run to the escape pods. So not great deal, and you do not see anything.Vincent Cassel an actor I always I like seeing was fine in his role as the Captain too, but sadly he is sort of wasted as he isn't really given a lot to do.Too many times, Underwater reminded me of better movies and the characters are pretty wafer-thin and walking cliche's, but you don't watch movies like this expecting great characterisation!!Surprisingly, for the first time ever, there were adverts and no trailers at all... Do studio's think nobody will go and see this and have not bothered attaching their new trailers to it??"
234,"Whilst it doesn't do enough to explore the characters and subtleties that are hinted at by the cast and blink-and-you-missed-it attempts at fleshing out the script, this nevertheless stands as a solid if somewhat derivative addition to the ""not sure what we're dealing with but it's scary"" genre."
235,"It reminded me with Ad astra,which has good effects but there's no story or point! Underwater is all about running away from scary creatures, but there's no real story at all. plus, they just wanted to emphasize the leadership role of women (feminist stuff). The movie is silly overall but I gave it 5/10 just for good visualization and sound effects."
236,"I've seen it twice and will probably be going a third time. This movie is not BAD, the opening dialog with her talking is kinda annoying and wasn't needed but I can live with that. The film seems to draw inspiration from a variety of sources, one thing that I do feel is this does a better job of creating a Doom like atmosphere than that film ever did! So you should totally see it because this is in my opinion Doom underwater (mostly).The negative reviews are probably from people who loved TLJ and thought it was great so take them with a grain of salt."
237,"The positives: acting was good by Kristen Stewart, and especially T.J. Miller. Everything else was drudgery, muted, dark, mumbled, technically inane, and absurd. My group of three all felt the same about it. For the money they could have made a good movie in this genre.The aspect that irritated me the most, which is not unique to this film, but a hallmark of bad ones, is action scenes that are flashing sequences of 1 second shots, edited into a semblance of continuity, but failing horribly. They went another level lower even, by having it dark and murky, so the incomprehensible staccato action isn't visible anyway, rather it is a suggestion of action, stifled and dimmed by molasses."
238,"Wow. We actually left after an hour of this movie. If you want a movie that does a close up of Kristen Stewart's painful face every 10 minutes then this is for you. Absolutely zero character development. There are spots that end abruptly and leave you with, how the the hell did they get there? Makes NO sense!!!!!! So many questions needing answers to this pathetic attempt at a movie. I was actually mad when we left early."
239,"Underwater is film that is better then i though it will be,film has story that is engaging even if it copies its story from alien and few other similiar movies,plot is basiacly simple but that is what this makes a solid watch,stewart for a surprise was good in a film but she could at least try to change her expression to something else not just like look at me im sad or depressed all time,other supporting actors also were satisfaying only tj miller was obnogsius and unfunny,film also has problem that in some scenes it lacks light and it is hard to see something and shaky cam didnt help with it ,underwater is a film that is good watch if you dont have something better to do"
240,"Entertaining and well done. Kristen Stewart with a wonderful, understated performance. Definitely worth seeing."
241,"Underwater
2020

Director: William Eubank
Starring: Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassell, Mamoudou Athie, TJ Miller, John Gallagher jr, Jessica Henwick etcOverall rating 86/100Underwater is based on a crew of oceanic researchers working for a deep-sea drilling company, try and get to safety after a massive earthquake hits, but they are not alone under the water, they must fight for their survival. I had a great time with Underwater and was on the edge of my seat throughout, I am really warming to Kristen Stewart now so lets talk about this more in detail,First of all, I thought the concept was great, as well as the cinematography and use of sound. I thought the whole concept of the movie was really interesting and well explored, the jobs of all the characters and the plot was just really interesting to me and despite the plot similarities I had never seen it done in this kind of setting before. The cinematography was also fantastic, despite a large portion of the film being CGI I still found it fantastic to look at. The underwater sets and the wide range of different locations kept you constantly entertained and some of the visual creativity was great as well. I also really liked the use of sound throughout, the film did a really good job at creating sound or effects without you knowing the source of where it was coming from, this kept me constantly on edge and nervous, the lack of sound in some scenes was also very effective in creating a frightening atmosphere.My next few positives would be the tense tone, Jumpscares and creature designs. The movie managed to execute an extremely excellent tense tone throughout. You were constantly on edge not knowing when anything was going to happen, one of the main reasons for this was that they played on peoples fears really well. The film played with fears of drowning and claustrophobia and made that part of what made the film so tense and scary, so this was very cleverly done. Also, the Jumpscares were very well executed. They weren't predictable like in some horror movies, they were well earned and unexpected. The creature designs were also really interesting and terrifying. They looked genuinely scary, and it made you connect with the characters more due to the fear of watching them let alone actually being there in the movie.My next few positives would be the gore, likeable characters, and the great lead performance. I thought that the film used gore very effectively throughout. It wasn't used often but I felt that it was deliberately done to create more of a shock when there was. And they definitely achieved this with some intense gore scenes that made you empathise with the characters and feel genuinely scared for them. All the characters were also very likeable, and all had at least one part of their personality that made you like or connect with them. This improves the experience of the movie because you don't want anything to happen to the characters there making you feel even more tense and on edge. Kristen Stewart also did a fantastic lead performance here, she showed versatility here, and her character was very likeable, and I believed every emotion that Kristen showed throughout, showing that her acting ability is improving in every new role that she is in.However, a few negatives that bought the film down slightly was the lack of background to the plot and characters, and the lack of depth to the plot and characters, as well as sometimes having an inconsistent script. The film went straight into the action which we will talk about soon, in some ways it was a good thing, but it meant that the characters and the plot didn't really have any background at all. We didn't know anything about the characters, or really anything about what was going on in the plot,, so this was slightly odd for me and made the film hard to connect with at first, The plot and characters were also sadly very self-explanatory and lacked any real depth or development, This was a shame as there was so many great components to the film but this bought it down slightly. The script was also at times inconsistent and not always the strongest. There was some plot holes and lack of description within the script to give the audience a proper understanding of what was going on, and some of the lines were slightly awkward and generic for this specific genre and didn't always work.My final few positives would be how the film went straight into the action, there was some attempts at depth to the main character and the final act was fantastic. The film didn't mess around when going straight into the action which I appreciated, it made you on edge straight away and that feeling never went away, so they executed there desired tone and atmosphere right off the bat, there was also some attempts at depth with the main character which I appreciated, they gave Kristen Stewart's character some slow building of background to her character throughout, we slowly learned more things about her family and reasoning behind her behaviour which made you feel connected to her and want a positive ending for that character. And finally, the final act was great. They really went all out underwater horror which I loved, it felt well earned after the slow building of tension throughout and exploded that tension out into a very entertaining and satisfying final act of which some things you won't see coming.Overall, despite a few depth and script issues, Underwater is a very good thriller/horror that achieves a perfect tone and atmosphere throughout and made even better with the fantastic main performance from Kristen Stewart."
242,There was room for both Jack and Rose on the door. And both Norah and Emily could have fit in the pod.
243,"Its one & done, then quickly forgotten. Kristen Stewart is a flat line throughout this entire film even in the action scenes. The kids were bored. But, production quality was great. This films production looked very expensive to create & might have lost out its ______ in box office."
244,"As many have said, the character development was lackluster, but so much of it was very entertaining."
245,"I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't. Upon further examination to why I couldn't I came up with two possibilities which was the story or the acting. The story had possibilities and the surroundings were creepy enough to invite people in. But ultimately I think Kristen Stewart ruined it. Her hallow one dimensional acting is repelling. That tortured look she constantly wears on her face is annoying and off putting. I agree with people who say she can't act, it's really bad. I just can't watch any more movies with her. I only gave this movie a 2 because I enjoyed TJ Miller for the short amount of time he was in it before they killed off their best actor."
246,"It might be a 7 1/2, but I decided on 8 as I think the avarage rating is too low.From 5 minutes into the film it is non stop action and thrills, and I think Kristen had a great performance. I was pretty scared at times and often was at the edge of my seat, biting my nails - GREAT.That being said, I wish they spent more time on character development as it was barely present, and the sea creatures was never explained in any way, they were just suddenly there and they had to try and escape and defeat them. But I wanted a little more.But overall it's a great popcorn flick if you just want some good thrills and action, and if you like sci-fy and the underwater setting."
247,"Im darn picky... but this was rather decent for sci fi lovers... Based on other reviewers I was expecting this to have any one of the several flaws that kill movies... NOPE.. this is rather good, unless maybe youre expecting some blockbuster.
Good Acting.. CHECK
Believable creatures.. Check
Chicks in undies.. Check
Happy ending... Nope"
248,"Let's get the history bias out of the way; with the exception of the commercial rigs and equipment, this movie is not trying to copy The Abyss (1989). That was a sci-fi thriller; this movie is sci-fi horror. Imagine a modernized version of Deep Star Six and Leviathan (both also released in 1989) but this movie's plot begins when everything is literally coming apart. I think this was intentionally done to grab and keep your attention as horror movies often start slow and build up suspense.Throughout the movie, you wonder what exactly is happening and who or what is responsible for the catastrophic damage to the station. Because it doesn't waste time with horror at the beginning, don't expect character development. I think they did fine establishing everyone's job and easy-to-deduce area of expertise and mini-backstory.Honestly it's not that bad considering there hasn't been a decent aquatic horror movie in a while (that doesn't involve sharks) and takes place deep under water.If you decide to watch it, don't expect James Cameron-caliber cinematic precision and just enjoy it!"
249,"Actually pretty good loved the plot and everything, but the movie tempo was slightly off for me."
250,"There's no backstory, the whole thing makes no sense. No idea what is going on the entire time. There is no exposition, the movie starts with the inciting incident. Pretty boring and hard to follow."
251,"I feel like I've seen this movie 10 times before. Predictable plot, bad acting, stereotypical characters to whom I couldn't get attached (+ one super cringy sarcastic ""funny"" dude, as always)... Didn't feel like wasting my time and watch an additional 1 hour 10 min and, reading these reviews, I don't feel like I've missed anything."
252,"Ohh mann this film really got into my nerves. This is one of the most chilling sci fy horror I have seen in recent times. Right from the start the sense dread gets gradually ascends and then we get immersed in this survival/scy fy/horror film. Mind you this film while watching you will feel I have seen this type of movies aliens maybe, you are absolutely right about that hell they even managed to give a tribute to that movie which is frankly scary. So what's new, for me the conspiracy angle of the story while sparse really creates a realistic world building maybe there is something in the unknown in this movie that is Mariana trench. The Mariana trench is again a fascinating thing in the world it is so deep that's getting a gist of it will definitely make someone scared. This movie is so claustrophobic and tensed that you are hooked right with the characters. Bojan bazelli's cinematography captures some of the striking shots in this film especially the close up shots and the whole closed marines ship beautifully, even if it's a disturbing horror you get the sense of beauty in this film. The underwater sequences are beautifully realized cause you have to maintain the mistyness of the deep ocean and yet it should be clear to the audience and the dop department nails it. The ost is brilliant there are some rock ballads and tensed music and jarring noises makes an effective sight and sound experience. William Eubank have experience in this genre of scy fy and in this third attempt he is very confident in showcasing the dread. The story moves fast and there are very little camaraderie but makes sense cause you have to finish the line cause it is a race against time situation there is no time to have a rousing conversation which I feel will be unnecessary so there are emotional moments but they are brilliant, you really care for the characters and will always think that there should be zero casualties. Kristen Stewart, Jessica henwick, Vincent Cassel, Stephen Callagher jr, Tj Miller,Mamoudu athie gives there absolute best performance in this film. And coming to the extraterrestrial monstrosity in a good sense they are creepy and lethal at the same time they had there supernatural qualities and animals instincts and the amalgamation of both these things creates a terror inducing creatures hatts off to the vfx team. This movie is one of the most underrated gems of this year cause this has some of the most unacceptable negative reviews I don't get it. I will say do watch this film you will not be disappointed."
253,"We were royally entertained.Its hot, fast paced, action packed, beautifully shot and well acted. Check out the edits...no endless needless footage. Script was the only issue but, hey you are so engrossed in the thing...get your mates round, its well worth it."
254,"I loved the Abyss, Leviathon, the Thing, all monster movies including deep water ones. This sucks. Kristen Stewart looks like Bieber in his underwear only I don't get to listen to I'm sorry. Be sorry for making this film. Terrible. An extra star for being an underwater film. That's it. And I love TJ Miller! Wtf?!"
255,"It's great when a movie pulls off something original and scary, but those are rare! If Underwater is derivative, at least it's riffing off of Alien and The Descent, two of the greatest creature horror films of all time!
I thought Underwater was tense and atmospheric and well-directed. Some of the acting was very good (Stewart was all-in), and I thought TJ Miller offered a nice light tone as the comedic relief. The creatures were...okay. The ending felt somewhat contrived, though still interesting. Maybe the best part was that you never felt like the team was safe. That constant dread didn't just come from the creatures, but from being 7 miles under the ocean surface, which makes sense!
I enjoyed it and will probably rewatch it with my kids as they get older, too (kind of a prep for the Alien universe)."
256,"This movie was intense from the start, wasted no time. My anxiety was through the roof for the entire movie. And parts of the movie were possibly some of the most horrifying scenes in movie history, or at least the cross-genre (I think that's what I'm going for there). Combine that with a very smart premise.Where the movie gets the 7 instead of a 10 in my opinion is the creatures (Which we're still solid, I guess I just wanted more) and the ending. Just my opinion but without reading other reviews, I have a feeling I'm not alone.Overall a good thriller flick and I recommend it"
257,Putting the climax at the very beginning can be so boring then it leads to a predictable storyline. It did well to be a heart-pumping movie without too much jump scares but in a very flat way.
258,"Pros. Some of the special effects were impressive.Cons. No back story, in fact nothing is explained at all. No character development. Bland acting. Predictable story. Often unclear what's happening on screen. And (spoiler) at the end the humans completely destroy the natural habitat and for some reason that's seen as a good thing."
259,"If it wasn't for the monotonous drone of cgi creatures throughout this film, it would have been better. Not 80 million dollars better, but better."
260,The dialog is extremely flat... No character depth... But this can be understood in a popcorn thriller movie meant but to pass some time in quarantine. But what really bothers me is that I couldn't see anything half the time... There's a difference between being in the mood of characters and just being clueless most of the runtime
261,"The premise of this movie isn't bad at all actually and when I first heard of it I was excited because I usually like movies similar to this but boy was this movie disappointing.My issue unlike a lot other reviewers on here wasn't with the acting. Even though I'm not big on Kristen Stewart didn't think she was terrible. Mine happen to be heavily with pacing and direction the director took with this movie.Zero character development at all to the point you don't even care about anything that happens to them. Was also very sluggish by the time anything serious happens you might catch your spouse dozing off. Final issue I had was the constant use of darkness, I understand director is trying to give the viewers the feeling as if they're submerged with the characters. But it became to overbearing after awhile and hard to see what was actually going on.Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone it just was brutal."
262,"I'm thinking 6.5 rounded up to 7 for this one. It was a mixed bag for me, one that I enjoyed more than expected but failed in a couple of spots.I largely can't disagree with suggestions that there was no character development with one exception, Jessica Henwick's Emily character. For the first half of the movie I wished this cliche'd damsel in hysterical distress would just die and be put out of my misery. But by the end of the movie she was found to be tenacious and resilient.It's true that many people find Stewart's acting wooden, but when I see it mentioned I often wonder if these people also find Bronson, Eastwood, Brenner, and Wayne wooden. All of these people made careers on resting-b***h-face and I don't see why it's unacceptable for a woman. That said, Stewart's character didn't really have far to grow in this one. She started out as a stoic, intelligent, self-sacrificing bad-a** and pretty much maintained that throughout. I do want to give her a nod for that final scene. Her expression in that scene seemed to me to encompass the entirety of what character growth happened for the character in the entire movie, and Stewart delivered it with subtle grace.I would have liked to have seen the monsters a little more clearly and because I couldn't I find myself wanting to agree that the cinematography was lazy. I don't really know enough about movie production to make that call, but the extreme lack of clarity in the water scenes throughout the movie was more frustrating than suspenseful.Props to the nod to Lovecraft in the final quarter to one-third of the movie. I was kind of delighted to see it, actually."
263,"This movie focuses on 2 things other than unknown monsters: teamwork and tension. The cast are pretty good working together, but there's so much tension in the film that will make you think that the creature shows up, but you have to wait more scenes. And that's the reason that I have watched this at home and still kept my ears closed. a lot"
264,"I can agree:
there is no much character developmentthe story doesn't' shine of originalityplot has some major illogical holesthere are some viewer who don't like Kristen's acting... but I cannot accept this movie has a rating lower than Captain Marvel (2019), Venom (2018) or even Aquaman (2018). Are we serious!?!?The movie IS a watchable action Sci-Fi popcorn movie with (IMHO) some great (""by the book"") atmosphere. The CGI puts it over a generic B movie.
You won't be blown away, but you'll definitely have some well spent time.Written by someone that has never watched a single movie of Twilight Saga ;)"
265,"I am wondering why Hollywood wast that much money to make movie that you have no clue about it. There is no begging and no story who is who, just some dude do something to prove to make some money."
266,Why does a monster that live in a place with no light have eyes? Why doesn't the story have any back bone? Why did you have to spit on Aliens face? So many questions...
267,"The previews told you pretty much everything you needed to know about this movie (why, yes, yes it is basically ""Aliens Underwater"").That being said...it's a well-done homage (French for ""rip-off"") to its betters. The acting is surprisingly good at conveying a convincing sense of the physical and environmental perils of where they are.Was actually fun, and did a nice job of building to an exciting ending. It was helped by a terrific film score and some nice camera work.Overlook the physcis and science mistakes, remember you aren't watching National Geographic, and you can have a fun time with this one"
268,"A sci-fi with sea monsters, a storyline that gives affliction at times very good but with a very cliché ending"
269,"The movie starts the action a little sooner than expected, a lot of characters die...But, I still consider it to be more or less a good story, the monsters are cool, there's also 2 suprises at the end, one being the ending (not really a suprise) and the other involving the monsters...Although all my fav. movie characters die, all in all it's a good movie for scares and agressive deaths...."
270,What a boring story and movie without explain anything... But it's not the only problem a big part of the movie is very dark and blurry
271,"The acting is awful in this movie as I was expecting a bit more quality, poor characters too throughout the movie. The storyline sounds like it may turn into a decent film set deep in the Mariana Trench, I can only remember 'The Abyss' with a similar story. It reminded me of the awful 'AVP Requiem' another movie that was very hard to see what was going on, as these 2 films are similar as it's so dark and murky throughout you find it hard to actually see much of what is happening. With the catastrophic failure of the station at the very beginning, there's not much else for the characters to do apart from heavy breathing, getting in and out of diving suits and pressing buttons. With the amount of money spent on this movie, estimated around $80,000,000!
I expected a lot more, even Kirsten Stewart wandering around in underwear for half the film can't save it."
272,"This movie isn't terrible, it's definitely something to pass the time.I understand people's complaints that it has no character development, and the ending wasn't my favorite. Yes technically it was not a good movie, but it is watchable.I don't think anyone will see this movie as a hit or a miss, just something in the middle that's not terrible to watch."
273,"I for one enjoyed Underwater - yes there's various plot holes, what movie has none. There s bit of a question why it went so under the radar with such a great cast (I for one like Kristen Stewart she's done her time since the teen vamp stuff). Its no Abyss and lacks a certain movie gloss however the reason I''m guessing is the Lovecraftian influence. Del Toro's been trying to get a Lovecraft movie of the blocks for years but they do not lend themselves well to blockbusters, well because Lovecraft is so dark. We had another Lovecraft influenced movie recently in the Nicolas Cage led Colour from Outer Space which was wonderfully bonkers. With Video game and movie story telling blurring more and more Underwater does remind me a bit of some Sci-fi games - the detail is there, the intro and end credits expand the story and explain a bit more, disembodied voice messages adding atmosphere as to the environment, as well as pages not even focused on in shot giving more information - some stuff is not spoon fed to the viewer. It does get off to a good start I thought and takes place over not a long period of time. I'm not sure if it would look better in the cinema or not - had a very short run - the in water shots were kinda unclear. However for me its a 7, that's because I appreciate that Lovecraft influence - mainstream viewers may not. It will get compared to Alien and Abyss but to me it does have its character aspect similar to a Lovecraft short story, and that I liked."
274,"It's a very suspenseful movie, with a great ambiance. The acting is fine and they are able to make you feel what they feel. Mission accomplished on that matter. No, it's not an all time great movie, but it's a very well executed horror movie. It's unique and it's riskfull in these main stream times. It feels like a 90's movie concept, which I love and it's more comparable to Alien in it's style. Don't compare it to the abyss, this is something quite different."
275,"I sat through it, since I had nothing better to do. A little dull, but that happens when you try to do horror in PG-13. Horrible underwater physics aside, it was just watchable.."
276,"I was not expecting Lovecraftian horror, was pleasantly surprised."
277,Underwater claustrophobic monster movie!!! Can't go wrong.
278,"Underwater: Far better than some critics suggest if a tad derivative, this is a good Horror/SF film. Deep underwater there is constant pressure on those in Kepler Station, physical, mental and then that of 6.7 miles of water itself. As Norah (Kristen Stewart) is musing on life water drops on her head, then doors explode as a seemingly an earthquake strikes. She reaches safety along with others but at cost of sealing off some to die behind bulkheads. In the control room Captain Lucien (Vincent Cassel) informs them that all escape pods are gone, their only hope is to don pressure suits and walk through station corridors and along the seabed to possible safety at another facility.And so the trek begins, one fraught with danger of crashing elevators, jammed hatches, failing pressure suits. The inevitable happens as a suit is breached and an implosion occurs, resulting in terrifying gore. But there are also more exotic threats to be faced, strange creatures ranging from young Alien types to huge monsters of The Cthuhlu variety attack. Convincing in design these provide some good jump shocks. The corridors and control room/facilities do give a feel of the Alien films, especially the retro look of some of the instruments. Good acting from Stewart and Cassel along with the maintained tension of the underwater journey keeps the interest going. Not particularly original but Director William Eubank (working from a script by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad) delivers an entertaining horror thriller. 7/0."
279,"A crew if highly-skilled deep-sea drilling workers must risk a dangerous ocean bed evacuation to reach a structurally stable section of their rig in order to reach safety. Dangers abound, both known and unknown out in the dark abyss.The dynamic of the surviving group is constantly believable and their growth and adaptation to their new, life-threatening circumstances is seamless. At no point did the actors' portrayals feel contrived or rushed.Vincent Cassel is not at his best but the role of a cool-headed, stalwart captain fits easily into his wheelhouse and his performance is enjoyable. TJ Miller is once again TJ Miller; his oddball persona lends well to the character of Paul whose banter and bonhomie offers most of what little comic relief there is. Jessica Henwick's Emily is perhaps the most out-of-depth character, who struggles initially with the burden faced by the group, often on the verge of panic but wills herself through the very worst thrown at her. Henwick's performance is thoroughly solid and enjoyable. Definitely the best I've seen from her.The star of this movie is definitely Kristen Stewart and her performance justifies her prominence. I feel I should add I almost didn't go to see this film as I haven't enjoyed the movies she usually makes, but this performance has instilled me with good faith going forward. As a mechanical engineer, her character, Norah, is one whose expertise and resourcefulness are key to the teams chances of escape. Initially struggling with the pressure of the predicament and weight of responsibility, we watch her progress with aplomb.The sense of foreboding hardly ever relents and the sense of impending doom is sometimes stifling. This film will compare surprisingly well next to classic sci-fi horrors such as The Thing and Alien."
280,"Hard to understand how Kristen Stewart can be included in any project. From the day 1 exactly the same twilight attributes in all movies. So depressing charachter and certainly has no any skills to be awarded for any movie project. This movie would get better scrore if Kristen Stewart not to be chosen. Cannot demosnbtrate second character in any movie. You wanna be depressed, watch her and she will give you naturally organic one for free. Actually at the cost of wasting your time. Poor movie poor players."
281,"Underwater not only goes about 7 miles to the ocean floor, but where many sci-fi/horror movies have gone. Movies about an isolated group of people in peril from a monstrouos presence or presences have been done at least The Thing back in the 1950s. Alien hit it big in 1979 with the theme, jumpstarting the trend. This type of movie will be done over again indefinitely.Underwater is the latest variation on a theme from Fox, which was recently bought out by Disney. As the movie was reportedly shot back in 2017, it's believed that Disney didn't care about it and released it when it did. At any rate, we've got a likable enough crew who have to abandon their deepsea drilling station when disaster strikes. And it strikes almost immediately, giving the film a fast start. Director Bill Eubank's camera quietly explores the interior of the station for a short time before catapulting Stewart and crew into peril. The captain is a caring and brave soul who has to decide on the best course of action for evacuating the station and trekking to safetly with whatever's left at his disposal..As anyone who's seen the previews knows, the main obstacle confronting the humans is a school of previously-undiscovered life forms with lots of razor-sharp teeth. The movie by now has settled into the who-dies-and-who-lives formula.Eubank milks enough mileage out of a simplistic, no-frills storyline as Underwater moves along. the pacing is well-handled, not too fast and not too slow, as the token funny guy and the rest of the crew bravely press on. The characters briefly mention a detail or two of their lives outside of work: family, lost love and little else. Characterization isn't a major thing in Underwater, but it's worth checking out at a bargain theater or a matinee."
282,"I went for a thrill and a few scares, expecting there to be plot holes and tropes and cliches. It delivered just what I hoped and was a little better than expected. The actors did fine for this type of movie. One movie it reminded me of was Cloverfield. It had that sort of horror in the dark feel to it."
283,"Everything is ""OK"" I think but Kristen is certainly a bad actress and I didnt really enjoy any of the characters in the movieGreat deaths tho"
284,Perfect popcorn horror movie. What would you like more?!
285,"With 95% of oceans remaining unexplored, one of my biggest fears is to end up stranded at night in the middle of some open waters knowing that it wont be hypochondria or dehydration that will kill but instead my own imagination. Things far scarier than sharks can be lulrking in the pitch black depths and the events of this film take place at the very bottom.From the first moments, Underwater feels somewhat similar to Alien having a certain resemblance in terms of style, crew and the atmosphere. It is not a horror movie; more of a sci-fi thriller that feels scary because you don't know what is out there but you understand that you can't escape it. The claustrophobic sequences and the absolute darkness establish a feeling of breathlessness while watching the film.The film turns up the pressure within a first few minutes packing a straightforward plot without pretending to be anything more than a sci-fi disaster-monster movie and its honesty is what made me like it. The rich cinematography and immersive sound create a tense atmosphere of danger with the camera giving away only glimpses of the unknown creature which was something that I was not even remotely imagining. Sit closer to the screen to feel completely immersed into the thrill.#moviesshmovies"
286,"Underwater seemed doomed from the beginning. With middling reviews, a January release, and Kristen Stewart starring this film was meant to be tragic.Thankfully it manages to stay a float and with a great decision to kick the movie off with a bang. It stays pretty intense for most of the run time, and the characters weren't terrible to be with either so so far so good.The movie falls a bit towards the end, the jittery camera work which made it almost impossible to manage what was happening on the screen and some dodgy CG work aside the overall product was better than expected and made for a fun couple hours at the theater"
287,"Except for the acting, plot, cast, camera work, and overall storyline, this is a great movie."
288,Overall the movie is fast paced and moves along rather well. Good acting and special effects. And the movie went by rather fast. I don't get all the bad reviews? Its a good movie.
289,"If you're a marine biologist or bio-molecular physicist or even retired Navy I would understand how you'd poke holes and not find this movie enjoyable. BUT, if you simply enjoy scary, thrill-a-minute, fun sci-fi movies you will NOT be disappointed!! The movie doesn't take itself too seriously so it's asking that we suspend any disbelief and just go along for the ride. Very glad I ignored the nay-sayers because that was a great 90 or so minutes!!!! Now give me Underwater Two: 7 1/2 Miles Down!!! 🦑🐙🐋"
290,It's a Sci-fi movie so leave reality at the door is my motto. Some things still bugged me like being down 7 miles where the pressure is 7 tons per square inch yet they're walking around in suits...Besides that I thought it was worth seeing at a movie theater. I liked how you got to know each character.
291,It did scare the hell of me a few times. Because under water.... too dark to see anything clear. Ending a little bit unexpected.
292,"The film wasted no time jumping right into the catastrophe that the crew experiences. The duration of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, awaiting to see who would make it to the end or not. Not nearly as violent as it could've been, it had a fair share of jumps and disturbing images. The last 20 minutes really didn't satisfy my need as a viewer, and wish that they had scrapped it and ended it differently. With subtle homage to Ripley Scott's alien, the movie was over all a fun suspenseful thriller. But definitely save it for streaming or renting."
293,"I was not expecting much from this Sci-Fi movie since I felt it was not widely promoted and the trailer seemed like some of the recent movies I watched which had interesting and promising trailers, but the movies turned out crappy.However, being a fan of good Sci-Fi Horror movies, I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie entertaining and engrossing.It has the typical formula of a Sci-Fi horror flick (in a good way), but executed well with fast pacing, good cinematography and acting. The director was able to capture the emotions of the actors well and it's editing was spot on. The CGI was pretty good as well.As the movie basically brings the audience to follow a group of survivors who experience a sudden mysterious disaster (as seen in the movie trailer) , some might find this movie lacking of backstory or explanation as the characters were clueless on the events that transpired.However, I found the mystery and lack of exposition worked well in this production, giving me a sense of being part of the survivors and understanding their frustration on figuring out what is going on and how to escape this disaster, as the creepy horror stuff unfolds."
294,"Underwater is a film I was on the fence about seeing. The trailer interested me some, but it's a horror movie released in January, which is never a good sign. Plus, it stars the actress from the Twilight Saga. However, two of my trusted reviewers gave it a positive review, so I decided to check it out. I have to say this was a fun time at the movies. The effects were great. It has a great atmosphere, and a fast, thrilling pace. Within the first five minutes we're thrust right into the action. All the actors do a good job, including Kristen Stuart, which surprised me. Despite the Twilight films, this film proves that she is a good actress.This film is a creature feature, but does the smart thing of not showing the monsters for most of the film, letting the audience use their imagination. For the first thirty minutes its just our characters caught in a bad situation, of their underwater base collapsing, and having to just survive. It reminds me of Jaws or the original Cloverfield. This does feel like Cloverfield, but underwater. In fact, this movie is what The Cloverfield paradox should've been like.Now, the move I won't say is great, or one you need to rush out and see. The premise isn't that original. Films like The Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and Sphere have a similar plot, among other films. All of these films are quite underrated and receive a lot of undeserved hate, much like this movie has.
There's not much in the way of characterization here. It's mostly plot driven. It's really the actors' performances that carry the film and make us care for these characters rather than the writing.Overall, if you're a fan of movies like Cloverfield, Leviathan, or Deep Star Six then I say give this film a watch. It sucks that this film has gotten a bad rap from critics, and even the studio that made it. It was originally supposed to come out in 2017, but got shelved for almost three years, and then got dumped here in Hollywood's garbage month where no one will care to see it. That really is a shame."
295,"Yes, it's alien under water. yes, it's derivative. yes, it's familiar. i see a lot of movies, and honestly, folks, this isn't that bad. kristen stewart is quite good, in fact. the monster not so much. it's a saturday afternoon delight."
296,Why would you make a movie and not allow the audience a chance to see the FREAKING CREATURE !! I'm not going to complain about the plot which is WEAK !! But I get pissed when you show images of something you (the audience) can't figure out and then poof it's gone !! I get your at the bottom of the ocean and it's DARK but dam I think the audience should be able to see what is attacking who and what happened to the character exactly !! I found myself getting frustrated with this movie because I could NEVER figure out what exactly was going on and NEVER getting a clear look at what was tormenting the crew !! I WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE SO BAD !!!!
297,"I enjoyed Underwater, the writing was a little half assed and was waisted for TJ Miller's character. I love Miller and feel his comedy chops could've been utilized better. Kristen Stewart was tolerable for the first half but per usual she emotes nothing and her character falls short because of it. The saving grace of this movie is the concept. Can't go wrong with an underwater alien type creature. Vincent Cassel is always good and didn't disappoint. Overall I give Underwater a 7 for concept and visuals. Anybody else but Stewart and this film would've great.Cool Movie minus Stewart👌🏻"
298,In last scene the radar shows creatures but in all station there's no radar show them?!!
299,"Storyline was a bit fast, lacking some depth to the characters and to the science of what's going on but amazing scenes, great acting, good ending hitting real elements of life."
300,"Underwater is about a drilling team 7 miles deep in the ocean. They drilled too deep and woke the presence of sea creatures and have to walk on the ocean floor to each the safe point and get out safely.So my friend and I wanted to see a fun movie to watch over the weekend and we decided to see this. Expecting it to be ""ok"", we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and content of the film. When the film was over, we looked up the budget for the film and were surprised!! This movie had a lot of jump scares (some may be unneeded) but still enjoyable. I like how they didn't waste any time and got started right away. This movie was definitely no slow burn, in fact the complete opposite. I personally think that they tried to cramp too much in this film, for nothing slowed down. Everything was fast paced and intense, I think this is the most intense PG-13 I've seen in a while. (But for parental guidance- this might pass as an R rated movie so beware, it had a lot more blood/gore than I thought and cussing )But if you have spare time willing to spend on the movies, go check this out, it's a fun movie to watch for a good time."
301,A real surprise and kept me fully entertained from start to finish
302,"With low expectations, this flick was a pleasant surprise. The characters were all flawed individuals, with little hope for survival. Kristen Stewart was deadpan as always (which works here), and the almost textbook TJ Miller character injected the proper amount of humor and laughs without wanting to cringe at what is normally forced jokes. If you can look past the scientific flaws and want to have a quality 90 minutes in front of a screen, this may be the movie for you. Oh yeah, the monsters are pretty cool too."
303,"Reminds me of something almost similar. Was it the Abyss? Everything about the Underwater they did it quite impressive except for running on the seabed? Let alone putting on high-tech heavy weight wetsuit!! Everyone did a pretty good job in the film. I like the focus in facial expression, otherwise animated CGI could have easily done it all. The creature at some point correlates to the damage done on the rigs. For a second when they flashes the monster i thought Godzilla might jump off the screen. I also thought it might serve a better credit let just say the film includes the rescue operation from the above.. that would overall balance the core ingredient supposedly the mighty company would be interested to save the assets, the people from the bottom of the ocean. Where were they?
Overall is a great entertaining film!"
304,"As some reviews said! Well ok, walking underwater in 12km... so yes, this was pure scifi... but as horror... pretty dark and scary. Starts bit too early and then it isnt really interesting , but 2nd part of movie was better than my expectations."
305,This film wasn't bad at all but I suspect there were some character development scenes cut which is a shame. Starting out with this instead of going right into the action would have probably generated more interest for a sequel which is implied at the end. As usual Stewart brings it. I would have loved to have seen more acting from the actors instead of the immediate action. Not criticizing them at all. The editor needs to be flogged. Missed opportunity here. Nice visuals. Teasing a monster that was difficult to see until the end. Why do science fiction films do this?
306,Really enjoyed it and I wasn't sure if I would. And truthfully it works as disaster/escape movie at least as much as it does a horror movie.
307,Going to theatre's now a days are boring and the atmosphere is not the same as it was growing up... this would of been a better movie if they went deeper into the story... the sound was by far the best part IMO
308,"Well, well--besides being a pretty deep subject, looky here it is the start of 2020 and what better way to kick things off than a movie review (or two) from me, considering, after all, I am living in the back lot of Tinsel Town. So, let's get right to it, shall we? UNDERWATER directed by William Eubank (Love, The Signal) wow, what better claustrophobic, nails-down-a-blackboard, deeply derivative, loosely character driven 'who-let-the-monster's-out' type feature-flick could I hope for to hash things-out? And yes, also, my 'official' first, bonafide theatrical viewing of MXX.Now, of course, I would normally be very, very tempted to look-back to make mention of the profoundly impactful works of late 2019 (Parasite, The Great Hack, Uncut Gems) that is, if I all I wanted to pontificate upon was substance, metaphor, as well as everything else that brings the best of the cinematic experience to the forefront of my being. But then, how could I stop there without going further into the unexpected social relevance and cultural importance of films I'd seen over the past year such as The Last Blackman In San Francisco, Hustlers, Queen & Slim and yea, even The Lighthouse in its own kinda-twisty-slimmy way.Fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon how one looks at it, though--this all brings us right-back to the twisted slime at hand--that of Eubank's UNDERWATER. As a Gen-X, the one big takeaway I got from this film is encapsulated in the following thought: the single most problematic of all Hollywood tropes exists only to give rise to new cinematic genius (aka Jordan Peel, Us) so that we can be reminded of why those tropes arose in the first place (spoiler alert, the black guy implodes (yes, dies) first--and I suppose if that's your only message as a filmmaker of 2020 you can envibe within me in a runtime of 1:54 min, so be it, job well done.Yet, all bio-political, socio economic jargon aside, UNDERWATER under Eubank's direction strikes a nearly-parable-like tone (ie. WERE WE NOT ALL UNDERWATER WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD AS WE ENTERED THE THEATER?) with assist mostly from the acting prowess of Kristen Stewart and the bits of 'almost-too-much-comic-relief' of T.J. Miller; as well as what seems a fresh and well adapted screenplay by Cozad & Duffield given the task of re-hashing all too familiar territory. Also worthy of note is the intermittent and an too appropriate wild-n-crazy 70's style electronic musical score by Marco Beltrami--overall adding to the mesmerizing, foreboding and even reverential tone of this surprisingly well crafted feature.The films success, in my eye, was not for lack of creature-feature-spills-n-chills, but rather Eubank's cleverness in overtly sublimating (let's call it for what it is) the ALIEN genre as a shimmering example of something new among other countless dime-a-dozen shameless appropriations of Ridley Scott's 1979--Muthur of all sci-fi epic morality tales--where key ingredients of time, space, female leads, gnarly monsters & corporate greed coallesses into a cohesive narrative thrill ride (hopefully) that defies convention, or at least attempts to, by up-ending deeply rooted, megalomaniacal cast/belief systems to remind us that in the end, we're all left standing in the same head-count-line-up with no place to run and time-on the clock done run out. That plus, cinematically, UNDERWATERS' uber grunge style of visual chaos set against translucent slime and murky darkness runs on a quite undistracting yet palatable parallel track right down to the blue of Yaphet Koto's (ALIEN's Parker) bandana--not an easy task to pull off, yet for this movie goer it seems well--well worth the effort."
309,"Kristen, I think does not know how to act. The dialogues were so so so bad, I can't even. If someone tells you that they love someone in a moment of need and support and you reply with ""That's so cool!"", that's the energy of this movie, trying to be a cooler version of Alien with underwater sequences which are just boring after a point. And the Mother Alien was so bad CGI. I mean at least they could have been a bit innovative about the creatures instead of copying from Harry Potter, Alien and Pirates of the Caribbean. Bleh!"
310,"I love sci-fi horror movies. Alien, The Thing, Predator, and Terminator are all examples of timeless 80's classics that continue to captivate audiences. Sadly, today's movie theaters rarely see an entry in this category. That's why when I saw the trailer for Underwater, I was very interested.Underwater follows suit of its predecessors in being set in a very quiet, isolated, and claustrophobic environment. It's not the first of its kind to be set in the depths of the sea (see LEVIATHAN, THE ABYSS, etc.) but it does very well in giving the film a dark and otherworldy vibe. The musical score is phenomenal and is perfectly matched to the setting in its hauntingly beautiful chords.The cast is one of the best parts of the movie. Kristen Stewart shines as a very likeable and relatable protagonist. She's not indestructible or fearless but instead presents a realistic underdog reacting to terrifying circumstances. Her co-stars play off each other well in a way that is genuine and avoids horror movie cliches.This movie works best building tension and mystery. True, there are a few predictable jump scares here and there, but there is greatness in how Underwater chooses to not reveal everything instantly. Less is always more in these situations. The creature effects are cool and the sounds effects are intense.At the end of the day, Underwater might not be quite the monumental achievement its ancestors from decades past are, but it is intriguing, moving, and and captivating in its own right. The fact that a great sci-fi thriller like this can be made in 2020 gives me much hope for the future."
311,"This films been getting a decent amount of doubt due to being a January horror movie + Kristen Stewart js playing the lead role but it really wasn't that bad at all.The film immediately gets into the action without wasting any time which is greatly appreciated. They do an excellent job setting the scene and laying out what needs to be done all within the first 10/15 minutes.For the most part all the characters were convincing at portraying panicky/worried workers trying to survive. TJ did a decent job with comedic relief while Kristen Stewart was suprisingly able to convey enough emotion to sell her more dramatic scenes. I'm ecstatic they didn't make her character the Mary Sue of the sea, especially because she had the feminism haircut so that's worth some bonus points.As for the storyline, it's a bit cliche with the whole ""unfamiliar environment & something's hunting the characters"" but it did a decent job trying to keep it entertaining with great set design and sick diving suits that looked like something out of the Lost Planet games. The monsters looked a bit boring except for that final reveal at the end. A giant crab would've been more threatening than those things but they weren't given too much screentime so whatever.If they fixed the garbage creature design, those few very dark and shaky cam scenes and lose a some of the corny jumpscares you'd have an excellent horror movie!"
312,"The decent itself was a decent horror but not it's best. This movie felt like it could have been longer. I was expecting it to be more scary but most of it was shown in the trailers which jump scare. I might be my fault for expecting more which made it a bit anticlimactic but it wasn't a complete downfall. There were few logic moments that help the movie on how it would happen in real life. The moral of story might or might not sent a good message. I'll leave it up to you. The performance was good, but like I said the plot could have been better.
The movie wasn't terrible but if you want to wait for it to come on TV, I would recommend it. If you can't wait, go ahead."
313,"""Underwater"" jumps in knowing exactly what it is and succeeds because it doesn't pander to any other expectation. This is a 90-minute aquatic horror pulse pounder buoyed by great direction and cinematography; I highly recommend the director's prior movie ""The Signal"" (2014)- the dude's got chops. This is the kind of movie that gets criticized for lack of character development and thin plotting, even though the lack of both is exactly the point. The script gets out of its own way and lets the characters just react. Kristen Stewart and co. are excellent and you root for them. Bonus points for the ending, which is surprisingly moving. Definitely recommended. If anything about aquatic horror interests you, you've come to the right film."
314,"There is no Dustin Hoffman, Samuel Jackson or Sharon Stone in this underwear tale. There's no immediate plot, other than a failure of equipment. When an antagonist is shown, it is not built upon this was made in 2017 and should have stayed there."
315,Straight down to the action... No mushy stuff.Good cast selection with genuine touch of sci/reality background
316,New breath into this New suspense movies.... Góes better after the comediant dies.... A good movies after all
317,"This was a nice surprise of a movie, given its unfortunate January release date; I think it could have held up on its own in a summer slot. The action starts literally two minutes in and doesn't let up. Not a lot of character development, but you learn little bits along the way. The acting was competent. But the real reason we all want to see the movie: the monsters. They didn't disappoint! Very Lovecraft-ian and tentacle-y and had some pretty cool kills. Downsides for me were that the ending was kinda corny and there was a little too much comedy sprinkled in. But hey, it was a fun time! If you like creature features definitely check it out."
318,It was fun and better then I thought it would be. Stewart is making a real come back and was great in this. Kind of reminded me of the X files a bit.
319,"I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie after reading some negative reviews, however I decided to watch it nevertheless. I didn't regret my decision. It's an adventure that takes you to another dimension of the dark ocean. The way the story was done make it in a way or another a true or story or let's say an inner message to humankind Unlimited intervention to this world.
I recommend this movie to those think deeply."
320,"The movie was good, kinda creepy when you have a claustrophobia and i love Kristen in this movie. She's so humble."
321,"Remember all those early si-fi/horror movies you watched when the VHS first came out? They made them on the assembly line like cookies and they all were grotesquely executed, with no plot, laughable effects and atrocious acting. This is a flashback from that era, the movie being the best example of the worst of it."
322,"This movie starts off pretty good with an immediate disaster aboard an underwater drilling site 7 miles underwater. At first, it was pretty exciting. Then the movie kinda takes a slow down of sorts. There are some dark scenes and shaking video shots that seem trite. T.J. Hunt is found early on and is supposed to be the comedic guy in the movie but I honestly didn't find any of it funny. The previews got me on this one. There are a couple good scenes in this movie, hence the 4 out of 10 stars. But, the end is pretty bad. It's not a 1 star like some suggest but it sure as hell isn't anything above a 5. The end completely ruined anything promising about the film. It left a lot of unanswered questions and there really isn't any character development to speak of. It was hard to care about any of the characters, and the end was horrendous. If nothing else is on, it's a okay time waster."
323,"I honestly think the makers of the movie thought this would be the underwater equivalent of The Descent (2005). Some of the creatures actually look similar. Unfortunately, it wasn't. This was the worst kind of creature feature, in that the movie would've been far more terrifying without the creatures - the premise of your submarine breaking while you're at the bottom of the sea is horrifying enough. As for the acting, I didn't find Kristen Stewart's performance to be terrible. The plot broke the movie - not the actors."
324,The Story line is not that good..... but the suspense is the great. Don't expect many action in this movie. Hence I mentioned 'One Time Watch '
325,"Underwater is one of those films that pops its head up every year that leaves you scratching your head. This film could have been better with a few re-writes and treatments. The film has too many gaps. The film felt rushed and when I say rushed I mean quickly done. I felt someone came up with the idea of crossing Alien with The Abyss and just winged the film.
There are a few things I liked. I like how the film quickly starts. No drag, no long period of waiting for something to happen. Just in your face action from the start. I also liked the idea. I like the idea of something mysterious. Was it an Earthquake? Was it a shark? Or was it something else. I am also happy they didn't use sharks. Like zombies, sharks have been played to death in films of late.
Here is what I didn't like. Kristen Stewart. I am perplexed how she keeps getting roles. She is not a good actor. She has the same look, some poor delivery, same unemotional response to any situation. The lack of showing what chasing the oil crew. The film is so dark in spots, it ruins the whole appeal of Sci Fi. Story Arch and character development. As I stated before, the scripted seemed rushed and you can tell with story arc and character development. The arcs of the characters are random and thrown at you at different points of the film. The film seems rushed. The characters do things too quickly to be realistic. Finally, action sequences. These Matrix like special effects have been played to death. Every action sequence does not need to be slowed down and put in slow motion.
Overall the movie is just meh. If you are bored and the weather is bad it can kill time. Nothing memorable. 5/10"
326,The scariest part of the movie was there were women trapped with TJ Miller 7 miles underwater. What's down there on the ocean floor? Is that an alien? That's a lazy foxhole that alien fish was laying in.
327,"If it wasn't for the actors, the special effects, where clearly all the money went. This movie would have made the b rated movies of sharknado. It's a true copycat film of Leviathan. (and the Leviathan is far better). Not only that but the writing is horrible, it counts on building character feelings right off the bat. Its great for you action lovers and that is it."
328,The movie was surprisingly okay but the fact that Kristen Stewart was selected for the main role made me not appreciate so much the movie. It is clear that she is not a good actress but it seems that they still didn't understand that in Hollywood!!
329,"I do like a creature feature, i'll be honest. I also like underwater type movies, but, there are a lot of rubbish ones. This, is not one of them. It's a pretty good solid sci-fi movie and definitely worth a watch.Its not the Godfather. Its a monster sci-fi movie, enjoy it as such."
330,This was a great movie. Scary too. And I'm starting to like Kristen Stewart now. She really did a great job on this film. I even liked her shaved head. I don't expect too much when it comes to films these days. But I was happy to have seen this movie. I was very worth watching. I will recommend this movie to everyone I know.
331,"In a decade that has less then wowed me with its horror, this was refreshing. Not the best thing in the world but refreshingly good. Decent acting if not great, good plot that hasnt been done about 10 times in the past half decade. Refreshing for someone who feels monster movies have become to few when it comes to actually good movies."
332,"This movie is better than expected .. which may or may not mean very much. As a throwback to older ""under the sea"" titles (Abyss or similar) .. it also dabbles in ""big bad, awakened thing .. "" (a sprinkle of Lovecraft maybe?)Now .. it is enjoyable .. it has a fairly good pacing .. and i really liked the acting for the most part. (although i think Steward could do better if she wanted .. as for the rest of the cast .. they were mostly stereotypes)What i liked:
plausible communication and decisions made by the protagonists (i cannot value that one high enough for a movie of that type)Mostly good effects .. (visuals)What i did not like:
very predictable storyline .. you can almost predict the order in which the cast is picked offmaybe a few plot-holes here and there .. for the sake of storytelling and suspense...The characters were mostly one dimensional and tbh .. not exactly very interestingTo sum it up .. i think there is a balance of good enough and not so great."
333,This movie was great. From start to finish it was intense. Really filmed very well. Great acting and direction. This is a solid movie.
334,"Kristen Stewart is an awful actress. They could have hired the door that saved Rose on the Titanic instead of her and the film would be slightly more watchable. She even brings a normally dependable Vincent Cassells down to her level.The thing is the film itself could've been ok, with another actor/actress it's just unfortunate she exudes zero charisma, believability or likeability and should remain a background/supporting actor going forward.Basically an ok movie that could have been a 6 or 7 ruined by a bad casting choice."
335,"The film starts with the near collapse of an underwater drilling platform and continues with a race to safety.
Naturally all the easy routes to escape are gone do the assembled group of protagonists have to do things the hard way... Finding out more than they want to along the way.Kristen Stewart channels Ripley throughout and plays the role straight. She's tough but broken and with a humanity that gives the story some heart without any schmaltz.
The rest of the characters are secondary, either their to be saved or to fall away and provide emotional heft to the drama.
The reason for all the trouble ?
Basically Godzilla or Chthulu has been awoken and is mightily pissed off.There were some irritations... The type of structures shown couldn't survive at the depths they were supposedly at and the prospect of a power suit being able to withstand pressures at that level are doubtful.
Still some of the depth effects were horrible and spectacular.I did hope that someone would use a suit as power armour (Warhammer 40k style) but sadly it wasn't to be .. apart from an one brief encounter towards the end.Overall a fun popcorn movie, not worth overthinking."
336,"Apart for two or three jump scare the movie doesn't scare enough and it never reach the tension that it need maybe because of the lame dialog and the bland, two-dimensional characters that it's nearly impossible to care about or maybe because of the screenplay that remains too basic and superficial and it never creates the right set up.
The production design and the cinematography are pretty good though"
337,"From the trailer I was hooked, sadly it turned into a weird underwater jelly monster comedy.
I'm a big Kristen Stewart fan as far back as the panic room. She has had some movie wobbles but this isn't just a wobbly it a totally stacked it moment.I loved the shaved head and her change of movie role direction but this wasn't the one to pick"
338,"The film isn't that bad it's a typical monster movie scenario with decent action.
How else do you write a monster mash lol. Who cares how it happened not knowing gets you gripped. Good monsters and action definitely watchable. Alien and Aliens different league thanks to Giger.Real tough crowd with sticks up ........"
339,"Worth a watch, ignore negative reviews and make your own mind up"
340,"Well I like my sci-fi and read some of the good reviews but gave up after 25 mins, simply didn't care about any of the characters and could not see sci-fi in it. Maybe I shouldn't have reviewed without watching the whole thing but don't bother."
341,"The only good thing about this movie is Kristen Stewart. Otherwise, after the first thirty minutes I was bored to death. Really, how many more playoffs of Alien do we have to watch? This one isn't even entertaining or interesting at all. I think my 6 stars is being very generous and that's only because of Kristen Stewart."
342,"Watchable but we've seen this before and done better
The plot was too see how many times they could show Stewart in her undies only to blow herself up to destroy the Kraken and the deep sea Aliens (rip off)"
343,"This film wasn't what I was expecting, in a good way. The film is clearly inspired by James Cameron's alien, you see a lot off similarities with the films. Set in a hostile unbreathable environment check. Female protagonist will be in just underwear and t-shirt for part of the film check. Crew have to escape exploding facility/ship check. Unknown hostile being hunting and killing them check. I enjoyed the film, I thought it was a lot better the I was thinking it was going to be. Clearly it isn't as good as alien because what is? But it still a decent film, I'm not sure why it has so many negative reviews I'm going to assume it's because it stars Kristen Stewart that poor girl gets a lot of hate. I thought her and the rest of the crew did a good job. From the opening scene this film starts with a fast frantic pace and keeps That going for the rest of the film. I wasn't tempted for a moment to pick up my phone and that's the best praise I can give a film these days the only negative I can say about the film is the creatures weren't the best CGI Your going to see. The film released in 2020 you would think the CGI would be much better. Other then that I thought it was good. I would say the atmosphere was the best part of the film. If you enjoy alien and are stuck for something to watch I say give it ago. But of course don't expect it to be on the same level."
344,"Take ""Aliens"" and add it to ""The Abyss"" and that's exactly what this film tries but fails to be.
It's unoriginal but never dull."
345,"A vast underwater facility is badly decimated, apparently due to an earthquake, leaving a few survivors trying to find a way out. This is complicated further when they realise that strange creatures are responsible for the devastation.There is a great sense of claustrophobia here as Stewart and co crawl through damaged corridors and through the darkness underwater. The problem is that this represents the bulk of the story and whilst it is impressively handled it does drag a little. A good film, but one to admire rather than to enjoy."
346,"I went into this movie with not exactly high expectations, Kirsten Stewart isn't one of my favourite actresses but I thought, why not. Well I'll tell you why not, because it is one of the most abysmal movies I've seen for a very long time, and I watch some real crap!This had some real promise, the story isn't exactly original but as we have barely mapped 10% of the ocean floor who knows what's down there, so the premise of this movie was a good one. However, with not one iota of character development or explanation of what the heck was going on, I had to force myself to finish watching. I'm all for edgy camera angles, real lighting, and that kind of shaky effect; but when there is no explanation of what is going on it becomes exceedingly difficult to follow... Well what the hell is going on.I wouldn't waste my time watching this really and I think that's a real shame. Basically the film is a rip-off of the abyss, deep blue sea, and alien all rolled into one... Only without the great acting, characters, story, or creature feature."
347,"The idea of awakening a new species of ""Monster"" under water is a great concept, Albeit a recycled one, but this film instead decided to focus on the characters lack of oxygen and the long distances they have to travel to get to safety, instead of the horrors regarding the monster.The sci-fi theme is very strong, especially with their gears of war type deep water suits, computer displays and the actual drilling of the ocean with a huuuuge drill.The characters all get picked off rather fast, but you struggle to see this as the colouring is so dark that you struggle to see what's going on half the time.If you want an easy to watch sci-fi movie with an annoying ending then this is just for you, you know...for those background movie choices whilst you play on your phone"
348,"It's got a great premise and the whole cthulhu mythology is interesting; they should have advertised it better. i had no clue cthulhu was the big bad until the very end of the movie. the directing ruined the movie, the lighting is some of the worst i've ever seen in a movie, i couldn't see a thing at the most interesting parts. i never really got a good look at the creatures and they saved cthulhu for the end but you can barely see him. it woulda been a great movie if it had a better director"
349,"I've always found the deepest darkest level of the sea to be fascinatingly frightening. This might've stemmed from the Angler fish scene out of Finding Nemo! I mean, check out images of that creature, it's quite something. So the concept of the film Underwater released earlier this year really appealed and in a way it's unlike any other sci-fi horror that I've seen before. The story arcs and narrative structure we may have seen many times but just the setting it's in and the danger it presents to the characters makes for a really exciting watch. Norah (Kristen Stewart) is a mechanic working in a high tech submarine base in the deep depths of the sea with a team of 315 others working on drilling into the ground to find what lies underneath. After a seriously damaging tremor occurs leaving many of the team dead, the remaining survivors embrace an escape mission only to find unburied horrors along the way. I loved the twist made about half way through the film and thought the unknown threat becoming known was really cool! It's great to see something with a mythological background become realised on the big screen. Stewart is becoming increasingly one of the coolest movie stars in modern times and the entire cast do a great job; it's pretty refreshing to see Vincent Cassel play a nice bloke for once! It's stylishly beautiful, has a fantastic music score and I'm already looking forward to watching it again 😀"
350,"Normally when i know Kristen Stewart is starring a movie, i tend to try and avoid the project because I find her acting stiff and emotionless. This time I thought I would watch cause this movie actually didn't look half bad. I watched this movie based on a trailer and nothing more - therefore i wasn't exactly sure what to expect (probably the best way to go into movies). The film starts out with vibes of Alien, where a crew is isolated miles in a station and troubles ensue...as the films goes on the vibes switch into almost a Cloverfield feel. I honestly was thinking this movie might be a shark movie like Meg or maybe even just a survival against ourselves film - but it definitely changed into something much more.
I think people should take the chance on this cause the cast is actually pretty good, even Stewart, the story isn't half bad. The worst part is how the director chose to film the water sequences. They are blurred and dark - and with how action occurs it's almost impossible to make what's going on clearly. The biggest surprise and want to revisit this film is the unexpected Lovecraft / Kaiju elements. Definitely a step up for Stewart."
351,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm definitely not a fan of Kristen Stewart but was pleasantly surprised by her acting.
Although it is a genre that is used often I found this movie with more content. Also to found out the movie is a lovecraft adaption and with a lot of feel of Alien, I loved the movie even more.
It had no typical characters like a selfish or really dumb guy (that still somehow made it). It were just real people that honestly cared for each other. Don't really get the hate it got."
352,"From having watched it twice, I can say that it is NOT a good rewatch; BUT if you only view it once, you should have a fun time from start to end."
353,"What you want to see, does not make it a bad movie. It's just an opinion, try to do better with the ratings everyone. The film has all the good references, pop culture, visuals and the Lovecraftian horror. Cast was good, maybe not the best character development, since it concentrated more on the story itself (thrills and mystery), in the 95 min. Anyway, since everyone is a film critic now a days, I recommend it and would like to see more."
354,"I was very skeptical about ""Underwater"" and honestly I was expecting the usual wannabe sci-fi trashy movie with big stars, just to gain people's attention, instead the movie looks pretty solid. Of course, we are not talking about the most beautiful or original movie of the genre, as the story is pretty average, but the script is good and scenes are very immersive. The director managed to generate a lot of anxiety and tension, avoiding cheap jump scares. What you have is a production that immerse the viewer in the story.On the first three minutes of the movie we already know the backstory, so the movie start immediately with a big explosion, that will destroy partially the underwater base built on the Mariana Trench, for research purposes. The six survivors that we follow need to escape, facing a dangerous and mysterious treat. During the movie a lot of scenes are shot directly on the first person perspective, by using the suites ""body cam"" POV. A nice way to build up tension and that made me stay glued on the screen until the very end. Speaking of which, was very disappointing and completely uninspired. I was honestly hoping for something less predictable honestly.The cast is formed by very important names such as Vincent Cassel, Kristen Stewart, which I really never appreciated as actress, but I have to say that in this case she made a good job and she was pretty much convincing and expressive and T.J. Miller that as always needs to play the part of the stupid/funny guy. It is stuck in this kind of role, and I wish to see him for once on a different part one day, maybe a little bit more serious.Special effects and CGI are convincing, and I really liked monsters models and the whole underwater locations that we have for the whole movie. If you are a sci-fi lover, this movie may be the right choice, just to spend a nice evening, just to relax."
355,"Reasons to hate it:It was a nice attempt to create sea monsters inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, but the film takes it too much in the direction of the Alien movies. The sea monsters are not that scary and the cast doesn't have enough interactions with them. The sea monsters are just there.
It's also not scary because the gore is minimized. Everything is too censorsed today for good horror films to come out. The characters are also one dimensional and come across as shallow people you don't really care to invest in.Reasons to watch it:It's an okay sci-fi/action film and is well cast, especially Stuart and Cassel. Ambitious movie in that it pays homage to the Alien franchise. At least it's more entertaining than ""Sphere"" with Sharon Stone. I loved the robotic, deep sea wetsuits used to navigate the terrain.
Kristen Stewart is mechanical but she's interesting to look at, and she spends the entirety of this showing off her waifish figure. She is good at these ""military roles."" She's got this androgyny that makes her attractive to men and women."
356,"I don't get it, its almost the same movie as the abyss with a touch of Aliens but The Abyss and Aliens r alot better. It sounds like it should be good with what I just told u but NO. Watch the uncut version of The Abyss if u can find it. That the sad part about dvds that now adays its almost imposiable to find the uncut versions of movies.
But now this movie if u dont mind seeing an okey movie and you have nothing else to see.
I gave a 6 out of 10.
Peace! :)"
357,"Okay, what is going on with me, this is the second Kristen Stewart film I've watched recently (Charlie's Angels review to follow). But to be fair, the trailer for this had an Alien/The Abyss vibe and I love both of those films so had to dive right in!An underwater(shockingly) research and drilling facility gets into some serious trouble and most of the crew are lost, the few survivors have to head out onto the ocean floor to try and save themselves and encounter some creatures who have the opposite idea for them! Now can you see the links to Alien and The Abyss?Kristen Stewart continues to build up her action resume as the heroine Norah and to be fair, she didn't annoy me for once and I can see her developing quite a nice niche in this genre. T.J Miller is annoying as Paul but ALL of his characters are meant to be, I do wonder if he can act without being annoying or if he is just the best annoying actor out there? Jessica Henwick as Emily shows why she is getting the bigger roles now and I'm looking forward to seeing her in Godzilla v Kong and Matrix 4 and Vincent Cassel is a great choice the Captain of the ship, rough and ready but with a heart.Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a great story, in fact I think it was a great idea which hasn't been executed brilliantly but it is okay. The cast work well together and the concept has enough about it to build up the tension, but it has one main problem(and I'm not talking about Kristen Stewart surprisingly), it is so dark that I could not tell what was going on most of the time when they were away from the facilities. The death scenes happened really quickly and it all got a bit confusing. I know filming underwater is going to have its difficulties but this got silly, I had no clue as to what was going to happen next, not because of suspense but because I couldn't see what had just happened!Now, if this was Alien or The Abyss, it would have justified a 19/20 but it's not and as good as the concept was and how well the cast interacted, it was let down by its execution and by being all foggy! A watchable 12/20."
358,"Going into this I was expecting a more slow paced sequence of events along the lines of The Abyss. The plot however exploded into gear right from the start. The very first scene. During Kristen Stewart's narration I thought my hopes of a slow burn would come true. I hoped it so much much that the incident seemed like a dream sequence. It wasn't, it just kept going.The movie isn't great, some of the action is shot and edited poorly making it confusing at times. The plot is predictable and trite. The emotional scenes are sappy and eye rolling. Despite all these things I didn't hate it. It didn't make me miserable. The atmosphere and visuals are very good. The scares are almost exclusively cheap jump scares.Certain aspects of the ending ALMOST made it all worth it. I wished they kept going with IT, but no they bungled that too.In conclusion. Not great not terrible. I applaud it for being mildly unique and for trying really hard. Existential horror underwater isn't easy."
359,"I like this adventurous movies. Deep breadthing movies. Hollywood here wins my heart again. Thanks🙏
Lomg lasting suspense & fear. Full of Dark, and dark creatures. Braveness and bold characters. I love these type of movies where there is a strong fight to live against die. ""Do or Die"" !!!
🌟🌟🌟🌟"
360,"As a creature feature this was very entertaining. The murky water and the close quarters and harrowing underwater escapes kept us Straining for what could happen next. Yes most of this has been done before and the characters are pretty one dimensional. But the atmosphere was terrific, and the sound incredible. One of the better surround features we have seen. There was always something going on around you. Very immersive. I have not seen a lot of Kristen Stewart but thought she was terrific."
361,"With potential flowing throughout, Underwater isn't sadly just a missed opportunity- but an incomplete and rather lazy film as well. I didn't mind the cast of this film, but felt angered that they had so little to work with. By far, the best actor in the film is Kristen Stewart, who totally puts her all into her performance- or at least as much as she can. The writing for the characters, and really in general, is so incredibly thin- it's as if they scrap noted an idea for each scene and decided to use it as the script. The film feels largely mechanical, as scenes tend to unfold in very predictable and formulaic measures. I did enjoy the look of the film, its underwater setting, and it's researching headquarters and suits provided- but something just felt like it was missing. A reason to care, maybe? A point, maybe? Largely I didn't care about what was going on in the film, and as it continued to go on, more and more scenes tended to feel rather abrupt and random- as if they had no idea what would come next as they were making it. The music in the film can be quite good, besides the horrible random Spongebob theme song cover, but all in all I did enjoy the score for what it was. It has moments of suspense, but nothing truly scare, or truly thrilling. If you are a huge fan of films like Alien than maybe I would recommend watching it, but most likely you would be disappointed. It does imitate it quite a bit, but I would put the film more similar in terms of Sony's 2017 flick Life instead. In the end, Underwater is a subtle and messy creature flick- with some to offer- but not much.
My Rating: 5.25/10"
362,Yes it's worth to watch this movie for once. Actors did fantastic job. Finally Some one made movie on deep ocean water monster. Some scenes of movie hold you tight. Good Visual Effects but Average Screenplay and Poor Direction.
363,Love the idea of this film! From the start the film failed to pull you in and grab your attention. This movie had so much potential but it ends just leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Very bland and just all around disappointment.
364,An undersea sci-fi horror drama going nowhere. Explosions galore leaving a few people to fight another day. Endless running around at the bottom of the ocean till they reach an escape area. All this takes 94 minutes but becomes a bore after some 50 minutes if you persist. You may get a fright once in this film but that's the only highlight.
365,"It's true that the story has many holes that they never solved. There're many plot bubbles. There's no character development, or anything interesting about it. However, I was still able to enjoy the enigma they produced even if it was something temporary, without complexity or comprehension. The director didn't make it easy, but I think you can still enjoy it."
366,I've seen some low ratings on this film but I feel it is a solid effort from the cast and director. Kristen Stewart gives a great performance and in my opinion proves yet again that she has a broad range. The story is light on details but that is because this is a tension driven monster movie. The claustrophobia is palpable from the very beginning. I love how the characters are put in extremely high pressure mental situations while also physically being under immense pressure from being almost seven miles down in a tin can on the bottom of the deepest place in the ocean. That juxtaposition keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The sets and CGI are very well done as well. A very fun film. I expect to see more good stuff coming from director William Eubank in the future.
367,"Not a bad way to pass 90 minutes, all pretty predictable b movie fair. Biggest issue for me, watching on the small screen, was that all action took place with shaky camera work in the dark."
368,"It's a good movie, I don't understand why it gets all the hate. It's not an horror movie at all, and I like it, since I'm not a fan of horror genre. It has a few jump scares."
369,"A lot better than most of the stuff out there this year.its a perfect mix between the Abyss, Alien and Dead Space the video game. Not sure what all the hatred from the people living in their moms basements, about Kristen Stewart I think she looks pretty hot and is a decent actress, given that she always has that awkward style of acting. Listen give it a go yea?Its worth your time."
370,I laughed when the protagonist's helmet was cracked by another girl but it could withstand the crushing force of a monstrous creature's jaw.
371,"I will not be comparing this film to others like Aliens. Aliens is by no means an original film. Its concept is likely inspired or copied from older films or literature. So saying such film copy another 'copy' from another film and so on and so forth is meaningless.This film could have been great if there were more character developments or a more wholesome script or direction. It felt like we were thrown into the midst of a long but typical escape-from-creature 'sequence' and that was all there is to it.The cast choices were quite poor. While Kirsten Stewart is somewhat suitable for a strong female protagonist role (with perhaps a degree of apathy), the lack of facial expressions (mainly fear) erases a lot of the urgency and tension from the scenes. But even so, I still find her overall acting quite decent in this film and it is not far fetched to say that she did carry some bits of this film to some degree (especially towards the end). But then again, it probably would have been better if the role was given to another actress.T.J. Miller on the other hand was totally unsuitable for this role, either him or how they dictate his character to be. You want to set the theme/mood towards a certain direction in order for the audiences to immerse in it. Adding a clown into the middle of a supposedly tense and horror film will not make it better.Best part of the film is undoubtedly the creatures themselves, the destruction, the suits and the environment so kudos to the VFX team. Though with most of the scenes being so dark we cannot marvel at all the digital assets produced.All in all, a slightly weak direction and cast choice hindered this film's potential. It is still a decent one or two time watch if you are into such a genre and cheap thrills."
372,"The theme was just like the other underwater thrillers, like meg, jaws and etc. An adventurous and surviving situation, had nothing so special, different or new. The ending was a little unexpected , not the whole ending though. By the way it was catchy and worth the time for the people who are following this kind of themes and genres."

Budget $50-80M; box office $41M.Summary/conclusion of my review (1): atrocious joke of a screenplay/script - it was very bad. I have never seen a screenplay/script as bad as this one. Another huge problem in this movie was the fact that it does not have an ""introduction"" phase like any other movie you can think of, and instead it randomly starts off with a poorly produced cinematographic/CGI scene, which is the scene that kicks off the movie's plot. Such scene felt like the scene you would expect to see around the 30-40-minute mark, and not at the seven-minute mark. Such a horrible start to a movie. No explanation is offered as to why such an event occurred and this is never discussed in the film at all.(2) The CGI and cinematography were actually ""pretty fine"" throughout the movie though, except for the very first one that kicked off the movie. Kirsten Stewart did a great job in my opinion despite a poor script and poorly made film, and she, the cinematography/CGI, and the ending are the only redeeming qualities of this film. The supporting cast was decent enough with Mamoudou Athie showing the second best acting (I mean he genuinely looked afraid). The ending was surprisingly satisfying and ""felt right"" - this part was probably the only piece of writing that was actually written properly.(3) Overall, is this movie worth watching? If you are a Kristen Stewart fan, then yes. If you are a horror fan, then probably yes but you HAVE TO remain patient. I mean, this movie does deliver over 30 minutes of some horror ""attempt"" which I will not fault. The CGI/cinematography and Kristen and the director stepped it up for the last 30+ minutes of ""horror"" and because of those 30+ minutes, the fine ending, and Kristen's slow-motion last final scene, I say this movie IS worth watching despite the worst screenplay/script ever, poor plot (was there even a plot?), and lack of an introduction. The first hour of the film probably deserves a 5/10, but the last 30 minutes probably deserve an 8. I liked the last 30+ minutes so I will bump up the movie's overall score to 8/10 too.Below are some other thoughts:The movie almost immediately jumps into action with zero explanation and it does not make any sense. Any other movie (e.g. Life (2017), Gravity (2013), The Abyss (1987), etc.), would have started out with introducing the characters and what life was like to be working in the vessel and somehow lead to the climactic moment. Instead this movie starts out with a very poorly made cinematographic climatic scene of some sort that felt totally fake? This decision most certainly is a reason why this movie did so poorly with the critics and the box office.Also, the robotic alarm voice in the background sounded all-too familiar and the volume and clarity did not make sense. The voice did not sound like it was coming from the ship, but instead it sounded as if the voice was added to the movie during editing. The same issue happens later when the robotic voice says ""oxygen level critical"" except that once again it sounded like it was added on top of the videos during editing instead of making it sound like it came from inside the suit. Sounded so fake. Surely I have heard that exact voice in previous movies - it sounded exactly the same. Could they not have come up with something more original and also actually have the voice sound like it was actually coming from the ship and suit?Screenplay/script problems: at the 11th minute, ""Are you a computer engineer or something?"" Since an introduction was completely skipped in this movie, the protagonist is introduced by having another character (actor Mamoudou Athie) ask her a question for the obvious purpose of introducing Kristen's character to the audience. I mean, how can the crew not know each other? Later when this character meets up with the rest of the crew, they do not even exchange a single word, acknowledge each other, or act as if they know each other. Nobody asks for his name either. And yet the rest of the crew seem to know each other and Kristen. Mamoudou's character seems completely out of place and very amateurishly put into the movie. Moreover, not once, do any of the characters ever ask in the movie, what happened?, as in, why is the ship suddenly so extensively damaged? This is common sense. Then they hear strange noises and nobody asks what those noises are or might be? At the 52nd minute two characters finally ask what is going on and I mean, it ""only"" took 52 minutes to ask what anyone with common sense would have asked at the first minute, but nothing comes out of those brief questions. Later when the BIG ""_____"" is introduced, the characters do not say anything at all or ask what it is or act shocked or terrified (the director failed here too to instruct the actors). Seriously? You just saw the most terrifying thing in the world that would make anybody ____ their pants, and you do not say one word or act terrified? This movie has the worst screenplay I have ever seen in a movie.The only good line in the script was ""Let's go put our lives in danger"" 31:56. Why could not we get a good script?Kristen Stewart - great work.
Mamoudou Athie - good acting.
Supporting cast - I thought they were decent.Conclusion: same as above.8/10"
374,It's actually not a bad movie. It's takes a little while for the tension to kick in but there certainly are some tense moments. Acting was good all around. Only down fall is some of the lines were kind of bad. A fun watch.
375,"I can't decide if this is a 6 or a 7. I'd go for 6.5. The acting is not horrendous, it's competent. Not great, not terrible. Just like the story. I liked the characters, well, maybe liked is a strong word. I didn't hate any of them, which is unusual for a film like this. If you like Leviathan, The Abyss, Alien, The Descent, Life or The Deep, you should find something here. It is generic, and you'll be able to guess who dies. And the females run around in their pants a bit. But I enjoyed it as a Sci Fi romp. This review is pretty poor but I honestly can't think of anything more fitting to say!"
376,Rented this while quarantined! Not very many new releases due to this pandemic so it was a lack of options selection. I already wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised it was far better than I was expecting. Probably Kristen Stewart's best film since Panic Room. I wouldn't exactly call this a horror film. More like a sci-fi suspence thriller. There were some plot holes and the people that should have died don't. Then they have story fillers at the end rolling with the credits explaining the outcome of the entire ordeal leaving it completely side open for a sequel with entirely new cast and characters except for maybe the few unknowns that survived. That was and is an irritating way to end a film.
377,"'Alien' underwater it isn't. It lacks the style of Alien and the tight direction.
Neither does it have the depth...no pun intended, of script to actual make you care about any of the characters."
378,"Not going to compare with Alien, Abyss, Cloverfield etc - everyone is doing that already, and just don't get why...
For sure it's popcorn time and just brain freeze to watch, but it's big fun ! And on some moments, I'd need that kind of brain freeze :-)
The soundmix is wonderful - sometimes even jawdropping on those implosions and surround atmosphere very, pinpoint accuracy, good! I'd just rewatch for that experience - pity we don't have a 4K release."
379,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I think movie deserves more merits than the critics are willing to give. It is a good HP Lovecraft movie. It has obvious inspirations from Alien but it is not an Alien rip-off.The likes:The atmosphere was claustrophobic and intenseThe performance of Kristen Stewart and Vincent Cassel was excellentThe production value, especially the armor/suit and the monster design was outstanding.The final act was a dream come true for HP Lovecraft fans like me.The dislike:
TJ Miller's character wasn't so great, his jokes were off beat and it didn't suit the atmosphere of the filmThings that can improve the movie: (WARNING! Spoiler begins)I wish they had added another 10 minutes to the movie, to explore the connection between the characters and Cthulhu better; for example, how (and why) the characters were acting weird and influenced by unseen forces outside of the rig disaster. And why did the captain have a picture of Cthulhu and the strange map in his locker, so on and so forth.A few more minutes to the ending to depict how, despite being the survivors, Emily and Smith were haunted by their encounter with Cthulhu in the deep sea, and so their mental fortitude never recover completely for the rest of their lives, knowing that Cthulhu might still be alive and sleeping in the deep corner of the earth, before reawakening one day, in the future."
380,A good film to see with your friends! I would recommend watching.
381,"This film start with a woman ""Norah"" brushing her teeth in a drilling facility, and the drilling facility suffering pressure breach scene! As turnout, this film is about Norah and her drilling crew need to survive from a bunch of aliens in the deepwater! Entire film full of overuse of the slow motion, and jump scare scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Norah constantly hit by an alien, and she eventually kill it with the flare gun! At the end, Norah sacrifice herself to save Emily and Smith by explode the drilling facility! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
382,"The worst movie I've seen this year.
No acting, no story, no logic."
383,"This movie was well worth the watch, it's like a 21st century 20,000 leagues under the sea thriller that will absolutely have your heart pounding & the thought of where it's taking place is completely unknown to us that deep in the ocean is horrifying but you can't look away due to the fact that the darkness doesn't give you a full picture of what's going on all the time but you definitely don't want to miss what your able to see at the times it's shown. It doesn't drag along or slow down at all, has really nice slow modes & camera work for sure & the biggest down side was that it wasn't longer because I wasn't ready for it to end. The unknown has always frightened & fascinated & that's what I got & I loved it. Well worth it & honestly will most likely watch again to show it to others & maybe catch what I might've missed the first time. Great job & I hope others enjoy it as much as I did"
384,Just want to say this movie was a great surprise to me nothing what I expected and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie nonestop action all the way through the movie !
385,"This is the first film to come from Disney's 20TH Century Fox Merger and in my personal opinion this definitely has a franchise possibility to it. First off let me say, this film has nothing original to it. But, what it does have is a amazing amalgamation of various horror and sci-fi films placed therein and it works! While watching this I noticed a variety of great films which were brilliantly homage'd (ie. ""GODZILLA""'s opening credits, The claustrophobia of ""ALIEN"", The dread of ""EVENT HORIZON"", and the creatures are definitely something out of ""THE DECENT"" and a H.P. Lovecraft story) all in a pitch black underwater setting.Speaking of Lovecraft, many who know his writings know that its readers have a word for the cosmic horrors. That word is ""Lovecraftian"", interesting enough the company in the film is called ""Tian Industries"". There is a quote where the IA in the film says ""Welcome to Tian Industries we have big things in store for you."" In many Lovecraft stories, there are Cults or Followers which purposely try to ""Awaken"" their gods and there is a slight hint of that in this film if you look closely enough.The drilling facility in the film they are on is called ""The Kepler"" and as I write this review in the news there is a The distant world, known as Kepler-88, which is the most massive in the star system, which contains two other planets, according to a study published in The Astronomical Journal. It orbits its star every four years in an elliptical, or egg-shaped, path.
According to ""Cultists"" there is always a moon cycle as well as an alignment of stars that lead to the ""Awakening of the Elder gods"".The film is like a gnarly roller coaster. It barely gives you a chance to get comfortable in your seat before it sends you into a explosive and intense opening sequence. From the 5 minute mark until the credits roll, this film is a nonstop anxiety driven monster.The acting is well done, the underwater cinematography is top notch. The pacing is breakneck fast and done perfectly and the writing is great especially since the writing team of Adam Cozad and Brian Duffield are still new to the film community. The director William Eubank is also new to the scene with only three films under his belt, I thought he did an amazing job bringing forth the intensity and bringing Lovecraft back to the big screen. Those who are ""Lovecraftian"" fans like myself will simply love the creature and visual effects in this underwater monster romp.The film has a great cast which includes Kristen Stewart who plays Norah. She has always been a ""wooden"" actress in most popular opinion, but then again so is George Clooney. In this film, I think she shows the best emotion and really shows her acting chops. I really enjoyed her performance, she is really good at playing stoic strong women and it shows.Vincent Cassel known for ""Le pacte des loups"", ""Irreversible"" & ""Black Swan"" plays Captain Lucien carries his charisma throughout in this film and he really helps the film's intensity.T.J. Miller known for being the comedic relief in most films, some of which are ""Ready Player One"" and the ""Deadpool"" films. TJ plays Paul Abel and his contribution to the film helps add levity to the anxiety driven scenes which are constant throughout the film.John Gallagher Jr., Jessica Henwick, and Mamoudou Athie also star in this underrated underwater horror film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and your anxiety through the roof.UNDERWATER comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray on May 6th. A 4K copy has yet to be announced as of yet."
386,"Is there other movies like it? Yes. But it is different enough in areas to actually keep you in. Cliches aren't in plethora like in many modern horror movies. Not trying to be too layered. In the end, you will probably find 10 bad reviews for every good one since movie snobs our a plethora out there. It it is a fun, entertaining movie that obviously takes stuff from different source material but doesn't take away"
387,"Working for an underwater drilling station, the crew finds themselves under attack by a mysterious series of accidents that have trapped them on the ocean floor miles underwater and must try to get to the lone possible escape method to get topside, only for an unforeseen creature to impede their plans.This one was quite enjoyable when it worked. Among it's better qualities is the overall fine setup at play that features some rather enjoyable setups which are rather fun at points. With the opening destruction of the various rooms and hallways in the station, the race to get to safety away from the crumbling walls and onrushing water serves this incredibly well with the chaotic nature of the situation immediately into the film to get it started on a frantic note. The ensuing chaos and unpredictable nature of what's going on with the station exploding and failing around them unexpectedly turns into a fine series of escape plans to get to a stable environment where they can regroup and get their bearings on what's happening, allowing this to turn into a rather fun survival thriller with the different obstacles they need to overcome to escape the station. Managing to become incredibly suspenseful and claustrophobic about their trip through the unknown conditions of the situation, this section of the film gets off to a fine start. The other enjoyable aspect featured here is the final half where they've survived and become aware of what's been stalking them throughout the compound. The first attacks with the strange creatures are rather enjoyable, featuring the survivors coming upon the creatures feeding on the remains of the deceased crewmember which is all the better with the strange lighting and bizarre look of the creatures. Later scenes including the attack on the group getting into the station or the ambush inside the lift as they get into the main tower of the crumbling facility come off rather nicely, featuring a nice use of the budgetary resources to generate some spectacle in the sequence. The big finale, featuring the last-ditch effort to get out of the doomed facility before it explodes and the creatures get inside, gets incredibly enjoyable as the slick and glossy visuals offer quite suspenseful moments within the frantic action as the cliffhanger involving the monster attacking them has a lot to like. Overall, these here keep the film up over its minor drawbacks. There are a few minor problems with this one. Among its main flaws is the fact that there are some rather unnecessary aspects to their escape route that don't need to be there. A detour into rescuing a potential survivor that's out of the way of their projected route when they're on a deadline to get out alive serves no purpose and results in no real surprises when they encounter unexpected obstacles that later affect their trip. Scenes of them going for food and special item retrieval missions that enable the creatures to attack aren't too surprising, and an attack where a guided recovery system allows the creatures to follow the crew comes off incredibly confusing not just in the on-screen action but how they managed to ignore that aspect of their trip. As well, some might find fault with some woefully unfunny comedic relief attempted here which seems highly unprofessional and completely at odds with the purpose behind the company's protocols who would've eliminated that kind of behavior and immaturity from their ranks. Otherwise, there isn't much to dislike here.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language."
388,"This was an enjoyable movie, with an okay story. Normally I would give to it 7 points, but because of the bad reviews, I'm gonna give it a 10. I liked Kirsten's acting in this and I usually find her acting just meh. The film's mood was unique. If you love Lovecraft, you should give it a try."
389,"I was skeptical at first,presumed it would be one of those generic sci fi movies with cliches and badly posed actors.
I was taken by surprise!! It was entertaining, it had the potential to prod against the big budget sci fi movies out there. ""Kristen Stewart was good in this one"" , i barely got any chance to make that statement in the entire life. Visuals were in the league of big budget productions, nothing groundbreaking though but they kept it to a level of their capacity, which was sufficient for me. I am comparing it with those overrated sci fi movies which got away with 7* or 8* for their marketing ability, not comparing it with the masterpieces."
390,Not much to say .I forgot it already.Oh the review is short
391,"The premise of this movie is so good that I love it since I first saw the trailer, especially with Kristen Stewart. But contradicting to my speculation, it slowly loses my interest throughout the journey: It does not have a decent screenplay. I wish the script would have more space for character development, such as Norad herself, the relationship between Norad and Captain; with other crew members. Furthermore, an explanation of the existence of those creatures and drill operation should have been a great addition. It (the subcontext) makes the plot stronger and more relatable. For me, the solid thriller film has to understand where to build up the tension and where to relieve it so that the audience can take a breath after a while. However, this movie has a constant action pace with shaky camera movement, those plain pseudoscience conversations and excessive scences without any meaning adding to the plot, makes it really hard to experience the whole thing. So much potential, unless a waste of time."
392,"I'll be brief, and there will be no spoilers. This is a really good movie. I'm not calling it a masterpiece, but it is good. It does not look or feel cheap or low-budget. The visuals are fantastic, the setting feels real. The claustrophobia will grip you. The actors and the roles they play feel like genuine, regular people. There are no heroes that lead the way, but heroic actions on the part of everyday workers caught in rapidly deteriorating and deadly situation.It's no secret there are creatures in this film. This movie is not trying to be Aliens, where the titular organism is as horrifying as it is fascinating. I would compare this more to Frank Darabont's The Mist, as it is less about an enemy being hunting down our human cast, and more about humanity unwittingly coming to brush against an alien ecosystem that, by nature (and not design) just happens to be incredibly deadly to us. Law of the jungle, baby.I'm picky about movies. Very picky. Especially when it comes to sci-fi. Underwater doesn't bring anything drastically new, no. But it does do established themes very well, and is the one thing it should be: ENTERTAINING."
393,"Imagine Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979) mashed up with James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" (1988), and you'll have a clue about what awaits you in ""Underwater,"" an energetic ""Deepwater Horizon"" (2016) disaster movie cross-bred with a harebrained, B-movie creature feature. Since ""Twilight"" actress Kristen Stewart wants to be taken seriously, she has close-cropped her hair, cavorts about in a sports bra, and wears nerdy glasses. After all Hell breaks loose, Stewart and a tiny group of survivors don huge Michelin Man diving suits. The escape pods have all malfunctioned, but the captain is sure a nearby facility has operational escape pods. However, they must tramp for mile or so across the ocean floor until they reach the other facility. Initially, ""Signal"" director William Eubanks looks like he was content with making a gripping disaster epic about a troubled corporate drilling platform boring the Mariana Trench, seven miles below the surface. An earthquake erupts, and everything goes sideways. Clocking in at 95 nerve-racking minutes, ""Underwater"" qualifies as a white-knuckled exercise in suspense which may make you feel like you're trapped in that ""Star Wars"" trash compactor in ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Anybody who suffers from bouts of claustrophobia should prepare themselves for some tight spots. ""Underwater"" doesn't let you to get comfortably seated before the bottom falls out. For the first half-hour, this tense, atmospheric opus will make you cringe because the only way to escape imminent death is to wriggle around one heap of wreckage after another and hope fate doesn't serve you up as hors d'oeuvres. About 45 minutes later, it dawns on our survivors that they may have something else to worry about than the next subterranean tremor. Indeed, somewhere out there on the gloomy ocean floor lurks a new aquatic lifeform like no other that feasts on human flesh as if it were a delicacy. ""Underwater"" qualifies as the kind of 'no holds barred' thriller that gives neither its characters nor the audience an easy way out of its death-defying quandary. Moreover, Eubanks and scenarists Brian Duffield of ""Insurgent"" and Adam Cozad of ""Legend of Tarzan"" maintain a sense of balance between the disaster plot and the monster plot until the last quarter-hour when those scary lifeforms awaken from a nap and ring the dinner bell. Sadly, the CGI is not up standards, and the monsters amount to hokum.
Norah (Kristen Stewart) serves as a mechanical engineer for Tian Industries aboard the deepest undersea drilling rig in the world. No sooner has she awakened than one disaster follows another in rapid succession. One hull breach after another has her scrambling to keep from being fish food as water swamps the facility with explosive menace. Initially, everybody believes an earthquake is the culprit, and only a handful of personnel have survived the tragedy. Along with Norah are the Captain (Vincent Cassel of ""Ocean's Twelve""), Emily (Jessica Henwick of ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens""), Paul (T.J. Miller of ""Deadpool""), Smith (John Gallagher Jr. of ""Jonah Hex""), and Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie of ""The Circle""). You don't have to be a genius to figure out as the story unfolds, some of them will fall prey to either the treacherous deep-sea or the ghastly but ghostly monsters that assemble by the hundreds. Our heroes and heroines encounter one setback after another, and they aren't sure what to think when they lay eyes on these amorphous monsters. Eubanks and his writers do a good job of painting the survivors into a corner. As their resident comedian, Paul takes it upon himself to provide the comic relief from all doom and gloom. Initially, his sarcastic banter provides some chuckles. Gradually, as our heroes and heroines find themselves getting deeper and deeper into the unknown, Paul's humor wears out his welcome. T.J. Miller's sarcasm did wonders for the ""Deadpool"" superhero yarns. After a while, you just want the aliens to gorge themselves on his carcass. Inevitably, the monsters single out Norah as their prey. The last thing you want to do when you are in the presence of these monsters is to blind them with your helmet headlights. This agitates them, and they will attack. Norah comes prepared for just such an eventuality. She has appropriated a clumsy flare pistol. Suffice to say, when one of these slimy looking haunts tangles with her, Norah lets it have it with the flare pistol. Happily, she survives this encounter, but others aren't so fortunate.
The problem with ""Underwater"" is it aims no higher than a waterlogged ""Alien,"" despite the fact Eubanks stages several tour-de-force scenes that have nothing to do with alien infestation. Watching these technicians struggle against deadlines to avert the next breach which threatens to drown them all is what keeps ""Underwater"" captivating during its first hour. The adrenalin rush that comes from this constant threat of death when you least expect it provides the movie with a sense of rhythm. Little by little, Eubanks and his writers work the monsters inconspicuously into the storyline. Unfortunately, our heroes and heroine have no ideas how lethal these aquatic adversaries are. Similarly, we the audiences are just as clueless. The evil corporation in the ""Alien"" movies had an android character among the survivors who could spout data about any threat. No such character inhabits ""Underwater,"" but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that something corporate stinks.
Ultimately, what sinks all the pent-up tension that Eubanks has drummed up in ""Underwater"" is the sight of the mother monster which has populated the rig with hundreds of its spawn. Basically, this creature resembles a crepe paper dragon that you might witness at a Chinatown parade. Despite this hokum, ""Underwater"" never takes a break from the action. Just when the survivors think that they have it made, more terrifying things happen. Sadly, ""Underwater"" might have been more compelling had the filmmakers confined themselves to the disaster plot rather than piggyback a monster invasion on it."
394,"Its nice once in a while to go in to watch a film just for some good popcorn fun / entertainment ! Its January, which is notorious for being a dumbing ground for film studios to put out the films they have absolutely no faith in whatsoever to be good. Now and then very rarely you do get a decent film in the month, I'm glad to say that ""Underwater"" surprised me a bit and ultimately deliver what I wanted. A simple/basic story, some interesting characters you can get behind, some nice CGI and maybe some nice scares/suspense along the way.So with that in mind I went in completely cold, didn't watch a trailer for the film....I hadn't even read the synopsis of the film. Maybe that affected my viewing of the film..........I had NO expectations !Its just all round good fun! Simple story, an underwater mining facility is mysteriously breaking apart/ being destroyed.........the group of survivors inside have to figure a way to get to safety and to the surface ! Bang ! Simple enough for anyone to follow, check ! Next some interesting characters to follow, you've the stereotype of everyone in this film. Kristen Stewart, the smart, brainy, quite one which the film centres around. Vincent Cassel, the leader of the base, old and wise. TJ Miller the comic relief, obviously ! Jessica Henwick, the doctor, I think ?? Who is terrified and screaming all the time and lastly John Gallagher Jr, the chilled pilot sort of guy!!! They are all stereotypes but they all do their job in this film very well, there is a good team dynamic throughout !! Great CGI of the base braking apart and the suits they walk in, also nice design of the creatures !! Lastly some decent scares...........and some really nice suspense driven scenes ( Well pretty much the last half of the film is pretty near the edge of your seat..........its not that good enough to be on the very edge of your seat, but close )Cliche deaths,Yes !(Surprisingly Gory) Cliche Ending, definitely Yes ! Do I care, No ! Not every film has to be overly complex, long, overbearing, emotionally driven and sad/depressing. You can just to watch a standard science fiction film and enjoy the ride, everything about and in this film is absolutely fine......its not going to change the world and it doesn't have to.Overall its 65% out of 100 its a decent/ ok film.............I wasn't expecting much or anything and actually enjoyed the experience..........Good directing, acting , script and definitely runtime !!! Oh what a great idea of making it 1 hour 30 mins.........the film gets you up to speed with whats going on quickly and it never really stops after that..........the film flies by. I'd recommend it, if you've never seen it or if you've got nothing else to watch............its decent all round !!!!"
395,"My Rating:
6.5/10
A January movie, the dumping ground of Hollywood studios each and every year where at times there are a few surprises here and there but for the most part, it's usually just trash. Underwater is by far from a January movie, I went into the theater with no expectations whatsoever and to my surprise, this movie delivers on various notes and is surprisingly incredibly entertaining.
Well, the plot is simple, you have seen it a hundred times with movies such as Aliens and even the Meg in terms of the underwater sea creature element which was honestly a fairly enjoyable but all in all a pretty bland movie. But yes, the movie wastes no time with character building and cuts to the chase thus, I would say that this movie is entirely carried by the atmosphere created and also the acting. It is definitely not a story driven movie nor is it one with much character building moments.
Previously as I believe many of us have, the only movie I have seen Kristen Stewart act in was in the Twilight series; yes, THAT series and yes, I have heard from others that she was actually a good actor with her taking part in various indie films which aren't shown in Malaysia. So, I must really praise her acting here, it is nothing iconic whatsoever but her ability to communicate the sense of fear and dread that she is feeling whilst crossing the ocean's floor is truly mesmerizing in a weird sense, and this is also due to the director, William Eubank as I believe, the acting was above par for a movie such as this., so all credits to him for getting the best out of the actors with what they were given to work with.
Given the estimated budget of this movie ranging from 50-80 million USD budget, and where this movie is intended to take place, a thousand leagues under the sea, they did an incredible job with the budget given. The CGI is fairly serviceable and believable, and this is mainly due to the fact that the entire movie takes place at such low lighting depths where the SFX team were able to hide the CGI in the darkness. There are indeed certain scenes where you could notice the obvious CGI which is the walk on the sea bed where there is the whole floating heads issue whilst they are in their suit. Kind of the issue certain individuals had when the Iron Man suits became more dependent on CGI rather than actual costumes.
There's nothing much to talk about for this movie, it is a fun one where certain scenes will leave you at the edge of your seat. with a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes, this is a pretty good movie and I would recommend this movie for those whom want to fill that 'I want to watch a good January movie' void that they have going on."
396,"This movie rocked with not stop thrills and action, this movie is like Alien, but in the ocean. Kristen Stewart is the new Sigourney Weaver of this generation, this is a must see movie."
397,I like the trailer but I didn't put high expectation for this. But this movie has given a solid horror and dark side of the deep water. Kristen is a badass here. Not a perfect horror movie yet it delivers a new way to put you there sitting uneasy. You will leave the cinema with big question. Is that even possible to have that kind of creature under the sea?
398,"Given that 20th Century Fox is now owned by Disney, I didn't think that an unreasonable assumption to make. But, I wasn't disappointed to discover I was wrong. The character, Nora, is actually played by Kristen Stewart, who is no stranger to what my father would call ""weirdo roles."" As anyone else who's followed her career from her film debut in THE CRAFT through the TV series THE MENTALIST can vouch for!That's the first pro. The first con is that she's the only recognizably big name in the cast. The rest of them, I've never head of.The second pro is that this movie has one genuinely startling moment that made me literally jump in my seat. And other moments that merely made me cover my eyes in suspenseful anticipation. The second con is that I've seen those types of moments before. In ALIENS, DEEPSTAR SIX, and any recent remake of KING KONG or GODZILLA you care to name.In short? The movie is an enjoyable time-killer. But, there's a reason the trailers for it have been few and far between. Most fans of this type of eco-horror/sci-fi/disaster flick will have seen this type of action already and probably dismiss it as not worth their hard-earned money.But, I have no _major_ complaints with it. So, to the minority of fans of this type of movie who don't mind slightly recycled plot themes? Go see it with a clear conscience."
399,This one is one absolute hell of a ride.. A must watch...!!
400,"Underwater puts you in the character's shoes, shoes that you wish you had never put on. Kristen Steward puts on a mesmerizing performance making you forget she was even in the Twilight films."
401,"Though there are some newbies behind this movie, it does do some things well: good special effects and production values. However, two big problems bring it down.First, except for TJ Miller's comedic character, the characters aren't interesting enough to care about. Except for good jump scares, it's hard to care for any of the characters.Second, there's not enough context or background information about what's happening to intellectually follow the plot changes. It's easy to understand scenes where they're alone and may be attacked -- but not intelligently follow what's happening at a bigger story level ... except in retrospect.This movie may work well for younger audiences (which is where I think some of the high reviews are coming from), but if you're seeking intellectual satisfaction, this is not the right movie to see."
402,"If you've seen the underwater alien films of 89
Like the Abyss, Leviathan and Deepstar six. I would consider this a modern take on those. But unlike those three which had polish, actual effects, chemistry with the cast and good directing
This is just another Hollywood assembly line film.
I couldn't SEE anything half the time. Color scheme underwater is black and dark green. Sure it's I guess realistic, but how about a little brightness. If you can't see what's going on, it's a problem.
The movie tries hard to be different by starting off the disaster within the first few minutes. A bold move, yet completely hinders it all the way through. You get 5 percent character development at best. I think it's one to two lines of expository dialogue per person.
Cast is fine, it's just the script that's bad
Everyone plays with what they have, not much.
Jump scares are present throughout. Once again these are repetitive and annoying. Loud sounds do not equal scary.
Huge opportunity with the underwater creatures to be scary and suspenseful. Instead we just get BOO all the time.I'll give it some credit. Monsters were cool within reason. Yet I can't help but think we've seen the design before. And there are a few claustrophobic moments that will certainly get under some people's skin.
Ending was cheesy and by the time we get to the big baddie, it's completely overdone and anticlimactic. The film feels like an hour an a half with the opening sequence of 15/20 min deleted.
A little build up to the rig imploding with some character introduction would've helped this a bit more.
It's not even dumb fun, it's just uninteresting
Also dear TJ Miller, you're a one not actor and extremely annoying. Glad you were sucked out through your suit in that scene. Ugh go away man.Avoid unless you feel like wasting time"
403,"One of those films that is shot so dark that they obviously haven't spent any money on the set........I could not see anything......moody atmospheric.....no just cheap and dark..No characters of note, no story .......nothingWe look for anything over 5/10 to at least make it pass some of the many hours pass during our extended time at home, this is where we draw the line of Passable, anything below this we would not recommend as it would be better to paint a wall then watch it dry."
404,"Acting is high school level.
i dont think this feature had a director.
the camera work was shockingly bad!
but thats the tip of this very below average iceberg!
this is a long drawn out bore, specialist crew on an underwater plant if you will, electrical malfunctions and damage from an outside predator left the station in a state of disrepair, so the story begins, well it didnt really begin , nor did it end, the staff went out in space suits then back in , then out, then ..... oh dont bother with this!"
405,"Ughh, we were excited to see this because we like deep blue sea the abyss etc movies of that genre, but this was cheesy dumb with bad acting. Watch it when it's free and you need a nap."
406,"First of all, the positive reviews here have been bought and paid for. Or they are all written by the cast and crew under pseudonyms. There are not enough words in the English language to adequately describe the putridness of this movie.The plot summary is this: a group of unattractive, unlikeable, unappealing environmental criminals slosh around unintelligibly in complete darkness for an hour and a half, until the credits mercifully roll and the torture is at an end."
407,"""Underwater"" is a sort of reimagining ""Alien"" in the titled environment, an oil rig, to be exact. A few on-screen texts help you navigate the underwater maze, complete with depth and name (mid-point station, abandoned experiment site etc).To me, Stewart's new image is particularly striking as I have just watched her recent ""Charlie's Angels"". With her hair cropped short in both, the contrast cannot be more pronounced, chic in ""Angels"" while unisex in this movie, matching the persona of her role.While there is nothing new, commendable is its no-nonsense style with the smart, less-than-100-minutes duration. Entirely without any preliminaries other than a brief scene of Norah (Kristen Stewart) at her morning routine of brushing teeth etc, all hell breaks loose. Deep sea water from cracks burst into the claustrophobic underwater quarters of the oil rig.What follows is something quite predictable. Six survivors try to find rescue, walking in space suit look alike underwater. There is the usual suspense of who dies and to gets rescued in the end. The hideous monster is not really different from the dozens (maybe literally) you have seen before. The heroic act of self-sacrifice is just about mandatory. While the whole thing is competently executed, the end product is quite unremarkable.Two other members of the cast I would particularly like to mention. For those who have just been following ""Westworld"" Season 3 to its conclusion, there is Vincent Cassel who, rather than a villain, is a good guy here. For those who, like myself, have been compiling a list of ""life after Game of Thrones"" actors, you can add Jessica Henwick who is Nymeria Sand, the middle of the Sand sisters."
408,Proper creepy. Loved it. It could have been a little better but it was pretty good nonetheless
409,"Lots of people say it didn't explain anything. It actually explained almost everything. Only thing I didn't hear was why Paul was carrying around a stuffed animal but does it really matter?! Kristen Stewart was amazing in this. I really appreciated how they mostly captured the underwater reality. Great monster flick! Reminded me of Cloverfield, just under water."
410,His movie is great from start to finish it is just survival and any one is fair game.
411,"Glad I didn't listen to all of these people leaving bad reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Yes, it did grab some ideas here and there from other movies. But, if you want to go that route, then no movie out there is original anymore.
Some other big budget movies have had worse story telling, acting and CGI.
My takeaway is, if you like sci-fi and enjoyed movies like Alien or The Abyss, then give this movie a shot. You definitely won't regret it.
Really wish people could leave some positive things in their reviews instead of bashing the movie and pointing out everything they didn't like about it.Again....Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it."
412,Disappointed...Trailer created hype....but movie is totally failed to fulfill the hype...
413,ZERO character development. Terrible acting (which was expected). But a complete and total rip-off of Cloverfield....under water.
414,"We all know that from the titles we can understand how good or bad a movie is yes? Well, if you are able to get over the titles you'll come across an underwater station with a tiled bathroom. A TILED BATHROOM, YES! And if this was not enough for you to try to understand HOW THE HELL they keep writing stuff like this and mostly finance it, you'll get awful acting, bad editing, jump scares which are not scary and the most obvious plot.
Do not watch this."
415,"I saw a fish.... he stole the show.
At least there wasn't pretty vampires.
Have a nice day😀"
416,"They have a suit that can withstand 6 MILES OF WATER PRESSURE. I REPEAT. 6 MILES OF.... ok seriously though, there's little to no reality here. It's a nice premise, but horribly executed. Uninteresting characters, no plot, blah blah,blah..... DIE HOLLYWOOD DIE!!!!!!!"
417,"I'm guessing most of people on here hate this movie cause it has Kristen Stewart in it.
But let me tell you. You have monsters, Chutulu looking thing, TJ Miller punchlines and Kristen saving peoples asses, 4 of my favorite things. It's not super original, but it's 1,5h of entertainment. Jump scares, difficult choices and smart conversations. Just go with it."
418,The movie is mediocre. It has 0 character development like most movies nowadays. It has a lackluster story and the horror is ok.
419,It's like watching paint dry. Kirsten stuart fans who want to see her running around in her underwear alot may like it but I cant see what else there is for anyone really
420,I'm starting to think Kristen Stewart doing bad movies on purpose I mean back-to-back horrible movies I don't want to believe she's a bad actress because I love the Twilight Saga but this is getting out of hand I just couldn't get into at all I mean why this is one of them movies you feel bad not because its bad but you had hope it would be good and turn out mind blowing bad its like a bad version of the first alien movie.
421,"Aside from a little lazy acting and what I felt was pretty poor lighting, this movie wasn't so bad. I couldn't fully get into it but I do like the underwater aspect of it. It hasn't been done well in quite a while and I like deep sea creature movies because of the real lack of knowledge about the ocean. That being said, I think it is a good enough movie to look at as a one time watch for a movie night or something."
422,"It has Kristen Stewart's standard sour slapped fish face. Appropriate for once as it's a disaster movie.Started off quite good, but then got a little tedious and rushed.Am I the only one that often wants the monsters to win?
Unfortunately the movie follows the tried and tested format of humans successfully killing everything.Nothing wrong with standard, but if you're gonna do standard, it has to be bloody good.This was just meh..."
423,"I couldn't understand 90% of the dialogue in this film. I generally don't mind Kristen Stewart but in virtually every line she was either mumbling, stuttering or chaining her words together doublespeed. Fortunately the dialogue was so uninteresting it really didn't matter. I have a feeling the producers were counting on a scantily clad Stewart being a big draw card for male viewers but I doubt that's the case.Usually films like this spend a good 20 to 30 minutes setting up the characters and environment so you have some grounding and familiarity before the action starts. This film spend about 2 minutes before the action starts and you spend the rest of the film wondering if you missed the bit where you are meant to know who these people are. Stewarts character is a bit of a Mary Sue as well and just isn't believeable as the mechanical engineer action hero who seems to be the only competent person there. The are attempts to insert some humor and sentiment to help connect with the characters but you really don't care about them. In fact I spent most of the time hurrying them along so the movie would end. There are several scenes towards the end where people need to be running to save themselves and the characters literally just stand there doing nothing. The pod that can clearly fit two people in it is a bit of confounding too. In the end though none of it really matters because the film is complete trash."
424,"I was surprised to enjoy this as much as I did, after reading all the poor reviews. It was fun, full of thrills and really beautiful to look at. Maybe it's no Oscar winner but it kept my attention from beginning to end. The score was excellent as well."
425,"A(n) (almost) two hour waste of time.
Ruined my typical quarantine night :("
426,"Great movie. If you were a fan of the Alien movies with signoury Weaver. This movie is had great similiarities to it, only the surroundings are not in space but down in the sea. It is not as great as the Alien franchise, but still trilling good to watch the outcome of this movie. Suprising good avond my expactation till the end."
427,"Decent cast. Interesting premise. The list of good things about Underwater stops here.The screenplay is terrible and whoever made this was content to simply mash up dozens of movie tropes and even go as far as copying a few scenes from other horror sci-fi movies. It's all been done before with better screenplays where actions only supports the story.There is zero character development. We jump right into a race to survive with little to no reason for it. The movie is entirely shot with a shaky cam style, using abundant darkness and blur to hide poor special effects.Stewart can't act and the director though he could make up for by showing her in underwear for half the movie. Cassel should know better, even him can't save this farce."
428,"Underwater is decently executed with some good visual effects. The near-future underwater mining facility is interesting and it reminds me of the Bioshock, SOMA, and Subnautica video games.The film's biggest weakness is the generic monster plot, which could have easily fit into the Cloverfield films. I almost wonder if it was originally in that series, but they disconnected from that following the lukewarm reception of Cloverfield Paradox.Whatever the case, I wish it had just kept the cause of the disaster unknown. It is a decent near-future underwater survival film and I think alien-like predator detracts from that with cliche moments. I would have liked to see more worldbuilding instead.Nevertheless, I thought it was good and I'd recommend it if you like sci-fi horror. It is only an hour and a half long, so it isn't a huge time investment."
429,"What I dislike the most is the story line. Just out of nothing where of. Some nice underwater scene, and cool monsters. But nothing really big happening. At the end you thing. Why, how, what. A bit a waste of time. Again"
430,"Kristen Stewart as an aquatic researcher. Yeah, right. All you need to know to stay away from this mess."
431,In general i'm not a great Kristen Stewart fan but this was a good performance. film moves along a a fast pace and you really get a claustrophobic feel for being trapped underwater. definitely recommend.
432,"In Underwater William Eubank directs a life with artificial light and the clock the only way to tell night from day. Kristen Stewart is an engineer, Norah, but let's call her Ripley for now, lost in her own thoughts, but shaken into reality when a catastrophic underwater earthquake hits the drilling station she is on board. Barely making it out alive with Mamoudou Athie's Rodrigo, they are forced to close off their wing to save the rest of the platform, and make a claustrophobic attempt to escape across the debris, picking up TJ Miller's rubble covered Paul on the way. Hundreds were on board, some managed to escape via pod subs, but now only six are left alive. With seemingly no way out.7 miles down in the Mariana Trench with no communications, Vincent Cassel, the Captain of the rig stayed behind after those who could leave left, and assesses the best chance for the six is to walk across the seabed to another part of the site, where there might be other pods. A one mile walk. Let's hope their helmets survive the pressure underwater.William Eubank doesn't allow time for second thoughts with everything moving so fast in Underwater. The beginning showed newspaper headlines and I missed some of them so I wasn't sure if they were describing pre-film events or after. I guessed after, as they continued in the end credits. But again so fast.But time is indeed of the essence in Underwater, with John Gallagher Jr's Smith, and the aforementioned Paul, adding light relief to the watery greyness. I thought TJ Miller's stream of novel puns was fun, and who on board drew the sea monsters on the walls I wondered. Pretty accurate actually! Bizarrely with the team suited up for their underwater walk there's no room for pants girls. Not in those one size fits all mega suits anyway, as Kristen and Jessica Henwick's Emily both strip down to their undies.But that is the least of their problems as after spotting a distress call from a previously released pod, Smith and Paul go for a deep see walk to investigate. And in the murky half light of what just happened, they manage to bring aboard a big pink prawn like creature that just happened to be eating, I think, an unfortunate crew member. Now dead but he's not alone. You can hear others banging the outside of the station. Did they happen to bring a baby onboard they wonder. One that has teeth. Ominous music by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts. Walking a mile in their shoes is going to be a nightmare.I want to say that out there is a colony of mermaids and mermen released from the depths by the drilling company, but I don't think there are any singing Ariels. The filming took place from inside the helmets so we see what they see, the distance no more than a few feet. Although the usual horror rules didn't apply either as the sediment was so thick you could barely make out what was just about to grab you. Until it was too late. Still keeping the fear factor up though.Underwater is a disaster/horror/'ecological' movie that skips by in a deep breath of 95 minutes or so. Cinematography by Bojan Bazelli became clear when you realise the horror of the big prawns matched the tension of the deep. The aliens just added the extra, extra-terrestrial dimension of the need for speed. And walking underwater is slow. Maybe in space no one could hear you scream but here we are way out of our depth. And know so little about what is down there. What have we released in our need to exploit the earth's resources? Although the teeth are just as big as those other Alien Space beings. And as one of the big prawns was going for an even bigger mouthful, well thank god for the, I guess, stick of dynamite or similar. But that isn't the big bang, no there's something much bigger waiting in the wings.Even as the film was highlighting the potential dangers of drilling too deeply, it wasn't preachy and that usually kills a film for me. Such as Disney's Tomorrowland and Downsizing. So a lot of bang for your buck with a movie that gets straight to the action and keeps the menace high. Even for the future, as I think there was a headline in the credits about Iran continuing the research? Maybe that was the screenwriting wags? The details of the disaster obviously being kept top secret - there be monsters."
433,"From the moment it starts, it's complete suspense and intensity below sea, it's Alien meets Poseidon!Great action, decent plot and always leaving you feel claustrophobic, a good popcorn movie, far from brilliant but a mixture of action & suspense make it a great watch!"
434,"As I was watching 'Underwater' I was thinking to myself that it was very strange that T.J. Miller was in the film, because I was sure that Hollywood had blacklisted him after his controversy. It wasn't until afterwards when I read that it had been filmed way back in 2017 that it made sense. Typically January is known as a month where the worst of the worst films get released. I don't think it would be fair to put 'Underwater' in that category though. It's far from perfect admittedly, but it does have its moments.This is an extremely dark film. Not dark in terms of tone, dark in terms of lighting. Now that might be considered fair when you factor in that the film is entirely set at the bottom of ocean, but it doesn't change the fact that it can make it difficult to watch at times. Combine that with the tight and claustrophobic way the film is shot and this can be a very laborious movie to follow. It's hard to get your bearing on exactly where everything is in relation to everything else a lot of the time. Then finally add in the fact that a lot of characters lines are quite hard to pick up, partly because of the suits the characters wear and partly because of mumbled delivery and accents on the actor's parts, and you have yourself a film that isn't the easiest to watch.The strength of the film lies in the suspense it is able to build. There are some very well crafted scenes in that respect. Also the pacing is lightning quick. After a quick opening credit sequence the film immediately kicks into the action and almost never relents. I wanted to like the creature side of things more, and I would say I didn't hate them, but they did feel slightly forced and out of place. It felt too much like the film was trying to be 'Alien', just ""underwater"", so to speak. This isn't must-see material but there is enough to keep you interested and entertained if you do decide to give it a shot."
435,"January guilty pleasure? Sure. But is Underwater a film that almost certainly will be forgotten in a few months time? Certainly. A promising start is ruined by an overly produced/directed/written thriller that can only be described as merely 'meh'. For a much better underwater thrill ride, see 47 Meters Down. That movie knows what it is and never tries to be much more. There was something here before things became drowned with CGI monsters and crappy dialogue.5.8/10"
436,"I was so hesitant of this movie. But it rocks. It rocks hard. For a PG-13 horror movie, there's quite a bit of gory scenes. So I loved that. The monster designs were amazing, especially the massive Kaiju at the very end. The way it builds suspense is unbelievably fantastic.Give it a watch."
437,"I came out pretty happy about seeing this film. It moves fast enough that you don't dwell on the plot contrivances and inconsistencies. I was rightfully worried that Mamoudou Athie would play the same cringy character from Cake's ""Oh Jerome, No"" but luckily he isn't on screen for long. Kristen Stewart was great, though the pontificating voice-overs at the beginning and end seemed silly and superfluous. Vincent Cassell nailed the captain role, and TJ Miller provided the perfect amount of comic relief. The big bad is awesome, I just wish it had more screen time! The film was too short, I think it could have been expanded to make room for more character development and investigation. I could easily have watched 20-30 minutes more."
438,"Underwater is a 2020 horror creature feature directed by William Eubank, written by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad starring Kristen Stewart. The plot is pretty simple, it follows a group of aquatic researchers in an Underwater drilling facility after an earthquake destroys most of the facility; not only do they have to escape the crumbling underwater station, they also face Cthulhu inspired sea monsters in the depths of the ocean. The film is very well paced, moving from scene to scene very quick, but not too quick as you are given time to absorb the environment of the research station. Although I really liked the look of the facility, I would've appreciated some backstory to the propaganda like posters you see on the walls, and maybe a look at the day to day life in the facility for the people who work there. The film jumps right into the earthquake in the first 5 minutes and I think it would have been more effective if the viewer was given time to soak in the world and the characters that inhabit it because it had interesting potential. Another detriment to the film is the extremely shallow characters that are difficult to care about. Kristen Stewart's character Norah is the most fleshed out of the 6 as she is established to be a loner character who has lost people in the past and is the only character with any real arc at the end. TJ Miller's characters teeters on annoying to kind of funny, the captain played by Vincent Cassel is boring and cliché, and the rest are stock and derivative of the genre. There are many echoes of films like Alien and even some video games like Dead Space and Bioshock, which range from uncreative similarities to clever inspiration. As much as I've been dogging on this film, I was still very entertained throughout and the design of the monsters was scary and interesting which isn't too common now. They didn't show the monsters too much which I really liked; the fear of the unknown is scarier than some CGI monsters flying around the whole time and I'm glad the film didn't blow its load in the first act. Overall, Underwater is ironically shallow while being intense, fun, and effective as it moves quick making you feel claustrophobic throughout with a good performance by Stewart, I just wish there was some more downtime before the earthquake started to get to know these characters that were so boringly written."
439,No need to add anymore to short no real story. No real character build. Fairly boring. In no way a horror. Avoid.
440,"First of all they never explain why these people are underwater. You don't know what their actual job is. Drill for what and for what reason? The beginning credits show articles that kinda tell you stuff but they flash by so fast you can't read it properly. It literally starts out with chaos, no character building, no back story, no reasons or explanations just boom Underwater rig is leaking. You don't care about the characters because you haven't learned anything about them or what they are doing.
I didn't have high expectations but I hoped it would be entertaining. Maybe like The Abyss, which I loved. Well it wasn't entertaining it was just dumb. The mystery of the creatures in the water that appeared to be hunting them was ok right up until you saw the creatures then it was like wtf is that, looks like a mutated human at the bottom of the ocean. Ridiculous! Just when you think how much worse can it get , low and behold there is a giant version of the creature that looks even stupider than the small ones.
Bad acting, no real story line, cheesy ass sea monsters, just a none entertaining pointless mess."
441,Underwater is visually appealing with really nice set & sound design and competent cinematography. Stewart & Cassel are both really good but both seem handcuffed my a poorly written script with an uneven tone. T.J. Miller is a very funny guy and I generally like him but this film could have really done without the comic relief. The other 2 members of the survival group are very forgettable. I would have liked to have seen a more straightforward adventure with Stewart & Cassel.The creatures were ok but I think they could have gone with more of a slow burn or psychological terror approach. It is implied in the credits exposition that living in deep pressure causes unpredictable side effects. There is a scene quite deep in the film that played with this a little bit but it never came to fruition.Overall this film reminds me of The Abyss mixed with Godzilla: King of Monsters and doesn't quite hit the mark for me because it is more of the latter than the former. Final note: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE someone cast Kristen Stewart as Amanda Ripley in a screen adaptation of Alien: Isolation.
442,"First off, I can see why someone would say that this is like LIFE, but I feel that is kind of selling this film short.
Second, I'm not sure if people know this but it's really really dark underwater, if you've been in a cave system before than they turn off the lights you CAN NOT SEE, now imagine you are also surrounded by water that is constantly filled with silt from the ground, poop, pee, and tiny little bits of dead things all constantly floating around you all the time. It's supposed to be hard to see, that's why this isn't Leviathan (another movie I love) with OBVIOUS sets where balloons holding boxes dangle from OBVIOUS strings which is great entertainment but hasn't aged very well with HD resolutions.This movie is a lot like Gravity in tone(?) and maybe pacing, I get that sense that it's possible for the main characters to survive IF they keep calm and professional and get themselves where they need to be. We still have the distinct actors that we know from other things but unlike in Gravity where most people seemed to find it super distracting with Bullock all by herself they don't have JUST Kristen Stewart carrying the entire second half of the movie by herself, and when she is carrying it she does a great job. B-BUT SHE WAS IN TWILIGHT! you say, so were a lot of people who are normally great actors, NO ONE DOES A GOOD ACTING JOB IN TWILIGHT, so just move on and forget about it, it can't hurt you anymore.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT JUST IN CASE~!People are apparently complaining about a heavy handed environmental message in this film, wut? Like they had 2 characters say stuff like ""We shouldn't be down here"" ""What we're doing isn't right"" or something along those lines, literally 2 lines immediately followed up with a ""We dug too deep"" line that pretty much sealed the deal for me on why I enjoyed this film, it was a what if not a It could happen! Mines Of Moria scenario not CHUD, so if you were worried about that don't be, it's just people freaking out and exposing their fears is all. Same with the whole ""This feels like a you go girl film"", like wut!? OMG don't watch a movie like Aliens or Fury Road, I'm sorry if a woman being competent at her job (you know the thing the company she works for put her down there to do) if a feminist propaganda thing to you.My biggest complaint is that almost all the monster stuff was CGI, like 90% + think. I would have enjoyed a few of the main creatures to have some like practical limbs or a creepy head puppet or something in one or two scenes but it wasn't a deal breaker or anything. Second biggest complaint is that 2 characters are in a relationship but you don't really get any sense of bonding out of them for most of the movie and that's just cause of the scenario and less of the fact of poor writing, just idk, people act weird in life or death situations.They spent a lot of money on a gimmick horror thriller and I really really appreciate that. These kinds of movies don't happen much anymore it feels like and with the way this is going over I don't think the box office returns are gonna change this trend.IF they had about half the budget and instead used dinky older style suits and did the sets like Leviathan perhaps this would be more well received with a more reachable profit margin but they shelved the film for almost 3 years (I assume when LIFE didn't do that great financially) so who knows what is going on with it.IF this is really the last FOX movie, a shame but at least they went out on a high note.I'm sure I could discuss this thing for another hour or so and go into various things but I really don't wanna type for hours."
443,"379. Underwater. A straight to the action, claustrophobic thriller. Story begins with scantily clad Norah getting ready to start her shift at the laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. And by the sudden alarms going off and the entire structure rocking back and forth, something went wrong. it's an earthquake, and its tearing the place apart. And so it's on to find others and to get to escape pods. Oh the earthquake also woke something up down there, and it's big. Who knows maybe its there just to say hi to the new neighbors, but it doesn't really look that way. Because the movie mainly focuses on action, we never really get to see Kristen Stewart make that awkward face, you know what I mean, so that was a plus. TJ Miller was in it, as some kind of odd man-baby scientist, so I thought that was pretty stupid. Overall it was a decent action sci fi flick. Just remember like a famous Jedi once said: ""There's always a bigger fish."" Filmbufftim on FB."
444,"This has to be my first review in IMDB, coz I feel this is just so bad.
There's not much science to explain what is going on underwater. Most of the scenes happen in the dark, thus the gore is limited.
Other than that, there are typical jump scares, classic ingredient to old-fashioned horror movies. Skip this and watch something else.
Cheers."
445,"Terrible acting , atrocious dialogue, Kirsten ""Cannot Act Stewart"" trying to be Ripley and failing tragically in every possible way - she only seems to have one mode of acting, zero characterisation......The movie is so dark and gloomy you cannot fathom (pardon the pun) what is happening most of the time or see the creature properly - where did the 80 million go?I was quite looking forward to this but it was a real stinker and no mistake - worst biggie of the year so far!"
446,"UNDERWATER finds a group of drill miners at the bottom of the ocean escaping their vessel after it is hit by an earthquake. As they attempt to escape, they are met with unfamiliar creatures and must in turn escape from them as well.This is by far the best film I've seen in terms of 2020 releases so far (though that's isn't saying much and I'm not factoring 1917 or JUST MERCY into the mix here since those are technically 2019 films). This movie was actually filmed in 2017 and just released now due to the Disney/Fox merger and it really feels like both studios didn't know what to do with this because this is better than most January releases and the filmmaking behind it is adequate. They at least try. The acting is fine, the production design and technical are all passable as well.One of my huge issues with this film is that it feels to much like Alien or Cloverfield to the point where it feels like a ripoff of those films. There are so many homages to those films that at times it became a bit distracting at times and took me out of the movie at times, causing me to zone out.I've seen things saying that the lighting is very minimal, but for the most part I thought the minimal lighting helped with the suspense of building up the creatures and the experience of the characters when they come into contact with these creatures. The only parts the minimal lighting didn't work for me was when the camera was skating all over the place and you couldn't see anything that was happening.This is one of the more decent films in January. This is by no means a great film, but there was enough that was entertaining that kept me engaged, even though it does feel like it rides that line of ripping off some classic films that clearly influenced it."
447,"My brother came to town, and when he does he always wants to see a movie. He went through the list, and said ""this one has a monster, I'm in"" - suffice it to say that my wife says that I know owe her several ""chick flicks"" in penance.This movie would have been a lot better, if they had developed the characters. Is that cute little Bella from Twilight? And why does Hollywood insist on killing off the black member of the group first? That guy's pretty funny, let's kill him off. And let's make the captain like Jacques Cousteau. The writers could have worked harder, and some consistency (like whether eyes make any sense at that depth - yes, or no, guys, you don't get both).That is not to say that the writers were not clever or unlettered. They clearly knew of Cthulhu, and there is strong evidence that they were influenced by ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"". Borrowing more from that story than just the sea monkeys would have improved the film a great deal."
448,"An entertaining underwater creature features flick with some flaws, but a fast-paced action packed ! ten minutes into the movie and you'll immediately sit on a thrill ride. Not without flaws, it's almost like a two hours film cutted into a 95 min, and unfortunately the rating is PG-13, so as an adult viewers, you'll likely to find a not too satisfying light content of blood and gore in a monster-horror genre. Other than that i've found it has some good jump-scares, nice designs, especially the suits and creatures, which clearly come from people who love to watch alien and leviathan, playing dead space, or even fans of Lovecraft and J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield. Succeed deliveres me the underwater phobia plus a mystery-suspense feel of what might been lurking in the dark depth of the bottom of Mariana Trench, you'll surprised they're even parts of something more gigantic !"
449,"""Underwater"" is the kind of no-nonsense B-movie with an A-list cast that Hollywood used to make more often. It's a lean and mean film that gets you into its action instantly and then doesn't release the pressure until the ending credits.In an era of increasingly long blockbusters with pretensions of greatness, it's refreshing to see a tight movie that knows exactly what it needs to do and sets about doing it. Anchored by another impressive performance from Kristen Stewart and really effective cinematography from Bojan Bazelli, ""Underwater"" absolutely bullies you into liking it.There's no time not to. Some of the midsection succumbs to incoherent effects in which the murky setting overwhelms the ability to actually be able to tell what the heck is going on, but the flaws of the film never linger long enough to, sorry, sink ""Underwater.""Stewart plays Norah, a worker on an underwater research site that's literally miles below the surface. An annoying opening narration that feels tacked on by a producer during the film's delayed post-production details how time starts to lose all meaning when you're that far underwater. There's no light and you sometimes can't even tell if you're awake or dreaming.Just about then, while you're still trying to find your seat in the theater, all hell breaks loose. The hull of the rig starts to crack and explode. Norah runs to safety, eventually finding other survivors that include characters played by Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, John Gallagher Jr., Jessica Henwick, and T.J. Miller.That's it. It's six people trying to survive a catastrophe that has killed the hundreds of other people aboard the site. No shots of emergency crews on the surface. No flashbacks. The escape pods have either been used or destroyed. Their only hope is to literally walk a mile along the ocean floor to another site and hope there are pods that work there. Then they discover they're not alone.Yes, ""Underwater"" is half disaster movie and half monster movie, combining two B-movie genres that I've always loved. As ""Underwater"" shifts from something more akin to ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to a submerged riff on ""Alien,"" the transition doesn't always work but director William Eubank directs his cast to incredibly strong in-the-moment performances that hold it together. We need to believe Norah's plight, and Stewart sells the immediacy of her waking nightmare, well-assisted by Henwick and Cassel in particular.(On the other hand, Miller's schtick gets old fast, but that's the only weak link). The writers tack on a few too many manipulative back stories to try to heighten the emotional stakes, but that's commonplace in both genres on which ""Underwater"" is riffing.It also helps that the producers of ""Underwater"" tapped the eye of the great Bojan Bazelli to shoot the film. The cinematographer behind ""A Cure for Wellness"" and ""The Ring"" knows how to build tension with a combination of extreme close-ups that put us inside Norah's helmet while never losing the geography of where these people are fighting against incredible odds.When the movie becomes a full-out monster flick, Bazelli and Eubank could have dialed down the underwater murk a few degrees, but it's still an effective film visually, the value of which cannot be understated. Most bad B-movies like ""Underwater"" rely on a steady diet of jump scares and shaky camerawork to disguise their low budgets and lack of visual acuity. What sets this apart is that there's an artistry to the visuals and captivating sound design.The film is filled with flashing lights of broken or breaking equipment and the din of metal creaking under the pressure of water. It's all necessary to enhance the tension.What I think I responded to the most in ""Underwater"" is its relentlessness. It's almost real time for at the least first chunk of the movie, and the immediacy of the filmmaking gives it power. ""Underwater"" discards all that on-the-surface nonsense that worse movies would have forced viewers through, in which we meet the characters and foreshadow weird happenings underwater.There's no time for that. Don't show up late. It's a film that's about panic, and how unexpected heroes can be made through instinctual response to adversity. That, and underwater monsters.The final act of ""Underwater"" will likely divide some people, but I'm a fan of when a B-movie really goes for it, and there are a few beats in this one's final scenes that are impressively ambitious.My kids are at an age where they're fascinated by the idea that there could be species so far below the ocean's surface that we have yet to identify them. When they're old enough, I'll show them ""Underwater."" Maybe they'll like B-movies too."
450,"This movie is straight Gravity at the bottom of the ocean with sea monsters. Very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The movie had a great score, great atmosphere, solid acting, good pace, and the monsters are effective. It's a simple plot line but every other element really works. For me personally I loved this movie. Most others will Atleast be entertained no doubt. I say see this movie for sure"
451,"15 seconds into the trailer for this movie I thought-I gotta see this! I was not disappointed. Exactly what I was hoping for. Thrilling, terrifying, and claustrophobic; this movie doesn't let up for a minute. Have you ever watched a movie and thought that they should have trimmed 20 minutes? This is NOT that! All heart-pounding tension and no filler. I'm not gonna say too much about the sea creatures. I'll just mention that there was one scene in particular that was straight out of a nightmare! Monsters aside, the cinematography was also great. My favorite moment's were the ""helmet cam"" shots where we are inside of Kristen Stewart's helmet. Did I mention claustrophobic? I was holding my breath because I didn't want to use up any of Kristen's oxygen!"
452,"Theres no buildup to the action. They rely wayy too much on suspence to where you loose interest before the ""jumpscares"" the only thing that made it tolerable was tj miller. Hes funny but spoiler he died to early. Didnt even finish the movie walked out early. Could not pallet it."
453,This was a very boring movie. What was this movie about again?
454,"For a sci-fi movie released in January, it was quite good. Good story, good visual effects and good acting. It definitely was an omage to the original Alien film. Definitely worth a watch."
455,"This movie opened with like 40 minutes of nothing but explosion and running around with out any character detail, story why they are under water or anything. When one of the character died, there was no emotional attachment.Why are we hearing these creatures making moaning and growling sounds in water?"
456,"I liked it very much. The movie is exciting and the actors are good.
You could really feel how the characters were struggling for survival.
Also the production design is great."
457,"For all fans of kristen stewart, she acted very well and she is just wonderful as usual. Movie seems like life of 2017 but it is under water instead of space."
458,"I didn't come in with any expectatations, other than maybe the average score (as of now, at 6.1/10 from 4,472 stars). But I think that is a disservice to this movie. I may have chosen not to go see it. But I have to say, I don't often feel like I would recommend a movie. But I would recommend this.What I like about it is that it feels realistic. It has an exciting, action-packed type feel, but not overly so. Also, it scared me at times, and I'm not usually scared.And I love that Kristen Stewart was the strong lead character in this. I am so happy for her. Smart, strong, empathetic, and all the good quality you would love to see in a person. Bravo! I hope she get more characters like this."
459,Wow what happens in the movie it is actually shocking terrifying such a good scare!! I did not expect to be that scared on the edge of my seat the whole time! Loved it. Cast was incredible. I could have watched it another hour longer soooo good!
460,"Underwater is one great disaster creature feature. This film deliver in a big way. From the acting to the not stop action, horror and suspense. Not to mention a great simple story. The film is great and it have some awesome surprises that you need to see. This is a film to watch in theaters. If you like The Meg, Deepstar Six, Life and Alien to name a few you will love Underwater."
461,"Brilliantly cast and with a relentless pace, Underwater would have to be in the running for best sci fi spectacular of the year. With a gorgeous lead and a nod toward Cloverdale, and yet all underwater, how could anyone not be excited?"
462,"Honestly this movie should have been rated R. The visuals of some of the people dying are very disturbing. My mom writes/reads horror and she had nightmares about it (which NEVER happens). I have a 10 year old sister, and we often watch R rated movies together as long as we know why it's rated R. Since this movie was rated PG-13 we didn't question it, just watched. This movie was more disturbing than other R rated movies we've seen. Plot wise I thought it was a pretty good movie. Just wish we could've been warned."
463,"This movie was... embarrassing. There's no backstory. Throws you into the action without any explanation of what's going on. Plot lacks a time frame that makes any sense. No characters being defined, who are they and what are they doing there. It's just some people in a bad situation without any clear plot."
464,"This movie is actually way better than it's current rating suggests. Yes it has it's flaws and goofs and yes it could have been even better, but you could say the same about so many movies and it still has all the essentials for a good horror flick and Kristen Stewart is actually not bad in here. BUT ALL I WANTED AFTER WATCHING IT WAS TO SEE ALL OF IT AGAIN IN 4K!!! Why has the 4k BluRay release been cancelled??? This movie and its special effects REALLY deserve a 4k release! I would have definitely bought it...
Watch it and decide for yourself."
465,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. This was pure entertainment at its finest! Hats off to the director & the cast. You guys killed it! I would advise the viewer sit back, turn the lights off and enjoy this blessing during these trying times."
466,"Greetings from Lithuania.From the premise i read and heard, i was secretly expecting ""Underwater"" (2020) to be in common with a great movie ""The Abyss"" (1989). What i got here was a good opening of the movie, and involving second act. What i got in a third act was not was i expected as the movie was kinda leading me to. After all the mystery, at the end it was basically a ""Godzilla"" underwater VS Kristen Stewart in her underwear running around the space station .., oh i'm sorry - underwater station. You will see similarities with ""Alien"" i'm sure.Overall, i won't spoil anything else, but i was expecting this movie to be better. Unfortunately, premise was much more involving then the story itself. Not a bad movie, but pretty disappointing."
467,"When one of the main characters sports 3 silver hair clips in his fringe and talks to his little toy bunny, you know you're in trouble. Like his character, Underwater is equally nonsensical and poorly developed."
468,Serious tho I thought it was one of the best monster films in relating to movies such as leviathan and deep star six.. I'm mean come on the big reveal that u knew was coming but just didnt realize how awesome it would be....
469,"Good scary movie. I love scary movies. But there has been one out in many years that would make me jump. 40 min into film and I already jumped 2 times. Turn up the volume, turn the lights off and just enjoy the entertainment."
470,"After 30minutes I was skipping through the movie. I just wanted to finish it. It's just NOISE, DESTRUCTION and SHAKY camera. This film makes you fed up! One of the worst movies I've watched. Even the rating of 6.0 is very generous for this film. In my opinion I would rate this much lower."
471,Would have been much more enjoyable had Kristen been nude.
472,"I think this movie definitely deserves a a better rating than it got here .
I know many films of this genre get low ratings here, likely because everyone's a critic, and many do not like this genre but rate anyway.As a fan of gritty Scifi like the Alien films, Blade Runner, Pandorum, The Abyss, District 9 and the like, I thought it was awesome. If you like these type of films, I think you will like this one."
473,"The story is cliché and with little explanation as to why they're drilling or what went wrong, although some of this is explained by the end. Good use of atmosphere and good pacing, focusing on being intense rather than building suspense, and the special effects and big reveal at the end are good. The acting's nothing special, the characters have little depth and the humour doesn't sit right with the supposed ""horror"" setting, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
474,"The thing about AMC's new ""A-List"" program is that you get to see a lot of movies that you wouldn't otherwise risk $10 on, and sometimes are pleasantly surprised. ""Underwater"" was not one of those.The folks saying this was ""Alien under the sea"" really need to go back and watch ""Alien."" I'm sure the director had hoped his film would come off that way, but this dreck didn't even competently rip off the superior movie. Jumping into the action practically before the credits ended, there was never ANY character development, meaning you really have no reason to give a damn when a character dies.Dark lighting and ""shaky cam"" were probably rationalized as ways to enhance the mood (and maybe even worked for the aforementioned more gullible and undemanding viewers) but were most likely simply budget-cutting measures, to prevent too close an examination of the cheesy monsters.One simple measure that should have been taken would have been to make the diving suits different colors. At some points it's difficult to determine who is being dragged off to end his or her participation in the movie. Fortunately, by that point you no longer care.It's been said MANY many times before, but apparently it bears repeating. Hollywood, pay attention: KRISTIN STEWART CANNOT ACT. Look at her face in the movie poster at the top of this page: that is exactly how she expresses any emotion, whether love, hate, joy, fear, envy, lust, etc. It is beyond me why directors keep casting this piece of wood in starring roles, when they might just as well cast a nobody and put her in a Kristin Stewart Halloween mask. I was hoping to at least see her killed off, to prevent any chance of her appearing in a sequel, but I don't think there's any danger of that anyway. Spoiler alert: she does get killed at the end, but it was not satisfying, except to mark the end of a wasted couple of hours. And right to the point she blew herself up, she steadily maintained the expression of someone in the recovery room after a session of electroshock.Ah well, at least I didn't have to pay for it."
475,"This had a lot of potential. Underwater is as if not more scary than space, and being trapped with no Escobar in either is undeniably terrifying. The suspense held on pretty well until the last 20 minutes or so. It felt like the writers gave up and went with the easiest way out, which was really really lame. I can deal with something being far fetched but when it just makes no sense it ruins the whole experience."
476,"Thinking this was going to be another ""DeepStar Six"" or ""Leviathan"", ""Underwater"" sheds a little of both and relies on constant movement to create a sense of urgency I think is worth your time.There is nothing new with this flick. A buzzed haired tough trucker type drill worker. Digging deep into the Earth for minerals (instead of..say...space ore hunters...ahem ""Alien"" or science exploration at the Antartic...um...""The Thing""). Fine. So director William Eubank doesn't fight the tropes instead embraces them and makes it interesting.
Not surprising, coming from a former Panavision employee, this is a visual exercise in darkness and dirt and grime and just claustrophobic atmosphere. I'm completely cool with that.
Unfortunately, what is lacking is how we should care about the characters. Kristen Stewart plays Norah, the tough cookie who is also a survivalist. Much has been said about her unlikeability OR her supposed inability to act. Both, I feel, untrue. Vulnerable, sad eyed and somewhat sexy (who else can rock a buzzcut and still remain feminine?...Sigourney Weaver?). Her melancholic voice over simply adds to a wounded person underwater.
Personally, I think the alien life form seems really unnecessary. It's enough to survive after an accident. I think that was the difference between making it a VERY interesting character study, into a b-movie horror flick.
It holds your attention and is perfectly good flick."
477,"The shots were so dark it was hard for my mind to catch very much. The acting was very good but some dialogue made no sense. I found a few holes but usually use imagination for that.
I wish the lighting had been lighter but as it was. Not to bad a movie."
478,"Wow! Really good suspense. A semi-cliché mashup of several genres but the best yet.
I started in disbelief like, o yeah there we go again but I have been proven wrong. What a ride.
Also; Kirsten steward has a really beautiful body that is ""used"" and shown off without you/(me?) making me feel like a perverted peeping tom; A bit like the end scene of Alien where Ripley goes underwear. But never mind that.
Good acting all around without cliché one-line actors, jokes or script.
And the ending... omg the ending! I'm going to watch it again now."
479,"The movie wasted no time getting right to it. Action from the very beginning to the very end.Too many people go in to the movies expecting to be taught science, an education from actors in an action flick. When you walk into a theater with those expectations you're guaranteed for a let down. Or you're the group that believes and base their lives on ""actors."" Unless the movie is literally based on facts and true events, just enjoy it for what it is, a movie.This movie has good action, good suspense, and decent acting. It really uses the slow motion at the perfect times to be effective.With that said, they spend zero character building in the lead up. They try to fit in some back story of some of the characters right in the middle of all the action. A lot of movies spend too much time on this, this movie doesn't spend enough. If they did, it may have been slightly better."
480,Core meltdown with a very accurate blast range with the press of a spacebar. We're not supposed to be here so we just kill all the poor creatures.
481,"Kristin is boring in this...one note. Could have made a good movie if ..sorry, fell asleep"
482,"Weak understanding of the tech needed for deep sea operations trying to frame a classic Alien-style monster flick. Filmmakers for these millenials can learn a bit from pros like James Cameron who try to use believable technology. And the characters are kind of useless, what kind of tech firm would have these ninnies running a multi-million dollar business down below? Hard to see what jobs they could do apart from Norah and the Captain."
483,"On par with original Alien, this movie kept me interested ast every turn. Best part I could watch it with my teens and they both said, great movie dad."
484,"Big budget Disaster movie thriller following the crew on a deep sea drilling facility as they try to get to safety after an earthquake.Doesn't waste a second in getting to the action and is pretty much action packed from start to finish. Well crafted set pieces, amazing production design and stellar performances through out. Kristen Stewart does a brilliant job in carrying the movie.Great popcorn movie escapism."
485,"A group of people on a deep sea drill unit need to abandoned their drill site that is several miles underwater, as the compound has suffered severe damage. The challenge for the group is to get to another nearby underwater drill site, and then safely to the surface. Within minutes of the movie starting there's chaos! I'm not sure if the frantic start to the movie weakens the movie, as it doesn't take the time to build the characters and tension. Or the frantic start does well to get the viewers heart pumping straight away? It's certainly not the best action movie I've seen, but its watchable."
486,"While yes, there some flaws and clitches I have to say is one of the best monster movies I've seen in a while. Also, it is not as predictable as one would imagine. There are many things to enjoy in this movie. If only comic horror was a popular genre this would have a lot more positive things."
487,"Neat movie. Has an interesting vibe throughout. Thought Kristin Stewart was good in this and was favourable as the main character. Good lesson and quote at the end. Had excitement, played out how most of these movies do until the end but it just felt right. Good hour and a half show!"
488,"Not a bad film, a bit like Alien on the bottom of the ocean, but completely ruined by the audio. It was almost impossible to understand anything anyone said with the mixture of incidental music (too loud) and water sound effects. Had no idea what was being said."
489,I really like this movie. But I'm also a kristen stewart stan so I could be bias. But it gets my anxiety going real good. It's a fun movie. Why all the hate? I don't get it. Creature features are always fun be it big budget or B movie. I like em all. Lighten up people. Just enjoy watching something and eat some popcorn. Stop picking everything apart piece by piece. Deserves a sequel for sure
490,"Underwater's unconventional opening without any setup, jumps straight into the action and is surprisingly engaging from the get go. The set design is atmospheric, almost evoking a deep sea version of Alien. The plot is gripping enough and the tension builds consistently over the course of the film, with a climax that is satisfying and justifies the build up."
491,It's a brave cross between Alien & The Abbys with great special effects. The characters are well acted. It's well paced and the effect of mounting claustrophobia is well maintained. I really don't know what people expected? It's well worth watching. I predict it will become a cult classic.
492,"(3.5 out of 10 stars).Underwater is a science fiction horror film that delivers a claustrophobia thriller with a good cast ensemble and performances, edgy music score, and a direction that feels like this film is trying to bring back a 1980s sci fi thriller like Alien movies, The Thing, or The Abyss (minus the creatures in this movie). I will say the film packs a punch with putting you into the action in the opening scene when an underwater facility is torn apart. Survivors Norah (Kristen Stewart), Paul (T.J. Miller), Lucien (Vincent Cassel), Emily (Jessica Henwick), and Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) are trying to make a way to the other station to find the evacuation pods. While the earthquake that shook the facility was not an ordinary quake. The drilling station has awakened something on the oceans surface with creatures that are trying to hunt the remaining survivors.May not be a fresh plot or concept idea. Underwater facility drilling in the oceans surface. Releasing some giant monstrous beast. And an army of humanoid creatures. The concept and plot is still exciting. As a group of survivors are trying to survive and escape from the stations before it collapses onto each other. They will go into claustrophobic settings of crawling into tight spaces. Or walking out onto the ocean surface with big underwater suits. Which the camera pans into their faces making it feel claustrophobia with the darkness out in the deep sea. Which anything can come into their faces at any given moment. I will say the film is intense and thrilling not really scary at all. It does try for a few jump scares with something running towards you. Or popping out in front of the screen.The cast ensemble was good. Kristen Stewart's performance is good playing Norah, a character that is struggling on leaving people behind in life and death situations. Stewart is coming along way with her acting. And she worked great in delivering the role. The music score by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts worked well delivering an edgy sci fi horror movie tone. Director William Eubank did a good job in creating a sci fi horror film. The movie begins with action and never stops for a breath until the credits roll. The first half is about characters trying to survive the wreckage. While the other half is the people getting killed off by a creature which barely shows. And they are trying to survive and escape.I will say my one issue with the movie is the quick editing cuts when the creatures are attacking them. The lighting is dark as it is cause they are out on the sea floor. It is a lot of fast editing cuts and shaky camera movements which can make it a little confusing. Sure, it was probably done to create the intensity direction on what is going on.Overall, Underwater is a pretty fair film. It could be a lot worse. It turns out to be a worthy sci fi horror film that is worth watching if your into those kind of movies. It is fast paced with action, has a good cast ensemble, and puts you onto the edge of your seat."
493,"If you're looking for a film with character development, then this isn't for you. It's straight to the point and doesn't really stop from there.It was a refreshing change of pace to have a film that didn't hold your hand explaining things, leaving things to your imagination.Nice to see the Lovecraft inspiration."
494,"Surprisingly enjoyable tho' well worn Abyss/Alien/ type monsters from the mud romp.
I like it..maybe it's because i'm in a bubble at the moment."
495,"Not a lot to see here
Could have been better , lacked a lot of substance"
496,"It's been 30 years since Leviathan and I enjoyed this movie just as much , of course there are a number of movies Underwater also emulates all of which we all know and love . Underwater is pure entertainment with a good cast , a few silly moments , action and suspense . Would you believe in Australia there is no Blu-ray release so I had to order a German version which was perfect in every way image and 7.1 DTS sound and extras . I couldn't imagine watching a DVD version with all the dark scenes it would be unwatchable . Recommended ."
497,"A typical Hollywood-machine production. Underwater is fresh off the conveyor belt; formulaic without any feeling or depth (pun intended). The trailer does a great job capturing your curiosity, but you're better off in the shallow end. Nothing worth exploring here.PS: The black guy dies first, and this is in 2020."
498,"A tense film, at least for me. All of actor play their roles well, even though there are some weird scene but that doesn't mean it's bad. I was entertained by this film, worth it to watch."
499,"In era of movies like alien covenant. This movie lacks any soul. In other words, couldn't keep it together.
I wasted 1.5 hours waiting, something to happen.
Please dont waste your time.
Watch life on Netflix, way better than this"
500,"Sure it had some flaws, like crashing the helmet with a fire exstinguisher when 6 miles of water pressure could not break it, but still quite a decent movie with references to many classics."
501,"I really liked this sci-fi-horror movie.
The story was interesting, the horror adequate and the monsters believable.
CGI was great too, the movie did not have that fake look.
The performances by the actors were great and it was surprising to see how very good Kristen Steward is in this movie."
502,"Obviously this flick is not going to win any oscars, but it is a highly entertaining bit of sci-fi escapism. T.J Miller is funny, Vincent Cassel is awesome, Kirsten Stewart looks great in her underwear. Something that obviously did not escape the directors attention, if all the lingering closeups are anything to go by. Its a fun/scary film, Citizen Kane it isn't. Favorite line from the film ""You sweet flat-chested Elven creature..."".
I gave it a solid 7/10"
503,"Lot's of nods to classics such as Alien, The Abyss, and The Descent. Deserves way more than the 5.8 it's currently rocking. It's not on the level of the aforementioned movies, but it is solid and quite well made. If I were to grade it, I'd give it a B."
504,"I do get the hate. My father who loves this sorta film (The Thing/ The Abyss/ Alien, etc) didn't love this...for 2 reasons.1) it was too dark
2) you never get a clear view of themHowever, you have to know Lovecraft to love this. Why?? Because Lovecrafts monsters are not something we know anything about, as far as origins, and they have ZERO motive.You have to understand that his monsters have the same motive against us, as we do walking down the street and stepping on an ant. The only possible motive is we are in the way. They think nothing of us, as we think nothing of a single bug, or bette yet, a cell.Once you understand that, you can easily enjoy the monsters. Especially the ending one...those asking where it came from, how it lives down there, etc...you're thinking outside of how Lovecraft monsters are written. The point is we don't and can't understand them...and YES this was a Lovecraft monster (the directors words)If you have issues with the script itself, I can understand that...yes it started off with a bang with no character development...which I've never had an issue with. The Thing, widely regarded as the greatest monster film ever, did the same thing. I've always kind of preferred that, so it's less of an issue for me...Stewart is also a hot button actor...but she was fine I thought.I gave it a 7 because yes, it WAS too dark and too man quick shots...but overall for what it is, I enjoyed it."
505,"This was a blast. I thought the effects, stunts and cinematography were great (sadly I had to watch it on my iPhone, I suggest a big screen for maximum effect!)
I'm a big fan of Kristen Stewart. She and the rest of the cast really brought it.
Spoilers below:One interesting thing was that (unless I'm mistaken) the actors who played Smith was also in 10 Cloverfield Lane, and while they aren't from the same franchise, Underwater and the Cloverfield films have some related topics and similarities.Now, I'm not oceanographer, but I do enjoy watching documentaries and the like about strange animals and creatures of the sea, so just generally I thought the creatures to be at least a little unrealistic. Specifically that they had working, *light sensitive* eyes. Baring these being creatures from another world, it simply wouldn't make sense for deep sea creatures to have functioning eyes (unless they do go up into higher waters and we just don't know that). In my opinion, a little more research on the types of fish and life that exists in deep water would have been good to really bring about something that felt a little more plausible while still be terrifying. I have plenty of notes but I have them because I enjoyed the film and, if for some reason was given the chance, would love to really make it top notch.In the end, I think it's a fun action flick, if a little too light on personal details."
506,"What makes this film admirable and quite disarming is indeed it's breakneck pace - if there are flaws in it to quibble about, the makers move through the material at such a belting pace, you might just forget what those flaws were and just be carried relentlessly along with it. Sure, its not the ultimate in 'exploration crew in dire straits' movie, the creatures unfortunately have to 'growl' and are slightly overexposed at times but the picture looks great, creates some decent claustrophobic tension and the cast immerse themselves well through it all (pun intended). The Abyss, Deep Star Six and alike weren't all exactly groundbreaking properties back in their day anyway. We've waited a long time for another frolic in the murky depths and Underwater is definately worthwhile. The hardware is inviting and honestly, I actually look forward to watching Kristen Stewart these days. She certainly hasn't become stereotyped in her choices of roles. You may feel as I do that you still wanted more somehow from this movie, but the most inexplicable thing is you really can't put your finger on it....because what you got was all served up so fast and so well."
507,"Really a slightly below average sci-fi movie to be quite honest. The acting is good and there are bits of tense and suspense here and there but that's all the positives I can give to this movie. Special effects are good too, but that's to be expected from a movie with such high budget.I think that there are a lot of fans of sci-fi movies that are going to be disappointed by this one. Would not recommend this movie to that crowd. If you like tense thrillers this is barley passable though."
508,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Underwater"" (R - 2020 - Blu)Genre: Horror/Monster
My Score: 7.2Cast=5 Acting=7 Plot=8 Ending=9 Story=6
Scare=7 Jump=7 F/X=8 Monster=9 Gore=6A crew of researchers working for a deep sea drilling company try to get to safety after a mysterious earthquake devastates their facility. There escape leads them into another situation.""What's the scariest part of a roller coaster? Waiting in line."" This movie starts you off like a disaster movie for the first half, then becomes a full on monster movie in the second. There were some hokey bits and the story was left with some holes, but I really liked this one. This probably goes down as one of my favorite movies of the year...even though the score doesn't reflect that."
509,Extremely boring and predictable. Aliens revisited once again.
510,It's not a bad film and I quite enjoyed watching it for some light entertainment.It reminded me very much of a watered down (no pun intended) Alien based in the sea instead of space.Worth watching if or when it is screened on telly...
511,"I wouldn't normally write a review while still watching the film in question but this is bad, bad bad.Within a minute or two of runtime, we are into chaos mode, a bunch of people we don't know, don't have any affinity with and can't yet relate to are suddenly thrown together and have to make their way to safety. Once disaster hits, there is no space to breathe, just a continuous stream of action with no tension whatsoever. There were set-pieces which, in the right hands, could have been effective but with no connection to the characters, were just tickboxes for the attrition.This movie is another example of the failure to recognise that what is imagined by the viewer can go way beyond the skills and budget of a filmmaker, something Kubrick and Ridley Scott understood when they left space for silence to do the talking, or kept their antagonist's form indistinct and vague.Pity."
512,"Honestly this movie had some pretty solid acting in it for a monster movie and Kristen Stewart does a fairly good job carrying it. There were not a ton of cheesy lines that you typically have to hear in these movies(althought there were a couple). The action was evenly paced and did not drag on with a ton of monologue which I appreciate. I'd say give this one a watch, it's worth the 4 bucks to rent if you're looking to scratch that ""I need to see a monster movie"" itch."
513,"I give this movie 3/10 for he story this movie has a good idea they working on but the director can not used this for the movie
the act was very bad except Vincent Cassel he was good
the vfx was bad"
514,"I love sci-fi, horror, action, survival... this film touch on it all but failed so bad to get me engaged. Firstly the action happened straight away, there was no character introduction or development, no chemistry between the cast. I genuinely did not care if they all died - that's a big problem. A forgettable movie with uninspiring monsters and uninteresting characters."
515,"I for one found it to be very entertaining. Hate me if you want I don't care. I love that fact that the monster at the end is freaken Cthulhu! Freaken CTHULHU! If they maybe added a bit more meat in the beginning of the movie and some Cthulhu mythos scattered for the keen eyes fan to see then maybe, just maybe this would have been such an awesome movie! The first time we get Cthulhu on the big screen and the movie flops.....or hear me out. This could have been an awesome concept for a Cloverfield prequel? Idk I'm disappointed. I love the idea but they really dropped the ball on this awesome as hell idea of a movie. Ugh ok done lol"
516,Thought provoking with definite inspiration from LOVECRAFT and ALIEN. If it was articulated a bit better it would be a surprisingly sharp
517,"Do not understand why this movie is getting knocked. This movie kept it real, when it comes to reaction to circumstance. 2 scenes made me really like this movie.1. When they first spot something weird happening to a body and all three people watching them tell him to come back in a calm but scared manner of what might be uncovered. You will rarely see that in your typical movie.2. When she tells the other girl to get in the pod, she doesn't stop to have a heart a heart convo about life. She tries for second then punches her in the face.Yes characters development was not present, yes we know absolutely nothing about the creatures. But it was different and engaging right from the beginning as there was no time to stop to explain or learn, because everyone is simply focused on the goal of escaping to the surface because of limited oxygen. A typical movie like this takes 30 minutes to get to the point or start to really let you know what the movie is about. This one smacks you in the face with it and engages you right from the beginning.If you like movies like ""the decent"" or ""cloverfield paradox"" then watch this, its just as fun.If you like games like ""Dead Space"" or ""Resident Evil""(not the movies). Then watch this."
518,"If people read books in general, they would have known about H. P. Lovecraft 's Cthulhu mythology and the Great Old Ones, which obviously this movie refers to. Great portraying of a Great Old One and the Aylith servants. I don't care about character development, because that is not the point. The characters are just pawns, means to an end. The only thing I didn't like was the ending and the little to no human insanity. A Great Old One cannot be killed. We can only see the portion of his existence that is placed in our dimension, as it is a multiple dimension creature. That said, the movie was descent and was scientific accurate. For instance, the fact that in great sudden pressures, matter explodes, hence the character explosions as soon as they were exposed to the underwater pressure.
I hope we get more Lovecraftian movies in the future. Maybe ones that are not afraid to refer openly to the Mythos."
519,"Many films with a budget of more than $ 50 million are released every year. This film is one of them.However, questions immediately arise. With such funds, at least, it was possible to make much better water and create better textures and graphics. Although, I don't rule out that such a murky picture could have been the idea of the authors.Plus the film - it constantly keeps in tension and doesn't allow to be distracted from itself. It's true. But the plot is not very original, there is no minimal background.The cast coped with their task, playing at the level of the film - not great, but good.In general, the film is not so terrible to have such a low rating. Yes, there are many questions, but as a thriller it coped with his task. To look in free time is just that. 7/10"
520,"... actually wish for one or the survivors' speedy demise because your ears are bleeding from the nonsense they spout, things are probably seriously amiss in a survival horror movie.Underwater is essentially The Descent with stupid dialogues. The scientific impossibility of the underwater walks at a depth of over 8 km makes the whole venture as plausible and credible as a Spring Break movie set on Mars. Jesus!"
521,"Couldn't find anything else to watch and I thought the trailer at least looked interesting. I watched it 3 times on my rental timer. Pretty good.If you can get past the constant lack of urgency to keep moving and or run, that lack of urgency is painfully persistent. They even stopped to pick up a sweets wrapper and chit chat about it instead of not getting dead. Ugh.... It's one of those movies where you're shouting at the screen ""RUN YOU MORONS, RUN!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OMG!!"" eh, just mental.Near constant chaos and near death happening left and right through the entire thing. When you can actually see the source of the destruction and chaos, well I thought it was really crazy. Don't want to give things away. Edge of your seat entertainment. It was what the Dr ordered.Anyway, there you have it. Oh, and Kristen didn't bite her lip once through the entire movie. I'm not sure if that counts as a spoiler."
522,"What if you take the basic premise of ""Alien"" and set it in the deep sea? You get ""Underwater"", directed by William Eubank. It's one of the last films released by 20th Century Fox before Disney bought it, which led to it being released at an unfavorable time for cinema. This contributed to it being swept under the rug, which is kind of a shame since this film has a few merits.Plot: The story centers on a drilling crew (chief among them Kristen Stewart). The group were working at the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world. However, there are some places man was not meant to dig and, sure enough, they end up awakening something hidden in the dark depths. This forces the gang to risk venturing out to find a means of escape while being hunted by monstrous entities.A good method to sell horror is isolation and there are few places more terrifying than the deep sea; darkness, cold, intense pressure, and life forms too alien to describe. The cinematography is done well, bringing forth claustrophobia within the station's cramped halls and the characters' POV when they walk outside in diving suits in low visibility. The horrors plaguing the crew, while not scaring me much, are effectively creepy. Though obscured by the environment much of the time, the film shows just enough for the viewer to get an idea of their appearance. Further details sprinkled throughout indicate something out of Lovecraft's playbook. The characters are kind of meh. None are bad, in fact a couple I liked such as T.J. Miller, but none leave a big impression outside decent character moments and interactions. Kristen Stewart, while not a great actress, at least has more to do here than let sparkling vampires whisk her away. Part of the issue is that after the cool opening credit sequence establishing the setting, the chaos happens almost right away, leaving little room to familiarize with the crew members before their perilous journey. I will say I didn't quite expect the conclusion to play out the way it did (in a good way).""Underwater"" admittedly doesn't offer much that's Oscar worthy and even I wouldn't call it one of the great horror classics. That being said, the setting and presentation do make it stand out, resulting in a passable experience."
523,"I liked the movie mostly, but have a long list of pros and cons to make (final score: 6-4). Voted with 7 of 10 which means: ""I liked watching it twice (!), but it is, despite the 80 megabucks spent on it, certainly no masterpiece in the Alien category.""PRO:
1) There is not simply a bunch of the same creatures. We are introduced to beasts with a history, evolving in three different steps: the 2 ft flesh-eating babies, the 8 ft humanoids, and the Very Big Guy who comes closer to one of the Lovecraftian Old Ones than anything I've seen on the screen before. When Norah's rocket illuminates him for the first time, it's a breathtaking moment. Huge has a new meaning. Godzilla, pack your bags!
2) The movie doesn't explain everything to the audience, but expects them to think a bit for themselves. Yes, that's a good thing, because I don't want a movie to treat me like I'm dumb. For example, the accident of the station at the beginning is never explained. Characters discuss whether it was a seaquake, but they are not quite sure. When later the Big Guy is revealed, and how he angrily attempts to destroy the station, I thought it was most likely his awakening by the drilling that caused him crushing some of its sections. The characters only talk about a possible seaquake because they don't know yet that He is outside. I thought it was quite obvious with hindsight, but when I read some comments accusing the script to be stupid because it doesn't explain the accident, I shake my head with despair.
3) It is sci-fi with station technology that is a few years in the future. But it makes that appear totally natural, the set design looks good.
4) The noises are deliberately vague, hardly ever identifiable. Hollow echoes, screeching, clicking, heartbeats, radio noise, twisting metal. Since the sound in such a depth beneath the ocean is certainly different from what your hear on the surface, sound design did a good job with disturbing effects.
5) Believe it or not, I actually think Kristen Stewart was a good casting choice. If this script had been filmed in 1985 with a tenth of the budget, they would have given this part to Pamela Anderson for two obvious reasons, and having no green screen FX, extras in monster costumes would their thrash their rubber tentacles at her. Yeah, that probably would have been fun - but cheesy. In 2020, you have an average looking woman who studied her technology stuff, repairs things and doesn't need any special powers except being the smallest one, so she can squeeze herself through narrow gaps first. Stewart was credible in her role.
6) I loved the moment when the monster swallowed her whole, like a snake would, and she shoots her way out of the behind. Hilarious! The scene with the creatues sleeping in front of the door was the scariest one, nonetheless.CON:
1) The station is said to have 316 people on board, and 6 escape (in the beginning at least). We could see a bit more of the others that fail to escape, but the movie wastes this opportunity of more dramatic fights for survival. The scale of the disaster is underwhelming, therefore the next steps look almost too easy: get in the suits, walk around like there's only 10 ft of water over your head...
2) Although we are limited to a handful of characters here, they are not very interesting and stereotypical. There is the grumpy guy who complains about everything, the nervous girl who worries about everything. Vincent Cassel is the captain who gives a the orders (""Here is what we're gonna do...""), and only later Norah finds out that he lost his daughter, which is the only thing we hear about his past.
3) Heroic self-sacrifice. Oh no, not again! Everybody is ready for it, from the captain to Emily the Nervous One. You must take the capsule, I stay. Bah. What happened to ""we leave nobody behind""?
4) Talking about the escape pods, the audience never has any orientation how far the heroes must run. The actors are swimming down corridors, another door closes, another wall breaks, they try another corridor - and hey, here are three pods for three people! Seems more like a gamble than an actual plan."
524,I enjoyed this film though it did move quite fast. Character development was left on the side of the road but if you remember the film Alien you don't get to know half the crews name before the bodies start hitting the floor. Although this movie has many similarities to Ridley Scott Alien it wouldn't be fair to compare the two as Alien is a sifi horror classic. I love the look of the films tech. I loved how claustrophobic they made me feel. Compared to some of the garbage they're releasing today Underwater is a refreshing change. If you give it a chance It won't disappoint.
525,"I'd give this one a 6.5,, not incredible but definitely fun to watch. I saw another review that was griping about no character development,, really? Not that kinda movie. With the beginning and the end,, you get a good bit of information (you just have to actually pay attention and read). I liked Norah's (Stewart) inner monologues as well. She did good in this one.So go watch it!"
526,"The movie mainly fails in its predictable script, flat characters and cliche story. I think the project could go further and although I did not consider it a bad movie, I think it could be done much better, especially a deeper and more intriguing story could be made ... Special mention to its production design and special effects, just excellent."
527,"I dont know why people are so crittical about this movie. It is really good movie with lot to offer. It is atmospheric and quite exciting. And I really like that they don't pay much attention to the relationships between the characters, because it's not about it. But I have to admit that anything that is inspired by Lovecraft is a win for me in most cases."
528,"Great movie, good production quality and good performance. i dont know why soo many bad reviews but still the movie exciting. yeh there are some flaws or many flaws (the walking on sea bed like its flat ? or was there only 1 or few creature only? but wth. Enjoy the movie."
529,"The movie isn't too bad. It is beautifully shot, the underwater scenes are credible, the CGI is of good quality, etc. It could have done a few things better though.The pace is way too fast. Not even 5 minutes into the movie and characters are already running around and screaming in panic, stuff explodes (or rather implodes) left and right and this pace doesn't change ever again over the course of the whole movie. There is no time for character development or depth, at least not that you'd start caring for the cast.Also there are quite a few plot holes and logic fallacies. For instance:-How did the creature, who ate Abel in the tunnel, even get in there, from a high pressure environment into a low pressure environment, without collapsing the whole facility?Why did Cpt. Lucien die when being dragged up by a creature? He screamed something about ""we are ascending too fast, pressure is too high"", but the pressure reduces when you ascend ...How could Norah catch up to Haversham and Smith, when obviously having spent a good couple of hours in Shepard station? And how did Haversham and Smith even survive that long?But overall a not too bad movie, with a few flaws. Still good popcorn movie and enjoyable to watch."
530,"Imagine 'Alien.' Now imagine 'Alien' set under the sea. There you have my entire plot summary of 2020's 'Underwater.' I would say that 'Underwater' has to be one of the most unoriginal films ever created over recent times. There is absolutely nothing to see here that you haven't seen a hundred times before in various 'post Alien' sci-fi/horror movies. That sounds like I'm ripping on the film, yet - amazingly - I actually quite enjoyed it.Apparently, it was made in 2017 and sat on the shelf until 2020. I guess I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were at 'absolute zero' when I decided to watch it. That's probably a helpful way of watching it - don't expect too much (and certainly don't expect anything vaguely original).I know it's fashionable to hate on Kristen Stewart, but let's not judge her on one franchise containing sparkling vampires. She's actually quite a capable actress and, although her performance as the lead role here won't win her any Oscars, she does the job. Plus the film does get right into things. In the opening scene the underwater drilling facility begins to explode, causing a handful of survivors to try and find a way to make it all the way up from the bottom of the ocean to the surface. And, as if that wasn't difficult enough, there's something out there waiting for them.There's not a huge cast which at least gives us the chance to get to know some of them before bad things really start to happen. I thought Vincent Cassel certainly was the best among the supporting cast (even though I had a shrewd feeling I knew exactly what was going to happen to him and I was proved right). However, Jessica Henwick just seemed absolutely wooden at all times. I'd never really seen her in anything and thought she must be an American trying to put on a British accent. After a quick check online I found she was British, meaning her accent sounds fake even to a native like me!I know this is just a 'glorified B-movie,' but the special effects were actually pretty good. Yes, most of the surroundings etc were computer generated, but because the environment was supposed to be murky anyway, the CGI wasn't in any way noticeable.As I've said, 'Underwater' provides absolutely nothing new for the genre, but when that's a film's only real flaw, it makes it worth a watch if you're looking for something new in terms of a 'monster-munching movie.'"
531,"I hope I'm not right...
But we never get any closer to a Cthulhu movie than this.
5 point for the ""endmonster"" the rest is trying to be alien, but fails..."
532,Other than T.j. Miller also known as the bartender from Deadpool. This movie is noisy and hard to see. CGI was horrible. You can't give Kristen Stewart a haircut and make us believe she's scared of monsters when she was in love with a ware wolf and vampire previously.
533,"There was something missing from it, can't quite say what it was"
534,"Nothing makes sense here. There is no story, no character development and no suspense. You simply do not care if the main characters in this movie die or not, because no one tried to make them likable. And yes, Kirsten Stewart is the worst part because she simply has only one and a half facial expressions. And when she recites her lines, every sentence is mumbled in the same way. She should change to audio books because she is obviously way better when she narrates her character's thoughts. Also, the movie painfully does not care about the most simple laws of physics - or logic in general. But overall it is such a shame as the setting and the budget could allow gifted people to make a movie which is compelling and suspenseful. But unfortunately, Underwater is not that movie."
535,"This was, by far, the worst movie I have seen in many years. The dialogue was terrible and badly written, the visuals were foggy and unclear, the plot made no sense, and the actors were terrible! The characters a bunch of scary movie clichés. Embarrassing. Stewart is so annoying, and I normally don't mind her. Just.... Just don't bother with this one."
536,"Maybe it's not highly original, but this movie is a solid action / sci-fi. The feelings of claustrophobia and intensity are real. The set feels authentic. Kristen Stewart is great as the lead, and the supporting characters are strong as well."
537,"I read all the negative reviews, and I cant understand why all the bad ratings. If you're into horror, or even just in the mood for a horror movie. Then this movie definitely deserves your time. I watched this movie after reading all the bad reviews, and I thought this movie was actually pretty awesome!I really enjoyed this movie. It gave me exactly what I wanted a horror movie. An underwater one at that. The scenes when they are down there walking on the bottom are terrifying. Imagine being in a position like that. Just Darkness, no hope, and there's monsters, that movie incredibly fast, because this is their environment.I had a blast with this one! Definitely give it a watch! :)"
538,"Very nice deep sea thriller, actually a good one, unlike ""the Meg"". I expected nothing, cause i normally don't enjoy Stewart's acting, but was pleasantly surprised! Strong, suspenseful and beautiful at times...hold your breath"
539,"I'll make it short in my review. I like Kirsten. Her acting is good.
But the movie? Omg, I'd rather watch the paint dry which is more fun. Don't waste your money on this. I slept half way through the movie. I hope they give refunds if the movie is crappy as this. Stay home and watch your paint dry is more fun."
540,"Kept me interested a lot better than I thought it would be,enough tension pretty good acting overall I would recommend it."
541,You end this film thinking that you have seen the same story over and over again for decades... Dont waste your time.
542,"I haven't seen a many movies with Kristen Stewart other than the Twilight series which doesn't seem like a fair benchmark of her talent. I loved her in this. Take with a grain of salt that the movie is written to have a particular signature as is her character. That said, she did great! TJ Miller also met my comedic expectations. This was a very fun film. If you aren't a super critic of movies (specifically sci-fi's) and the trailer piqued your interest, then this is a solid pick."
543,"What others find bad - superficial story, lazy production, etc. I happened to find refreshing. The film didn't try to drown you (pun intended) in mythical lore, made up marine biology, or anti-capitalist moral values. It is a straightforward story without any major twists. We know exactly as much as the characters and we never learn anything. I was tired of movies trying to sensentianalise aliens-now-deep-water-monsters and at the same time not require much attention and this was a good palette cleanser."
544,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I was surprisingly interested in and even optimistic about this movie. Why ""surprisingly""? Well, first of all, the cast doesn't really have a big name attached to it even though I actually enjoy some of Kristen Stewart's performances (who, like Robert Pattinson, has a few blind haters that haven't seen anything else other than Twilight), as well as a few other actors (Jessica Henwick, particularly). Then, no director or screenwriter caught my attention. William Eubank hasn't done anything exceptional yet. Brian Duffield co-wrote Insurgent (awful) but delivered a surprisingly fun horror screenplay with The Babysitter. Finally, Adam Cozad helped to create some underwhelming narratives (The Legend of Tarzan, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit).In addition to this, I'm not in favor of films written by more than two people since these usually disappoint, and... it's a January movie. So, why was I slightly excited to watch Underwater? For the same reason a lot of people probably avoided it: its formulaic horror-thriller story deep at the bottom of the ocean. If a sci-fi film has a premise based on a team that works on a claustrophobic location and some sort of entity ""disrupts"" their job, I'm instantly drawn into these movies. There's something about them that makes me enjoy them more than most people. Usually, this type of film has a low-budget and really requires a talented director who's able to generate genuine tension and suspense.Underwater is 2020's big surprise. January movies are known to be Hollywood's trash bin, so I'm honestly dumbfounded that this film is far from being bad. It's very, very good! The set and production design are impressive, and they help create that isolated, suspenseful atmosphere. The first few minutes are nail-biting. The next twenty minutes are fantastic. The following twenty minutes continue to be a blast of entertainment. I felt continuously surprised by how good the movie actually is. I still can't believe what I just witnessed!Don't twist my words, it's not a masterpiece or even a ""great"" film. It still follows a plot-driven narrative that countless other movies did better. It borrows inspiration from Alien, Cloverfield, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, and every other film involving an alien-like form threatening a crew. Plus, it lacks characterization of pretty much every character. There's no real attempt at deeply developing a single character to make the audience care about it, but this doesn't mean the movie can't succeed. Like I wrote above, there's a whole lot of plot-driven films that went on to be phenomenal.The difference between those and Underwater is that the latter doesn't truly bring anything new to the genre. It just uses the known cliches and executes them really well, which is itself a massive surprise. I can't deny that I had a lot of fun watching this thriller. I expected messy action with way too dark lighting making it impossible to see anything. I received surprisingly visible, well-filmed sequences, packed with tension, tons of panic, and a palpable sense of urgency. There aren't that many moments to breathe and relax.The VFX team and Bojan Bazelli (cinematographer) deserve a lot of credit because the ""aliens"" not only are visually captivating, but they are shown just in the right spots for the exact right amount of time. Underwater doesn't possess a huge budget, so the creatures need to be shown ""in the shadows"" to make them look and feel ""realistic"". It might seem like an obvious technical decision to be made, but its execution it's far from being an easy task, so kudos to everyone that participated in making the monsters a genuinely menacing threat.The cast is excellent. Kristen Stewart continues to break out of the Twilight shell, proving again and again that she's a wonderful actress. Jessica Henwick is pretty great, as well as Vincent Cassel. Everyone delivers fairly decent performances, even T.J. Miller, who portrays the always divisive comic-relief character that will surely be extremely annoying to some, and quite funny to others (I stand in the middle, I think his character is fine).It's definitely a good sci-fi horror-thriller, way better than most January flicks (Underwater is one of the last 20th Century Fox's movies, which probably means that Disney had no clue what to do with it, hence dumping it in the worst month of the year). I just added William Eubank to my list of directors to follow. His commitment to actually make a good film is demonstrated on screen, so I really hope that his movie gains some sort of following when it reaches people's homes.Underwater is 2020's (first) massively positive surprise. A January film far better than most of the month's competition. William Eubank delivers a remarkably well-filmed sci-fi horror-thriller filled with great tension, surprisingly visible (!) action, fantastic production design, and some really captivating VFX work. It's by no means a brilliant movie! It takes inspiration from better films of the same genre, and it follows a straightforward, plot-driven narrative with close to zero character development. It simply uses the known cliches but executes them really well. An underrated cast led by Kristen Stewart offers some notable performances, but it's the claustrophobic atmosphere surrounded by incredibly well-generated suspense that turns this movie into a success. Technically, I still can't believe how surprised I am. I just wish that it had a little bit of more characterization, so I could recommend it even more. As it stands, do watch it at the highest quality when you get the chance.Rating: B"
545,From beginning to end it felt like I missed something. It started as if it was the middle of the movie. Who are these people? Why are they here? What was the point? Like really guys....... WHAT WAS THE REASON!?!?!?!
546,"Underwater came off as another horror flick set deep below sea, in the vein of'Leviathan', 'Deepstar Six' and 'Deep Rising', movies I enjoy rewatching because they are good campy entertainment. Underwater started out promising, but once they introduced the deep sea creatures, it got bogged down in the same old boring storyline that is a shameless copy of O'Bannon's 'Alien'.The basic premise of the movie was engaging - people locked in a place without a chance to escape - and a lot could have been done with only the danger of being so deep below the surface. It would have made for a suspenseful race against time. But the writers obviously could not be bothered with original concepts, or trying to evoke genuine scares with atmosphere and good writing.It had some interesting moments that would have made for good horror if written and executed better. However, once the creatures show up, it turned into another failed attempt to cash in on cheap scares with CGI monsters. It's 'Alien' but without the enticing plot or interesting characters. There are failed attempts at the final girl trope as well as action heroes. It is what it is - a big wet failure. Very predictable and entirely unnecessary ""horror"" flick."
547,"I think the people making this movie has the same love for the classic monster movies like ""Alien"" and ""Jaws"" as I do.This movie start right of the bat, throwing you into a pretty standard race against the clock situation, completely forgoing any character introduction. The underwater stations layout is briefly hinted at the start of the movie but we never really get a sense of space or atmosphere. There are no windows or anything to hint at that we are in fact deep deep under water. Movies like ""The abyss"" and ""Sphere"" do a great job in this regard, you can really feel the pressure of being that far deep under water.Compared to the other movies I have mentioned this movie rarely introduces anything. Things just kind of happen. Kristen Stewart meet some new characters along the way, none of them are likeable or interesting - neither is she.In ""The abyss"" we get a real sense of the people in the deep sea rig. I could not tell you their names but I could tell you what they where about. In this movie they barely seem to know each other by name, why doesn't anyone care about characters anymore? It is the single most important part of a film.You can have a great film with bad plot if it still has great characters, you can't get a great film if you have a great plot but poor characters - no matter how many explosions you have.I am sad that I did not like this film, because this is a genre I really enjoy, no matter the budget - if the film is good then B-movie or not, I will gladly watch it.""Underwater"" is a mess, and I blame the writers and directors for the lack of core understanding of what makes this genre great. I could barely watch it to the end, that is how boring I found this thing."
548,If you liked Alien you must watch Underwater. While being clearly derivative with copying parts of Alien almost wholesale the film manages to bring enough suspense and atmosphere to be seriously enjoyable. 9/10 on visuals and set design. A true must watch for any scifi horror fan!
549,"So, I had this on my radar. Didn't really know much, perhaps a quick review in the Tube from Chris Stuckman. Not even that, just checked the score. That said....I had a blast! I mean, yes they could've done more and yes the cheesy parts are there, but I can't remember the last time I didn't have to check my watch when watching a movie. It sucks you in the first 5 minutes of the events and goes on and on until the third act when it actually slowed down a bit. In my book, that's a colossal win. Choose a night, turn off the lights and do take your plasma cutter, 'couse you gonna need it. Ohh boy, you wish you did take it!
Apparently this was completed in 2017, but somehow released January 2019!? I have no idea why it sat in the drawer for 2 years, but it is one thrill of a ride. I wouldn't mind a second part somehow."
550,One of the best sci fi thrillers which i have seen recently. This movie is in layers where when each layer unravels new mystery unfolds.Movie is action packed right from the start. Fast paced and gripping. Kristen Stewart with her blank face and i am always sad look is ideal to play this role.I like movies where everything is shown and not left on the audience to work things over and this is one such movie.Highly recommended.
551,"This movie is tries (and fails) to be a mix of Gravity and Alien, yet it missed the nuances of either. I don't like to write reviews that bash movies, but sometimes you're just compelled to. Slow and plodding, you're presented with familiar scenarios and bog-standard movie tropes. By the end of the film, you're left wondering what the whole point of the exercise was. You're just left with a sense of meh -- no real highs, lows, or memorable moments.None of the characters are particularly likable, except maybe Vincent Cassel as the Captain, but the rest are basically one-dimensional. Kristen Stewart is back from her role in the disastrous Charlie's Angels remake, and she's still trying to prove that she can act outside of the Twilight series. She's no Ellen Ripley by any stretch. Note to Kristen: Jet Li took acting lessons to prepare for his role in Unleashed and he was awesome for more than his fighting prowess. She's basically our main protagonist with the tortured past who serves as a linchpin for these underwater operations. But by the time her ""arc"" is revealed, I doubt that you'll care. The other members of the crew are kinda bland, although if I'm ever in a life-or-death scenario with someone like T.J. Miller, I hope that I'm the first to go. Every movie HAS to have an irreverent, unfunny jerk in stressful situations, I guess?My biggest complaint is that the movie is just too dark and the water is too murky to really see anything. That attempt at ""realism"", when combined with the CGI and the jump cut editing makes for a confusing visual mess. Ultimately, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking about this movie. Everything it has to offer has been done better in The Abyss, DeepStar Six or Leviathan. You get the same scares, better casts, effects and cinematography with any of them."
552,"I was pretty excited for this movie. Was waiting a long time to see it. But oh boy, was it a big let down!
The idea - very nice and good. But execution? Very poor. The set designs are mediocre. Film is irregularly pased. Sometimes its super fast and sometimes its so slow, you cant even tell that only 1 minute has passed. Creature design - super mediocre. I have seen better creature design in lower budget movies. The CGI is also very low class. Acting is, well - its got Kristen Stewart soo... Need i say more?
No good soundtrack, no good direction, plot holes, dumb characters with 0 backstory or relevance, no good acting, no good set or lighting, not even good color grading. No cinematography (something i personally really look for in a film). This movie's really got nothing that makes it stand out or memorable. The idea is itself a Frankenstein of ideas, comprised of parts taken from many different (read ""better"") movies and just put together.Overall - a disappointment."
553,"It's hard to get a good underwater film. In the 80's Hollywood spit out The Abyss, Leviathan and Deep Star 6. I enjoyed them all.
Add this to them.
The cast is good, the script not so much but I still enjoyed it."
554,I thought we were over this flaw in movies. Why did the black guy have to die first. We should be past that by now.
555,"Great atmosphere, great cast and awesome creatures. I hope this gets a sequel!!!"
556,Halfway through this movie and cant watch anymore. The creatures jump at the right time. This show is awesome. My son is into horror movies and he is on the edge of his seat. Best movie ive seen.
557,This movie couldn't have been more boring. Time I will never get back again. Stewart didn't disappoint. Was more wooden than Pinocchio.
558,"Everyone should just accept that Kristen Stewart, after all this time, still can't act. I suppose that's why the skimpy outfits. Nothing else seems to be working. The acting is terrible, The story line is terrible. The movie is terrible. From about five minutes in, I hope the main character die. Violently. It might match the pained and semi breathless expression. Remember the one face acting from Twilight?. Same thing, just less clothes. This is no relief for lock-down boredom. Rather watch grass grow."
559,"She spends literally 25% of the movie in her underwear... now I don't mind that, but if I wanted to see half-naked girls running around in their underwear then I'd just go watch some WWE.Anyways, the CGI is very good. The plot could have been done much better. The acting is OK. There's very little humor (T.J. Miller tries his best though. And while we're on the subject of T.J. Miller, I don't think he should be given work by hollywood anymore... Just look at the guy's past as it's filled with ungentlemanly behavior which I myself wouldn't want to be associated with).The entire movie is a B-rated monster-thriller with some action sprinkled over the top. It's sub-average and with this budget (and a different director), it could have been made into a much better B-rated movie, something more similar to Deep Blue Sea (1999), which is actually a pretty good monster-thriller."
560,"I was quite excited for ""Underwater"", I love an entertaining creature feature & there's really not enough horror movies taking place in the depths of seas or oceans. It was awful to see how ""Underwater"" flopped financially, so, even though late to the party, I managed to commit the price of one ticket. The verdict? I'm both happy and disappointed with it. But mostly happy.""Underwater"" is a prime-time horror popcorn flick in which Disney had no faith and so it got dumped in cinemas on January. I want to believe it'd have done better in box office if it was released in summer, like, for example, last year's creature feature ""Crawl"". But sometimes it is what it is, this flawed but highly entertaining Cthulhu movie had a bad fate in store for it. Yes, the monster at the end was indeed the Cthulhu himself (confirmed by the director William Eubank), although that's as far as Lovecraft's influence goes in ""Underwater"" - only in monster's design and location.""Underwater"" entertains from start to finish, its big budget provides top tier special FX and a great aesthetical outlook in general, definitely makes a great big screen experience. It's not exactly of the non-stop-action kind, but in ""Underwater"" we move forwards always, the question is how fast. Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel and the rest of the cast of six provide solid acting performances, can't pick on much there. Besides being a visually pleasant experience, ""Underwater"" also has good sound design and decent original score. So these are the things I'm happy about. Now the disappointing part. Movie's biggest flaw is its story. While all the elements at play provide all kinds of goodies, the script tends to drag all that down a little. Why? Well, it's a story that's taking uninspiring turns, uses a bunch of tropes we're all painfully familiar with, the characters, for the most part, also fit that bill. Mildly predictable, mostly conventional story. As a horror, it's not as scary as it is entertaining, but, thank god, it doesn't cover itself in unnecessary amounts of cheese.I doubt ""Underwater"" will find any kind of cult following, but I do urge You to see it on the big screen if You can. Or wait for the blu-ray and find the biggest TV available. My rating, with a heavy heart, 6/10."
561,"SPOILER ALERT!The Geets (Greats):The first third of the movie had excellent use of tension build-up and Stewart did a good job with her performance as Norah. The movie did a good job maintaining the sense of isolation and dread.The movie did a good job in terms of continually progressing the plot. There was the sense that the protagonists had no choice but to 'edge on' and this helped with engaging the audience for the majority of the movie.The scene involving the sudden death of Rodrigo was excellently done with raw, authentic reactions from the protagonists. It highlights the importance of underwater equipment reliability as well as building up the sense of helplessness.
The Phads (Bads):Vincent Cassel didn't give a satisfactory performance as the Captain despite his successful Resume. His lines seemed 'not-so' convincing to say the least. For a movie which heavily relies on the sense of isolation from the rest of humanity, the authenticity of actors involved is important to maintain this and most of these actors, apart from Stewart, failed to deliver an 'above par' performance.The final act failed to live up to my expectations. Despite Stewart's good performance overall her final scene didn't create the effect necessary as her character didn't show vulnerability effectively throughout the movie.There were several cliched moments in the film such as characters miraculously surviving attacks by the underwater creatures or environmental damages. It's a cheap way to continue the plot. Perhaps the movie could have focussed more on the palpable dread and isolation of being stuck in the underwater facility. For me the atmosphere of isolation was more convincing than the underwater creatures.The movie seemed too fast-paced and formulaic of a typical 'creature-feature' movie in order to be enthralled by the tension of inescapability. It failed to deliver on a level of atmosphere and pacing evident in successful movies such as 'Alien' and 'The Thing'. As such, it 'drown' in the sea of most formulaic Horror movies with a few good moments to just about reach the surface.Rating: 4.5/10"
562,"Lena(Natalie Portman) gives her head a subtle nod. The biologist confirms what her interviewer(Benedict Wong) in a hazmat suit already guessed for himself, verified at last as the truth, while talking and listening to the lone survivor on behalf of the personnel occupying this military compound. The ""shimmer"", an expanding translucent coating that originated from a lighthouse, with the potentiality of breaking perimeter after perimeter until there is no perimeter left. This deconstruction zone, spreading like a disease, which dispassionately corrupts flora and fauna, animals and humans alike, was indeed alien. Incidental body snatchers, more or less, is what the half-widow describes to Lomax, when recounting her encounter with the alien life form, a blank slate awaiting the transference of DNA. Kane(Oscar Issac), her husband, is not her husband. Alex Garland's ""Annihilation"", a sci-fi film about the possibility of an unnatural sixth extinction, echoes ""Underwater"", directed by William Eubank, with the difference being that our planet's annihilation starts off-land, not on it, and its threat is man-made, not alien. Emily Haversham(Jessica Henwick), a scientist like Lena, more so than the other Kepler 822 Station earthquake survivors, knows that drilling the ocean vents for seafloor massive sulfide deposits comes at a steep price. ""We don't belong here,"" Emily surmises, not long after she inspects an unidentified sea creature that nearly killed two divers exploring wreckage for survivors. Everybody knows they're looking at something terrestrial-based, but only Lena makes the connection between the discovery of this new species, a mutation, and the environmental fallout from mining the Mariana Trench. Cracks in the floor heat up the water and creates acidity. The ocean, in essence, is dead. There are no schools of fish to be seen. Whales? Sharks? Coral reef? ""Underwater"" quietly makes the point that an increase in water temperature hurts species diversity. Whereas the giant sea creature in Ishiro Honda's ""Godzilla"" symbolized nuclear power and its byproduct, the oceanic monster in ""Underwater"" can be interpreted as nothing less than an embodiment of global warming. This humanoid ate everything in the surrounding Pacific Ocean, even the jellyfish, as if it was climate change with sharp teeth. Ironically, it takes a nuclear blast to save Emily and Liam(John Gallagher Jr.) when Norah(Kristen Stewart), a mechanical engineer, stays behind to stop the sea creature and its minions from pursuing her friends in escape pods by raising the energy levels on the core.The sea creatures in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" are aliens, therefore smarter than their Mariana Trench counterparts. Mastery of ocean movement; that's their power. A water tentacle, whose salty tip is equipped with a camera eye, snakes itself aboard Deep Core, an underwater drilling platform, and identifies a trident missile, which poses an imminent threat to their survival. Although the humanoid in ""Underwater"" lacks the technology to anticipate a mushroom cloud(as seen in the director's cut of ""The Abyss""), it guards the Roebuck Station's entrance because instinct, something akin to waterlogged street smarts, tells the creature that Norah and her friends can harm it, once inside the facility. By default, Norah stays behind on account of a malfunctioning third escape pod. Torn between her love for Liam and her accountability in creating this biological anomaly, Norah punches Emily square in the face like an MMA fighter before the suddenly concussed scientist can make up her mind. Whereas the mechanical engineer had nothing to lose, the marine biologist would be a purer hero, since killing the monster, for her, theoretically, serves a higher purpose; a sort of penance, a hairshirt made from seaweed, after making the conscious decision to sell out science by helping a corporation destroy the ocean. Virgil(Ed Harris), in ""The Abyss"", knows that his descension to the ocean floor would be a one-way trip when he volunteers for the suicidal task of disarming the nuclear weapon. Oxygen running low, Virgil is resigned to die. But then, recognizing this man's heroism, the NTIs save Virgil and deposit him in a dry room, isolated from water, on their wet ship. On a screen, the aliens let mankind's representative know that they've been recording the evildoing of his kind for generations. A Godzilla-sized tidal wave is put on hold, frozen at its apex, because the aliens intercepted Virgil's last transmission to Lindsey(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). ""Love you, wife,"" he typed out. Thirty years later, the metaphor changed; this wave of mutilation, from a call for nuclear disarmament to climate change awareness; a threat. A man who loves a woman would not be reason enough to call off the sixth extinction. ""Underwater"" more than suggests that we're past the tipping point. This humanoid, symbolic of global warming, poses a greater danger to people than the radiation that emits from a nuclear reactor. Radiation couldn't stop Godzilla. Radiation can't do anything about the change in weather either.""Underwater"" updates ""The Abyss"" for the 21st century, via ""Annihilation"" with its theme of the human impulse for self-destruction, as a means to extrapolate how capitalism has run amok. Tian Industries conducted interviews. Liam can corroborate everything that Emily tells their corporate employers. The truth can be read between the lines of those misleading newspaper articles that drives the cover-up narrative in the film's epilogue. Despite the danger, the drilling company is going back, ready to face another, if not the same mutation, until every living creature in the ocean is annihilated. Whereas Deep Core would heed the aliens' warning and stop drilling, Tian Industries would set off another underwater nuclear bomb if anything gets in the way of its profit margin."
563,"Kristen Stewart (Norah Price) stars in movie as a mechanical engineer. Attracted by her icy-blond buzz cut, she intended to shave and dye her hair because with respect to (Alien)Can't u see the monster in poster? The answer s NO. It's attractive that shows mysteriously with a big bloody mouth. If you expect to see this monster, you may be disappointed, unlike other Science fiction movies, (The Meg, 2018) & (Life, 2017) the creatures doesn't show up usually. But with a dark, quiet scene, it's little terrifying when they suddenly attack the crewMany large and mysterious creatures are common subjects in movies, like Megalodon, Space creatures, Anaconda, Are they really exist. Since we only discover around 10% of the ocean, under the thermocline (between warmer n cooler water), temp decreases sharply and water is oxygen-rich, so giant creatures can be existing"

565,"Despite what some people say, there are similarities to the movie Alien. I'm not saying Underwater is as good...I'm just saying there are similarities.Some of the sounds reminded me of the creepy noise from Grudge.Various close-up shots reminded me of the tent scene from the Blair Witch Project.This wasn't an original concept for a movie, so there are probably a dozen+ more films that I could have referenced.I usually tolerate T.J. Miller, but he was extra annoying in this movie. I rooted for him to die and his stuffed bunny to make it to safety. I guess wishes can be granted.Most of the characters were forgettable.A lot of the scenes were very dark, so it was hard to tell what was going on, It was also hard to get a sense of direction and surroundings. I get that the bottom of the ocean is dark, but it made it hard to follow the ""logic"" of the characters.The pressure exerted at the depths that the characters were in would have made most of the movie impossible, so you have to just go with the flow on this one.I went into this movie with low expectations. I was not disappointed. I guess the scenes with the women walking around in their underwear were used to gloss over the lack of a reasonable plot."
566,"You know the movie is bad when:
1. There's only 1 setting, the whole movie.
2. Almost every person in the movie dies.
3. And the worst part is the main Character dies in the end... you got to be kidding me."
567,"Unless you're in isolation for the next couple weeks, and you've absolutely exhausted all forms of entertainment, then by all means, waste 95 minutes watching Underwater."
568,This is a very scary movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. There should be more movie like this. This is a very scary movie. I give it 9 out 10. 7 out of 10 is underrating this great movie
569,She touches creature without gloves. Lol How is that even possible?
570,"The premise is nothing new. We've seen it so many times before: DeepStar Six, Leviathon, Alien...Since 'Underwater' doesn't really bring anything new to the table, what would make me recommend it? Hmm, nothing really. Unless you enjoy this sort of genre and want to watch yet another film on the subject that might as well have been a remake of these films. I didn't think people actually still take Kristen Stewart seriously, but she does a damn fine job here. She leads the film almost as effectively as Sigourney Weaver does in the Alien movies.Kristen Stewart stars as Norah, the film's heroin and star attraction. Norah is a very strong, yet very sensitive character. And Stewart does her justice. I enjoyed the entire cast, and characters. Thankfully there were no cliched conflict between characters you generally find in these genre films. Instead, the survivors worked together like a team, and it was a refreshing change from the norm. TJ Miller stars as Paul, who allowed for the film's comic relief. Again, unlike other films, this character wasn't overdone or slapstick. His humor was more like a character trait, and funny in a very subtle way, and Paul was a likable character.There's loads of action and suspense here to keep the viewer interested. Thanks to the film's short running time, its tight and fast-paced, which I enjoyed.Would I watch it again? Maybe."

572,"I really enjoyed this film it had some very good acting as well as jump scenes and some genuine tension, the monsters were genuinely creepy and very nasty...
My only complaint was T J Miller, he was terrible and I'm afraid I cheered inside when his character was killed.Why has a lot of people said instead of watching this, watch The Abyss? The two films are nothing alike."
573,What a god awful movie! It must be Covid 19 movie fatigue to make this mess a premiere on Crave TV . Don't waste your time on this. You've been warned!
574,"The terrific part of Underwater is the song ""The Unknown"" which played while the end credits rolled. The movie was well, there was lot of water, there was lot gear, there were lots of debris, there was creatures of various sizes, there were 2 women and 5 men in all and there was one big VFX aided blast in the end. That's all I could fathom in the 90 odd minutes runtime.Jokes apart, the problem with movies such as underwater is that, the studios are banking on the same genre which had brought them bag loads of money previously. They are so blind to realise that this ""Genre"" is so overdone. I believe this particular story is literally stamped on the brains of people who are born after 1970, no kidding but seriously anyone among the audience watching Underwater would have been qualified enough to work with the director William Eubank on the story & screenplay. Yes, it was that simple, and horribly predictable.Apart from good Cinematography & a quality Production design team, there was absolutely nothing at all in this one BIG boring dull affair. Screenplay was a big letdown on this one. The basic necessity for any filmmaker is excite the audiences with novelty, I am afraid the production team of underwater completely failed to do so. Acting was another sore point of the movie. But I would have to thank the editor for keeping it around 90 minutes, I can't imagine watching the movie more than that.Overall, skip this movie and do something worthwhile for the 94 mins, I assure you whatever you do in that time will be much better than watching this movie. I still feel trapped underneath the Mariana Trench along with lame creatures in the movie. 3 stars for Cinematography & Production design."
575,"The monster and creatures were pretty funny! almost like those in cheap games, totally fake and unrealistic but kind of fun, anyway, I feel scammed cause the trailer promoted this movie like horror, and the creatures just made laugh because of the bad CGI xD, so my rating is for the scam, I only give 2 points for the amazing cast, the amazing music, sound desing and epic edition, but the cinematography was too dark, that's a thing to improve in the next movie, that's my advice to the photography director."
576,"Another movie which immediately attracts all Kristen Stewart haters who wont miss an opportunity to slander her to death. So the movie must be rubbish because its got K.S. in it, then we should kill it .
I'm not a fan of her, but this AntiKS thing I see in all the reviews about the movies she has a part really started to be sickening. Please go away an find a job to do because your rushy responses about how she can't act, how she can ever find a part in a movie, etc. are just pathetic.Beside that, movie is ok, ish. Plot could've been more interesting.
And about the lack of character development, well actually there is, as much as you can deliver within a few hours when you suddenly find yourself in an unexpected fatal crisis situation and realizing that you have almost zero chance of survival."
577,Kristin Stewart ruins every movie she is in. With her mouth always gaping open and all her stuttering. And in her underwear I guess to attract guys to watch her bad acting Ugh . You don't even get to know these people at all. So boring I was trying to not fall asleep.It just goes into The Abyss and Alien are much better under water movies.
578,"This movie is very entertaining and kept me and my spouse on the edge of our seats. The tension starts almost immediately and doesn't let go to the end. Kristen Stewart does a fine job carrying the film. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Stewart does NOT spend most of the movie in her underwear. I'd estimate it's probably about 10 minutes. I don't see what the big deal is. It fits in with the plot. Needing to not wear pants under the 'space suit' is typical, I thought. This is done by Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" and likewise it was not gratuitous. The other actors are engaging and interesting to watch. Especially entertaining is TJ Miller. He's so fun to watch. His firecracker humor is such a gas!"
579,"This film has no logical throughput. It starts with an explosion and then catapults the audience from one disaster to the next.There is not one likeable character as you never get to know anything about them, apart from a guy carrying a stuffed bunny... which I couldn't help thinking he could have been doing something a lot more useful... rather than worrying about the bunny.The action the characters go through is flimsy at best, with no real explanation for the viewers other than they are trying to get to an unused section of the drilling platform they are in.Perhaps I just prefer films with a more in-depth storyline and thought through characterisations.Would have preferred to know more about the creature... but there is never enough of the creature in these sort of films.Kristen Stewart is parades around in her underwear A LOT, where as the other women seem to be under contract to at least keep their T-shirt's on.Frankly think film belongs with the fishes."
580,"Gonna be honest, I've only seen half of this film. So, for this ""review,"" I highlighted the five stars mostly because I was required to in order to submit anything. I'm not a film critic or movie buff. I have no knowledge of film or film study (although I did take this one class in college). I say this because I want to be as transparent as possible, and admit that I am a movie plebeian and most likely have trash movie opinions.However, the people trying to undermine Kristen Stewart's body of work by adding that she isn't pretty, isn't feminine enough, or has a hair cut that makes her,""look like a boy,"" are disgusting. It only exposes THEIR discomfort with accepting people who are different and don't meet the lame, antiquated, and discriminatory standards, of conventional femininity and beauty, imposed upon actors in Hollywood.Critiquing her acting? Sure, ok. That's what critics do, right? They watch a film, do their own analysis, and provide the necessary feedback, supporting their review, for general audiences. Criticizing an actor's looks, though? That seems so trivial and subjective. Be better."
581,"Kristen Stewart was a real disappointment as this movie. The darkness in the scenes seemed to be there to hide details, scenes where similar to the last, plot was predictable and thankfully the audience got saw revenge when Kristen took her own life. I should have known 2 minutes into the movies when the opening credits were droning along. Then when you get into the movie more vague dark scenes. It just continued as a darkly filmed simplistic plot with over the top science. The dialogue wasn't very sharply written. Kristen show some acting chops and find something that has quality that builds to a climax rather than a dud. I should bill for my wasted time, It seems appropo that it cost me .93 cents to stream the movie. As they say you get what you pay for. ."
582,"Kristen stewart would make a great role in le miserable .. her limited 2 face expressions can help In a backup child showing in the back scene sad for losing his only penny. Seriously, she sucked as a vampire why on earth would they expect her to do better as human! This is it, from now on i am avoiding any movie she stars in or even act as a supporting actor.. it will be a 1 without even watching!!!"
583,"...you just made no. 1 on my list worst-movies-i-ever-saw!2 stars for some mildly interesting shots and the fact that amazon filters 1-star-reviews. It's actually worth zero.Cinematography and effects are done better in most current video games. Script is virtually absent. Dialog is embarrassing. I feel so sorry for Vincent Cassell. Is there anywhere I can donate some bucks to him? He must be desperate!Watch Alien, Aliens, The Poseidon Adventure, The Abyss or Sphere instead. All of those are ripped of by this film but even the least of them is far superior.Some Reviewer wrote that this makes The Meg look like Jaws. This is not true. It makes The Meg look like Citizen Kane."
584,"I didn't see much of the movie trailers, but I heard a lot of the #lovecraftian label being slung around when the movie came out. Eventually picked it up on Vudu, and I'm so glad it's in my collection. In fact, I think it's one of the best movies of 2020.It wastes no time in getting started. Lots of shots have incredible amounts of detail in them for those that pay attention, and follow scene-to-scene how those details connect. Lovecraft fans will notice a theme, and will pick up the sub-plot behind the scenes very quickly. Which adds to the excitement, and horror of the movie.For those not initiated in Lovecraft, you're going to miss a lot. It's going to seem like a simple horror movie, deep underwater, with potential scary monsters. And I can see how many average or negative reviews are coming from that. You will only ""get"" this movie if you've read some of the more popular H.P. Lovecraft works.Much like Lovecraft's works, I predict this movie will catch on later after home release. I hope it does.And if the movie seems muddy, and unclear, and chaotic at times - that's not lazy production. That's a nod to Lovecraft. Things are not meant to be clear. Things are meant to be insane, questionable, erratic.The sound-work further lends itself to this in it's horror sequences. And then in the calmer scenes lends itself to a confused contemplation. The theme of horror in the deep sea. The fear of the unknown. Dialogues between characters seem so natural. From banter between two characters pulling one out of the rubble, to lesser-sane moments of characters dragging each other across the bottom of the pitch black darkness.And the movie masterfully delivers a final act.Lovecraft fans - we're finally getting what we've wanted. We have The Color out of Space. and we have Underwater.""We shall dive down through black abysses ... and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever"" -H.P.Lovecraft"
585,"What is this movie? Is it attempting to feel like ""Life,"" which was quite good, or maybe the older movie ""Sphere,"" which had an awesome cast, is it trying to be even the Lifetime low-budget movie ""The Core?"" ""Armageddon,"" any of the new ""predator"" movies... it didn't know what it wants to be. Bottom line: it's so much worse than any of those movies.The screenplay is ok, the development is zero, the clarity is blurred and skewed, the acting is... fine... I guess. Kristen Stewart acted very well in the first of the Twilight Trilogy movies, but has since shown very little versatility and has become so incredibly annoying with her nervous stutter and exact same facial expressions and tone. She does well in this movie.Not interesting, hard to follow, difficult to see anything at all, inability to understand the goal and how-to of saving themselves... so they use our inability to see clearly to throw in a ton of LOUD noise and cheap jump scares. Not scary. Not good. Not horror. Not thriller. Not worth watching at all. Watch ""the core"" instead or ""the abyss,"" or watch a Lifetime movie."
586,"Although this a a different story, its blatantly trying to capitilize of the success of The Abyss. The inconsistent pace doesn't give you any hint of the drama that is about to unfold. FAIL!"
587,"I was actually surprised how well this came off. Although it is derivative of many other movies (underwater no one can hear you scream) it has it's share of jump scares and some very good action scenes. If you like h.p. lovecraft and enjoy screaming at the characters when they do dumb things, you will like it"
588,"This is a underwater, monster thriller. I would put it along the lines of Deep Star Six and Cloverfield. The action hits you right out the gate and the slow parts aren't too long or bad. Kristen Stewart gave a great performance and T.J. Miller was awesome as usual. Vincent Cassel and the beautiful Jessica Henwick also gave great performances. The lacking comes only from the fact that this movie has been done. For the younger crowd the will be something new but for those over 30, it will seem too familiar of a plot. Like I said, It's only good to watch if you're bored."
589,"Good actors , great costume, good effexts5, but bad story, bad script and mediocre directing... could have been epic..but it just feels something missing. The dialogue is bad."
590,"The concept for this story is very interesting, I feel the only major thing missing is another 30 minutes if background information and context. Its like you started watching a movie 20 minutes in. We already know what's happening, but what I want to know is why. If it was too much work to flesh out a back story they should have just left out the monsters all together and made it a straight escape movie to cut out the lingering questions and confusion. Maybe we'll get an extended cut that'll actually make sense"
591,"I predicted the entire movie death order. It shouldn't be that easy. Aliens underwater, just not as good."
592,"Who needs a plot when you have water everywhere? Explosions, chit chat, more explosions, oh look some creature, more water, a long trek, some crew members die. More chit chat, then self-sacrifice with more explosions. There I save the trouble of watching this nonsense."
593,"As these movies go, this one is not to bad, clearly a rip of the abyss/alien movies, but well done. To be completely honest I actually qiute enjoyed it, even though it was extremely predictable. Not the worst 2 hours of my life, but will probably still buy it for my movie collection."
594,"In my opinion as an avid move fan the viewers should be able to learn who the characters are, form likes and dislikes in a sense. Then the action should happen. If everything happens at the beginning, and everything is in chaos, we don't know who is who, and don't have any emotional attachment to any of them, so we don't really care what happens."
595,Okay first off this movie sucked . there was no back story the entire movie . and stewart literally CARRIED THE WHOLE TEAM ! and they killed the bunny guy who didn't even deserve to die . lastly that's emily character mad annoying .
596,Renting this from Redbox was a terrible waste of my time and money This production Hit BC a new all time low for worst movies I have ever seen The words don't exist to Describe just how awful it is.
597,Great movie for the thriller/horror genre. Yes there isn't alot of character development but you don't need that because you feel like you are along this traumatizing journey with the characters with how awesome this movie is shot and that makes you care. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Pro-tip: watch at night in a dark room with sound turned up loud!
598,"So much is wrong with this movie, that I just tried to forget about everything and tried to enjoy it. For a second I thought I was watching a Cloverfield movie, but apparently it only has a few links to that franchise. IMO this is lazy filmmaking and wasted dollars. I only managed to finish it, knowing it was under 90 minutes without credits. If you wanna watch a movie, just go find something better than this. I'm gentle with the 3 stars I've given it."
599,"Underwater sinks like a rock right after the introduction that already tells its viewer that something monstrous is lurking in the depth of the mariana trench. Clever move, lol. Anyway this is the milionth Alien clone with all the cliches you would expect, from the female computer voice to the everyday normies in an isolated and disastrous environment. And yeah there is a gonna be a murderous creature. Durr hurr.Unwatchable, cringy and awkward."
600,"This film surprised me in a positive way. I wasn't sure if I'd like it. The rating is quite low. I think it's too low. The characters are okay. They're pretty good considering there's not really a break in the action at any point. This is the opposite of a slow film. The pacing is lightning quick.Some of the character motivations and the realism of certain scenes did stir some skepticism in me. These suits they wear must be incredibly tough; far tougher than even the best space age technology because characters are dragged at high velocity over the ocean floor and yet there's never a rip or a break in these characters suits. That seemed to me to be a little oversight.Despite everything else, this film does one thing very well. Something incredibly important for horror films. This movie has a very strong sense of atmosphere. The set design is stellar. The CG and effects are exceptional. The monster element is a slow burn.A visceral sci-fi horror movie with obvious inspiration from alien and other space horror films featuring okay characters, decent performances, awesome CGI and atmosphere."
601,"Let's get the pros out of the way...the film does carry some suspense of claustrophobia.That's. About. It.Cons: Where to begin...how about the fact that this is supposed to be a multi billion dollar facility, yet its run by severely underqualified people. You have an actual intern with no experience underwater, Kristin Stewart, who though comes off as the Mary Sue, claims she's not diver certified, T J Miller playingT J Miller as the supposed comic relief when he's just annoying and a black guy who dies nothing but panic for the brief time he's onscreen. Also not qualified to be working in that kind of environment. The captain of the facility has a deceased daughter, that the crew doesn't know about. How does that make him psychologically qualified to lead this? Personnel cannot handle critical situations, as anyone even being considered to work down there should.And of course, the film has to have diversity thrown in our face. Not to mention that more than half the crew are in their twenties. Inexperienced millennials, anyone?So while the film doesn't look too bad, the characters are detrimental, killing any hope of wanting anyone to survive.And if you're gonna introduce Cthulu to the big screen, you failed miserably at it.90 minutes (which felt like two and a half hours) wasted."
602,"It makes me miss Ripley..again..

603,"This movie was barely in the theaters so I just watched it on Prime. I liked it. The pacing was good and it was entertaining. Some of the criticisms about the lack of originality in script are true. It was a bit formulaic.The criticism about it being too dark is valid, too. I don't know why new horror directors think dark means MURKY. If a scene is correctly lit it has a combination of darkness and light that intensifies the emotion. I'm guessing a large amount of the underwater scenes were CGI and they established that a lot of lights were still working on the rig so I have no idea why they didn't use that plot device to make a better lit movie. The ending was a little off, as well. The idea that a computer program would show a perfect representation of pods and creatures was pretty silly given how real the rest of the technical elements felt. And I didn't really agree with where the writer took the ending.I thought Kristen Stewart was good in it. She was pragmatic but still provided the 'heart' in the drama. The rest of cast was good, too and what you can see of the special effects was well done. Definitely worth a watch."
604,"When you watch this movie, every moment you are on the tip of the seat but do not know what happening and it is pity. They should lead the viewers better. The music the effects the acting very nicely done. Like the dry humor what did not push through most of the movie. Like they opening up the world of the undersea and what possible our future could looks like with good details only in some scene that is pity, this movie could be easily a three hour one, what could be made so much better but could be less much action and less horror scifi and leaning towards a more romance.
Hate that actors are cutting off that fast, so only main character is playing whole the time not that I am complaining but still more interaction will be nicer. The plot should be explained more in details so viewers could understand it better. Really like how they explain the environment problems that you face and with right effect.Good movie but could adjust more and the ending could be done better so it can lead to a second movie. It could be wonderful and even if they plan to do a follow up it is pity that they have this ending because now it is like starwars that end every section all the time (what is not not good but could be better)"
605,"First off I have to say that I expected very little from this movie, mainly because I find Kristen Stewart's acting very annoying.
That said, I generally find that having low expectations at the outset tend to make an average movie feel better than it perhaps was.
What I did like is that it avoided the common movie trope whereby the first half hour of the movie is spent giving us some background of the characters, what I would call ""the touchy feely"" section, before finally getting going with the story.
This movie dispenses with this ballast, and gets straight into the action, moving along at a good pace.
Others are correct in citing such movies as The Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and Alien.
I read another review that claimed that there was no explanation given for the implosion of the drilling station at the beginning, but I can only assume they did not watch it till the end.
I know it's not saying much, but this is Kristen Stewart's best movie so far."
606,"Underwater stars Kristen Stewart as a tech expert working on a drilling crew many miles underwater in the Mariana Trench. The title and opening voice over lend themselves to ambiguity, making the viewer wonder if all of this is taking place in the protagonist's mind, but the title cards and end cards imply that if she was imagining it, she wasn't the only one affected. You can ignore those little bits of misdirection if you want to, because the vast bulk of this movie is a good old fashioned underwater creature feature disaster movie. If you loved Leviathan, Deep Star Six, Deep Rising or even The Abyss, here's a movie very much in that vein (but particularly like Leviathan and Deep Star Six) only it's been updated with 21st Century production values. It also makes a valiant attempt to reflect overall 21st Century values, but the characters barely have time to do anything but react to the monsters and disasters, so it's not exactly rich characterization going on here. Still, it's fun to watch. I would recommend darkening the entire room and hooking up the surround sound to get the best experience."
607,"Another sci-if/ horror movie made with a PG-13 rating to bring in as much money as it can in theaters, but definitely not anything you would want to watch again that's for sure. There are quick edits of the ""monster"" whenever attacking the crew which makes it incredibly frustrating not being able to get a feel what they're up against. Most of the movie is of the crew running away from the sea monster things, and when the first one dies all you see is their helmet fill up with dark blood and get quickly pulled away. Same thing for each of the crew members deaths, just really fast crap editing to see as little as possible of anything. Kristin Stewart was ok in her ""Ripley"" type role, can't say the same for the rest of the cast, with the other female being way too annoying to care if she lived or died, and the other guy with the stupid connection to a stuffed animal. And the two survivors at the end seemed like the least likely people who would live at the end of this type of movie.I was somewhat interested in this type of movie after watching similar movies in the genre like The Abyss, Leviathan, or evening Deep Star Six. All are much better at telling a story than this nonsense. With a competent director (and cast) this could have been a decent flick, unfortunately all you'll get is a lousy PG-13 sci-fi/ horror flick you can easily catch on the USA network."
608,You can see the ending coming a mile away. Very predictable. Kristen Stewart plays her part well at least.
609,Can someone please tel me what happens in this movie? It seems like the movie was so focused on killing people that it forgot to stop and make sure it made sense.
610,"This movie was decent for what it is. Go in with moderate expectations and you'll be entertained. Don't worry about plot holes or anything being ""unrealistic"". I do have to mention that I found the lighting to be way too dark. Yes I know they're deep underwater but still. Overall a decent entertaining way to kill some time."
611,"Movie is a one time watch, It was high in production stayed true and direction also good. There were a few jumps scares. The story let the movie down it was just clishe could have come with something more better. It's a good entertainer no drag just enjoy"
612,"Seen a lot of bad reviews but surprisingly enjoyed it.
Alien & Gozilla mashup basically"
613,Movie takes off right from the beginning and never slows down. I thought it was a pretty fun movie. Easy watch. Whatever that creature was reminded me of Venom. The huge giant one was awesome looking. I'm guessing that was the mother. My only complaint was the ending. Would of been cool if Norah (Kristen Stewart) would of fixed that pod and escaped. I don't know why they went with the Bruce Willis Armageddon ending. Either way still worth a watch. 7 stars
614,"It's an ok film, well done and it's worth a watch.
It's just like watching Aliens but underwater, nice to see that they added the cover up at the end because that's what the Americans do in real life."
615,"So the movie is pretty bad, you don't need me to say it. But it was the ending that disappointed me the most. So there's this new specie at the bottom of the ocean, with some glimpses of intellect in the way they behaved. And what does our ""heroine"" decide to do at the end? Blow them the f up! Why? Why would you do that? To save the world from a bunch of slightly evolved octopuses? Ugh!.."
616,"Some Einstein make the fight scenes very fast and dark too. Very ""clever"""
617,"I'm surprised by the low ratings this movie gets, and the negative reviews, those are even worse to read. I wonder what people expect from an underwater horror movie? It's exactly what I wanted, a claustrophobic feeling during the entire movie, it made me sit at the edge of my seat from beginning till the end. I get anxious just by watching Underwater, certainly a thing I wouldn't do in real life, but it's a pleasant anxious feeling as I'm not in danger at all, just watching others suffer is enough for me. I don't know why you would want to compare this movie with The Abyss (which was also an excellent movie by the way), don't see the point of that, just enjoy this one, or skip this one and rewatch the 1989 classic but don't compare it. The acting wasn't bad at all, again I don't get why people criticize Kristen Stewart for this one, she did a good job playing her character. The only thing we learned here is that women shouldn't cut their hair short unless you want to be lesser attractive, then it's a good choice. Vincent Cassel never fails to deliver, and so did he again in this movie. The CGI's were not bad at all, and even if the movie is pretty dark (it's at the bottom of the ocean so that makes perfect sense) it's still good enough to be visually attractive. Underwater is suspense for the entire time, and that's the only thing I wanted when watching an underwater movie. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this one is way better than I expected after reading those misleading reviews."
618,"I am SO HAPPY I ignored the negative reviews on here. So so so so happy. This movie was almost EVERYTHING I wanted it to be.Seriously, what is wrong with these people? These negative nancys. This is an AWESOME movie! It's one of the only movies I've ever seen that never has a dull moment. Not a single one. Crazy/awesome/creepy stuff is happening AT ALL TIMES.Ok, so you're reading the negative reveiws here and you are undecided. Let me go over them real quick:The annoying guy that you hear mentioned in other reviews? He's barely annoying. Like, practically nothing. He's just a dude who uses humor as a defense mechanism so he doesn't GO CRAZY from fear.The darkness of the film? If it wasn't dark, it would be STUPID. You will see. A dark sea bottom MAKES this film.Kristen Stewart's acting? It's absolutely fine. People don't dislike her acting, they dislike HER. She rubs some people the wrong way. Her acting is absolutely convincing all the way through this movie.I saw someone complaining about the cgi. No, the cgi is perfect. This is coming from a guy who gave Alien:Covenant an awful review because I couldn't stand the cgi aliens. Yes, my standards are high, and I am telling you that the cgi is perfect here.I'm actually pissed. I'm pissed that I ALMOST listened to the negative reviews. This movie was great!"
619,"What i wrote in the summary is exactly what i mean, it reminded me a lot of alien due so many ways. Not storywise but what is happening sometimes, the baby humanoid creatures, reminded me of the eggs. The one being dragged by the monster and one creature is taken on board. and I can go on and on.But forget that, it's entertainment from the beginning until the end and it do has it moments. Still you can easily spot who is going to die. And the reason why Kristen is walking around a lot in her underwear is also a mysery. everybody is wearing clothes but she is mostly walking without clothes, in underwear.If you are into creature features you will adore this, it also reminded me on part of the monster of Cloverfield somehow. Still, Kristen did a nice job, i liked it, it's not going to win an Oscar but its well above mediocre. Some nice effects used (superslomo), sometimes a bit of weird editing too.
Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 4/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5"
620,"When it comes to horror and sci-fi I can remain open to a certain degree. I won't find myself watching the bottom of the barrel slithering around the dark corners of streamers, but movies like ""Underwater"" and others you'd probably find on the ""If you liked this..."" section hold a special place in my heart. I'll at least give them a chance and I did with this.I will say that I was, indeed, pleasantly surprised by this one. I enjoyed William Eubank's last movie ""The Signal"" and this one takes most of the good bits from it and expands on them. Obviously he had more of a budget with this and it shows, but the CGI leaves a little to be desired. That being said I was a fan of what he was trying to do here. I found myself getting immersed in the little world on display here.You've seen this movie before. Eubank knows you have, but he still runs with it. I feel like this is a case where that sweet balance is struck. It's familiar, but the kind that you welcome. However, the third act completely took me by surprise. It's what bumped this up to a 7 for me. I was reminded of ""Cabin in the Woods"" but a good way.The acting was all fine. Kristen Stewart and TJ Miller were the most enjoyable. You can tell the cast had some fun making this."
621,I don't understand all the negative reviews. Nice solid thriller/horror movie. Passes the time. Won't receive any Oscars but certainly entertained us. RECOMMENDED
622,"Movie is fun.. One mistake i found was you changed the dress, ID of Cap in closet at abandoned oil drill during second shot. Although, i really enjoyed it to be honest."
623,"From the start to the end, this movie tries to be an Alien style movie. The quiet interior pans at the start, the female suddenly thrust into a race for survival. It all started out well, but then it plummeted into the absurd with the danger that lurked below the depths. I won't spoil it anymore apart from to say the only saving grace is Kristen's tight physique. She must have worked out a bit for this one. The constant shots of her hanging her head in her hands was so bad though. The movie was just so predictable. There are some good scenes true to say, but by and large this was a bad movie."
624,"When during my captain years I was crossing the Pacific about 500 miles north to Nemo point I let my imagination run wild as I was thinking that I sail over Cthulu,s home disrespecting his privacy and waiting an immenent attack.......later on...watched all these deep sea disaster movies involving Leviathans Megalodons etc......it took almost 50 years till someone had Cthulu play the villainous monster..even it takes place in the usual Marriana trench monster infested area some thousands of miles to the westnorthwest of the creature,s fictional home (the furthest point away from land) so...one star for that plus another one for watching Kirsten and Jessica with their panties...other than that a very cliche and ordinary movie"
625,"This was a bit under the radar for me, had very low expectations and started off wit action. the creatures are awesome and more like a mi of aliens and the abyss. images where a bit to dark and grainy at times but overall it had me on my seat"
626,"This was a great 'B' movie, I wish people would just get off their high horses. It was a fun, brainless action/scifi flick for one of those nights when you just want to come home from work and turn off your brain for a little while and have some simple fun. Yea, there's literally zero character development, as a matter of fact I don't think I've ever seen a movie with no character development at all besides one or two sentences of character intro. The sets, acting and effects -- especially the effects -- were a lot better than I would have expected. There was a somewhat predictable 'twist', but still pretty fun and well presented. Overall, I'm glad I saw it, I really enjoyed my hour and a half of action and suspense, and I recommend it for anyone who is willing to give it a shot for what it is."
627,"This picture looks nice but rest of it is really waste of time and money. the story is boring and the worst thing is the bad science and physics of this movie. Such a shame that in this day and age with such huge tochnological potential most of the ""scary sci-fi"" movies are this bad."
628,"Yes, the movie is poorly made. First of all its just start, dont know why the maker just started the movie like that, a little lower pace would have been better. Further, as they are in sea with no light to see, so are the audience clueless as to what is going on.
This movie could have been made better in many many ways.
Waste of time for me."
629,"The Meg meets Life and that's pretty much it. Could be better, but it's good among the others with the same genre."
630,"This movie is a wreck. It tries to unify the best elements of Alien, The Abyss and Life into one movie, but fails to do any of these aspects right.
The film doesn't take any time to set up the characters and environment, it just throws you in and off you go. This can be a good thing if done right, but the filmmakers show us impressively, how it's done wrong. All the right ingredients did not blend at all.
Stewart does what she can with the given script, and again shows that she is an interesting and good-looking woman, but not a particularly good actor. The rest of the crew is pretty forgettable with a standard assortment of wannabe-badasses acting extra stupid. Yes. They basically make the crew of Alien Covenant look like geniuses.
The cinematography is all over the place. Some shots are really good, but then others are just dark and damp, where you can't tell whatsoever what you're looking at. The sound design hits every horror cliche and the music is a hodgepodge of a hundred scores you've heard before.If you're an avid Kristin Stewart fan, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but if you want to see a good horror scifi movie, you'd best stay away from it."
631,"The worst part about this movie isn't even that it has Kristen Stewart in it, it's that this movie is salvageable if it was in the right hands. You get zero introduction to anyone or anything in this movie, everything is learned on the fly which doesn't help make you care about anyone in the story. Some of the action scenes are done quite well, but the overall pace of the movie is backbreakingly fast for no good reason. If they had just taken a few steps back, taken a bit of time to show the who what and why of this movie and then start delving into chaos then it could have been a good flick. Instead you get this rushed mess. Add on another 30 minutes or so to develop the story a bit and you could maybe save this wreckage."
632,The movie its ok. It's not a great movie. you can have a good time without tiring you. we've seen the script before in some similar movies and the acting is from average to good. 7 stars its ok
633,"Pros - it was free to watch, it had a cool premiseCons - anything remotely science relatedWhile the entire substation oncept was interesting, I found much of it to be stupid.Drywall in the bathrooms - as well as wooden framing
Tiles on the walls and floors
Lots of wiring and electricalNow I uderstand that it was to be livable down there and also that it was a working environment - but to build something that big, send it far below the water and have it fuction to full capacity with as much space as it had - does not make any senseThe construction for such a unit is far too big to be functional and safe in an environment where nobody has gone and done a proper survey for constructionLet alone safety standards, who designed the building? Which arcitechts went below the water and decided to build such an enormous structure and how would they even think that it could hold up to the water's pressure?How about generating the plumbing systems and drainage for a full size bathroom facility with multiple toilet systems and sinks and showers?Then in addition, there is drywall and tiles on the walls...which drywallers decided to install sheets of drywall at 35 000 feet below the surface? How did it all work?What about all the electricians and the plumbers?That all involves hundreds of contractors - if not thousands - and then it also involves movers and people that are required to do daily operations such as cleaners, cooks, safety and health officials.For a unit as big as that substation was supposed to be, there should have been roughly 50 -80 people on the staff - and each of those people would require a certain amount of adequate space for movement.All this planning and then the operation of the drills and computer system will require massive amount of knowledge in construction - and I just don't see what kind of contractors would have the knowledge of designing something as big and operational without having any understanding of the depth and pressure and environment of the Mariana trench.What would have made this good is if this was a 2 or 3 part series where the initial construct was made, installed and then put to use - adn then all the trouble came about.To start this movie with everything in place already working makes no sense.The laying of wiring - as much as the construct has will require hundreds of miles of wire- and a team of people so skilled that the budget would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The plumbing systems, the framework and wiring, the cooking facilities and communication systems are all massive - and the design would takes years upon years to complete from initial design and layout to the end of it's construction.That would have made a far better story than just throwing people into an underground facility and having it fall apart.To see this operate from it's very beginning would have been so much more interesting.From the people in the offices talking about the design, to the designers, to the conctruction crew, to the training of the workers, to the installation, to the operation - until the point of the earthquake and damage.A 3 part movie or 1 very long movie that starts from the very beginning would have made this film just super awesome - but because of poor plot development and bad science knowledge, this sadly failed.It was so evident that they were walking roughly 30 feet below the surface - because after that, the movements underwater begin to totally change - and the temperature of the water becomes very very cold - let alone at 35 000 feet.They didn't look cold, they didn't look weak, they didn't look tired. They didn't look hungry. They didn't look scared.They didn't even seem like being in water would need to make them go pee.Believe me - when people are surrounded by water - they have to pee. When they are soaked, they have to pee.This was bad direction adn to not realize this made this film barely passable.Next time you are in a cold and wet environment with nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, worn down - trust me...you are going to pee. Maybe 4 times an hour.It was a good thing that the monster ate them - otherwise there would be more stupid people on the top of the planet - and we already have far too many as it is."
634,Boring movie nothing really happening. Some aliens lurking underwater which were very hard to clearrly see. only the first scene of earthquake is good...
635,"Uninteresting characters, drab dark environment. Predictable. Just rubbish. Don't pay to see this"
636,"Honestly I like the premise of this film. The execution was just brutal. Absolutely zero character development, I didn't really care about them at all. We have little to no idea why there were no other people down there other than our heroes. Jumping from scene to scene with little to no explanation or conclusion from that last. Camera work was all over the place. Sorry but this movie missed the mark big time."
637,"This is simply crap. I'm not going to waste your time comparing it to other movies, filmakers, or actors. Anytime an interminable amount of time in a movie is spent crawling through tunnels in the dark, you know to turn off the video and find something else to do.
As has been stated elsewhere, Stewart picked up a check for enticing her cult to watch this dreck. We all get to watch her toned self run around in her underwear because, uh, there's nothing else of interest going on..if you find even that of interest."
638,"Scenes are cut too fast to care what is happening. No developments in character or plot. Everything is so dark you can't make out any details of what people are looking at when they point to something and say ""hey look at that, wow what could have done that"".Plays like it was a 2 hour movie that has been chopped down so much it's basically nonsense.Seemly they pulled straws to see who was going to play what character and nobody liked what they got.Forgettable and bland even for a pg-13 movie. With this cast and budget you won't believe how disappointed you will be."
639,"One would think that after years and years of these movies coming out with the same or very similar stories, they would try some new ideas or concepts in order to take this sub-genre to a new place but no. It would be wiser to just watch the predecessors of this movie.An underwater research facility and its staff is threatened by creatures that live in Mariana's Trench."
640,Just barely worth watching for the close-ups of Kristen Stewart's bare feet as she runs around in her Underwear (which would have been a better title). She does have nice feet.
641,"Kristen Stewart's latest (actually it sat on a shelf for a couple of years) borrows heavily from Alien & The Abyss as we follow survivors of an underwater oil rig which has collapsed. Needing to get to safer ground, they must sea walk to different stations before gaining safety at an abandoned section of the complex where the only escape pods reside. Besides the usual choke points found in these wet climes (pressure, visibility, the need for oxygen), we have underwater creatures (released from the drilling) on the stalk. Running a brisk run time & knowing exactly where the story will be at any given second, the onus should've been on the director William Eubanks (he made an interesting film back in 2014 named The Signal which had a good look to it but also suffered from story in-cohesion) to tweak things by twisting expectations but we're never in doubt on how this monster mash will end. Co-starring T.J. Miller, Vincent Cassel, Jessica Henwick (Iron Fist's Colleen Wing) & John Gallagher Jr."
642,"With Underwater, the title doesn't leave much to the imagination, as the film starts off well... underwater. We see an exhausted Kristen Stewart with a shaved head, as she brushes her teeth in a facility bathroom on her own. While the surroundings remain silence, with a few vibrations and the occasional flickering of the lights, it isn't not long into the film where Norah (Kristen Stewart) is sent into a panic rush, as high-pressured water bursts through the walls. Leaving everything behind, Norah bolts down the halls, banging on doors to alarm crew of the danger. With no time to slow down, Norah bumps into crew member Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) and the two find themselves shutting themselves off from the possibility of drowning.As the two surviving members recollect their focus and thoughts, survival instincts kick in and the two squeeze their way through tight gaps to gather with fellow survivors along with the Captain (Vincent Cassel). The small group of survivors form together, and head towards a control room as they try their luck at contacting above water for help but receive an unsuccessful response. With oxygen running low, the Captain takes authority in attempt to rescue his crew, but to get to the crew to safety, they must dive lower where they discover that they're not alone out in the deep blue sea.Where Underwater lacks in backstory to where and why these people are deep down underwater. The film makes up for it with some suspenseful scenes and impressive looking graphics. However, I felt it was hard to build any connection to the characters, as we don't really learn much about them to grow any attachment to.I know I'm going to sound like a broken record here, as this has been quoted so many times prior, but Kristen Stewart struggles so hard to show more than one expression. The tone in her voice remained the same whether she was scared, angry, or happy, it was all the same. Her whole performance wasn't bad, however with Stewart being the lead role in this film, she needed to deliver more as I struggled to feel the emotions she was going through.Ultimately T.J. Miller who plays the character Paul, becomes the glue to the film with his hilarious sense of humour, his love for his rabbit plushie and strong presence on-screen.Overall, despite my criticism, I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend Underwater to fans of horror and sci-fi."
643,"Underwater makes up for its derivative plot with satisfying action and impressive visuals, along with a charismatic performance from Kristen Stewart. Though the film is little more than a generic sci-fi thriller, fans of the genre could do much worse. Go in with reasonable expectations and enjoy the ride."
644,What's the point of repeating the same story over and over again? Is that really profitable? Because who cares about anything else in Hollywood?!Don't worry about this movie being predictable. It's not... Because you can't believe they will repeat the same thing again! So wait until the end in hope of something different will happen in this girl-and-the-doomed-crew-against-the alien-monster. Wait and see...
645,"Here we see Lovecraft meet Pacific Rim. There were several major plot holes, and the only real fear factor was the claustrophobic aspect of being underwater for prolonged periods of time. The concept had potential, but was poorly delivered.Kristen Stewart still struggles to show any emotion besides angst."
646,"William Eubank's claustrophobic subaquatic disaster film succeeds in reeling audiences into its uncomfortable world of darkness and fear. From Ravi Bansal's brilliant art direction to Marco Beltrami's anxiety inducing score, to Dorotka Sapinska's amazing costume design that perfectly fuses modern-day tech with rich sci-fi elements; ""Underwater"" assembles an all-star team to create a fascinating world ripe for exploration and discovery. Unfortunately, due to its rushed plot, spotty writing, and hasty character development, for all of the great audio and visual pieces presented, it all winds up feeling just a tad bit shallow.The opening credits of ""Underwater"" quickly catch the viewer up to speed with the kinds of operations that are being conducted. A company by the name of Tian Industries has begun drilling several miles deep into the bottom of the Mariana Trench in search of a variety of resources. It is here where we board the Kepler 822 Station and meet our primary protagonist in Norah Price (Kristen Bell). We hear her discuss the psychological issues brought about when being several miles under the sea, when suddenly, catastrophe strikes causing a segment of the station to become ruined. From here on out, Norah traverses the station meeting up with a few allies along the way. When her crew is fully assembled, Captian Lucien (Vincent Cassel) takes charge and determines that their only chance of survival is to walk along the ocean floor until they reach Roebuck Station 641, another facility located just a mile away. The crew equip their gear and embark on a mile-long walk across the seafloor all while being hunted by an unknown aquatic creature that stalks them every step of the way.""Underwater"" features a premise that is sure to make any thalassophobe panic. Sadly, the premise alone is the only frightening quality of the film. This is caused by a couple of major issues; the first being, the writing, and characterization. Within the first five minutes of the film's ninety-minute runtime, the audience is instantly thrust into the disastrous action of ""Underwater""; it is at this point where you will know exactly what kind of a ride you are in for. The film tosses you right into the deep end (which is not inherently a bad thing) before establishing any core elements of the plot. Adam Cozad and Brian Duffield pen the script and create a handful of characters that we as the audience are expected to care for; we don't. This issue stems from the fact that the film never takes the time to establish any of our central characters; we know nothing about them and are instead spoon-fed key details through forced dialogue as events are rapidly flashing before our eyes. The characters appear as nothing more than vessels for the plot to continue onward, as the little characterization we do get from each member of the crew, is lackluster and dull. Everyone is here as all of the characters embody an archetype we have all seen before; Norah, the team's glue, Lucien, the hard-nosed leader, Emily Haversham (Jessica Wenwick), the frightened, yet optimistic rookie, Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), the level headed focused one, Paul Abel (T.J. Miller) the funny guy, and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie), the nervous and sporadic one. Every character is defined by a singular trait, that to the film's credit, they never lose sight of. However, because of the surface leveled nature of these characters, you will either enjoy them at the start or grow to loathe them in the end. Another note that should be mentioned, is that every member of the crew already has a pre-established relationship (once again this is not inherently a bad thing) which means that the writers must properly ""sell"" these character dynamics to us; tragically, they do not. The crew is presented to us as being friends, but because we as the audience have no prior knowledge of how or why they are friends, we can not reasonably buy into their friendships since it feels all to forced. It is a shame because the ensemble cast does their best, but could have done something great, instead, they are forced to read dialogue that does the bare minimum. The disconnect we have with these characters continues to haunt the story during nearly each and every one of its emotional beats. On the plus side, our small crew of characters all remain constant in both their actions and words throughout the entirety of the film.""Underwater"" suffers from another major issue that holds the film's potential back. All of the marketing leading up to the release of the film put forward this concept that it would be an underwater thriller; the marketing department did not lie. However, it's just not very scary. With the exception of a few POV shots quickly showcasing the creepy cryptid, the film feels more action-oriented than anything. Every time the film prepares to show off the lurking beast, it does so by ratcheting up the score and blaring a foreign sound for nothing more than a boring jump scare, every scare is laughably predictable. What makes this even worse, is that early on in the film, the monster is displayed in a manner that truly makes it seem like a terrifying threat, which in some regards it actually is. But, ultimately this cthulhuesque movie monster feels like a glorified nuisance that will sadly be forgotten.""Underwater"" is a film that personally bothers me. The costume design, the creature design, and even the set design are more than exceptional. Eubank's camera work shows a true brilliance in how to establish tension while also displaying a profound beauty within the film's dark atmospheric world, as he and Bojan Bazelli work in flawless tandem to exhibit some genuinely awe-inspiring moments. Yet, on the other hand, when inspecting the film's narrative, you will find a flimsy story that feels uninventive. These two conflicting elements make this film a jumbled bag. If you wish to have fun and view an atmospheric thriller, ""Underwater"" is for you. If you are searching for anything else, you would be better served looking elsewhere. Aside from the less than stellar writing, I found myself enjoying this film far more than I had anticipated, and I would certainly say it is worth the watch.Final Verdict: C+"
647,"This movie fits the word mediocre perfectly. It doesn't do anything that great nor does it do anything that bad. Decent acting from most of the cast. Weird comedic timing from TJ Miller where most of his lines come off unnatural or just don't land. I liked the pacing of the movie, even the fact that there was close to no exposition. You pretty much know just as much as these characters and they are all likable enough that you don't want anyone axed. Fun watch, over quick."
648,YIKES...this is the worst! It took me 10 minutes before I quit watching this trash. I do not know who Kristin Stewart is but I sure do now. Quite possibly the most unlikeable actress I've ever seen. How do these no-talent people get so famous?
649,NOBODY BUYS kristen stewart as the leader of an underwater investigation whatever whateer SHE STINKY
650,"I was so relieved when the main character died as it meant that the end of the film was finally in sight. It clearly had a high budget, but execution was shocking. There must have been times when the production team got together and discussed the filming. Did no one speak up and say 'guys, we are making a terrible job of this'. If it was not possible to recover the rest of the film, they should have just abandoned it, and gave the money to charity."
651,"Todays casuals may dream of cgi avengers next fight with cgi robots. While spiderpig is crying like a wimp. A movie thats more videogame then movieart.
Me on the other hand wants realistic horror scifi thrillers that looks reminicent of the 80s. If you find beauty in dark desolate minimalist architecture and cool dense enviroments and a sense of retro fashion like alien, the abyss, event horizon, moon and recent ad Astra, bladerunner and arrival etc you will absolutely love dig this movie. Its not the best one. But if you compare to the absolute crapfest of crap movies this year, Underwater certainly sticks out. And who doesn't love deepwater b thriller set in the deepest ocean on earth.
These type of movies rarely get recognition as
Pure entertainment made with craftmanship and talent. Wich is sad. I give it a 10 just to even the bad scores from teenagers."
652,"Extremely similar to the movie ""Descent ""... didn't hold my attention at all... ""Descent"" was better..."
653,This was a complete waste of $6 on Amazon prime. Too bad I wanna gash up Kristen Stewart
654,My wife and kids loved it not what we expected didn't even know anything about it hitting theaters better late then never like to see what happens after like a start to something big
655,"Of course it could be more interesting if they showed the everyday life of the crew just a little bit before everything went to chaos, but that's mostly it. Movie has interesting turnarounds and even moments that made me back-up from the screen, extremely rare titles succeed at this. Effects were neat. Also i've read a lot of comments like - ""it's very dark""...it's the bottom of the Pacific Ocean lady, illuminated by their costumes, what do you expect, sunshine? At least it wasn't Dothraki levels of dark.
Shame it has such a low rating, maybe they haven't tried to appease the woke culture, but instead focused on the production.
Also i would like to point out that plot shows its unforgiving relation with the characters...no plot armor and that makes a scary movie good."
656,"I have juste create my account on IMDb to comment that movie.
I can't described how surprised / chocked I am.That so BAD..., its empty, the void, the blackhole....
Its understandable, I want to cry!"
657,"This film is not a masterpiece, but boy oh boy is it well crafted and fun. I had seen the teaser and thought OK, this is another DeepStar Six or Leviathan and I didn't have that high expectations, but I was in for a surprise. Yes, the film is murky and dark (on purpose) but the acting is spot on, the set design and props are solid and I felt like I was 100% in a real place. I also got a solid Soma vibe.Give the film a chance if you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft. You're in for a treat. :)Underwater gets a solid 8 from me."
658,"Went into this with high hopes.
A very underdeveloped story about a mining crew once again going to drill into the earth and poison everything for human gain. They stumble on creatures that live around the area that they are drilling (no delvelopement on their story either) and spend the next hour fighting them off with about 12 nonsense scenes that the director tries to cover up Kristen Stewart's inability to act by having her run around in her bra and underwear. Only to in the end have her kill the whole nation of creatures to save her two idiot friends. Once again a naive approach to how humans go in, poison everything, and then kill all the other life forms that retaliate for us invading their home in the first place."
659,"Fifth-rate underwater version of Alien.Oh - and why did the women run around in bralettes and bikinis, while the men were fully clothed - except TJ Miller's tattooed torso? (Hey, let's give credit where credit's due - TJ obviously worked out to prep for this roe!)"
660,"First, the bad:
Mothman ass opening credits. Genuinely looks like an X-files episode. Utterly at odds with the movie they made.Director has no idea who the adversary is/what it wants/what we're supposed to know about it, or think that it is. Not knowing this, there's nothing communicated by any of the choices, and aside from some cool ass creature design, and some absolutely gut seizing scares (which will hit extra hard if you are scared of tight spaces or of drowning), the adversary remains largely unknown the whole movie: but not in a cool, on purpose sort of way.Studio stayed out of things for the most part, but the finale is just...why? Sacrifice? Very noble. Retribution, though? Not in the cards. Director presents presence of the adversary as due punishment for humanity's transgressions pretty early on...yet someone chooses a 'let's blow this all up and take you out' finish? Didnt fit, didnt like it.The Good
Delightful cast. TJ Miller surprises, and his camp is welcome against the bleak backdrop. Kristen Stewart is terrific; she's enormously *in* the movie, and rarely seems to be acting, which is a contagious thing - her conversations with other people are rare fare for movie screens; it seems like people talking to eachother in an insane crisis. Not delivering lines. Unusual and welcome.-Kristen Stewart is so hot it's upsetting and distracting. Someone was like 'So, I heard you liked Sigourney Weaver changing into a space suit. How about that, but for forty minutes?' Weirder bc it doesn't feel lascivious, she's just absurdly fit and covered in water for a long time.
The suits/props/real sets. Feels like it came from late 80's-early 90's - the diving suits, in particular, have that uncompromised feel to them. It's a great design vision throughout, and it NEEDS it, because the movie doesnt have a good sense of place, and the sets really step up to entertain in that absence.The adversary is spooky as heck. Everything after the little one is cool as heck...though, why a super-subterranean, super-deep ocean...biped? Why do they have eyes? Nothing else down there does. Miller jokes about them looking like slenderman, and they do, which is spooky, but...bizarre? Coupled to never giving them any clear purpose, the humanoid form seems like a mistake.I'm pleased I rented it, really enjoyed it, and am probably going to check it out again - we'll see if the bad choices make a second watch unpalatable."
661,"A cliche creature movie , too boring at times.
Only a diehard Christian Stewart fan can watch this without banging your head on the lost two hours of your life."
662,Unengaging claustrophobic murky poorly lit no plot alien underwater retread signaling the end of the main actresses career.
663,"I've been an oilfield/salvage diver for almost 20 years. I've seen lots of crappy diving movies, and this one takes the cake. I guess they thought hiring technical advisors was a bad idea. What a joke...and why do they keep casting Kristen Stewart in movies!? There goes and hour I'll never get back..."
664,"A standard, run of the mill monster flick.Hardly any tension, the 'scares' are obvious and the acting is sub par for the majority.If the roles of Emily and Nora had been reversed, this would have made for a much better movie.Stewart simply doesn't have the range to act this kind of role, she should have been the engineer who'd found a way to survive on the Shephard while everything else was going to pot.The monster, although a great design (having elements of Giger and Lovecraft,) simply isn't seen enough. I get it, you don't always need to see the monster for it to be threatening, but this film seems to go out of its way to try and show you what the crew are up against, but someone has turned the lights off and simply said 'not happening!'There's a conflict of camera work against film direction that just turns this into a bit of a jarring mess.Worth a watch if you want a cheap popcorn flick, but for horror/monster fans, look elsewhere."
665,"Just watched this with my wife. Is it the best movie out there? No. Is it a bad movie? Not at all. The acting was well done, the CGI was convincing, and there were several times that I experienced the sense of dread associated with being underwater and in a claustrophobic environment. Definitely worth a rental."
666,"This film needed another 20mins at the start with everyone working together drilling/working etc to get to know the characters and care bout them before hell is set loose. Like Alien. Maybe was cut, as short run time. The audience needs to be scared for the characters, and need to care about what happens to them. They should've delete the last monster scene and add first 20min+, I felt that what this movie lacked the most, was a purpose. Sure ""survival"" is a purpose, but who are these people? What were they really mining for? What were the creatures? Why did they do what they did? The ending hints at some possible sinister connections, but since this isn't meant to have any sequels (and certainly won't be profitable enough to warrant any), we won't get any further information. It felt like an idea for a movie, that never was developed into a full plot, but which was filmed regardless."
667,"This movie is utterly boring and at no moment is capable to draw the spectator in. I am a big fan fo SF/Fantasy and Underwater movies, but this no, better rewatch your favorite Underwater movie what ever that is than go through this!"
668,"After struggling with my dislike of this actress for no reason , I can finally set it all to rest after tolerating this movie . I like her .. I like her a lot ..The high point is the actors
The low point is everything else ..
Especially the failure to give us a real and discernible environment in which to have the action play out.Had we had more time inside the Kepler Station, we would have had more connection to why they were so far underwater. Couple that with introducing us to the dead bodies littered along the way.. and u might have had a good movie!
Part of our love of the Alien film series, is that each one has its own cast and its own envirantfir is to identify with after the movie is overWithout that.. we are left with a murky, mess that ends up boring us and having us come up for air long before the film intends us to do so !"
669,"This is a competent thriller reminiscent of Alien. Undersea mining operation mishap creates life threatening situation of the survivors at a nearby base. And a struggle for survival it is. Dark viewing given the 6 mile under the surface setting. Stewart somehow manages to instil her lax, disenfranchised persona with technical science knowledge to be the driving force to solve the situations. And she is rather believable in the role. The rest of the cast do what they can with standard character roles. The film brings nothing new to the genre, but it does display what the director and production crew are able to do (and do well). If you enjoyed revisiting Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and other such undersea creature films, this one rises above the cliches."
670,"A rip-off of ""The Abyss"" what was an underwater (sic!) rip-off of ""Alien"". Looks very cheaply made and totally unoriginal in 2020. Kirsten Stewart is not Sigourney Weaver and the director is not Ridley Scott. And they will never be. Of course there is a monster, which obviously is BIG because it has to best both Alien and Abyss. The monster is played as a surprise but since its on the movie poster noone will be surprised by it anyway. So basically you sit through an extremly boring movie for the monster to show up. You have better things to watch, really."
671,"Colour me surprised. Everything from the trailers to the posters for Underwater made it seem like a rehash of a thousand better survival films, and while it absolutely has a few cringe-worthy moments and it not afraid to completely steal ideas from other films, it's actually quite a solid little thriller. My expectations were incredibly low, as I was expecting to hate how derivative it would feel, but I never really did. I'm shocked to say this, but here's why I believe Underwater (especially if you're a fan of survival movies) is probably worth your time.The premise is simple. A mysterious occurrence ruptures a submarine underwater, causing many of the crew members to parish. The few survivors left, band together in order to come up with an escape mission. This movie could've benefitted from much more development of its characters and a little more time to spend with these characters before the event itself, but the filmmakers clearly just wanted to place you in a survival story right off the bat. Once you get past the rushed feel of the first act, this movie becomes very enjoyable.The main character in Norah is played by Kristen Stewart, which was something else I was apprehensive of before viewing. Not that I think she's a bad actress, but she's never exactly blown me away in any of her roles. I think her performance in Underwater is probably the best she's ever been. Not only does she deliver something different than she ever has, but she almost feels like someone who would actually have a job like this. Where this movie suffers, however, is through the events of the third act.While it becomes obvious that the third act will be a giant spectacle as the film progresses, I wasn't expecting it to go as far as it did. It almost felt like the conclusion to a different movie. Underwater begins as a film that pays homage to the first Alien film but becomes a generic CGI-fest by the end. Still, the effects themselves were actually quite good and I was invested enough to not let it hurt the movie too bad. Aside from an overblown ending and a rushed start, this movie hit all the right marks for me.In the end, Underwater certainly won't be winning any awards, but it's a fun little creature-feature nonetheless. Kristen Stewart is solid in the lead role and supporting performances from Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel stood out to me as well. T.J. Miller is present as the comedic relief, which honestly just felt unnecessary, but there's a lot more good than bad here. If you're looking for a quick little thriller to watch, there are much worse options. Underwater was a pleasant surprise."
672,"Hi,
I need to disagree with ""some"" and not all of the comments - yes the movie did show some level of ""ok, I am a little confused"" but overall - the movie was actually not that bad.. I actually found the movie to be ok, and while I agree, there isn't much depth as to the background and ""why / how"" but still found the movie to be ""Ok"" - not worthy of a blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination, but something to fill in the time."
673,"At 90mins you get a quick and breezy creature-feature outing of simple b-origins. It's a fine film, if nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a roller coaster ride. No real standout set-pieces, which leave a lasting impression but there are a few moments which give you a quick rush. Likely all forgotten a week later.Surprisingly I enjoyed the 30 min claustrophobic build-up and mystery way more, and that's before the monsters' screen time takes centre stage. And it really throws you right into the disaster, much quicker than expected and tautly takes hold as you gather info on the fly. The first death surprised me. However it seems to go for jump scares when the focus shifted to the creatures, and in doing so it sorta lacked tension at times, even character tension. Maybe this is because we don't get any time with the characters before the chaos hits the fan. As for the murky imagery of the underwater scenes, it didn't bother me much, compared to say the editing around the attack scenes. But my interest was definitely beginning to drift, especially when the group (in their indistinguishable suits) are walking around on the ocean bed. It's not until Kristen Stewart's ingestive encounter and a Lovecraft-like monster reveal is where it had me hooked again. Too bad this magnificent looking beast comes on too late. The acting chops of the headlining cast, makes up for the thinly written character beats. It's actually quite strong showing by Kristen Stewart, who really does pull you along for the ride. Making the most of her part, and definitely holding the picture together. Hell, even TJ Miller was bearable."
674,This movie is thriller and mind blowing. Wow. Wow. Very beautiful
675,"A mix of movie cliches of the genre, don't waste your time, it lacks the desire of show something original."
676,"Did not expect this movie to have Alien type creatures creating havoc and killing crew. Acting was atrocious and plot was beyond sci-fi expectations. I guess liberal oriented movies these days require flat chested women to be the heroines that save the day, (Quoting a line in the movie) There are no negative ratings on this site so I will go with Zero., don't waste your time watching this loser."
677,"Watched this film hoping it would be good.... Didn't disdopoint.... Great monster movie.... One of the best I've seen in quite a while..... Very atmospheric and chlosterphobic.... Lots of tense moments and it doesn't let up at all for the entire 95 minutes..... Highly recommended, more like this please.... Hope it gets a 4k release one day.... Enjoy...."
678,"It has been a long while since we got a new good undersea horror movie. And this one, while slow in the first 5 minutes, goes of the rails into it fast.Set in 2050, the realistic looking deep sea tech fails catastrophically. Communication lost and all escape pods gone. The survivors stuck on a sea elevator midpoint residential station now have only the option: go down.You will feel claustrophobia out of the get go, skeptisim in the calmer parts, and paranoia as the survivors go deeper and deeper in search of means to escape the depth alone, leading to part the climax and questioning what really caused the catastrophe.Only drawback is the smalltalk when nothing is happening. Preachy, annoying or just boring and meaningless. But overall makes sense in the situation.A stronger horror film than most out there."
679,Ignore the review ratings!I went to watch it with very low expectations. I left the movie pleasantly surprised on how good it really is.
680,No characters. No set up for the story. Unbelievable setting. Pretentious jokes. Useless tons of cgi. Pretty girls in the abyss.
681,I guess I can be better than the director as he has no idea how to present a movie that can link it up to be understood. Stupid even trying
682,"Kudos for attempting to do something original, the idea is not bad as besides The Abyss and Sphere I can't think of a lot of movies with the deep sea/ocean exploration narrative. But, everything else is just bad, first of all you can barely see anything through the whole movie, the cast was looking promising but because everything is so rushed there is no character development and you dont really care about anyone also, maybe is just me but Vincent Cassel just doesnt look good as a good guy and his casting here was a bit misplaced. There is no reason to blame Kristen Stewart for the acting here as the movie just sucks and no matter who the actor was instead of her it would still suck. Probably the only good thing about this movie is that Jessica Henwick is gorgeous. Skip this one and watch The Abyss if you didnt already."
683,"Wow.. Just wow.. This is Whole Family fun pack Movie.. Don't listen to those critics.. Go watch Without any expectations, you'll love it.. Flawless Acting of Kristen Stewart 10/10.."
684,"Formulaic, featureless & forgettable yet managing to be genuinely thrilling in bits n pieces, Underwater approaches its 'Cloverfield meets Gravity on the ocean floor' premise with a frenetic but promising start yet fails to make the most of it, thanks to its derivative plot, awful characterisation & several other shortcomings that get exposed as story progresses.Directed by William Eubank, the explosive opening does provide good momentum to the story but the director is unable to capitalise on it, and once more characters show up, their dull interactions & bland chemistry do enough to ruin the palpable sense of danger. Eubank neither heightens the claustrophobic element at play nor puts effort to make the characters interesting.There are a few gradually escalating moments of tension & suspense but majority of them fall short of delivering the maximum impact. Kristen Stewart renders her character's fear with naturalness but her arc isn't properly fleshed out. Remaining cast is more or less terrible, with T.J. Miller & his jokester persona being the worst of the bunch. Not one character in this film is worth caring about.Overall, Underwater comes packed with genre tropes & clichés and is predictable for the most part but its breezy pace, consistent thrills & final creature revelation still makes it an adequately entertaining aquatic horror. A mediocre effort at best, the film is a wasted opportunity of sorts, and if it wasn't for its lazy writing & lack of vision, much more could've been accomplished with the provided material."
685,"I like sci-fi and ""The Abyss"" and ""Aliens"" got to be among my favorite movies of all time. It would be easy to slam this one as a cheap rip off of those two (which it kinda is), but still, I can't deny the fact that I enjoyed watching this. There are some obvious drawbacks though: it gets to the point right from the get go. In fact, so fast that you don't care about any of the characters. The movie is also cut and shot in a way that half of the time you can't tell what the hell is actually going on. On the plus side of things, the movie is compactly short so you don't really get bored and the monster design is effective. Stewart also does decent job as the main protagonist. With little more attention to detail, this could have been great."
686,"Alien but underwater creature and underwater station instead of space station . Near the end they have the protagonist running around in her 2 peace with some leggings ... nice body other than that the film is just ok .
I like Vincent Cassel he is good in this ... need to see him in more features ."
687,"Not that good and not that bad - something to kill some spare time without using too much of your brainpower. The actors and effects are good, the end boss is a fine species (greetings from Lovecraft) but the story is more or less right out of the textbook of making a sci fi action movie. Anyway, if you want some solid produced stuff you may try Underwater, but like I stated recently in too many reviews and too many times regarding new movies these days: the story can't reach or hold the level of the production. Underwater: a solid flick but in my opinion a missed opportunity to make something really remarkable.Recommended if you like such movies like The Abyss, Deep Star Six, Leviathan, or their counterparts in space like Alien, Pandorum, Life etc."
688,Alright in terms of a Sci-Fi and kept decent tension throughout. It's something to pass the time.
689,"What do you think of a movie made with some 8 actors, 80 CGI people and Physics to laugh at? Right. Go watch another thing."
690,"UnderwaterI enjoyed this movie but it's not everyone's cup of tea. We had a simple linear jump scare movie set in an underwater mining base. Much was reminiscent of Alien just set under water.What was goodA great tense atmosphere we were straight into the action. There was a great feeling of being trapped and my claustrophobia was jangling 10 minutes in..... ahhKristen Stuart was good in delivering a clunky script, she made this work and the camera loves her look.Great underwater special effects it really was quite gripping.What was not so goodI thought it was an over simplistic plot, no back story on the ""creatures"", no proper character development.The horror was limited to ""jump/scare"".Lack of variety in the situations.The survivors were the ""duds"" of the group....lolOverall it was good but with some minor tweaking could have been so much better."
691,"It's worth a watch if your into Sci-Fi.
It's a hybridization of a number of past genre movies.Very dark screen at times. I wanted to give them a push at times to hurry along and get over dragged out scenes.The voice over at the end ruins any finalistion the protagonist was building towards."
692,I watch many horror sci fi movies from blockbusters to low budget found footage. This movie could have been great with special effects. I have mixed feelings about Kristen Stewart. I like her since she was a young actress but she has certain facial expressions that distract me. I don't think she is the type of actress that you can focus the camera close to her face without it feeling weird. You can zoom in certain actresses that can act without speaking. Just their expressions. I think she would do better in a ensemble cast. I definitely think this movie is about a 5 or 6. But I'm very tolerant of sci fi horror movies because there not many out there. I wish Kristen could get some acting lessons to help her not make the same expressions in every movie she is in.
693,"Clearly should have been rated 'R"" based on sensual images, language used, and intense imaging with fright and gore."
694,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie going in. Seems like every movie lately encourages me to think this way. I'm not sure why a company would choose to listen to a screenwriter or producer who pitched the idea for this film. There are far better movies similar to this already. Those movies had some elite Hollywood actors in them like Ed Harris. This movie has uh, Kristen Stewart. In order for a leading actor to have a memorable performance you need good supporting characters. Well this movie has neither. It's an underwater (ha ha) disaster movie with angry mermen (women?) and Cuthulu. It's not suspenseful or exciting. The performances are as exciting as watching Doc McStuffins. Also, UNDERWATER? Really? That's the best you could do? ""What should we title this movie?""
-""Well it takes place under water so.."" ""How about ""Underwater!?"" -""That's brilliant!"" *awkward white guy high five"
695,"UNDERWATER is a great example what may happen with an independent film maker when he gets more money to play with, but when the studio restrictions come with it. Director William Eubank, who helmed a mind-bending sci-fi movie THE SIGNAL, now dials down his artistry for the sake of the spectacle.The plot had been done to death - ALIEN, THE THING, DEEP BLUE SEA, you name it. At the heart of it we have Christen Stewart's Norah, the protagonist, and in the first few minutes she is thrown into turmoil, making life changing decisions that will haunt her for the rest of the film. Her story is an interesting one, but it is dimmed and dulled by the rest of the cast - cardboard characters, each of them a survival horror movie cliché. Although the acting overall is pretty good, there's only so much that can be done with what the screenplay allows. There is plenty of mayhem on display, but the gore is toned down and there's nothing particularly inventive about the character's untimely dispatch.There is good news too: the effects are fantastic and the sound is mesmerising. Marco Beltrami comes up with a score that resonates to the very core of the film, although you will not be humming a tune from it on the way out of the theatre. Eubank also hasn't lost his touch, his visual style is recognisable and the concept of the creatures is intriguing, the full scale of what they are is not revealed for a while, and it is a vision to behold.Focusing rather on action than claustrophobic dread and marvelling at monstrous creatures rather than making us afraid of them, UNDERWATER is a solid entertainment that sacrifices drama and originality for the pure spectacle."
696,The people posting reviews of 8 and 9's are clearly paid to post positive reviews. The film has literally no character development. No 20-30 minutes to get to know people. The result is the start of the film is pretty much the trailer. The rig is in trouble in the first 5 minutes. You don't really care about anyone in the film as you never got to know them. Imagine in the first Alien if the film began with the Alien fully grown on board. I think 6 stars is generous.
697,"Ok.Let me be honest.It has been a year since I've been to the theaters. Quite honestly it has been both that movies don't last that long in the theaters and I've been busy, and the fact that nothing looks good anymore.I mean really. They just don't make movies like they used too. I was seeing TRANSPORTER 1 (film from 2002) back in the fall, and I even said to myself.....there's something different about this film. It's just the feel. And I said to myself....movies these days are so different.This movie though looked remotely good and interesting, so I decided to go see it.But it was not that good. It didn't suck....but I don't think I'll be buying it.This movie reminded me a little of THE MIST (2007), only this film was better....but not a whole lot....but definitely better.I did have to leave to use the restroom at one point, so I don't know if I missed a crucial scene or not.There aren't many people in this film...only seven...I think.The film does pretty much get to the point right at the start and is only 95 minutes instead of these whiny 2-2.5 hour films these days. Although the end credits music was whiny.Gosh music these days.....it's only going to get worse.So....the real problem is that .... they never explain what happened ... (other than they drilled too deep under the ocean and these monsters were released) the survivors are denied interviews..... and only 2 survive.Like why couldn't two fit in a pod at the end? Maybe there wasn't enough room. I don't know. But the one that was broken .... I wish she could have fixed it.Maybe there is a DVD coming with an alternate ending.Kristen Stewart is the main character and she dies....but yet still narrates at the end.....so maybe there's a sequel coming....maybe she survives....and maybe again she survives an alternate ending.By the way, Kristen Stewart has blond hair in this film...instead of her brown hair on the imdb picture here....but then again she did have blond hair in PANIC ROOM.She looks odd here....almost reminds me of a cross between that evil dude from RED 2 and Ethan Hunt from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 1. I'm not saying she looks bad...actually rather funny....from the description I mentioned.Also the black guy dies first....I'm not black btw....but I guess I got really distraught over it becomes he reminds me of a friend. But I guess if they killed the fat guy first...people will whine, always the fat guy gets it first.I'm not saying this movie is awful.....it does have it's cool moments and it was fun.....but I was expecting a better ending.Also this is not a film for kids at all under 13. Ahm....the monsters are really ultra scary. Please don't take your kids to see this."
698,"Underwater is a good sci-fi horror film, the script is not that original but it is a fun remembrance of the late 80's, late 90's and early 2000's underwater monster flicks. The special effects are cheesy, a lot of digital effects. Kristen Stewart acting is forgottable as usually is, but John Gallagher Jr. acting is very good. A funny film, no more."
699,"""You're descending seven miles to the bottom of the ocean"". Sounds like a hoot. That's a quote from my first review of 2020 titled Underwater. Kristen Stewart stars in Underwater as the short-haired, athletic heroine named Norah Price. Aside from looking like a female Roy Batty, Kristen has screen presence and is embroiled in ""underwear"". Sadly, her line readings are a little garbled.Anyway, Underwater is draggy even with a running time of ninety-five minutes. Yup, it's not fully epic despite having shades of 2005's The Descent. In fact, Underwater resembles a lot of flicks such as Leviathan, The Abyss, DeepStar Six, Alien, Life, and (gulp) Event Horizon. Here's the problem: Underwater came after all that stuff so that deems it a little last-ditch. What a shame.Now has Hollywood run out of ideas in the regurgitated, sci-fi realm? Oh yeah. And is Underwater the outline of true life form leftovers? Almost.The director of Underwater is Massachusetts native and former HD technician, William Eubank. His vision of Underwater is murky cinematography, choppy editing (no pun intended), pouncing jump scares, not a whole lot of critter striking, and not a whole lot of character development.Underwater has virtually no buildup as we the audience watch the film from perhaps the middle or second act. Besides some cringe-worthy comic relief from goofball (and Hudson wannabe) T.J. Miller, the personas are virtually non-indelible. They are slack passengers just waiting for the parasitic slaughter.Distributed by 20th Century Fox and containing a decent musical score by Marco Beltrami (Free Solo, A Quiet Place), Underwater is about heinously morphed creatures who terrorize some research crew members far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.Look for a backhanded ending (which I liked) and some science fiction dialogue that reeks of vessel deja vu (that I didn't like). Underwater was released in January and was shot almost three years ago. That's some bad cinematic juju if you ask me. Rating: 2 stars."
700,"Somewhat interesting storyline. I liked the fact that the protagonist was a female mechanical engineer (Stewart).
Otherwise the movie had a predictable group of characters:
-loveable, but annoying frat guy
tragic loving couple-aloof superior (Captain)Good rainy day movie to pass the time."
701,"SYNOPSIS:
A group of aquatic researchers experience a malfunction in their base that they believed to be an earthquake. While trying to get to safety, they realize that something much more sinister caused the wreck.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I want to start off saying that I don't think simple premises are bad in any way. A lot of times it's very refreshing to tell a simple story. By simple, I mean a movie that is very surface level with no underlying message. A movie made simply to entertain and nothing more. When you make a movie like this, I expect something great. There's a plethora of writers who can take a simple story and make it entertaining and so that's what I expect. You can take a basic premise and make it a little deeper or complex and that can work very well or doing something a little different. Take ""1917"" for instance. Two soldiers that have to relay a message without dying. Simple. Then you have Sam Mendes making it appear to be one seamless shot. That's taking a simple premise and adding something extraordinary. You had a solid premise here with solid acting and a fantastic claustrophobic setting. Unfortunately, I didn't have any part of the story to grasp on to. I was thinking it was going to be the story with the creatures (not a spoiler, it's in the trailer) that I latched onto, but I think they really dropped the ball on that. So much potential, but ultimately fell flat for me. 5.9/10.----------------------------------------BREAKDOWN------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
William Eubank does a commendable job here. He had very good set pieces and built an eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere in this film. There was quick pacing in this film, but I was almost begging for a moment to slow down, because this film really gets right into it from the moment the movie starts. In a lot of cases I love this, but when you have an ensemble of 5-6 characters, I think it's good to slow down in a couple moments and build character. I really savor those moments.WRITING:
Building off of what I said about slowing down and creating character development, I think I would've enjoyed this film far more. I didn't feel connected to the character in any way. They were all dispensable and it had nothing to do with the acting itself. Not even the dialogue. It really was all about the fact that the movie starts with a problem and a solution and the movie follows this formula from beginning to end with some minor distractions in the middle. It's in movies like these where it's very important to input character development. In a movie like ""Good Time"" there's a different situation in place with only 2 main characters who are brothers and don't need too much establishment for you to be on board with the quick pace. In a film such as ""Underwater"" where you know there's a large possibility of characters dying and going on this survival journey, it's important to feel connected. You want to care whether someone lives or dies and I just didn't.ACTING:
I really loved Kristen Stewart in this film. She really rocked as the introverted computer mechanic. I thought TJ Miller was great as comedic relief. He wasn't too much, just grounded enough to be believable. Then Jessica Henwick was also a star in this film. I really had no gropes with the acting in any way, It's just really too bad that none of them had a chance to establish their characters."
702,"First there was Ridley Scott Alien and the decades that came next were imitations, copies, reimaginings either in space or somewhere far or again underwater.
It's not like one can watch the movie and totally ignore it's influences and the tech mechanic setting also don't help. The camera sliding on dark hallways don't help forget alien as well.
Even the alien they come to find before the big boss show up could very well be a distant cousin of xenomorph.
As in the past many alien re imageins were done more the future will bring. For now we have an alien loose deep under the ocean killing everyone in a tech setting where safery measures before it all began were never the big priority"
703,"All the disaster starts within 5 minutes.. from surviving the wreck of the station they then have to survive the attack of the creatures.. at some point the creature is really hunting and following them but then smith and emily can stay safely outside for so long without any attack..Kristen stewart is ok in this movie... some parts is so blurry and dark I could not see anything.. somehow I dont really care about what happens to the characters.. anyway, this is a must watch for Kristen Stewart fans"
704,"If you've seen Cloverfield, you've seen this. Same premise, just don't underwater. Save your money and wait until it's streamed."
705,"First off, I really enjoy scifi/creature movies. And the Mariana Trench amazes me since we don't really know much about whats *really* down there nor can we actually explore much of it for very long. So with that being said, any time there's a movie about deep water adventures and discovery, I'm all in!! Add a little bit of fear and scary creatures for a thrill and I'm also a fan!!Now almost immediately this movie gave me Aliens vibes and it kept on giving throughout. Like I could probably name off every moment something reminded me of Aliens but that would give away too many spoilers. Although it had so many Aliens like qualities, it didn't make me dislike the movie, I actually liked that it did.There's some action where the place blows up a bit and puts them in a tough place in terms of survival, a lot of jump scares, some death scenes, scary creature scenes, and I enjoyed all of it. I even felt a little claustrophobic myself.But something felt ""off"" about the movie. Like we didn't get any character development. We didn't even really know these characters enough and had nothing to cheer for if they lived or be upset about if they died, I guess. I wish they gave more explanation of the creatures or maybe even if the characters discussed the creatures more?? I guess maybe they were all too much in shock, it was just odd.Go see it if you're into creature films, scifi, Aliens, etc because it is good on the big screen. But it fell short with character and even creature development."
706,"First of all this is just a survival horror don't even expect any kind of storyline. We don't get to know anything about the monsters or the characters.The jumpscares are really cheap. I hated them.
In a lot of scenes i just didn't understand what's going on because of the lack of vision and the shaky camera.Oh and apparently you can blow up everything by pressing space on a computer."
707,"An underwater sci-fi which underperforms due to an underthrusting storyline that underwhelm the audience with fear, focusing more on Kristen Stewart in her underwear."
708,"The best thing Underwater has going for it is the scientific accuracy. Obviously this movie consulted the best ocean-cryptozoologists.In all seriousness, not a good movie. Acting was okay, but not great. The humor fell short, the horror was weak, the action pedestrian. The script was weak. Strangely, the audio was poorly mixed. There were many times where the dialogue was unintelligible due to the other sounds of the film, explosions, music, machinery, etc. As the dialogue was pretty weak, this issue didn't detract as much from the movie as it would have other, better written, films."
709,"While it is a fun thriller, jumpscares come frequently and are executed well, it is inspired to heavily by other films. It becomes this amalgamation of superior films while lacking what made those films good in the first place. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the film if you can, don't waste your money if you're going to want the intelligence of films like Alien or The Descent. Effects are rough especially for cgi. The writers give tragic backstories in an attempt to make you care about these characters but it just fails. If youre a cinephile, do not waste your time."
710,"Typical survival film in which a group of people suffer a disaster and are trapped in a place of difficult access from which they can only exit through a long and dangerous journey amid obstacles that not everyone will survive.
On this occasion the stage is a station that controls a maritime drilling 10,000 meters underwater.
I admire of the film that features characters that make decisions based on the common good, which leads them to make sacrifices or get ahead of adversity. Thinking of that kind needs this world now. I also recognize that there is a careful production, with amazing scenarios and a sound worth enjoying in the movie theater.
Even so, the pace of the movie is unstoppable, something always happens and what happens is not always understandable. The characters are introduced instantaneously, when in this movie genre is more enjoyable to know their background to suffer or enjoy who is saved or not. There are some dialogues and scenes in which we know something about them, but not enough to sustain all the time we spend with them.
The edition is made of very fast cuts, which prevents us from appreciating what the characters do to save themselves, or to die.
And there is a subplot that involves some monsters that stalk these people but I didn't feel it contributed something relevant to the main plot and you don't even know what those things are. It could have been just a disaster movie without having that unnecessary part of the monsters.
And in the end, we came to appreciate the character of Kirsten Stewart more, but his destiny is uncertain, and that frustrated me.
I would not recommend this movie to spend money in a movie theater, but to rent it at home and watch it with a good HD screen and a good sound system while eating pizza."
711,"For a horror/thriller released in January, I was impressed. Kristen Stewart also pleasantly surprised me with her great performance. T.J. Miller's character was awful in the beginning, every time he opened his mouth he spewed out some attempt at humor which ruined the mood every time and felt very out of place. Just when I was starting to like his character he gets killed off (in a pretty cool way though). There was a constant feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness conveyed in the film that really helped enhance the atmosphere. Light-years better than the grudge (2020) which also released this month."
712,"I like this kind of movie but i put a little bit high hopes and i was wrong. I still love ALIENS more. The plot is more and less the same. The character too. Even Kristen Steward bald her hair off , it was such seeing Sigourney Weaver in younger version. But still...Sigourney did better. Although Kristen finally can show more emotions 😁 but to be honest i still enjoy the movie. Because Vincent Cassel in it. This movie can be your spare choice if you just want to have entertainement during lazy saturday night..."
713,"You have so much things to do in your life, for waste your time to watch this movie. I pray the lord to give me back the last 1h35 of my life,so, if you have a minimum of decency, just leave."
714,"The worst part of this movie is that it takes itself seriously. If it was to make fun of other movies, fine, but they are serious. I have so many questions... why?! Just why?
Firstly, why did they make it? This movie is just wrong on so many levels I can't even tell. I think it's one of the worst movies I saw lately. Bad script, bad casting, bad story, bad directing."
715,"When some strange creatures suddenly appear at the bottom of the deepest ocean due to some heat source, and that too when the drilling structure that many have taken a few years to assemble is completed, you know that the movie will go for a toss. Very badly made movie, bad cinematography and horrible acting. The entire cast is pathetic. And the story, well there is none...."
716,"This movie could have been made a short film like the 3 stooges. Mysterious destruction of base and then same old dragging on of trying to get away from a sea creature. No real excitement.Subs can't stand the pressure that deep, yet they are walking down below in suits and then a fire extinguisher is used to break a man's shield. Yeah, right."
717,"""Alien"" meets ""The Abyss"" in a very bad way. Plot is so predictable I almost fell asleep. The soundtrack is really annoying.A soundtrack should help build up the suspense but they try much too hard so it is just annoying and noisy."
718,"This was really a snoozefest. I could barely stay awake to finish it. I played this for a friends movie night. The whole group was so bored I almost took it out mid movie, I got so embarrassed. It was awful. The only reason I gave 2 stars was every movie deserves an extra star for effort. This film really had no plot, it had no climax, and it didn't entertain at all. So glad I didn't see it in theatre. I really like Kristin Steward as well, so that was even more disappointing."
719,"The editing is bad, some of the shots are bad, and it is hard to tell what is going on frequently. The acting is meh and so is the script. The creature design is fine but nothing special. You are better off spending your money and time elsewhere."
720,"This movie is not making any sense. We have a group of people underwater for some reason we don't know why they are at that very far depth in this construction. The construction collapsed under what seems to be an earthquake, maybe, we don't know that for sure. Then we have some survivors who must leave the collapsed construction so they find some diving suits to wear. Now this is so laughable, because the suits are not good. Even the captain says ""remember, these suits are dangerous "". I laughed a lot at this statement What the hell? Aren't these the survival suits? Or at least these are the suits that the crew use to do their jobs or dive to fix pipes! and the crew has almost no training on diving. So this crew who lives underwater got no training for swimming or diving and totally incompetent. What kind of work they do anyway? We don't know, because after 5 minutes in the movie we find ourselves in a disaster situation before we know anything about the characters, their motives, their backgrounds, etc. The dialogue between the actors is really plain stupid. A mechanic engineer is fixing computer and electronic stuff, a guy gets his technical info from anime, a girl that does nothing but screaming and a guy who was in the movie just to explode after 15 minutes. There isn't one part of this movie that does not underestimates the audiences' minds. Total joke. Not scary, not action, and not interesting. After 30 minutes I could see that this is a very bad movie, but I watched it all only to write this review."
721,"When I saw it was staring Kristen Stewart I assumed I would spend 2 hours starring at my phone. I was wrong. The action starts fast, and goes basically till the end. You won't regret giving this a watch."
722,"I simply had so much fun during the movie and that's what's important, isn't it?
The acting was good (that was the first time I liked Stewart's acting), so were the effects and I loved the plot and its development. I liked the way the characters were being introduced and the soundtrack was perfect. It made me feel the creepy possibility of what may be under water..."
723,"Honestly, I enjoyed the movie. Everyone bashed Kristen Stewart but she is typically type casted like a lot of other actors. Most things in the entertainment world have indeed already been done. The only thing that confuses me about the movie is at 1:05 in there is Satanic sigil's and things that link up to satanism. But the rest of the movie doesn't go with it? So I just don't understand why it was thrown in for a minute if it was something that wasn't going to be tied in or followed with.
Everything else was pretty cool though. Lots of Alien and Lovecraft vibes."
724,..they had used the ending of this movie to establish it as a prequel to the Pacific Rim movies. Opportunity lost.
725,Don't expect a masterpiece.. it's an ok movie better than expected.
726,"I went into this movie only knowing that it was filmed in 2017 and finally being released in 2020. I know it's not the producers fault (studio changed licensing) but the fact that the movie took its sweet ole time to be released is a telltale sign that it's not going to be that good.
Anyways, on to the movie. First off, what's with the random lame slow motion? Just every once and a while they felt the need to include a slow mo shot. Second, the script was kinda meh. It didn't really flow too well, I know, I know, it's just a crew trying to get from one station to the next, how much dialogue could there possibly be? Well, if I was trapped underwater with little to no visibility, I would be communicating what I see, what's ahead, if everyone was alright, what's the plan etc etc. A lot of people are complaining about the color grading and I didn't really have too much of a problem with it. It's just a greenish hue, which kinda fits the deep underwater theme. Also, the guy who died at the beginning when his helmet cracked, why didn't he say something so they can organize another plan? I mean clearly the scientist chic was scared of going outside the station so she could've easily stayed behind and wait for the others to bring help back. I'm also curious to how much the pods can carry? Certainly two 110 lb girls can fit into one pod right? I'm sure they have plenty of workers down there that are bigger than both those girls combined. I get it, there has to be a big final sacrifice so we can have a hero.
With all that being said, I do have a few good things to say about Underwater. First off, when KStew was being eaten by that hydro predator thing, that was pretty cool how she was able to escape with the flare. I also like when she shot up the flare out into the abyss and we get a reveal of the Cthulhu. That was mega dope.
Overall, a somewhat okay film with okay action. I wouldn't recommend for people to really sit and watch but it's a good film to watch and it's airing on TNT and there's nothing else to do. Even with that, I'd still try to find something else to do."
727,"If you love sci-fi (shooters also) - watch it. Don't listen to 1 star reviews. Tension is amazing. Alien in deep ocean. Wooden face Kristen and charismatic Vincent fit very well here, enjoyed them. Entertaining. Not a masterpiece but rather a solid movie."
728,"Unlike many sci-fi movies set in space, this one takes you deep below the surface, like bottom ground deep. Solid acting, nice pace, great effects (you literally feel the terror of being underwater), and mediocre storyline with an original twist.Highly recommended for all Lovecraftian sci-fi/horror fans. At first viewing an ordinary movie that will stay in your head for days to come. (I actually rated it 7 then switched to a solid 9)P.S. Stay away from trailers. As with any movie if you ask me. :)"
729,"What is wrong with people, bashing this movie and giving it such low ratings?
Really a shame a movie like this noit getting the praise it deserves.It may lack originality, but it makes up with excelent execution.
First of it is made by newcomer filmakers, and one must give credit when its due.
Its faced paced, leaves the spectator anxious and at the edge of the seat from start to finish.Maybe people nowadays are just too used to the movies explaining everything?Also its awesome that they don't waste time on BS as everything is blowing up
right from the start (instead of wasting at least an hour of the movie before the everything goes to hell)
The effects are excelent, especially the ones underwater in the darkness, the suits are really cool and convincing (the actors used air tight suits that weight 63kg each), the station design is really interesting.And a fantastic surprise at the end whe it is revealed what actaully is attacking the station.As an avid sci-fi fan for the past 40 years, i loved this movie and i put it together with the tension and excitement i felt watching the 1st alien movie (to give just one example of many)"
730,"As a deep Sci-Fi fan, if I want to be honest with you, this is (if not only but) one of the worst movie experiences I've ever had. Slow plot, boring and predictable dialogues (like you can guess in every step what's going to happen), in other words, total cliche! At the end of the movie, you are left with lots of basic unanswered questions. Believe me, if I could take back this nearly 2 hours of my life I would. Watch only if you have 2 hours to literally waste. The CGI is okay. Though if I were in Kristen shoes, I would not take this role. Like what others suggested, Abyss 1989 is way better than this."
731,"The picture was blurry underwater. All the underwater shooting was not clear. All on-screen visual elements, including lighting, framing, composition, camera motion, camera angles, and zooming were mediocre. The idea of human size or bigger monsters with big sharp teeth living 6.9 miles beneath the ocean surface, under a pressure of 16,000 psi and at a temperature of about 33 F is completely absurd. The five stars are for the acting."
732,"I was highly looking forward to this movie in hopes of finding great visual effects and sequences. But i was disappointed. It is a very good story line, but it lacked the soul. Random cliche scenes ( Like come on, we know that if a couple gets lost in water one of them or both would miraculously find a safe haven )
They also tried to bring in the "" underwater "" feel (blurry visions and darkness) which was also a bit too much under my perspective. 6/10 for a good story line."
733,"There are about 8 protagonists in this movie, 7 of which make you wonder what the hell they are doing in the deepest underwater sea station on earth in the first place, instead of working at Starbucks.
I am actually a little pissed off, because there is much potential with this underwater horror theme. But, this is Hollywood and Hollywood is obviously more interested in quick profit and pushing political correctness and feminism.I gave it a generous 5/10 because it's actually not as terrible as many previous reviewers have made it out to be. That little boy's acting, what's his name, oh yeah Kristen Stewart, wasn't totally atrocious and there is at least some suspense and some cool visual design. But ultimately it's just a mess and a waste. Also, way too many close-ups."
734,The best part of the movie was seeing T.J. Miller die.
735,"The first 10 or so minutes of the movie are very very good. Kristen Stewart is awesome.But then the script fall. Way down. Quickly. And then it's like any other basic action movie ever made: pretty, young, skinny and complying women clad in torn (or just otherwise small) clothes, while the guys are older, scruffier, condescending and for some reason can fit into their really really fitting pressuresuits in their thick Black Horses. Why are these delusional gender stereotypes still displayed? Who enjoys them? Maybe I am just not the targer group here?At least Kristen's character has a mind of her own and sort of makes her own decisions once in a while. At least after someone else gave her options to choose from. I give a thumbs up for that punch at the evac capsules though. But what was that ""elvish flat chested.."" comment that guy made to her, when she saved him from under some boulders? Seriously? And that guy outlived the only black guy in the movie.It's 2020. Please. Do a remake with the same beginning. Or do that Alien movie with Stewart. :)"
736,"Deep down in the dark there is something ,witch is never should be wake up,but people wants discover things ,at no cost. They pay the highest price,did they learn anything from that ,probably not,because that's the human nature"
737,"Many years ago this sort out movie that used to be made all the time.
Regardless of whether they did well or not..it was a fresh idea all the time...many of them turned into classics.
imagine if through the 50s , 60s and 70s if all they made were sequels from the 30s and 40s! How awful would that have been. Alas,,,this is where we find ourselves today.
While Underwater may not what you might call a great movie , it is a good movie. Plenty of action and suspense with some great "" did i see that"" special effects.
Of course a few comedy moments and some bare female skin help....and of course a massive explosion at the end.
Most importantly it has to be applauded for being a fresh(ish) idea with not a caped crusader or mutant/terminator in sight.
We NEED this sort of movie to be made to keep the monotony at bay.
Give yourself a pat on the back guys and keep it up. A cross between The Abyss, Godzilla.Alien and Independence day make this well worth a visit to the big screen."
738,"Now I always have a soft spot for films like Underwater. I love this films with a small group of people in an isolated place being under attacked by someone or something. Sadly Underwater isn't that good of a film despite me trying my best th like it.
It's barely 90 minutes (excluding credits) and for the first 40 minutes I was kinda enjoying it but then it went downhill in quality, once I realized where this was going. Didn't really feel that intensity you were meant to feel. It just became more of aa action blockbuster than a tense isolated thriller.
Kristen Stewart is decent enough and as the lead. Vincent Cassel and the rest of the cast were good. T.J. Miller however really annoyed me and his comedic relief didn't work whatsoever.
The CGI was great, as was the production design, it looks really great and authentic. The creatures whilst they look good, sometimes more is less. And in this case it should have been.Overall it is enjoyable and good for the first 40 minutes but then it quickly stumbles. It's not worth watching at all and it will be forgotten about"
739,"This was a film that when I first heard about it intrigued me. I both love and am terrified of what could be at the bottom of the ocean. Seeing that this had what looked to be monsters as well ticked another box and I had vibes this could actually fall into Lovecraftian elements as well. The synopsis is a crew of aquatic researchers work to get to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory. But the crew has more than the ocean seabed to fear.We start this with newspapers filling us in with the back-story. The Tian Corporation has decided to drill at the bottom of the ocean to create energy. There are reports of seeing something that might be quite big and the reports are shot down by the company.It then takes us to Norah (Kristen Stewart). She's brushing her teeth and we get the feel of the place she's in. The lights don't seem to be reliable as they're close to 7 miles under the ocean, the deepest an operation like this has ever been. The place is then rocked by an earthquake. Norah makes it to a room where she is joined by Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie), another worker that she knows of, but has never met. She is trying to shut a door to prevent the facility was destroying itself and has to kill two other co-workers as they won't make it in time. The two are knocked out though by place shifting.When they come to, they leave the room and look for a way out. This brings them to Paul (T.J. Miller), Captain (Vincent Cassel), Smith (John Gallagher Jr.) and Emily (Jessica Henwick). The plan Captain comes up with is to go to the ocean floor, walks across to where the drill is housed. This is something that's never been done before. They also encounter something that the world has never seen before either.Now I wanted to go a bit lighter on the recap here as there's not a lot to the story if I'm going to be perfectly honest. The goal is to survive, they don't have a lot of time and there could be something down there with them. This idea is what is really driving the tension as well. I do have to admit that I did get bored with this for a good stretch. It is odd as the runtime is normal and doesn't really outstay its welcome. I just think they focus on the wrong things.What I did like though was introducing the back-story as well as the epilogue through the newspaper headlines. This has been done before, but I think when you can use it, it is an interesting way to introduce information quickly without just flat out having characters tell us things. It hints as to what we can expect to happen here as well.Going along with that, I like the characters we get because of the job that they're doing down there. Norah is able to pretty easily fix computers, but she points out that she's a mechanical engineer so I buy that. Not everyone can do what she can, which makes that work even more. Everyone that is down there would be smart or really good at something as they wouldn't just send anyone down that far. When they know things about the science behind it, I don't really question it.As I was saying earlier, I did get bored a bit here. It doesn't waste any time getting into the crux of what destroys the facility they're in. I almost think that might work against the movie as I think part of my problem is that I really didn't care about anyone as they don't really get established. I'll delve more into this with the acting, but that's what I thought when I was walking home after leaving the theater. The tension never really builds from there either as well. I mean I did think about how they need to hurry before it is too late and then when see the creatures that add to it as well. It just feels too safe for whatever reason. We also get the set up for a sequel if they so decide. Seeing the box office briefly, that might not be the case.I know a lot of people probably won't see this or are ready to bash Stewart for her performance and I'll admit she isn't great. I do think she is fine though, especially since it can be explained by how smart she is. She did have a husband, but that doesn't mean she can't be cold like she is here. We do get to see her in bra for a good portion as well as her underwear if that interests you. Same goes for Henwick, who I did think was fine in her performance overall. She does show fear which is good. Miller tries to be funny, but it really didn't work that well here. Cassel shows signs he could be losing it, but it never goes anywhere. Gallagher I thought was really underutilized and the same could be said for Athie. I think the biggest problem here would be that we don't establish 'normal' for the characters. I think with that, we get more of an emotional impact to see them as they're trying to survive in my opinion.The effects were something that I was curious about as well. This does go pretty CGI heavy, but to be honest, I was fine with it. I believed that these people were inside of the facility that is at the bottom of the ocean and as it is falling apart. They're doing what they can to survive. The underwater scenes looked good as do some of the deaths we see. The creatures that I've alluded to are pretty much done in CGI, but again, I thought they looked real enough. I didn't really have any issues there. I'll have a brief spoiler section at the end that I want to delve into a couple things here as well. The cinematography was pretty solid as well.Now with that said, I thought that this movie did some good things, but just fell a bit flat for me. There are some believable parts to the story and it is a setting that makes me feel uncomfortable, with something I believe to be true about the bottom of the ocean. The movie though was boring until we get the climax and I think part of that is the lack of fleshing these characters out, especially with the ability of these actors. They went heavy with the CGI, but I didn't have issues with it. The murkiness of the water does help a lot there. The soundtrack didn't stand out aside from the use of alarms. They did make some scenes quite tense if I'm honest. Overall though I'd say this is slightly above average. I enjoyed the movie, but probably one I won't revisit unless I have to.My Rating: 6 out of 10SPOILERSWhat I wanted to talk about was first about the situation there in. The synopsis I'm assuming is to avoid spoilers, but the earthquake was actually this giant creature freeing itself. It is attracted to the light and is destroying this base of operations. What I really wanted to delve into though was my statement about this being Lovecraftian, because I originally thought that it was a Cthulu. After hearing Mr. Venom from the Fresh Cuts podcast, I actually think it is another elder god in Dagon. It has tentacles on its face and is a giant sea creature. I did like that it moves like a cave though having holes were they are smaller monsters living in that and then we see the tinier ones are similar to what comes out of people's chest in Alien. This movie pays a lot of homage to Alien and Aliens, but I don't find that to be an issue. That's what I wanted to point out here and would curious what others thought about this."
740,Well the black guy dies first....it was decent movie
741,"Just another movie about an underwater monster, it's offspring and the sacrifice of one empowered heroine.The best scenes of the movie happen in the beginning. Later on the mystery elements are gone and the movie fails at becoming a true Sci Fi or Horror.I see this as an amalgamation of several other movies from the past. No narrative twists, no dilemas, no ""guess til the end"" moments.It's an ok family friendly movie, that will leave the younger audiences speechless while the rest of us are likely to rate it anywhere between 5 to 7.I personally don't think it's a horrible movie and frankly speaking the actors are doing a good job, however this a TV movie and not something you would want to see on big screen. Ok, yet forgettable."
742,"Wow. I thought Kristen Stewart was beautiful in ""Charlie's Angels,"" but ""Underwater"" takes it to a new level, and not just because the film takes place a billion miles under the ocean. For the last act of this film, Kristen Stewart romps around in just her underwear, and I found it increasingly hard to not pull a Pee-wee Herman in the theatre.""Underwater,"" directed by William Eubank, was apparently filmed in 2017 and is just now releasing to kick-off the new year, and the new decade. And what better way to kick it off then to see Kristen Stewart half naked and glistening from water for the majority of the film? In all seriousness, besides Kristen Stewart's incredible body, there is some other stuff to enjoy in this movie. For one, the direction and cinematography are pretty good. The movie has a distinct look, and it's clear the director had a vision for what he wanted to see. From the very beginning, the movie looks great, very crisp, clear, and eerie. When we finally see inside of the underwater vessel and get our first glimpse of a tantalizing Kristen Stewart, the camera pans slowly, allowing you to get a good view of not only her body, but also of the vessel itself; it almost reminded me of a Ridley Scott type shot, and it's evident that ""Underwater"" takes inspiration from Ridley Scott movies. And when things get going, they really get going. The movie has a kinetic pace that never lets up once it starts, and there is a lot of thrills to be had here, especially during the sequence when the vessel first starts to breakdown. Also, there is a third-act creature reveal that is, bada**, to say the least. Unfortunately, where ""Underwater"" shines the most is also where it fails; i.e., the pacing.Yes, we all love fast-paced films that keep you feeling a sense of tension throughout the entire running time (""Uncut Gems,"" for example). However, ""Underwater"" has pacing so incredibly quick that it makes the movie almost incomprehensible, and not just because of how dark and shaky it is. Seriously, this movie needed a brightness boost and a camera stabilizer because for the majority of the movie I could not tell what was happening and who it was happening to. At one point, one character gets dragged by a monster (or maybe an Octopus, I'm really not sure), and when they show who got dragged I was like, ""Oh, I thought it was someone else, I didn't realize it was this person being attacked."" Like, sure, in the beginning the shaky cam actually was effective, but only because it was used in a well-lit environment where everything was crystal clear. Use that same shaky cam in a dark, poorly lit environment, and suddenly you realize that shaky cam is never a good idea.Also, there is a notable lack of character development in this movie, again, because of the pacing. The movie kicks into high gear almost as soon as it starts, not leaving any room for meaningful characterization, which means you'll barely care about what's happening and who it's happening too. The only character I even remotely cared about was Norah, solely because she was played by Kristen Stewart. And that's a shame, because the cast and the acting were all fine, they just needed more to do other than run from one set piece to the next.""Underwater"" is an okay movie for quick thrills, and I'll probably buy it to add to my ever increasing Kirsten Stewart collection, but a lack of characterization coupled with the incomprehensible pacing keeps this from being a recommendation on my part.5/10"
743,"For people with 2 neurons or a little more, don't waste a second (even in boring quarantine) of your precious time.
Estudios and producers must know that fifty or eighty, or whatever millions of dollars, can't buy a decent film if there's zero creativity on it.
People just don't bite your stupid trap anymore!"
744,"I actually wanted to like it having seen numerous deep ocean human escape from submerged habitat disaster movies in past decades. Unlike ""The Rhythm Section"" which had a realness to it, and ""Bloodshot"" which was pure comic book fantasy, this was pure dumb per the following:
1. Submerged habitat was several hundred feet tall so construction dealing with currents & pressures would be harder than building habitat on the Moon or Mars.
2. Mostly made of 12-18"" thick concrete which begs the question how do you get it down there; how do you make & then build it in that environment? Most importantly the best imaginable concrete has a psi of maybe 5000, but the psi in the Mariana Trench is 16,000. Good luck!
3. Lots of extraneous, expensive to transport & build, stuff, e.g. floor & wall tiles & metal lockers, etc. in the film because of the cheap shooting location.
4. Dialogue was out-of-place for that environment; gossipy dumb. Usual stereotypical actor mix of black, asian, nerd, goofball. And, you know who's likely to not make it.
5. First cheap scary's - dripping water, loud rumbling. Imaginative!
6. Crowning glory were the alien like creatures subsisting on - who knows what, in that barren environment. Human alien looking with head, mouth (and of course sharp teeth), nose, two eyes, arms & legs. Second alien, much larger, half squid; half human. Surviving that pressure is comic book fantasy."
745,"Its all be done 100x before with more flair, more tension and far better actors.Watch The Thing (any version), Alien, Abyss, Leviathan
Even My Little Pony would be more exciting!"
746,Acting was aggressively bad and the movie was extremely tacky.
747,"Kristen Stewart is one of those rare actors that comes along once in a decade. She has a classicly beautiful face with universal appeal, with expressions that make fans want to come see her. She could have had a great career in traditional feminine roles following footsteps of Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan. But she didn't want any of that. She wants to look like a boy and be more masculine. It's a shame. I couldn't get past this, so didn't pay much attention to the movie. Also she was completely incomprehensible. Couldn't understand a word she said. There was some tension to keep the movie moving, but we don't really care what they were doing and why these creatures need to keep attacking them and everything was too murky can't see what's going on."
748,"Is Kristen whatsherface. Now I don't like Kristen Stewart. Not since she cheated on her boyfriend and was given a pass because she's a girl.
I thought I would give this movie a try. I mean how bad can it be? We're all on lockdown and an adventure underwater should take my mind off the sorry state the world is in right now.Big mistake!For one thing, every 3 seconds we're treated to the sour face of old whatsherface. Even when she's not talking or acting (Kristen rarely acts. her face defaults to a sour and pained look as if she suffers from perpetual constipation). Someone says something, cut to Kristen. That actor from Deadpool cracks a lame joke, Kristen grunts. Dude, give us a break.Finally I've had enough so I turned it off and watched Ozark instead.I recommend you do the same.I rated it 1 star because there are no zero stars."
749,Complete anti climax. Terrible film terrible under water aliens woukd have preferred a gigantic squid or something along those lines.
750,I was excited to see this movie. My excitement quickly left.
751,"It's sort of a crappy story that was realized well by the bad director who probably never work again.Kristen Stewart, who is proven to be a horrible actress only pushed to the forefront following her interaction with Weinstein, cuts her hair to prove she's a great thespian. LOL! Give is all break.The rest of the cast's acting is just as dismal.And there are several really fugly characters. Who wants to look at that for 90 minutes?Plus, this movie has been done a thousand times before in space. Nothing new here."
752,"Hollywood spent now 80mn USD for transporting a feminist message? And the result is this ? I cannot believe it.
This is - by far - the most boring Alien-rip off - I have, ever, ever seen. And casting boy-wonder Kristen Steward was not exactly a wise decission too."
753,EVERYTHING about the movie is stupid. First of all its impossible to build something like that drill and second of all how did they build it in the presence of the monster in the first place?! its just so stupid!
754,"Don't bother. Watch the abyss from the 80s... this movie is a joke. Horrific acting, to be fair it's not even acting. This is how these lame woke losers are in real life."
755,"South Park was the origin of Underwater's plot. Also with all the advanced futuristic technology contrived in this movie, society is still using crude oil? Have the republicans won? This movie is dumb."
756,"I hate it when movies have characters who have some type of very specialized job (such as an astronaut) but they cast young actors and give them dialogue that is not what people in those professions would say. In this case, some idiot gave the underwater drills to some millennial looking people who are woke enough to realize and say out loud: ""We took too much...now the sea is taking us back."" LMAO - what? These would be professional drill operators they wouldn't see the world this way. Anyhow, the plot sucks, movie sucks, characters suck - deep sea trash."
757,"Couldn't care less about any of the characters, or what happens to them, because they didn't even spend 30 seconds trying to develop any of them. Cinematography is poor, as you really can't see what is going on most of the time. Not suspenseful at all, as you know what's coming.Kristin Stewart plays the same brooding, mumbling character she always does. She does play a great prepubescent young boy, however.And let's talk some things that are unrealistic:A guys glass helmet cracks open at the slightest pressure change before he gets into water, but the rest of the cast can go down another mile, get slammed into objects, attacked by creatures, blown up, eaten, dragged around, and their helmet never breaks.The crew wore huge, weighted suits so they can walk on the bottom of the ocean, yet they can magically walk with ease when not in water.They take their helmet off the second their heads pop out of the water, repeatedly, yet the water is at their neck level splashing around and nothing gets inside the suit.For being around so much water, their clothes and bodies seem miraculously dry most of the time.There's plenty more."
758,Worst actress of all time. Makes the same exact face all the time. Sounds the same all the time. Awful.Script awful. Comedy at the wrong times.Editing awful. You feel like it's rushed.Squid attack. Now you can skip it. You're welcome.
759,"Like I stated, I have never been a fan of KStew's acting abilities mostly because she has the same facial expression every scene but trust me, this one the face matches her surroundings! My nerves were on edge all movie and the cast was great as well as the plot. Don't know why it got panned but honestly, it was real good. Give it a try!"
760,I don't know why they keep that French actor in the movies...He can't act even if his life depends on it.
761,One of Kristen Stewart's best roles ever! The movie itself was phenomenal 👏
762,"An entertaining homage to the monster movies of the 80s like Aliens and Abyss but with modern big budget special effects. This movie doesn't waste any time jumping into the action, but it still manages to develop thr characters as the plot progresses.
I know its dark and claustrophobic under the sea and it conveyed this very well, sometimes a little too well. It lost a point for how hard it was too follow the action many times but it gained a point for the amount of time Kristen Stewart spends in her underpants, she is a fit young lady. Definitely worth a watch for b movie Sci fi horror fans."
763,"I was expecting a horror but this is more of a survival thriller.That's perfectly fine though, it's the marketing that should blamed and obviously having Kristen Stewart is always a plus.This movie starts on the wrong foot for a several reasons: an overlong title sequence tries to set the scene at the expense of visual story telling and we also have unjustified narration. She mentions dreams and so I thought a lot of the first 5 minutes was indeed a dream. You won't now of course but it really made it hard for me to adjust to the movie and its pacing.This movie would have gained a lot from setting the scene more; giving us time to really take a look around this impressive set and really get even a small feel for the characters before things get crazy.I usually admire efficient story telling but the way this picture jumps in with both feet is just a little over whelming. It's not hard to understand but there is no moment to just let things sink in, no time to get my bearings and really follow this as a story and give it the emotional investment it obviously thinks it can get from us.The characters are nice and all but I feel that they were wasted here. They meet the quota of personality I want but we don't get so much.I suspect you can guess that these people are dealing with more than they think they are at the beginning. Let's just say that they are way too upfront in my opinion. The direction they go with in the third act...they should have just kept it simple because it feels like two movies glued together.So far I've been very negative but one must acknowledge the technical skill that went into making this, it's almost rather sad that so much talent and resources were dumped into this but it still shines through. The practical effects create a vivid aquatic world where the darkness presses in from all sides and the human and technophilic elements are impeccable. Nothing else is.I never thought of it as particularly progressive or not progressive but apparently different people had other opinions. Kristen is great and would have been great even if she wasn't in her under wear (pas mal). It's just a bonus. But that guy with the beard really steals the show.This clearly had a lot of ambition. They wanted an immersive, tense, poignant and funny tale of human survival with more than a few surprises and acting part of the larger literary tradition but it doesn't quite work, not because of the way they did it, but because of what they didn't do.I do not love the ending.I can't help but feel that ""Deadspace: Downfall"" is basically the same movie but done a ton better. Obviously there are some differences (they're not underwater) but I'm sticking to this."
764,This movie is GREAT i love this movie it has action adventure and horror! A great mix of genres!! Dont listen to the bad reviews!!!!!
765,This movie is beautifully shot. The acting is phenomenal. And honestly the best part of the movie is the Lovecraft aspect. You truly can't understand the underlying plot unless you know the Cthulhu Mythos. The sub background is heavily dipped if not marinated in Lovecraft. It's good even if you don't know it. Just adds another layer of you do.
766,"I'm a big boy now, I wear big boy pants and haven't been scared by a movie since I was a kid, at best a movie will make me feel uncomfortable and if I'm not paying attention and predicting the next sequence, I might jump every now and again.Underwater made me feel uncomfortable, almost as much as Alien did, all those years ago.....or The Thing, but they were masterpieces of cinema, this was a close contender and did it come close! Admittedly I did jump, reacting to the intended jump scare, even though i knew what was coming..that's a good thing, it shows I was enjoying the movie.What's normally offputting in movies of this type are the incredibly moronic decisions made by the characters and it was pleasing to see a certain awareness of this by not doing stupid things. I found that a very stand out point of the movie....the characters weren't idiots and their decisions, for the most part, were sensible and within reason under the circumstances..unusual or what!!!I was a bit let down by the order of on screen deaths, but that's a minor and I suspect more of a personal choice as to whom should be done away with first, but for me that is a small gripe for what is otherwise a really great yarn.Nods to Alien and Lofcraftian horror, namely Cthulhu are apparent and as I'm a fan of both made this even more of a treasure that I shall definately watch again, might even add it to my physical collection, as a rare treat that it is....a decent, well shot, claustrophobic, itch inducing and well paced sci-fi horror .I do hope we see more movies like this, because this touched on themes that I totally enjoy and make me feel phobic at the same time. This isn't Leviathan or Abyss, which in my opinion were completely tame, this is true creature feature and I recommend turning the lights off, cranking up the volume and enjoy this 1 hour, 40 odd minute bundle of joy.For all I've said, that's why Underwater gets a solid 9/10 for me, as I deducted a star for the order of deaths and making me jump once, just so I could say something negative.Looking at the some of the reviews here, I can understand, to a degree why some people didn't like it, but I guess this is a movie that appeals to fans of the genre. This said, it never lets up on the action, yes a couple of the characters are a bit stiff, but it's just not worthy of hate.I loved every second of this!!"
767,"I had some expectations since I do find underwater monsters to be a bit creepy...For the most part, this movie is bland, generic, boring and repetitive. I feel like I have seen this movie before. It is nothing special, it is very hard to see what is happening, the camera is shaky, the acting is ok at best, you don't care for the characters, the jumpscares are not effective...It's not all bad and there are some nice special effects. However, the whole movie just feels lackluster."
768,Zero stars what a bad movie script sucks save you time see the Abby's 100 times more better than this film
769,"Underwater is an amalgamation of various creature-feature flicks with little novelty in plot and setting. The cast (barring T J Miller, who slept off on the Deadpool sets and woke up as a supporting character in this movie) is adequate: the likes of Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, John Gallagher Jr, and Jessica Henwick play key roles. An earthquake destroys part of an underground drilling facility and its resident employees Norah (Stewart), Rodrigo (Athie), Paul (Miller) are forced to flee. They find Captain Lucien (Cassel), Emily (Henwick), and Smith (Gallagher Jr.), and decide to walk a mile across to Roebuck 641 to attempt resurfacing from there.T J Miller jokes around a little too much in a film with an otherwise serious tone. It's obvious that he's having fun being part of a (creature) horror film but showing some restraint would have helped here. A not-bad recent example would be Danny McBride in Alien: Covenant. In terms of character development, you get very little except for a scene that arrives quite late into the film. The creature effects are standard CGI fare. Some scenes look more effectively crafted than others. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography, in fact, elevates the film several notches. A couple of slow-motion scenes were visually brilliant.The plot doesn't have many surprises up its sleeve. The manner in which it unfolds doesn't make the average sci-fi fanatic go ""wow"". This is basically the film's undoing - it lacks that much-needed X factor. A few jumpscares (even underwater) cannot make up for that."
770,"If you want to get scare, definitely watch this
Especially if you have the phobia of deep dark water.
I really don't see why people doesn't like, the only reason for people not to like it is that they either compare it to other movies or that they are not into sci-fi.
I'll give it 10/10"
771,"I don't know what the point of this movie is. No energy, lackluster suspense, bad acting and lazy screenwriting. Such a waste of resources."
772,"It's like watching 'Alien' without the suspense. It was predictable, unimaginative, but beautifully shot though. Backstory was poor and the characters were under developed. Don't get me started in the aliens (a sorry mishmash of borrowed ideas from great movies before it)."
773,"If you have a fear of what lives deep, deep under water, this one will take your fears to a whole new level! I went in just going from the description I read about it thinking that it was just about a crew excavating the bottom of the Mariana trench who's facility gets destroyed by an earthquake or something leaving them trapped, but its not that at all. It definitely puts some ""What if"" thoughts into your head when pondering what all could live in the farthest reaches of the ocean and what may be living in pockets even further beneath than that. It is a very creepy movie and the creatures are awesome. I think they're actually demons but Idk. Awesome movie, though! It brought way more than I expected! I think I might be the first one putting it at a whole 10/10 here, but I really enjoy it!"
774,"It is one of the horror-s.f. the most successful in 2020, at least until this date when I write my opinion.
I rated it 9 out of ten stars because the ending, although quite successful, still gave me the impression that the director of the film, for various reasons, forced the end of filming ...
I know that somewhere we would have wanted a total ending of happy, I know the power of human sacrifice
it comforts us somewhere and maybe that's why my impression can be subjective ...
I don't understand how the visor of the diver's suit was broken with great weight by a steel container but those huge and strong jaws of the monster fail this, but, of course, this is a little for the capricious ...
I notice the appearance, I say, of the original appearance of marine life at 10,000 meters in the dark depths of the waters.
I was very pleasantly impressed by all the actors and actresses who enlivened the characters of the film, but also by the film crew that made spectacular scenes! In fact, the whole team behind this production really deserves congratulations!
Personally, I am happy that I managed to survive after watching: Underwater!"
775,"The creatures were interesting. Unfortunately they don't get much air time. This film gave me that wannabe Aliens vibe. But of course not as good. I did not originally want to watch this film but there was nothing left to watch. So after a couple of months I finally pulled the trigger and rented it. I was actually a bit surprised at how the film did not suck as badly as I thought it would. Again, not the greatest film.The lead actress was struggling in the role. I think the casting was horrific. Hollywood keeps trying to play to the barely-adults age group in every film these days and I'm tired of it. They even went back in time on the X Men to play to that age group.This movie is okay and good for when there is absolutely nothing else to do. Under those circumstances I don't think you will be completely disappointed. However, if you make plans to watch this film and bake popcorn and invite friends over, you will be in for a major disappoint."
776,"In my humble opinion, this movie was an awesome addition to the Scifi Monster Genre. I was on edge from start to finish. This movie has made my top 10 mysterious creature monster movie list."
777,"I enjoy these types of movies. it wasn't anything special. but it was suspenseful and i enjoyed the experience. lots of cool moments and scary sequences. a good time overall (1 viewing, 9/19/2020)"
778,"It's hard to understand what was happening, it's hard to make sense what went down, it's very hard to literally see what was going on, ms stewart/justin bieber also was very hard to like."
779,What a waste of time. DO NOT watch it. This os the worst movie I have ever seen. Nothing is interesting about this.
780,"Why do they even bother making something like this if they're only going to follow the exact same formula every other disaster movie has used. Even though I could barely understand what the characters were saying, I was still prepared to tag along. But when it came to diving suits, and the attendant science, well, I'm sorry, it's a big fail. Firstly, nobody has ever gone ""outside"" in a suit at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. 7 tons per sq. in. Does anyone realise how much pressure that is? Any diving suit not made of 6-foot thick Titanium would be crushed like an eggshell. And the lights. The hallmark of scientific ineptitude is to provide space/diving suits with lights inside the helmet. It is patently obvious that, especially in a pitch-dark environment, lights of any kind inside your helmet would completely destroy your ability to see outside. Nobody would design such a helmet. But there they are, in 99% of space/diving movies. Convenience for the lighting crew always triumphs over realistic science. There's a lot more trash science in this movie, but the helmet issue by itself is enough to ruin it, for me, anyway. I can otherwise forgive a lot of sins in exchange for a good story to get lost in, but sadly, I don't see one here."
781,This is the same cookie cutter monster movie you've seen 37 times before. Group of people trying to get to the thing as the get killed by the monsters one-by-one. Yawn.
782,Fell asleep during the movie the plot is dumb you dont care for any of the characters and the camera is pure crap they should make sure this director never steps behind a camera ever again. To many close ups that you can barely understand what is happening. Avoid and dont waste your time on this nonsense.
783,"If you like Cloverfield, event horizon, or pandorem then this is the movies for you. This movie was right down my ally. I can see why people wouldn't like it, simply because this type of movie isn't for everyone. I'd watch it again."
784,"I saw the good names cast in this and ignored the low score. That was a good idea. It was a really good movie!
I'm not sure what upsets people about this movie, perhaps they expected sex scenes with pale vampires because Kristen Stewart is in it but I would definitely recommend this movie! It's been a while since I was caught up by nail biting action /suspense like this."
785,"Basically a poor ripoff of the original 'Alien'-movie, just set in deep water instead of space. The same super-technological backdrop and the same environmental challenges. Even the characters are more or less the same stereotypical figures. Relies way too much on jumpscares. As a viewer, you feel two steps ahead most of the time - but if you have some time to kill, you could do worse. The cast is not terrible, high quality production, and the special effects & props are well done, fortunately."
786,"This movie had awful cinematography, it was so hard to follow because they filmed it ""underwater"" and it was so dark and blurry. Kristen's acting was also very bad."
787,"Across between Cloverfield and Alien but under water.
I struggled at times to see what exactly was going on due to it all being under water. I kept squinting my eyes to see."
788,"It's very difficult to make something new within the gender but it was never boring and it has everything: action... fun a couple of times... intense moments...
The only thing I didn't like was the end credits song so yes, I think it deserves better."
789,"The great unknown is not just in space, you find creatures as big as Godzilla underwater. What I liked about the film is the action, good storyline, decent chemistry between the actors, terrifying sea creatures. Sure, towards the end the women are running around in their underwear; the mystery of what can be discovered in the deepest part of the sea, is intriguing. Makes me curious. Curiosity is excellent."
790,"Some kind of underwater Cloverfield. Thankfully it foregoes the annoying characters of Cloverfield, who you just wanted to die right from the start, but it doubles up on the shaky cam and adds a few layers of 90 year old cataracts so you really can't see anything even if you look really hard."
791,Watching this movie really made my day. U really should watch the movie if u are reading this review. Trust me it's worth it not even kidding it's really worth it!!!!!!!!!
792,"Entertaining, well shot, solid atmosphere, an overall good movie. The only flaws were the predictable events here and there. Because we already saw this here, and that there... and most of the actors were way too young for that kind of characters. That choice is probably to target a young audience. But it made the story less credible."
793,"Actual line from the movie ""We can't see anything out here"" ""I can't see ****"", no neither can the viewing public, waste of time, don't bother"
794,"Of course. It wouldn't be an underwater movie without the Marianna's Trench.T.J. Miller huh. That may balance out Kristen.A dream?We are starting quick.She needs to find some shoes.Two anime nerds find each other :)That was a fast first half hour.I like T.J.'s positive attitude. I'm glad he is playing the ""hysterical coward"".You are the smallest but is your suit any different size? I doubt it. Those are likely very expensive and made as one size fits all.Why would you do that with your thumb?Maybe you should douse your lights and just head for the next red light.Scoop that Jimmy!"
795,Dead Space 4: Ocean World Necro Boogaloo.I am used to Kstew being in some regressive ess jay double you stuff so wrote it off when it was at the cinemas but recently got around to seeing it and it's surprisingly good!
796,"This doesnt come close to the creature classics like alien, the thing etc. But it has it's moments and Kristen Stewart is ok but she is no Ripley from alien. you dont get attached to any character, nothing gets explained at the end. Seems like movie tries to do too many things at the same time which makes you question the last 5 minutes of movie where a bigger monster is shown and what looks like the small ones are like worker bees or something. As i said in the title, dont think too much, enjoy whatever you can in bits and pieces."
797,I don't know really what to think of this movie or the ending because it wasn't as much as a thriller
798,"The woeful world of Disney has taken over even mpre studios. That means copycat plots, PG13 films and mire ""family fare. I liked Disney. Unfortunately, that was in the 1960s. Now they are like this film: a monster, and an unoriginal one at that. Skip this CGI bs."
799,"There is no way that people who found this boring even watched this movie. It was intense action from start to finish, literally.Just like most great Sci-Fi movies, they give you bits and pieces along the way without laying it out for you, as some lazy reviews here prefer. You didn't have time for much character love, but the pacing kept you moving along.Thank god it didn't suffer from one character dragging the whole film down with an unnecessary affliction. I saw Stewart as brave, stressed to extremes, and brilliant in this role, exemplifying true empowerment thru her decisive actions in crisis.I couldn't be more happy with a movie...it had everything, from being super entertaining, to terrifying, to really making me think about it, far after it ended. I've skipped writing reviews for a ton of movies, but this one does NOT deserve the crappy reviews. This should've been a blockbuster."
800,"One word for the entire movie is that its not worth watching even if its free. cheap acting, cinematography and worst storyline"
801,"The film kept me attentive from beginning to end, it has a credible story from the point of view of science fiction, where events are explained satisfactorily, and everything is concluded in a convincing way, in addition to the film striving to make scientific sense.This film is extremely underated, and I don't know why people are criticizing it so much.Grade 10."
802,"The overall plot seemed inviting, but the dialogue is tacky and the acting is really bad.It steals pretty much everything from other alien/horror movies at a deep discount.If you wanna see how a good alien/horror movie should look even when it steals all of its ideas from other movies....watch ""Life""You'll see the insane difference in screenplay and direction and cohesive filmmaking"
803,"Why so much hate when its directed under such Classic pace ?
Way better then expected"
804,Wasn't expecting much got even less don't know why I rated it so high
805,"A typical genre movie but elevated. It's what you would expect but the performances are quite good, the effects are eye-pleasing, the mystery is captivating, the thrill is there, and there is just enough innovation to the plot. And it works awesome overall - for a movie and popcorn night!"
806,"I thought this movie was great for what it was. The action is non stop. The stress is palpable. They also somehow invest you in these characters - the director is great.... he pulls you in and never lets go. I mean that as literally as possible. Idk- maybe it's my phobia of deep water but this movie was totally freaking nuts from start to finish.! I mean this isn't a drama it's not emotional , it's not mind blowing . It's an action flick. The science fiction aspect for me just made it cooler and more interesting. I mean for me? When you're digging that deep in the earth, there is no way you're not going to run into something crazy... side note: I read a review and they were saying that it was so unbelievable because they were digging under water. I had no idea that people existed that didn't know this is what almost every developed country does now. Oil anyone?? So yes the underwater drilling is realistic - the water alien? Who knows?"
807,"Not sure why there were so many negative reviews. This is a surprisingly good film, it is tense and the right amount of suspense.
The story is very good and easy to follow, it has excellent CGI, the cinematography is top quality and the acting very believable. KS is brilliant in her role though all are very good.
I am a professional diver and I know what being in the 'black' is like, though I've never been 7 miles down (no one has), this film really conveys the fear you would have."
808,No where near as bad as some reviews suggest. Cant stop thinking that Kristen Stewart would make an awesome Ripley.
809,"Great idea, but it was poor production... alot of noise, could not see any creatures for half of the movie. just didn't do a great job. Wasted my time."
810,"Underwater is what I was expecting, a classic underwater monster fest that rocked! Not the greatest actors but a superb story and creature that made me entertained! If your looking for Oscar worthy film then your barking up the wrong tree, this film is what it suppose to be a B- Movie Creature feature! A must see!"
811,"Cheesy but decent. Borrows from Alien, Avatar, every other movie about some audacious human effort messing with nature and failing spectacularly"
812,"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It takes place entirely in the Mariana Trench, almost 7 miles deep and with water pressures of over 15,000 psi. Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment. I replayed a couple of scenes with only my TV speakers on and all the great sound disappeared. It is a dramatic difference."
813,"Can't find any surprise from the movie, but it did entertained me, which I think is a decisive element for anyone to rate a movie. The storyline keep me focus along the movie, but it doesn't develop enough. Neither background nor hints giving regarding those creature, what a waste. Anyhow, Kristen Steward's acting is not that bad, I would say is average. This movie is watchable especially when you are looking for something straight forward. Go ahead."
814,"The movie is ok, with a ok story but the acting of Kristen Stewart still pretty bad! It's like watch Twilight under water! I not even know how she still getting movies to do since she is always looking tired and no will! The movie will be much better with any other woman actor for sure!"
815,"Seriously, don't listen to all the haters who bash this movie. I personally don't understand them, as I think this is an awesome movie. Is it totally original, or a piece of cinematic gold, no, it's not. It definitely borrows many themes from past films of similar stories of its kind, but it also includes new twists and what not within those borrowed themes. But it's a fun, creepy, suspenseful movie that kept me engaged in it the entire run time. Its even got some pretty good humor mixed in there as well. Like I said, it's not some amazingly smart and original piece of storytelling, but that doesn't just automatically make it a bad movie by a long shot. Like I stated, I personally really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times and do not understand all the hate it gets. So I say if you are deciding whether or not to watch it, don't listen to all the naysayers. Watch it, and decide for yourself."
816,This is the movie you go to cinema for. My favorite moment is when Vincent Cassel says his dauther is 12 and later we find out why. Tears...
817,"Fast entry to unknown to a alien fight from depths in coolass suits. Miss Stewart really looks like young Ripley, well guess that was the idea. No logic needed just few cold ones and good company. Critics can kiss the... Just enjoy the movie."
818,"Underwater is a sci-fi horror film directed William Eubank (The Signal, Love). Starring Kristen Stewart in the lead role, it rehashes virtually every cliche of both its genres to such an extent that it begs the question ""why bother at all?""Deep beneath the ocean at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the underwater drilling rig Kepler 822 is hit by a massive earthquake, destroying most of the structure and leaving its remaining crew stranded. Trying to reach the safety of a neighbouring rig over a mile away, mechanical engineer Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) leads a small collective of survivors across the treacherous ocean floor while wearing special pressurised suits. Unbeknownst to the crew, the earthquake was caused by a group of previously undiscovered creatures that are now in the process of stalking and picking them off one by one.If the basic premise above sounds familiar to you, then that's because it is. ""Underwater"" shamelessly steals ideas and plot points from better, more entertaining films like Alien(s) and The Abyss, trying to pass them off as something new with the assumption that the audience should be admiring the filmmakers for this. Of course, it isn't uncommon for films to take influence or respectfully borrow from other sources but there needs to be a sense of nuance for that to work properly. This film doesn't so much use its influences wisely as much as rip them off entirely. While watching, I often found myself checking off the typical tropes one should expect in a movie like this - the tough female lead, the token friend who's only there to be killed off later on, the enigmatic monsters who want nothing more than to prey on the heroes, the overly complicated scientific jargon, the malfunctioning equipment at crucial times... I could go on but I think you get the idea.The film's biggest faults, however, are its poor character development and unnecessarily fast pacing. Right from the beginning we are thrust into the action without properly establishing why these rigs are at the bottom of the ocean in the first place or why these particular people are operating them. It is hinted that some bigshot mining company is running things behind the scenes but the extent of their control over these underwater structures never truly feels as impactful as it should. Additionally, the lurid use of dark colours to emphasise its deep sea setting does a big disservice to the whole viewing experience. It became difficult to distinguish who was who in their suits while navigating the ocean floor and whenever danger was presented to them, I wasn't sure who had survived or not. Worst of all, by the time I had figured it out, I remembered that I didn't even care about that character to begin with so trying to ascertain who they were all along felt pointless in the end. In spite of this, there are some fleeting creative choices in cinematography, showcasing the backdrop of humanity's ignorance of our own ocean, for which we know less about than outer space. It's a shame moments like these are wasted in a film like this.As far as the cast goes, I feel only Kristen Stewart is worth mentioning. Even though her character's backstory is woefully underwritten, to her credit, she still gives a surprisingly good performance as a mechanical engineer who understands the technical aspects of the rig she works on. Even though she comes off as a bit young to be playing a role like this in certain scenes, I think Stewart is a good actress overall who is clearly trying to escape the stigma of the Twilight franchise people still associate her with even to this day. However, scenes where she tries to fight off the monsters by herself never felt convincing enough for me to take seriously. It is clear she is trying to emulate the strong no nonsense female action heroes like Ellen Ripley in the Alien series, right down to the short hair, but she has a long way to go before she'll ever be on that same wavelength.While it's not completely terrible, the film is just so frustratingly mediocre in its execution that it simply isn't worth one's time. There are so many other sci-fi horror films out there that you may as well be watching instead and this one will likely be forgotten about very shortly. At least, at only 95 minutes in length, it is all over before you know it.I rate it 4/10"
819,"For those who can let go off their brains for the length of that movie will be probably entertained.
For those who can't, it will be tedious. There are so many plot and logic holes, that the whole US Navy could pass through without being noticed.
Literally everything in this film is mediocre. 30, maybe 20 years ago it would be a higher rated movie, but too many films raised that bar in that genre.
That being said, it's not a bad movie, but not a good one either."
820,Very nice movie I loved at till the end . Get bit claustrophobic
821,"The scariest part is when Kristen Stewart moves a large piece of rubble to reveal T.J. Miller. Absolutely shocking to see that ass in a 2020 movie.Miller's awful ""humor"" is indicative of the garbage dialogue through much of the first half: a mix of bad jokes and cliches in what's meant to be a horror movie. The script is total trash overall, actually. The story is just Cloverfield underwater, and it's even harder to see what the hell is going on when a handheld camera is exchanged for murky water. There are some visual nods to Cthulhu, but it's not very impressive and feels very misplaced."
822,The scenes were to dark due to which i was not able to see anything...especially when the captain died i didn't know what was happening....
823,Another horror movie which the black main character dies onscreen first..its annoying truthfully 😤
824,"I thought this would have been a near-perfect movie for me, had I known absolutely nothing about the ending. For the one type of viewer that will love this, knowing even a single percent of facts going in will ruin it. Knowing even a clue about the end made it a decent, but unspectacular view for me. So basically, for most interested viewers, it's decent. For a few, it's great, if you know absolutely nothing going in. Keep the expectations low and you'll be fine, either way."
825,"This film took me to my little explored interests and to interesting
feelings of intrigue of what horrors or happy wonders we may find
in the depths.I sure did appreciate this film and I just wish there had been more to the
story. I hope to see future movies expanding on some of these ideas.Cheers."
826,"Simply. You know what you're going to get with this movie and it delivers on all levels. I watched the trailer for it, decided to watch it and I was not disappointed.The 2/10 critics say there was no back story. You should have been watching he first 2 minutes instead of fiddling with your phone or arranging your drink and popcorn. That was the back story.5/10 critics say there was no let up. There were, but when mayhem is going on all sound you I'm pretty sure they would be few and far between. I was paced perfectly IMHO. Anyway. I expected a roller coaster and I got one. Would you expect breathing space if your deep sea drilling platform suddenly blew up? No pun intended there.For those who haven't seen it. Don't go in expecting a long drawn out film like the abyss (which in my opinion is a masterpiece of film making). But it's pretty much 3 hours long (extended version). This is a short 1hr 30min high octane action flick with a creature to boot. It all makes sense. The acting is very good. The effects are excellent. The script is perfectly good, the direction is fabulous, the technical aspects are brilliant considering the complexity of making films in water, the creature is frightening, the end is surprising and good. It keeps you glued to it for the entire time. The editing is perfect. Those that thought it was boring clearly missed salient information as they were distracted with their own stuff and as a result didn't feel it hung together well. I kind of understand gay in Coronavirus world you might be watching on your TV. Yes. You need a projector and 120inch screen for films like this else they look dark and you don't necessarily get the full effect. Don't be fooled by 4K 75 inch screens. Still way too small. Pay a little extra and get a proper cinema experience with surround sound and then you'll be able to appreciate these kinds of films properly in you own home. Else - see it at the cinema before writing critiques"
827,"Not every word written by man should be turned into a movie
It's a man vs. nature film that asks if humankind has overstepped their position
The plot is crap and is full of holes"
828,"This is my first review but I thought this film was worth putting in my two cents. I enjoyed it , it has some intense moments, and the pace moves along swiftly. It DEFINITELY has a Cloverfield vibe to it. ( TJ Miller was in the first Cloverfield flick and John Gallagher JR was in 10 Cloverfield Lane...hmmm) I almost expected to JJ Abram's name pop up on the credits. Not the best movie ever, but you could do way worse.
What I liked:
Fast pacing
Good intense scoring
The claustrophobic feeling
Not so much:
Character development
At some points, it gets easy to become distracted(even when they are giving major plot points, and whatever ""backstory""- which isn't a ton, I found that I had to go back a few scenes a couple times.)"
829,"Some decent tension in the movie, don't watch it if you're claustrophobic. Do not try hard to think about the technical details of the plot, they are completely unrealistic. I was also curious why one character was wearing neoprene sleeves on both elbows and knees for the entire movie, was that supposed to look cool or what? Some of the FX were pretty cool. Not a big fan of the epilogue, maybe they were trying to provide for a sequel, but with an $80M budget it lost a LOT of money, so don't hold you're breath for Underwater 2 lol."
830,"There's really no script in this movie. There is action though and lots of darkness. There's about 5 minutes of movie prior to the climax of the film which lasts pretty much the rest of the film. There isn't much character development or story to speak of. It's mostly just wondering who of the stereotypical characters are going to live or die given the circumstance they've fallen into after the first 5 minutes.
It might be interesting to see a precursor to this movie, but this movie is kinda meh."
831,An underwater oil drilling company awakens Cthulhu and his Deep Ones to the terror of the underwater station's crew that desperately tries to both understand and escape their iminent doom!
832,"Well ... I preferred Alien 🤣
It's just another catastrophy movie under the see 😒"
833,"Do yourself a favor and watch the original ana subsequent versions of The Alien. This derivative just doesn't cut it. No character development, barely a plot, shoddy monster and filmed too dark."
834,Not much else to say..Watch it.. it's like Cloverfield universe under water... Great film!
835,"This film is a monster theme, no sense of terror, no deep sense of human nature revealed, only empty 90 minutes."
836,"Underwater is a 2020 American science fiction horror film directed by William Eubank and staring Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Jessica Henwick and John Gallagher Jr. Underwater was made on a $50-80 million budget but only grossed $40.9 million therefore squandering any hopes of a sequel.Underwater isn't exactly a unique story, Alien but underwater, that's basically the thought process of the movie but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. The cast is likeable, Kirsten Stewart, Vincent Cessel and Mamoudou Athie both open the film with a cliche yet enjoyable start however the character motivations in the second half of the film are believable but questionable by how they go about it therefore dampening the believe ability slightly.The classic trait of an unseen monster lurking around a confined space is an overused trait in Hollywood but that doesn't mean this isn't one of the better films to use it, the few glimpses of the monster work well to build tension , however, Underwater is hampered with many of the genres typical cliches making certain points predictable and therefore causing many moments to feel unsatisfactory and a few deaths meaningless.Underwater has many flaws, the character development is horrendous and the lack of explanation for what's going on can easily confuse the audience but if you like dumb monster movies then you can do far worse then this movie and I must say that I enjoyed the little snippets of news articles at the beginning and the end, that was a nice addition.The claustrophobic nature of this film works superb with its underwater setting and is one of the better features of this film as you personally feel confined as well. The cast do well enough with the basic script they are given and the few glimpses of the monster work well to build up tension but for a horror movie it doesn't induce genuine scares and feels more like it should be just be classed as just an action/thriller.Underwater won't revolutionise the genre in the same way Alien did but does have a few enjoyable scenes, however, it feels more suited to being the fourth Cloverfield movie then being a stand alone film. If they would have linked it to the Cloverfield universe then this movie would have worked better, however as a stand alone flick it fails to impress in certain parts and leaves you unsatisfied throughout with a mix of enjoyable and unsatisfying moments makes Underwater an very average film."
837,"This one is awkard I must say. The film starts without any proper context and then jumps right away into the action. For lot of you that might be thrilling enough but for me personally; that wasn't something I can acknowledge from my heart.A Sci Fi thriller/horror must have a well built pretext. You can't just start the story right away. And also the Pacing is too fast. It's weird that most of the times I complain about Pacing issues in a film. I usually applaud those who has shorter runtimes but unlike here. The film had gone too abruptly. The characterization is next to nothing. I couldn't connect to any of those. Kristen Stewart, she is a talented actress no doubt but even with her eye catching portrayal here. This film hadn't gone anywhere. The most frustrating thing is how little it provided in terms of Backstory, Depth in the characters and Any sort of explanations about what the heck was going on.It seemed like a simultaneous sequence of random events that occur because of a supposed attack on the underground facility. And that's just about it. Why they were there? What is the actual purpose of them being there? What are those things that are attacking them and why! This movie aroused more questions than answers unfortunately. And that I can not bear to be honest.In a Sci Fi flick, you must show us some sort of Explanation, Clarity on the main concept you are showing. But the overkill editing here looked like they were in a hurry. The Cinematography as well wasn't fully flawless. Some scenes practically looked shallow and too tight for my liking. Sound score was generally good with some Nice effects here and there. That surely helps to build up the tension. And to a certain extent it succeeds too. But Sometimes in order to pump up the drama or any scare element they brighten up the tones and to be frank it sounded awkard on few of those specific occasions.The honest applause must go to the CGI and Art Direction department. They had done an excellent job. No doubt about that. And maybe a bit to Kristen as she done a good job as well. The asthetics of the film too kinda saved it in my humblest opinion. An Incomplete final product that seriously could have been better"
838,"Immediately upon watching Underwater well honestly as soon as you read the synopsis you think ""Alien"", ""The Abyss"", or even ""The Thing"". All of which is understandable and it wouldn't be a bad thing if not for the fact that Underwater isn't just similar to those great film but it isn't any better. This film doesn't really bring anything new to the genre or concept of ""crew in an isolated place with little to no hope of an outside rescue while an unknown entity hunts them down."" Which is a shame because the entire cast actually does a great job of giving the impression of a close knit team and the special effects and direction are equally good. But everything else falls apart cause it's nothing we haven't seen done before and better. And yes there was the whole Cthulhu angle but even that was really explored in a satisfying way. I mean the ""old ones,"" are known for driving mortals insane by showing them that everything they know about existence is wrong right? Then why not go down that route instead of trying to out Alien Alien?"
839,It's not a bad writing and cinematography. But there are no surprising moments and no development. That was a really good idea but didn't used well as i see. Even the sounding is cliche. I couldn't like it.
840,"Was hoping to have a Titanic style backstory leading up to the action. Instead they just dive, pun intended, right into massively disjointed fast paced chaos. It was difficult to differentiate what was exploding & collapsing. There's no view of the underwater structure that gives you an idea of it's shape or size. Why are they even there? They appear to be drilling, but neglect to tell you for what. Many gaps in the story. Acting isn't bad. Stewart never smiles which isn't any different than most of the characters she portrays. Wish I hadn't wasted the $5.99 to rent this movie. The lack of any explanation for the company being seven miles deep, along with no attempt to make you care about the characters, leaves you feeling more sympathetic to the creature than it's victims."
841,"With a great tense action beginning, I thought that the movie would be like this every time, but soon, the movie start to stay slow, with some monsters, but everything dark a lot, have a great third act, but lost to much time with the runaway of the characters."
842,"It wasn't great movie
the monster shape wasn't scary"
843,"The story is just plain bad, 0 character development, you just cant give a damn about anyone.About the science, so a suit can stand 11km of water pressure but it gets destroyed when u ascend and the pressure declines, wtaf? And the same suit can get cracked by 3 hits with a fire extinguisher? Poor acting and bad directing. 5/10 for the visuals"
844,"Starting the story seems to be a good one ,but spend most time with nothings clear No relationships in the team, what's wrong with the base .Just scream , running in the dark and die by pressure . No story or anything in her thinking. Kristen is good in another bad ones."
845,"There is nothing to watch in this movie, no characters, weak directing, bad story and the movie scenes mostly unclear..Just skip this."
846,"The film had no new ideas, just a simple copy of the Alien 1979.
Instead of space, events happen in deep water."
847,"SFX great, ACTING great, BAD storyline. I mean is this story about kristen or the creature?? Gosh, my wish fullfilled she died at the end, and this movie also die with her. Im glad im watching this once only. After all, not recommended... Owh bt the way 5 stars is only for the SFX."
848,"I love my Lovecraft Ian, cosmic horror about as much as anyone else. I also don't mind the action taking place after only 2min of show time. ""Neat! More time for them to discover the threat while showcasing character development organically and not showcasing the bare minimum."" But I didn't get that. I got something that looked fun but nothing more substantial than a ""we shouldn't be here"" explanation. Anyway, this quarentine has me with a lot of time on my hands but I can't say that I enjoyed the time I spent watching this. I'll go back to playing my Eldritch Horror board game."
849,Things were happening so fast and being mostly dark it was hard to tell what exactly was happening..? Nothing was ever explained or even discussed.. and kristen stewart looks like slim shady but with smaller boobs!
850,"Rented the Blu-ray version and it was potato quality. You could hardly see anything that was in the underwater scenes. The ""creatures"" are hardly scary because of this and really only the jump scares give it some sort of a horror feel. What you could see was wisp, something floating in the dark corners, and monster things in holes. I think.The storyline was full of information that lacked details and the characters weren't relatable. TJ Miller was a great distraction from some of the more disappointing parts but he was taken way too soon. Overall, it was a subpar film. I thoroughly enjoy underwater creature features and this cured an afternoon of quarantine."
851,As for watching this movie Kristen Stewart was basically the only entertaining thing lol. It was a good start in the beginning but kind of a boring movie. This is in the top 20 of best horror movies in 2020. It really wasn't though.
852,"This one has really got it all (except story or characters)! You get to follow the adventures of Not Ellen Ripley as she battles an onslaught of creatures from the deep, thirsty for blood or something. Look, they didn't bother with story so there's no use spending much time on it. Nobody would watch it for the plot.It's not bad, per se, so much as it's just really forgettable. You couldn't care less about these characters, so the peril never hits home. Nothing is really at stake.
It's more of an effects reel than an actual movie.It's not the kind of failure that involves trying and faltering, it's the kind that involves no effort at all - staying at home with folded arms and refusing to participate.Since you're watching to see what the monsters look like: they're fine. The whole movie is fine. It looks good but has little to offer, so Kristin Stewart is perfect for the role!"
853,"There are countless aliens movie I have ever watched. If just compare the Aliens classic, it is way less good for this one. Especially under the water encounter, just too blur and cannot fight back by armless human. Just see escaping escaping and escaping. It's exciting though but it's not hold the breath kinda. But still can watch for this one, long time didn't see Kristen movie."
854,"Kristen Stewart is really starting to impress me. Even in a throwaway monster movie such as this, she really steals the show. I really enjoyed the visuals as well as the pacing even if it was predictable. Some of the scenes of claustrophobia are intense and I liked the dynamic of the group. I usually like movies shrouded in ambiguity but this could have given us just a little more."
855,"The story is really old and boring, should refer to the extreme cold and alien, but the effect is really bad.But there's one thing that's good about this piece, and that's the way it's presented, the kind of hazy darkness that's almost suffocating, the most powerful monster you've seen in a long time."
856,"I never thought Kristen Stewart was much of an actress. But she certainly surprised this reviewer with an excellent performance in ""Underwater."" Hers ranks up there with five-star performances in this genre from Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hamilton, Radha Mitchell, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her character sweated bullets while still maintaining focus and using her knowledge to try to survive under extreme hardship, which the top actresses (listed above) have done in the best sci-fi/horror movies. So what a shame that her five-star performance was wasted in this so-so flick.I think character development is overrated in most thrillers, but this had embarrassingly little. At least the other actors took their cue from Ms. Stewart and did a good job displaying significant fear while at the same time trying to hold it together. And the movie almost redeemed itself in building tension and suspense until the monsters showed up, then things went quickly downhill. A monster would attack one of the five humans, then its compadres would hold back for some reason, and the reason was not shown or even hinted at. Their apparent hostility towards the human invaders of their space, combined with their formidable speed, strength, and agility could have easily enabled the monsters to quickly terminate all the humans whenever those humans were vulnerable when walking slowly outside of the various underwater facilities or vehicles. So a five out of ten is the best I can do here. Hopefully, Ms. Stewart will get another chance to star in a much better movie from this genre."
857,How can a movie with four F words and 3 Gods name in vein still be pg13 only in a sick Godless society
858,"This movie is a mish mash of Abyss, Alien and Life. They do not serve solely as inspiration - so many scenes and moments are taken directly from these three movies and it is hard not to notice when watching. If you have never seen any of those 3 it may very well be a fun popcorn flick to watch, but I would urge you to check out those instead."
859,"This movie combines other horror and horror-sequel films that are beloved and makes a somehow terrible version-Life, Descent, and Alien come to mind. I spent $5.99 to rent this, and couldn't have been more bored. In fact, I contemplated turning it off to find a FREE movie go watch. But Levi, why? It has no point; there is not a plot that is revealed. There are no characters you care for and their development is void. The lack of scares and jumps were limited to under four.Watch if you want, but every point of this movie I was hoping for it to end sooner than later."
860,"Actually I had two titles for my review. The other was: ""Well, what do you know, Kristen can (almost) act! I wanted to give this title a 6.5 because it wasn't really that bad... What I really appreciated and what really bothers me about most sci-fi movies, is that there weren't that many slow moments. The action starts almost immediately and is non-stop. There aren't too many scenes where characters stand around and look at each other meaningfully while the disaster happens all around them. So many movies nowadays are full of those. It kept me guessing - I was never sure whether the main character Norah was going to be the only survivor or were others going to make it a swell. Or maybe they were all doomed? And even though I'm no expert on deep water drilling, I don't think there were too many scientific goofs, at least nothing that made me think, ""no way!"" and jarred me out of the experience. So, I actually enjoyed the movie except at the end I was left wanting to know more about the creature. Where did it come from? What was it? What was its relationship of the smaller, human-like creatures? I wanted to know!
Favourite moment: the tunnel where it's caved in and dips under water, Norah says: ""I'm the smallest, I'll check it out."" The deep dive suits are all the same size, Sherlock!"
861,The look was ok but the writing and acting was super boring. The screenplay writer should retire . I don't reccomend this to anyone.
862,"This movie is about an underwater base in the deepest known spot of the ocean, the Marianna trench. Down there things get really messy when the system for unknown reasons fails and the base is falling apart. The survivors are trying to figure out what's going on while they're trying a way up to the surface. The enormous pressure down there is not making it any easier either. But their worst enemy is not the natural enviroment but some malevolent form of life.
It's an entertaining movie with really nice special effects but the character development and the acting are pretty mediocre. Same goes as for the scenario which has so many holes. Despite these issues it's a decemt movie that can keep you vigilant for as long as it lasts."
863,"This 2020 sci-fi/horror film features Kristen Stewart (Twilight) as an oceanographer, Norah who finds herself in an underwater nightmare when an earthquake occurs and she and her team become terrorized by mysterious creatures from the ocean floor. This is ok, but could've been better. There's some tense moments, Stewart does a decent job and I like the music. The film also has similar yet obvious aspects of ""The Abyss,"" ""Leviathan"" and ""Sphere."" If you like creature features, give this a try."
864,"Wasn't very good. Slower paced, not very clear to see what's happening on screen and then the final bit of action and monster stuff was pretty cheesey looking and scripted."
865,I often wonder why so many British actors are staring in movies. Kristen answers that for me. However she is the perfect person for this movie with is 85% in a helmet. The story is average and predictiable but it kept my attention.
866,"We have about 30 minutes till meltdown.
And, uh, it's gonna blow us into tiny pieces to the surface.Am I a Kristen Stewart fan? On the contrary. To be honest, I seriously dislike this actress. Not that her acting is so terribly bad. And in a way, she's not a bad looking young woman either. But her attitude and facial expression don't really make her amiable. In the past I've already mentioned that her phlegmatic character equals that of a pancake and it seems as if her face was drenched in starch, because of her emotionless look. ""Personal Shopper"" and ""Equals"" were suitable films for this ""always-seriously-looking"" actress. Unfortunately, ""Personal Shopper"" was terribly boring and sleep-inducing. So, what convinced me to watch the movie ""Underwater""? No idea. Maybe because I heard this spectacle film was kind of a mixture of ""Alien"" and ""The Abyss"". In retrospect, this fact was also rather disappointing.You can compare ""Underwater"" with a classic dish served in an average brasserie. It smells good and tastes delicious, but it lacks the finesse of a star restaurant. You don't get excited. And you don't look disappointed at your empty plate, hoping that a waiter comes over and asks if you want an extra portion. The only feeling left is that of recognizability. Haven't we seen this before? And didn't it taste the same as the last time?I have to admit the film continues at a blistering pace. Before you realize it, the entire underwater drilling platform collapses and Norah (Kristen Stewart) must hurry through destroyed corridors and debris-filled compartments. A claustrophobic spectacle that takes place seven miles deep at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest known spot in the ocean. At first glance, it appears to be an undersea earthquake that causes Norah and some survivors quickly have to figure out an escape scenario. But when they step along the ocean floor, in heavy, futuristic-looking wetsuits (""Pacific Rim"" inspired gear), it soon becomes clear that it's something else that's attacking them. Once again, it's humanity that pushed the boundaries. Like the speleologists in ""The Silence"", the drilling company most likely is the cause of unearthly creatures surfacing. In short, they have tapped into the wrong source while drilling for raw materials.I myself had that feeling of breathlessness while watching ""Underwater"". When you realize that this crew is surrounded by millions of tons of ocean water that presses on them with crushing force, you wouldn't want to trade places with them for any money in the world. A stumbling walk through pitch-black darkness, knowing that you could run out of oxygen anytime, your pressure suit could implode due to a construction fault or a strange underwater monster sucking the life out of you in a fraction of a second. I'd hyperventilate and show panicky behavior for less. ""Underwater"" is a suitable film for viewers who prefer to watch a movie that is packed with persistent action scenes. So preferably, no character development or a sophisticated storyline that's being built up in a subtle way. In short, for fans of fast food chains and fast microwave meals (Indeed, I am quite culinary-inspired today).Although you can admire a multitude of fantastic underwater footage (and making underwater images is no easy task), the fact it all takes place underwater (hence the film-title) is a disadvantage to the film. The images aren't really clear and most of the time blurred and hazy. Especially during the vigorous moments when the sea monsters play an important role. Thus, the moments when the crew experienced a life-threatening situation, the footage didn't have the desired impact most of the time. And that was the biggest turnoff for me. The lack of any tension. It's not a completely boring film, but there wasn't really nail-biting suspense. No astonishing plot twists or surprises. In addition, none of the actors really stood out. They were all uninteresting, two-dimensional characters, to say the least. I can't really call ""Underwater"" impressive. Even Kirsten Stewart's ultra-short bleached haircut didn't have the desired shock effect. And to be honest, it didn't help that she walked around half of the movie in her underwear. If they had chosen Scarlett Johansson instead, it would have made an impression. In that case, the three-dimensional aspect of the character Norah would come across much better! Significantly better!More reviews here: movie-freak.be"
867,"A decent watch if you can completely suspend your disbelief, AND it's on a streaming media you've already subscribed to, but don't pay money to rent it.
Lots of action, but the premise is unexplainable. Let's completely set aside the unexplained monster subplot for a moment in favor of other unbelievable issues.
Drilling for oil in the deepest trench in the world by a 'for profit' corporation who is building hugely expensive and unnecessarily gigantic underwater stations, complete with nuclear reactors, deep inside one of the most active earthquake faults in the world, (seriously, it's a trench because it's between two tectonic plates), that at nearly seven miles underwater it is the most hostile environment in the world? Only if there's literally no other source of oil in the world and the oil is infused with diamonds, gold, and viagra.
Plus, the writers clearly have zero understanding of nuclear power. One, a nuclear meltdown is not an explosion (the Chernobyl explosion wasn't nuclear, watch the mini-series). Two, there is no built in mechanism to deliberately cause a meltdown, everything is designed to stop one. Three, the Marianas trench might actually be the safest place in the world to have a nuclear meltdown; no water currents to carry irradiated particles to other parts of the world, and an inexhaustible supply of freezing cold water to collapse steam bubbles and remove decay heat. In fact, due to that last one, I'm not sure a meltdown would even be possible there.
But if you can set all that aside, keep your expectations set on ""thrill ride with very little plot required"", you will enjoy this movie."
868,"I liked it. Ok it's not very original, but sets and effects were convincing , and it managed to pull off that horrible claustrophobic feel. And anything with Vincent Cassel in it is always worth watching. The cast overall were pretty solid. Worth watching."
869,"Although story plot is interesting script is not well developed. No background of drilling station, not enough information about how they work, which control deck where is veiewer can't understand what is going on and where those characters ?
This is major fault of the movie as me. Moreover director also confused about what to present on scree either deep water accident horror or under sea creatures' horror. That makes nothing part be impressive and movie looks like average, though they have a lot of hardwork and difficulties to make such underwater shooting. However photography is poor it should have better. Kirsten Stewart is looks like same as Charlies Theron in Mad Max : Road of Fury. Others are just okay. End is predictable and not effective. Overall it is an average movie."
870,"..about this one, as many pointed out already. A mix of expected cut offs from other similar movies. As I said - nothing epic here, but it is all about being entertained and this movie delivers (marginally...). Believable acting, interesting (not much of originality though..) script. However, it is entertaining to watch for at least once, provided that you have large screen and decent sound system - there are lots of low light scenes and atmospheric sound effects."
871,"I must admit, I liked this movie! I don't however see how this was an 80 million dollar budget movie...and the really sad part? It only mad 40 million worldwide. Ouch. It does start off with a bang, though. I mean, things starts happing fast within 10 minutes! It's kind of like aliens, only underwater...and if it's a mining operation, what were they mining? Maybe I missed that part of the movie. It's got a lot of suspense, tight squeezes and explosions...lots of stuff us guys like in movies. I don't think it deserved some of the reviews I read, though. It was entertaining and I liked it. Believe me, I've seen much worse. It's not something I'd watch again, but I did enjoy it. Peace."
872,"This was like the ending of Pacific Rim, mixed with Deepstar 6. It kept me interested throughout for the most part, but left me disappointed in the end. The special effects were very good, if a bit over done at points. T.J. Miller was the typical dork he always plays and really isn't an asset to anything he is in. Kristen Stewart was good as usual."
873,I read the negative reviews and decided to watch it any way. I had my guard up at first (because of the negative reviews) but to be honest it was quite enjoyable. I thought the movies in general wasn't bad. I personally don't like comparing it to other movies mentioned in other reviews but if you have nothing else to watch this one is pretty enjoyable and not as bad as what others have made it out to be.
874,"I was looking forward to this.Let's start with the positives. The actors were all doing a good job, especially with Kristen Stewart. The visuals were all breathtaking, with one exception. The monster looked too fake but we just got glimpses so it's not too bad. The underwater suits that the main crew uses look completely real and when they're underwater the camerawork works, unless it's an action scene.Alright, enough being nice, time for what I didn't like. First of all, this may be the first movie where I hated the sound mixing. I could barely hear half of the dialogue because it was 'drowned' out by sound effects or an inappropriately used score. That's the main reason I didn't really have a good time during this movie, because I had no idea what was going on. Also, the camerawork and editing when it's not wides, was not very good and it helped me not understand even more of the movie.Overall, I was expecting a good horror sci fi, but I got a decent sci fi that wasn't scary. I'm just very underwhelmed by this."
875,"So clumsy.
moving cam remains vomit.Kristen Stewart's cool face & shinning body is only remarkable.
that's it."
876,"I just have to LOL at this movie, it seem. The writer and director liked alien movies and wanted to explore the oceans, poor acted and I don't know man is kind bad"
877,"I would say the story, directing and actors are all satisfactory. However, I do NOT feel any threat from the creatures. Kind of soft body species with tentacles and teeth. Not creative enough n definitely not scary enough! Should be classified as a thriller movie without the monster element."
878,"UnderwaterWhat a wasted opportunity this movie turned out to be.
William Eubanks deep sea monster movie hits the bottom of the ocean running but soon runs out of propulsion becoming a lazy cliched snooze fest.
There's lots borrowed from Alien/ Aliens and just about every other good Sci Fi horror movie of the past forty years.
It's sad as the promising start and decent turn from Kristen Stewart is unable to save this movie from sinking.The crew of a deep sea drilling facility become under attack from something sinister lurking in the depths.
It's all been done before and much better. Even low budget 80's chessefests such as 'Leviathan' and 'DeepStar Six"" offered more. Not to mention the vastly superior 'Abyss'.With a budget of 80 million dollars there's some impressive visuals and Eubanks direction is fine.
It's just that the film becomes boring and generic very quickly.
None of the characters are memorable and the script is thin to say the least.
I wanted this film to be great. I'm a massive fan of the genre. 'Jaws' is my favourite movie and the novel 'Meg' by Steve Alten is my favourite book. I even enjoyed the movie adaption.
'Underwater' could have been great but instead it runs out of air pretty quickly and suffocates."
879,"Like the title, this is a film who didn't saw the surface.
An erratic plot (with a poor nuance about environment agression), some weak performances (the story didn't hep either) and a almost complete waste of time."
880,"I will start off by saying I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart and any of her previous movies but honestly in the case of Underwater she's 100% the best part of the movie from start to finish she surprised me with her acting showing that put in the right role she is more than capable of being a lead character in a movie and that she has matured as an actress in this role she is serious, dedicated and looks hot as all hell in a bikini.The movie is a creature feature/survival movie that takes place on a seven mile deep mining rig that is drilling the ocean floor but when the rig is hit by an unknown source the pressure causes most of the rig to explode with only a small group of survivors who now have no way of reaching the surface their only hope is to suit up and walk the pitch black ocean floor to make it to another mining station with escape pods that can get them to the surface but once on the ocean floor they discover new life in the oceans depths awoken by the mining drills now with creature's all around them and oxygen running low it's a race against time to make it to the surface alive.The underwater shots look amazing and capture the dark murky waters of the oceans depths the creature's are actually pretty interesting looking and have a lot of interesting design ideas some aspects are inspired from other creature features such as Cloverfield there's no denying that but you can see some real imagination and effort was put into the movie and that's worth acknowledgement.I went into this movie expecting another disappointing January horror movie but Underwater took me by surprise which is more than most movies have managed to do in the past few years so if you like creature feature movies then you will enjoy this but I would also recommend this movie to people who enjoy survival movies as the creature's aren't the only thing the characters are trying to survive against they also must brave a flooded mining rig in very tight underwater spaces and are trapped inside steel suits meant for Underwater exploration with little oxygen in the suits that also weigh 300 pounds with glass helmets makes you feel claustrophobic just watching."
881,"I think one thing, and this movie it's about another thing. Terrible."
882,"Not huge fan of Kristin, but I liked her in this one!
I rather don't expect much and than be plesently surprised."
883,"Quite enjoyable little film!
First things first:pleasant surprise in a way of the film being not too long!!!Most reasonably expensive to make films ,tend to be 2 hours and more,which most of the times make em too tedious to watch.Otherwise,nothing really special,decent one time watch."
884,"William Eubank's Underwater is a largely derivative, yet solidly thrilling horror-thriller infused with sci-fi elements doesn't go far beyond its familiar premise, but is still a decent victory. The CGI is quite slick and the cinematography is impressive, although it's edited in a choppy way that makes YOU feel a little claustrophobic. Kristen Stewart also headlines this film with a rock-solid performance and despite a wasted Vincent Cassel, T.J. Miller is terrific in his supporting role, bringing the comic relief. Think of it as Alien underwater, or principally The Abyss with few changes. One of them being a massive Kraken-type monster to fight towards the end of the film. Yeah, they jumped the shark. Overall, it's pretty decent, doesn't go anywhere special, but should be sufficient monster entertainment that packs some fun."
885,"Do you have ample time to waste? Do you want to live - no, scratch that, SURVIVE- through 2 hours of senseless, mindless disaster scenes?
Have you always wondered what a movie would look like without a plot or a storyline?
If you answered Yes to these questions, this movie was made for you. Enjoy, you fellow masochist."
886,"This film is typical ""crash"" one. Main characters try to deal with unsuspecting crash of deep water station. Of, one of them is a leader, they have 2 persons in love, person, who jokes a lot, couple of men, who dies first and true hero. This film has all of them. Typically, this film has a question: what happened? The end of the film, of course, is positive with a little bit negative shade. Visual effects are good, the main beast looks like Ktulhu.
Do, this film is only for one watching."
887,How was this company able to construct all these facilities without disrupting these creatures?
888,"Have you seen Alien (1979)? If you have, this is just Alien under water. Pretty disappointing second half, of a promising start."
889,Underwater version of Alien (1979) with Kristen Stewart as the new Ripley.
890,"Do not waste your time, boring af
movies r becoming so boring, there's nothing good anymore"
891,"There was nothing extraordinary about this movie. The plot was OK, acting OK, direction OK. It is a mediocre movie with a few nice thrills and decent pacing. But I don't think many people expected this movie to be a high-end thriller. I have seen worse, but also seen much better (e.g., The Abyss, Jaws, The Meg, Deep Blue Sea, Piranha 3D, Lake Placid).I did not expect much from this movie, but it gave me just enough enjoyment to rate it right in the middle."
892,"""Underwater"" is an Action - Horror movie in which we watch a group of oceanic researchers who are working for a very famous drilling company in a facility located at the bottom of the Mariana Trench trying to reach the capsules in order to survive after the occurrence of a mysterious earthquake.I have to admit that after watching the trailer of this movie I had high expectations from it and unfortunately I was disappointed. I expected more suspense and even more action than what I watched. The direction which was made by William Eubank was poor and I didn't like that not even one character of this movie developed because I believe that in these kind of movies the most important is the character development. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that I expected more from Vincent Cassel who played as Captain and Kristen Stewart who played as Norah and I believe that they both didn't reach their true potential. One good interpretation that has to be mentioned was T.J. Miller's who played as Paul and he was very good but this interpretation wasn't enough to save this movie despite the different touch it gave to it. If you are a fan of Horror movies then this movie isn't for you and it would be better not to watch it but even if you are not a fan of those kind of movies don't watch it because you are going to waste your time."
893,"I'll keep this short. There are three main big issues besides the classic cliches and I'll start from least impactful to most impactful.
First, the use of the very popular so-called ""realistic"" lighting as opposed to having the lighting contribute to the atmosphere. The underwater scenes were great, but there's a lot of moments when it just doesn't give enough of a scary, tense vibe when it could easily do so (a lot of the red-lighting scenes are involved in this). This is also coupled with the last point which I'm going to make and which I believe to ruin this film completely.
Secondly, the jumps cares. Yes, the classic ""Boo! I'm suddenly in front of you!"", the bane of pretty much any good horror film. You just know that if a film has to actively rely on them, it's just not going to be good. The only two good ones were the one with the dead lady in the wreckage and the one on the illuminating platform, which wasn't much of a jump scare all-in-all.
And lastly, the thing that is by far the most horrendous crime committed in the past decade and more, when it comes to pretty much any piece of ""cinema"", if we can even call them that anyways: the over usage of ambiance music or whatever it's supposed to be called. It simply ruins everything. You have a potentially great tense and impactful scene? Why, lets just add some generic ""something spooky and totally not expected is going to happen"" track in the background!
This last point is my main issue, again besides all the generic hack cliches, because it's something that should be so easily avoidable and yet it finds its way into so many films. What for? It doesn't make the film any better and as far as I can tell it just speaks of poor decision making, too much haste and greed.
All in all, could have been a solid 8/10, but I'm not sure it's even worth a 6/10 as it is now. Darn shame, since it seems Kristen Stewart gets pulled into films that lack the directive vision to be any good, no matter how well she may act."
894,The movie doesn't include any surprises as story is totally predictable nor does it introduce anything new. It just that kind of movie to watch if you are in mood for some underwater thrill and somewhat horror. Still not much impressive
895,"Enjoyable enough nothing to think about easy watch, I dont get the negativity? It's never going to be a timeless classic like The Abyss but draws inspiration from it obviously. Also reminded me of another 80's underwater horror called Deep Star Six. A terrible but brilliant monster horror that involves a drilling team that awoke something that picks them off. Put the two together and this movie is their mutation? Plus Kirsten Stewart in underwear what's not to like?? I liked it..."
896,"The black guy in a horror cliche, really? Why did he have to go first, it's 2020 writers and directors . Come on man hahaha"
897,"... its an okay movie that tells a story that was told a hundert times before since Cameron filmed The Abyss. Dont buy the Blueray, dont go to the cinema for it. Watch it if its for free on a streaming service or in your cable- or sattelite programm."
898,Simple movie with a small cast with lots of jump scares and reference audio sounds to test you surround system. Not too bad of a movie.
899,"Interesting premise, but ...
Poor execution
Poorly filmed
Poorly chosen cast"
