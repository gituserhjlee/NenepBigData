0,The 6 rating is mainly for Russell Crow. I mean if she would have given that courtesy honk in the first place all of this could have been avoided.
1,"This movie has the intensity factor which I gave 4 of my 5 points to. The plot is a good idea but geez the main character makes all the worst decisions, classic to keep the story going.Isn't it lucky when she calls 911 and they say oh sorry every officer in the entire city is at one crash so you're on your own with our most wanted murderer, good luck! At least she knows she won't get a speeding fine because literally no cop is around to pull her over. Maybe the Purge could make a combined sequel where there is a car crash then the city is free to do what it wants for the rest of the day."
2,No one in their right mind does the things she and her son do. The script js disappointing in that regard. So you gotta convince yourself that she's not a mentally competent. Also some of thesw stupid choices are cruel. She doesn't care for the strangers who help her. Or risk the life of her client by choosing her. These make the film very bad and not worth watching even though Russell Crowe kinda kills it with his incredible acting.
3,The fact that the main character didn't ask someone walking by to call the police or drive to a police station early in the film really ticked me off. He was able to ride around doing this stuff in broad daylight but in reality they would've called in swat to take him down asap. They would've had an APB out for his vehicle from the 1st crime....I turned it off halfway through.
4,"There's nothing wrong a decent thriller where two people face off on the road using their wits and their heavy machinery. So this movie could have been the Duel (1971) of the 2020s (or at the very least a Joy Ride (2001)), but unfortunately, it lacks a director like Steven Spielberg or John Dahl to make it work.After a shocking opening scene, director Derrick Borte starts off nicely with a disturbing montage that shows us the horrible consequences of explosive aggression and road rage. For a long time, his movie seems to be a passionate plea to have more patience and compassion with others in a harsh society where everyone is under constant pressure, because you never know what the other person is going through. Too bad that he gradually undermines this message with cheap shocks and sadistic violence.It's good to see Russell Crowe again after such a long absence, because watching his heavily disturbed maniac snap and terrorize a lady that just happened to piss him off is definitely one of the scarce highlights of the film. No Oscar material, but the man is still an acting heavyweight (no pun intended... well, maybe a little), so much so that leading lady Caren Pistorius cannot hope to carry this movie in his presence. In fact, her character is so passive and uninteresting that I felt very little sympathy for her plight. I don't know if it was the intention here, but I always love movies where you cheer for the bad guy for a very long time, like Face-Off and Law Abiding Citizen; everyone loves tragic villains, and you always hope that the makers can delay that moment where you lose sympathy for them until the very last.Unfortunately, this moment comes way too soon in the movie. In the first half we get some motivation from Crowe's and Pistorius' character for their actions, but that wears off quickly in an endless rampage that seems to be an excuse for a lot of torture porn. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, as long as you keep developing your key players. Especially psychopaths work best when they remain completely unexplained mysteries, or when they get fleshed out properly, like the psychologic-meltdown classic Falling Down. However, Crowe and Pistorius never get beyond their minimal and one-dimensional backstories. When the bad guy gets to the point where I no longer rooted for him (again, way too soon), you hope that your allegiance changes back to the heroine. But Pistorius' character keeps making such bad decisions (up to and including a laughably set up climax) that by that time, I no longer cared about either, and could only worry about the collateral damage.Too bad for Crowe and Jimmi Simpson, who probably have one of the best scenes together when this movie is still promising. But the pressure to marry action with psychology, and to increase the stakes with such disregard for realism really starts working against the film and characters. I don't mind violence in movies at all, but it should make me invest in characters, not get desensitized and bored.I like a good battle of character like everyone else, but when the action and suspense start feeling stale because I'm no longer emotionally engaged, then it's just mostly a waste of time. But granted, it's not a complete disaster and it had its moments. I hear people praising this movie as super-suspenseful, so by all means, try it out. But don't say I didn't warn you."
5,"She kicks him in the head saying, ""Here's your courtesy tap!""
Throughout the entire movie it lacked any common sense as to what anyone in her position would have done. After getting the holy hell beat out of her she drives off with her son, her face showing very little signs of being beat up. Surprisingly the rear end of her car had no damage at all from being constantly rear ended. A poorly made movie that lacked realism and common sense."
6,"At the first 10 minutes, you start thinking that the heroine is stupid.
Then you start thinking that everyone around her is stupid.
Then you start thinking that the police are stupid.But, in fact, the story and directing are stupid.I wanted to leave the cinema and the only thing that made me watch this till the end is that it's hell-hot outside.The trailer for this movie is better than the movie itself."
7,"It started out with promise, but the unrealistic way that the entire remaining hour of the movie unfolded was actually painful to complete. It's just, it was about the dangers of distracted behaviour while driving mad how people are taking things in their own hands resulting in road rage and accidents, BUT, it completely ignores human behaviour. There is NO way that he wouldn't have been caught 150x over before he killed Andy, let alone the entire scene at the cafe where police would have been there before he left the building. People are glued to their phones, he would have had 100's of people reporting his location. AND THEN there's the phone call to the police from the tablet ""were busy and can't get to you"" 🤣🤣🤣 WHAT?!?
We almost turned it off, but we were invested mad we're hoping it would have turned around eventually, it didn't... The ending was just as bad as the rest."
8,"A lot of convenience in this movie to push the plot forward... Russell Crowe did the best with what he could do but at times his acting felt way too over the top.Overall it has entertainment value to people who want to watch something and turn their brain off... but thrillers should be somewhat logical, and this wasn't.Everything was passable in the film but nothing felt ... worth watching to me."
9,"I can't tell you how many times I wanted to leave the theater because of her stupidity, but it's definitely what the movie was going for. God bless her son though."
10,"I'll start off by saying that i never had super high expectations going in, i thought the movie was going to be somewhat of a psychological thriller but boy was i wrong. I figured since it had Russell Crowe it was at least going to be decent but once again boy was i wrong.Am one of those movie goers that virtually never leaves a movie or wants too, but i actually asked my wife several times a little over half way if she just wanted to go to which she never replied so we just stuck it out. This movie just had zero redeeming qualities, i was perfectly ok with just walking out because i could care less what was happening or going too.The movie was basically torture porn, over the top unrealistic moments designed to shock the audience but it just falls flat on it's face. Also zero interesting dialogue, coupled with super generic progression and ending. I can see why they wanted to make this one of the first movies to come out since COVID-19 to sucker people into seeing this hot trash, otherwise this movie wouldn't make a dime. I wish i would have held out a couple more weeks to see a real movie like Tenet.As me and the wife we're exiting the theater i overheard two other couples saying the exact same thing that the movie sucked, made no sense, etc.Save your money. Utter trash. I legitimately can't believe Russell Crowe signed on for this."
11,"An unstable man under a lot of life stress confront a woman who's having a bad life and a bad day at an intersection. In it what can be cured with a simple apology, yet out of arrogance escalates into a hellish nightmare as the woman's whole life becomes a target of the man's rage.
Out of technicality, the plot is quite simple with few logical gaps. with that in mind and aside from the ridiculously bad choices which the female lead makes across the whole movie not to mention her passive boring personality...Yet with a raw chilling performance from Russell Crowe who owned the aggression and hate of his role, he single handedly managed to elevate the movie to a notable level of thrills, entertainment and excitement. The director succeeds in painting some interesting surprises in the car chase scenes and an over all thrilling experience that is worth watching.Unlike some views, I experienced this movie from a different point of view, to me the whole idea revolves around the concept of decency and common courtesy among mankind that most of us lost, maybe the fake bubble of freedom and personal rights that we live our daily lives in or how awfully some were raised on a fake racist patriotism which believes that a certain nationality/race is above others or or or. All are false reasons to be rude, mistreat others or lose compassion and courtesy for one another.
Either you watch Unhinged for the thrilling entertainment or for the eye opening message the results is quite satisfying on both ends."
12,"This movie had me stressed from start to finish. Russell Crowe is so menacing and believable. Somehow I don't think this role was much of a stretch for Rusty! We left the cinema and was sitting at a green light and the car in front of us didn't move. We just sat there, too scared to toot the horn!"
13,"Predictable, lots of mistakes, exaggerated and stupid. Couldn't wait for the movie to finish."
14,"Let's just start off with this, It Is A Movie.It just kills me when people carry on about believability when watching a fast paced action thriller. What are the odds of someone living through something like this vouching for the realities of the situation? In all honesty, most of us like to think we know what we would do but is there a chance that the pressure, fear and self preservation of the moment could alter our decision making skills? I think it could and I chose to look at films like this with that in mind. These were the decisions they made in the moment and only the absolutely absurd should fall into a category of unrealistic.I liked this. Russell Crowe was fantastic in his portrayal of a fed up lunatic. He really did a great job. I thought the story could have benefited with a bit more backstory on the characters but it was decent. The action scenes were well choreographed and the special effects were nicely done. It was a tense ride for sure and it got pretty brutal at times. I'm a horror buff so that is right up my alley but I read a review that described it as torture porn and it's not that bad unless you are a total lightweight.I know this will be a film I watch more than once. Forget the review snobs and check it out for yourself."
15,The woman in the movie tried her best to avoid calling a police 😂
16,"I groaned as much as crow did in this film and I think my cringe bucket is over flowing. Bad acting, predictable, unrealistic, poor continuity.
I couldn't wait for it to end."
17,"First off, I've never written a review before... This is literally the worst movie ever made, and I paid to watch it... Everything about this movie just sucks lol... Shame on the everyone involved making this POS..."
18,"Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Absolutely brutal thriller with a powerhouse performance from Crowe. It's like a cross between Falling Down & Duel & escalates the tension really well, especially as the sound design is especially prominent helping to portray the heightened sense of drama. The opening credits are there to remind you that escalating violence is on the increase and this plays out as a frightening scenario as to what could potentially happen. I'm never using my car horn again."
19,"Ok, so I'm a fan of Russell Crowe. He has done some truly magnificent work over his distinguished career. However this movie is definitely NOT one of them. It's a psycho thriller with a plot that keeps you interested, but sadly that same plot is riddled with holes and incongruous events. The lead characters aren't for the most part ""believable"", and there are multiple flaws in production. It is also an extremely violent film in parts - yet needlessly so. Having said all of that, it does make a very bold statement about the deterioration of American society into a race of ""proud, angry and intolerant"" people. Glad I saw it (it was the only original feature film on at our cinema!), but won't be seeing it a second time."
20,Nothing really much to say other then a standard hollywood movie with decision making that makes absolutely no sense.
21,"I hadn't seen a trailer or heard anything about this movie when I saw it, and I was pleasantly surprised, I wasn't expecting a horror movie. This movie isn't perfect, it's not even very original, but it's a very serviceable horror movie, good intense car action. Characters are alright but the gladiator guy is the best part. Makes me think twice about honking at people"
22,"Don't drive and do your mascara, don't drive and text/call, don't RoAD rAgE, be COUTEOUS!Brought to you by your auto insurance company."
23,"You will never flip the bird to another driver again once you've seen ""Unhinged"".
This is the most intense road rage movie since Spielberg's ""Duel"" in the 70's with the pressures of life, marriage and death at its core.
Except the Truck is now just a Ford Pick Up with no discernible logos.
Obviously the Blue Oval didn't want to pay for product placement...it is an older model like its manic driver played by Russell Crowe.
This man can happen to anyone.
He only picks one project each year, but he chooses well.
His body of work speaks for itself.
His co-star Carin Pistorius moved to New Zealand as a child from South Africa and she brings a gritty, real performance to the big screen.
She also delivers the best action movie heroine line for 2020.
Veteran horror child actor, Gabriel Bateman, hold his own as her on screen son, Kyle.
This movie is adrenaline charged from the moment the curtain opens and rarely takes it foot off the pedal.
The road carnage and Rustys salary make up most of the 33 million dollar budget, but its investors will be making money off this film and buying many more new cars in the years ahead.
This is Crowe at his best and most threatening study of pure menace under Derrick Bortes direction."
24,"I would not recommend my worst enemy to watch this ridiculous, unrealistic piece of garbage. The actors, the directors and anyone that was part of making this movie should be embarrassed!! None of it made sense from the very beginning. So, because a woman honks her horn at a stranger. Russell Crowe's character then goes through a series of events that includes mercilessly killing anyone in his path just to get an apology. Seriously, Hollywood haven't we scene junk like this from those straight to Netflix, Prime or Hulu movies. Come up with something new. Adding an ""A/B"" actor to it doesn't make it better. I need a refund for the time I wasted watching this crap. What a mess of a movie!!!"
25,"It only reinforces bad behavior and stupidity. Very violent and maniac, makes americans look like morons and irresponsable. Awful plot, super low development, and the famous cliché that the leader characters never get hurt despite all the hitting and punching received! Begins very interesting but 10 minutes on its all you will see! Hate it! Hate that one of mu favorite actors agreed to be in this poor movie!"
26,"Just appalling in every way, no plot, no background to the characters, worst Crowe movie ever, couldn't wait for it to be over. I have no idea what movie the other reviewers watched..."
27,"What a horrible movie. Almost 2 hours of my life I'm never getting. The plot is flat, simple and you can predict it from miles away. Other than that, it's the most unrealistic 'real' movie ever. Don't watch this."
28,"This is one of the few movies, that are exciting every minute. The car chase is well done, it is pretty violent and Russel Crowe is very scary.Go and watch this movie. You'll have a great time."
29,"Everything was bad about this movie. Highly predictable, bad script, bad acting, full of plot holes and mistakes in every area."
30,"This movie is ridiculous. Seriously. If you want credibility, watch something else. But for all that, it's a fun entertaining ride.We are basically asked to believe that poor fat old Russell Crowe, who looks like he'd have a heart attack if he tried to mow the lawn, is a near-invincible unstoppable killing machine. Russ goes to unbelievable lengths to exact vengeance on a woman motorist who has had the temerity to sound her horn at him, which includes murdering various strangers who have the misfortune to cross his path. Admittedly the opening of the film shows Russ bumping off his ex-wife and her new lover. But this is a surely a very personal crime; he has a reason to hate this woman and her boyfriend (at least in his own head). It's a bit of a stretch to believe that he will inevitably go on to kill anybody who just happens to get on his nerves.Russell's invincibility extends to whichever vehicle he happens to be driving. Even your average people-carrier has the strength and stamina of an armoured tank when he's behind the wheel. That is until our heroine tries to outsmart him by driving her vehicle directly into his; at that point Russ's car turns over as easily as a Wendy house. Well you have to give the hapless victim SOME advantages, right?The leading lady does all the necessary dumb things, including ignoring the protection of a team of police officers in order to go head-to-head with Russ on her own. But it's OK; she succeeds in killing the bad guy. As an added bonus, her brother (who was earlier set on fire by Russell - God knows why) has survived and is Going To Be All Right - except for third degree burns all over his body, not to mention the mental trauma of having witnessed the brutal murder of his girlfriend at Russell's hands.So, in summary, nonsense of the highest order, but strangely entertaining. I was on the edge of my seat throughout, and look forward to watching it again on Prime."
31,"The massage is flat.
Scissors, cliché.
Crazy people, cliché.
I almost swipe my phone during the movie.
So sorry to spend my money and time on this.
I this if the message is strong will be a better movie.
It's all confusing in the end."
32,Looked forward to this thriller but it had so many improbable scenarios that I lost the thrill before it ended. Casting was good and it had such potential with a great storyline but I feel the French or German cinema would have done it justice because of their attention to detail.
33,"At this moment in time we all find ourselves in, going to the movies is more than a mere novelty, its a genuine treat, so in that way we can be thankful for Unhinged that opened in Australian cinema's this week.Lathered in a hearty dose of Falling Down, a little bit of Duel and a lot of very angry Russell Crowe (more diabetic angry Kernel Sanders than Maximus), there's nothing new or even particularly great about Derrick Borte's grim thriller, but it does do exactly as what was promised in all the promotions for this grizzly affair, that sees Crowe go into full meltdown mode against Caren Pistorius's unsuspecting mother Rachel in a road rage incident that will make you think twice about beeping the horn next time you're on the road.Originally supposed to be the film that heralded in the return to cinema complexes in America at the start of July, Derrick Borte's topically examination of the rage that is bubbling away within society at this present time, whether its from hour long traffic jams, relationship breakdowns or the mistrust in the ""system"" is far from nuanced or balanced but this simplistic and over the top thriller does provide enough thrills and spills to keep us invested throughout and offers Crowe one of his funnest roles in years.Not often found playing the downright bad guy, Crowe is at his menacing best as the unnamed man haunting Rachel's day, that goes from bad to worse very quickly after running into him on the road on the way to the school drop off, from the moment we watch him commit a brazen act of violence in the films opening scene to the the mere look he gives through the window of a car, Crowe is chewing up the scenery at every chance he gets and it makes watching Unhinged a guilty good time.It must be noted that outside of being extremely far-fetched (as is often the case with such films) and playing out in a fashion that is typical of this sub-genre of thriller's, Unhinged is frequently unpleasant.There's barely a moment of respite from the horrors occurring throughout and if your blood pressure was high before going into a screening of the film it would go through the roof by the time the film is done with you, as while its well-staged and performed, there's an oppressive bleakness seeping through the entirety of Borte's film, making it one to watch when your up for such a grim and grimy affair.Final Say -Charged forward by a snarling and frightening Russell Crowe, Unhinged is a polished thriller that achieves exactly what it promises to do, nothing more and nothing less.3 Fortnite strategies out of 5"
34,"Started off ok then rapidly became that movie full of incredibly stupid moves and fantastic coincidences that make you want to switch it off. It's like the final editor never read the script and just did his thing, don't watch if ANYTHING better is on offer. Wastes potential and naff plot make this one really weak. It's 2020 right now, no one is this dumb in movies anymore..."
35,"The acting was awful - Caren Pistorius was a poor choice.
For me this was just a B grade movie. The plot was boring, predictable and full of violence that we are already seeing too much of these days in family violence and road rage in real life. Why go to a movie and pay a steroid version of it on a movie screen? The ending was absolutely ridiculous. They got to drive away from the scene looking no worse for wear and sounding bright and chirpy. One punch from a 200kg Crowe should have killed her or rendered her unconscious for a week."
36,"It never would've been an issue if she just would have called the police at the gas station. Anything that happened after that was just annoying. It's like they made it seem like the Police and 2nd amendment didn't exist. So there was nothing she could do to protect herself? Oh, and this obviously was not set in Texas because he deeeefinitely wouldnt have made out of the restraunt after what he did! Also, what was up with showing people dying in horrific car accidents? Sorry folks but this one was just bad. The popcorn was good though."
37,"Courtesy taps are the answer. That, and Russell Crowe apparently wants to be John Goodman -- which begs the question why this wasn't a comedy with John Goodman using the same script."
38,Has to be the worst movie of his career. The entire thing is so unrealistic. Most movies have a little realism to them but not this one. Skip it!
39,"This film won't ever win any serious awards. It is nothing more than a short-shelf-life popcorn film and, for that, it is great. I wanted to escape for a couple of hours and have an entertaining time and, I did.Russell Crowe sure packed the weight on recently and in this, he is nothing short of a tank and whilst he was unpredictable, menacing and definitely unhinged - I can't help but feel it made certain parts of the film laughable (Hence the 6 out of 10). For example, if a guy of this size repeatedly punches a slim build woman than I doubt very much she is going to get back up again for another barrage of punches to land on her. The way Crowe moves, the force of his punches and the added sound effects of the ""impact"" make it sound like it would take someone's head clean off or, at the very least, knock them out cold. But, that's a minor gripe.Some of the scenes are pretty tense but if you know nothing about the film, I would avoid the trailers for they give way too much away.A cross between Joyride (Paul Walker) and Falling Down (Michael Douglas), although that's almost an insult to the latter.Yes it is paint by numbers filmmaking but if you want something well acted, enjoyable (if you like film violence) and looking to pass the time - you'll leave happy enough. You just probably won't return to watch it again any time soon."
40,This movie will surely lock you in your driver's seat. A good thriller about road rage gone wrong. I was just wondering what happened to Russell Crow ending up looking like John Goodman?
41,"When a trailer is actually better than the movie itself, that's a problem. I feel like this was just a cash grab from Crowe. Of course, his acting was brilliant in this film but the movie itself was predictable and corny. For example, the battery dies when they call the cops. Of course it does... Or, the mother gets into the house, upstairs to her kid, somehow avoiding Crowe whos already in the house after miraculously getting out of a vehicle that's t-boned from the drivers side unscathed... I could go on but I don't want to give away too much for those that may still want to watch this 90 min horror. And I don't mean the genre..."
42,"This movie has no sense of time, plot, or brains. The people in n this movie are absolutely dense. $33 million was spent on something that could have been solved on 30 minutes of the film. Call the cops. Utter garbage movie, avoid at all costs. I love how one of the reviews says Russel Crowe's character is built like a bear, wtc. If you ran one block at full sprint, Russel Crowes character would go into cardiac arrest and die. Oh and this is nothing like Steven Spielbergs classic chase movie."
43,"One of the poorest movies I've seen in a long time .
Please don't bother with this absolutely average movie."
44,"Unhinged is a horror thriller film written by Carl Ellsworth and directed by Derrick Borte. Starring Russell Crowe in the lead role, it attempts to offer an analysis into problematic anger issues but becomes too caught up in its own sensationalism to be taken seriously.While out driving to drop her son off at school, single mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) becomes involved in a verbal confrontation with Tom (Russell Crowe), a hot-headed, mentally unstable man who doesn't take kindly to being honked at by other motorists. When Rachel refuses to apologise for her alleged rudeness, Tom becomes determined to ensure that she understands what it is truly like to have a bad day, even if it means going through anyone else willing to help her.In practically all countries where there are cars, road rage is a prevalent problem and virtually anyone who drives can recount at least one instance where they have been associated with such aggression. ""Unhinged"" tries to show us that no one is safe from falling prey to this behaviour, whether they are the instigator, the victim, or both, in perhaps the most shamelessly hypocritical of ways. Essentially, the film is trying to condemn these violent actions while at the same time telling the audience that they should be entertained by it. This ruins any attempt at clever social commentary as it reduces the film to a mindless thriller involving an angry man and his grudge against a random woman. I'm not saying it was absolutely necessary for this to be an in-depth study of the actions of every driver on the road, but considering it is made clear by the filmmakers in the opening titles that rage is everywhere and something needs to be done, I'm not sure what other approach they could have been going for.The film's writer and director clearly have little to no idea of how to communicate their message over to the audience, rather opting for generic car chases and strong violence as a distraction. Sure, the odd vehicular onslaught and fist fight can make for a fleeting amount of tension but it doesn't matter if there's no solid foundation of a story behind it to back things up. There's only so much graphic brutality that can be shown against defenceless victims, in this case a meek woman and her child, before it turns into sickening torture porn. What should have been a clever study of how rage can cause each of the two lead characters to act violently is instead reduced to just one sadistic man taking out his misogynistic anger on an undeserving woman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Russell Crowe plays his character with a frightening amount of realism, almost too close for comfort. A role like this fits the veteran actor like a glove as many will be aware that it's definitely no stretch for him to play such a short-tempered man, bringing to mind such incidents like in 2005 where he threw a phone at a New York hotel clerk or even his humorous parody on South Park titled ""Fightin' Around The World"" (I suppose this movie should be called ""Fightin' Around The Road"" instead?). That's not to say he's worth watching unfortunately, as he's just so one-dimensionally hateful in that his only purpose is to hunt down his victim and inflict as much pain on her as possible. On the other hand, Caren Pistorius plays her character like every cliched woman in a horror movie, frequently screaming and making stupid decisions that end up with her in even more trouble. It became difficult for me to cheer for someone who makes so many sloppy errors, to the point where I was shaking my head constantly every time she made a mistake. As a side note, I felt she looked way too young to be playing the mother of a teenage boy, either that or the actor playing her son was too old looking. At first, I thought the two were older sister and younger brother, but all that changed when he started referring to her as ""Mom"", much to my astonishment.Normally, I would have been happy to see a film that tackles a worldwide issue such as road rage as it can bring awareness to the masses of what could be done to combat it, but this one does it in such a hollow, mean-spirited way that all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth. It's also a shame that an otherwise talented actor like Russell Crowe has been reduced to starring in a film like this as it does nothing to showcase any of his dramatic range that won him acclaim in the past. I'm still confused as to what kind of lesson we are supposed to take away from all this. Are we supposed to stop violence and anger with more violence and anger? If so, that's an incredibly stupid moral of the story.I rate it 3.5/10"
45,"Crowe does a fine job.The kid is intense, I've seen him before.But the dialogs don't help.The pace feels like is from a short story that was stretched to a feature.Now, how I hate these movies where the only thing that keeps the thing going are the stupid decisions made... there are so many things the mom could've done to stop all this... so many people to call for help... but no... we needed 80 minutes of BS... urgh"
46,"I am a big fan of Falling Down n Michael Douglass' portrayal of a middle class man reaching the point of no return.
While Douglass' character is sympathetic n the way he handles the neo nazi is heroic, the character potrayed by Crowe in this movie is plain psychotic.
While Douglass' character jus wanted to visit his daughter n fights for the rights of consumers, Crowe's character is a murderous lunatic without a leash n heavy on drugs.
While the character of Douglass is a simple guy with simple taste, the character of Crowe is wearing a nice Shinola watch.Comparisons with Falling Down, Duel, Joyride, Changing Lanes, will crop up in most reviews.
As a thriller, this one moves at a fast pace, has tensions n chills throughout.
The first 4 mins sets up the dark tone, the movie has two brutal n terrifying road accident scenes.This movie came at the right time when majority of fellas r unemployed due to Covid. One study states that symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed."
47,"As movie theaters slowly start to open back up in North America, the only new release film playing right now is a thriller called ""Unhinged"", starring Russell Crowe and Caren Pistorius; directed by Derrick Borte and written by Carl Ellsworth. It follows Crowe's character, Tom Cooper, from a fly on the wall perspective of an angry 60 year old man with coke bloat (or he gained weight for the role) as he chases down a woman (Pistorius) who honked at him at a red light. This is a bad film. The script is poor and seems like a checklist of generic character traits to get you to care about the protagonist, Rachel (Pistorius). She is going through a divorce, has money problems, has a child, and got fired from her job, which has all been done countless times in the genre. The main thing that keeps this movie afloat, and is the reason I was so entertained throughout, was Russell Crowe's oddball performance giving me flashbacks to ""The Fanatic"" with John Travolta, and the comically excessive violence throughout. This is the funniest movie I have seen all year. Crowe's heavy breathing and unstable nature as he tracks down a woman to ruin her life for almost no reason at all was hilarious. The film also had a very strange tacked on message of ""phones are bad"" which was expressed so bluntly I couldn't help but laugh at it. For example, there is a scene where Russell Crowe crudely murders a man in a diner, but no one does anything to help because they are all looking at their phones, which is just implausible.
Every scene that was meant to be serious with a heavy message just came off as comical. They expected the movie to be scary, and not funny, making it more humorous. Some positives are the practical effects used in the car chases, it seems like they demolished cars for the film, and it looked great with realistic explosions and car parts flying everywhere. It was also a good-looking film; it had a dreary look with a lot of dark blues that helped establish a consistent tone throughout. Also they did not use CGI blood which is a pet peeve of mine. Overall I really enjoyed ""Unhinged"" but in the way people enjoy fast food. It was poorly written, dumb, and blunt but was just weird enough to land in that ""so bad its good"" category. I would not recommend risking an outing at the movies to go see this, but when it comes out on video, put it on with a group of friends and you will have a wonderful time."
48,"Very irresponsible filmmaking in this day and age, perfect timing, however....but let me guess, the ending...so predictable."
49,"Given that there wasn't a lot of promotion for this movie, I actually quite enjoyed the film for what it was. This film is a stark reminder of what can happen if you don't keep your road rage under control, you might bite off more than you can chew. Granted most people aren't as UNHINGED (see what I did there? Lmao) as this guy was, it's got a pretty basic plot of wrong place, wrong time with an unstable individual. However, there were some good action sequences, decent character development and some moments where I was holding my breath in anticipation so overall good film. Is it the most exciting film? No but it's worth checking out. It also had a pretty good cover version of Don't F.E.A.R. the Reaper as an end credits song so that was a bonus. I'd recommend this film."
50,Terrible plot. The storyline lacks a realistic flow. Why would Crowe involve himself in this production? Hopefully he didn't gain the weight for this part. This movie isn't worth your time to watch.
51,"If you were ever going to deliberately hack-off anyone in real life, Russell Crowe would probably be low on the list. A genuine bear of a man! He looks like he could kill you with a single swipe of his clawed furry hand!In the movie it was a certain Rachel (Caren Pistorius) who randomly crosses the ursine-one's path. She encounters his unnamed character (""Man"") at traffic light. Rachel is having a bad day herself. But the unstable and unhinged man makes it his mission to show her ""what a bad day really feels like"".Having had over 40 years of driving experienced, I've experienced two incidents of genuine road rage against me. One of these was in similar circumstances to Rachel's experience. By me giving slightly more than a 'courtesy tap' on the horn to a driver who cut me up. Both though were 'white-knuckles-on-the-wheel' scary experiences. So although, as a viewer, I felt a degree of irritation at Rachel's stubborn actions in the movie, it didn't seem completely 'out there'. You only need the other guy to be a psycho, and....What follows is a thriller having a vein of dark comedy running through it. Yes, it's relatively predictable and above-average on the gore rating but nonetheless enjoyable.The movie, of course, blends some staples of the thriller genre. Firstly there is that favorite trope of Spielberg of a malevolent force, persistently lurking in the shadows to wreak havoc at any time. (Think of those classics ""Duel"" and ""Jaws"". Blended with that is a recurring plot-point of Hitchcock movies: the every-man (in this case every-woman), in the mode of James Stewart or Cary Grant, uprooted from their hum-drum normal lives to suddenly face peril they are unequipped to deal with.Holding that role here extremely well is Caren Pistorius as the luckless Rachel. She's only had bit parts in previous movies I've seen - ""Denial"", ""Mortal Engines"" and ""The Light Between Oceans"". But here she gets a starring role, up front and central, and I thought she pulled it off really well. She also gets to deliver the best line in the film in the violent and bloody denouement! A leading actress I would like to see more of for sure.The star-power evident here though is Crowe. His portrayal as the steely-eyed unhinged psychopath is beautifully and believably done. A scene in a diner is especially chilling, featuring Jimmi Simpson as the unfortunate Andy, Rachel's divorce lawyer. (If, like me, you were desperately trying to place the actor, Simpson played the young 'good-guy' tourist in the brilliant first season of ""Westworld"".)Unhinged is nicely penned and, in the main, nicely directed. With the pen is Carl Ellsworth, who's sparse career has delivered chillers such as ""Disturbia"" and ""The Last House on the Left"". And although we've been in this sort of stalker territory numerous times before, the script of ""Unhinged"" delivers some nice twists. For example, the dangers inherent in ""Find My Friends"" style tracking apps. One negative though for me is the rising body-count of ""innocents"". It gave me the slightly icky feeling I felt when the jumbo jet is crashed in ""Die Hard 2"".Keeping up the pace is German director Derrick Borte, someone new to me. The car chases incorporated into the action are tense (reminiscent sometimes of ""Baby Driver"") and well-shot (by Irish cinematographer Brendan Galvin). There are the occasional ""oh, really!!"" moments, that a more experienced director might have chosen to excise. But on the whole, this is a taut little thriller, wisely sticking to a 90 minute running time, and never losing my interest.Although formulaic, and at times extremely violent for a '15' certificate, ""Unhinged"" made a welcome and entertaining return for me to the multiplex after the Covid break.(For the full graphical review, please check out bob-the-movie-man on Facebook or the web)."
52,"This Movie had Several Laugh Out Loud Moments that I don't think we're Intentional.It is a fun Movie to be honest I wasn't bored one bit, however it would of been great to get some character Development of Crowes Character. He Obviously had a past that the Movie Hints at in some scenes.Things I Liked:° Crowes Character was Terrifying° There Were Several Entertaining Laugh Out Loud Moments° The Action Scenes and Car chases were good.Bad Points:° The Movie would of been better if Crowes Character had some backstory, it just seem like a insane person chasing this woman.° There is a scene where he is fighting the woman and a young boy and he hits them a few times and they are not knocked unconscious, it was like the Rocky Movies, he is nearly 300 pounds, she is stick thin and the boy is maybe an early teen.Overall, it was a fun, highway road rage movie that was really unintentionally funny at times."
53,"We should be grateful these days to have the possibility to watch new movies at our local cinemas. Since my city has just been locked down once more during the pandemic, I was glad to go to the cinema one last time to watch a few films. Unhinged might not be a candidate for an Academy Award and its story is obviously inspired by classics like Falling Down. However, the movie has been created with great acting performances, relentless energy and solid scriptwriting. Unhinged revolves around a nameless man on the edge played by veteran actor Russell Crowe who has lost everything: his home, his job, his wife and essentially his sanity and reason to live. One night, he murders his wife and her new boyfriend, sets their house on fire and escapes from the scene of the crime. He doesn't care when and where the police officers are going to find him and even looks forward to getting murdered while resisting arrest. A few hours later, the relentless sociopath is lost in his somber thoughts and ignores a green light. A stressed single mother who is going through a difficult divorce, has just lost her best client and tries to rush her son to school because she overslept honks at him and shows him her middle finger. At the next stop, the sociopath apologizes for slowing her down and expects her to apologize for her rude behaviour. The single mother however refuses and that might be the worst decision of her life. The sociopath now goes after her, her family and her friends to teach her what a really bad day actually feels like.Unhinged convinces on several levels. The acting performances are convincing and especially Russell Crowe as man on the edge delivers one of his finest performances ever. The film finds the perfect mixture of action, drama and thriller elements. The different characters have interesting backgrounds as their flaws and strengths are shown in an authentic way. The special effects look realistic and avoid unnecessary exaggerations. Despite its frantic pace, the movie has been filmed calmly and avoids shaky camera work. The epic soundtrack blends in perfectly and provides much atmosphere. Unhinged entertains from its shocking opening sequence to its concise ending and avoids any unnecessary lengths. Despite its simple plot, the movie even offers some food for thought regarding courtesy, family and responsibility in our everyday lives.There are only two minor flaws to point out. As mentioned before, the film's story isn't exactly creative and has already been done even better in the past in the excellent Falling Down. It's also rather hard to root for anyone except the innocent teenage son in the story as both the protagonist and the antagonist make terrible choices, are lacking social skills and risk the lives of anyone around them.Despite those two minor flaws, Unhinged is an entertaining action-thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and is best enjoyed at your local movie theatre while you still can. Unhinged might not be creative, innovating or intellectual but it succeeds at offering an excellent genre film with great actresses and actors, very good directorial skills as well as fluid and intense pace. The movie even offers some food for thought without ever being pretentious."
54,Saw this on the spur of the moment last night and honestly haven't enjoyed a movie as much in a while. Sure there are some questionable plot holes and decisions made by the main characters - but a stellar performance from Russell really makes this believable. You can tell he's really enjoying getting into this character. Some excellent action scenes make really entertaining and they don't wait to long to get right into the story too. Defo worth a watch imo 👍🏼
55,"Finally I am back in the seat at the cinema here in Norway for the first time after this Covid-19 outbreak. Also a break from the sun outside and all the tourists on camping vacation in my city. No people in the cinema, only chocolate and popcorn in my hands and a good aircon on my feet. And the show kicks off with some violence. PERFECT!! Me and my friends smile, laugh and we just enjoy this crazy ride.Just what I needed, a man who has a total meltdown and is furious at everybody. No superheroes to save the day, no lame humor or romantic crap. Just a truck, anger and violence. Come get some! I lost track of time for a bit and forgot about my life and my own worries for 90 minutes or so. And that is the reason I watch movies, to forget my own misery. It delivered exactly what I expected.No Oscar moment in this movie, no great CGI needed and that is just perfect! I am so tired of everything being so politically correct and difficult. This is just a movie being a movie. Refreshing seeing something not destroyed by society. Yes, it reminded me of Falling Down. That feeling when you want breakfast at McDonalds and the girl/guy tells you it's over, it closed for breakfast 1 minute ago. Falling Down was great, it's still great. This is a 2020 take of that movie; at least I feel like that.If you want to have fun, not taking everything so serious and just watch a fun and somewhat violent thriller, go for it! 7.5/10"
56,"Unhinged brings the natural acting style of Russell Crowe, and fuses it into a homicidal maniac who is having a bad day. It just happens this is the day he starts to show his evil side. When I say evil, we are talking Michael Myers level torment.I must say that this movie shows some attributes of 1971 Duel, and others like that, but takes place on the ground as much as in a vehicle. Duel was more of a vehicle fight with the vehicle depicting evil. Unhinged carries that darkness to paint a personality of evil. A rejected middle-class man who has just committed a set of murders, and a road rage follows. Even though the movie is told in the perspective of the mother, we truly get to visit this man and sit alongside him as he forces his nature upon people. The only thing organized in his life is the manner in which he is going to go out. Fighting like a rapid dog, all in the name of his own idea of justice, which to everyone one else is his dark obtuse fantasy.Ever were there a movie to make you not only hate the antagonist, but similarly feel disdain for the protagonist. Riveting performances by the mother Rachel, Caren Pistorius and Gabriel Batemen who plays the son Kyle."
57,"I loved the experience of watching it in the movies.
Very thrilling and exciting.
I couldn't blink!Russell Crowe is very believable in this role."
58,"Not sure why the low rating here and even lower on RT, as I really enjoyed this one. Sure it's a no-brainer, and there are certainly some plot issues and ""wait, what?"" moments, but its 93 min runtime and fast pacing kept the thrills, anxiety and suspense on tilt. It's a well done B-grade film with an A-list actor and decent supporting cast. And considering what's been available these days due to all the shut-downs, this was a much needed fun ride. Novice director Derrick Borte was spot on, as was the cinematography and visual/effects. The story's premise was great, and the writing fairly decent by Carl Ellsworth. Even the score and soundtrack were on point, with the closing credits song needing to be Shazamed: (Don't Fear) The Reaper by Keep Shelly In Athens. I'm not sure why the critics went to town on this one, but I really enjoyed. You just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. At the very least, you will learn to courtesy tap and keep your phone locked. It's a well deserved 8/10 from, me"
59,Amazing movie!! Haven't seen a psychological thriller like this in such a long time. This is what movies are suppose to be like. On the edge of my seat the entire time.
60,Movie is awful...call the cops first scene ...worst written movie ever and when did gladiator eat gladiator
61,"One of the worst I've seen. 2 hours of my life I won't get back.
My wife made me watch it all as well."
62,Predicable. Boring. Waste of 2 hours. The acting was terrible. The plot was terrible.
63,"If you're thinking about watching this movie- DON'T!!! Do not waste your time like I did. The whole point of the movie is that you shouldn't honk at people who don't pay attention to traffic and sit through the green light, because there might be a psycho behind the wheel waiting for a spark to revenge his miserable life and get his frustrations out on someone, anyone. So, yeah, don't honk at anyone, because that might get you in a really, really big trouble. Undoubtedly, the most stupid movie I have ever seen in my life.
If this is the best we can get from Russell Crow right now, then I don't even feel bad for him having to gain all those pounds for the role and risk diabetes and heart attack in the process. This movie is absolute garbage. It didn't even require much acting on his part, because all throughout the movie he only showed ONE emotion- rage. OMG. I want those 2 hours of my life back!!!"
64,"Seen an ad on local television about this movie, couple months ago. The first thing I thought then, despite Mr. Crowe's face in it, was: ""Man, this movie probably sucks a lot, if they're showing an ad on the national television!"". And I was right...I see people in other reviews are complaining about the acting. That wasn't bothering me at all... Knowing this is going to be an psycho-action-movie - I was prepared not to expect any brilliant acting.I was more bothered about the lack of police forces... They miraculously vanished in the US for this action movie. Is this the new Great America of which Trump was speaking about? (giggles)I mean.... Come on!! He killed 2 people and sat a house on fire, the cops know who did it and what vehicle he's driving. Only for the double-murder at the beginning they should've lock down the whole city and chase the killer. But they didn't..... Not even after he killed another man in front of dozen people, inside a restaurant! He was sitting there torturing that man at the table for few minutes - more than enough for 20 cop cars to arrive at the place and to block the entire area. Zero cops has arrived. No one called them? Why? People were too busy posting the video on the internet? Ridiculous.At the gas station they didn't called the cops because.... they'd be too late to respond? For real? What happened, America? Ridiculous.Also, there wasn't any of those famous armed-citizens who stop killers and stuff. No one even screamed while he was killing that man on the table nor tried to stop the killer after he broke the man's nose. Why?! Ridiculous.Then that funny road chasing has begun. Both cars were speeding, but that wasn't still not enough to catch cops attention. There wasn't a single patrol car looking for the escaped killer. He started hitting and pushing mother's car beside tens of cars and witnesses and no one even noticed. And again no one reported that the killer's vehicle been spotted. He blocked a main road with tens of cars in the traffic and still no one called the cops. Ridiculous.Why he was standing still on that crossroad, at first place, anyway? It was really weird they didn't show him at least doing something in the car, or speaking on the phone, to be distracted by doing anything so we can understand why he was so pissed off to start chasing her and to want to kill her entire phonebook. Ridiculous.He got shot in the shoulder 2 inches above the heart and he still could run away like a boss, drive a car, speaking on the phone while driving, stole another car, and miraculously stopped bleeding. And still did not got chased by any cops. Ridiculous.The mother got punched in the face couple of times without bleeding? We saw what he did at that man in the restaurant, he should've killed her with his massive punch. But she stood up just few second later and wasn't even hurt or bleeding. Ridiculous.On the highway they spot a patrol car and instead she start hitting the honk (she knows how to!) - they opened windows and started waving and shouting at the cop, without even pointing at the back where the killer is. Ridiculous.Why Russell Crowe even agreed to play in this movie? Only he can answer....I think 3/10 is a fair rating for this one. I've seen much much worse. It's an action-thriller and it indeed provides some action with some thrilling scenes."
65,Surprised to see an actor of Crowe's caliber in a movie this bad.
66,Ugh wasted $ on Xbox to watch this. There is NO ONE (ok maybe the little boy) in this movie that you like. The main woman is an airhead and is just stupid. Russell crowes character is just crazy and annoying. I'd miss this one if I were...well anyone.
67,"I don't understand on the first place why even this movie got made or produced with an Oscar awardee.
Road Rage i understand, mostly its brutal all over.
But when you write a story and screenplay to it, you at least define the characters motive. This film lacked everything one needs to have to make a decent thriller. Stupid protagonist and a level up stupidest antagonist.
Such a lousy screenplay, especially scenes which i recollect in restaurant with the solicitor killing, no one thought of calling cops but busy taking videos and selling it to news channel.
Was Russel Crowe drunk when he heard the narration.?
Horrible movie of an A lister actor."
68,The Director and story writer are psychopath.. please don't watch it .
69,"""Protagonist"" is literally the dumbest person in the world. She may have well honestly been the villain for how many people she gets killed. The entire movie is based off her honking the horn, and yet when it comes time to honk her horn to alert police she forgets she has one.Sweet Jesus this was hard to watch. Crowe was alright, not enough to save this garbage. I started a body count to see how many people the leading lady got killed."
70,"Just from the beginning of Unhinged, you know that the psycho played by Russel Crowe is someone you don't want to mess with. This movie has gotten mixed reviews. I thought it was great. It is non stop action and hang on to your seat excitement. A woman is with her son in a car. She blows the horn at the guy in the truck in front of her at a traffic light. Big mistake. The guy is a total psycho with serious anger issues who takes out his road rage to the extreme. A few scenes were jolting. I was enthralled and on the edge of my seat throughout Unhinged. Russel was good at playing the psycho. He has that crazed look that makes you hope you never come across a guy like that in your life. After seeing it, you may think twice about blowing your horn at someone. He could be someone like the guy in this movie. I loved the line at the end by the woman who is being terrorized by the maniac. Classic. One of the best thrillers I've seen in awhile."
71,"Rachel is having a bad day, which is why she blats her horn at the zoned-out driver in front of her at a green light. Unfortunately, he's having an even worse day - we'e already seen him hammer 2 people to death and burn a house down round them. And so he decides to make Rachel's day worse, too.This is what they call high concept ie. a dead simple idea. In this case a woman trying to escape from a murderous nutjob. As such, it works quite well. There are some ""I wouldn't have done that"" moments, but it's mostly a chase with interruptions for Russell Crowe as the nutjob (and looking like John Goodman) to be savagely violent. There are no huge surprises, and certainly no subtlety, but it's not bad if you're in the mood for some violent mindless action."
72,"This was my first movie theater visit in over 6 months. I expected this film to be predictable and silly. Was I in for a surprise. Russell Crowe plays an unhinged psychopath in a way I haven't seen in a very long time. It had me almost jump from my seat several times, and I literally covered my eyes a few times. If you're looking for some exciting entertainment to get you back into the movie theaters, then this is the perfect thriller.
Thank you Russell Crowe for serving us up a fantastic movie!!! And now you can get back into the gym and get back into gladiator shape again (as soon as those open up too!)!!!"
73,I am not one to like Russell Crowe films but I was blown away at Unhinged.Russell Crowe played the part of a Psycho Killer perfectly I was honestly shocked at the kills and this movie in general was a suspenseful thrill ride.Remember this movie isn't just about road-rage its about a lunatic trying to make a woman truly know what it's like to have a bad day and he bloody well delivers!!!10/10
74,Super intense and unrelenting thrill ride! Acting was great and the violence was a little brutal but that made it scarier and the stakes higher. I actually jumped a few times which I usually never do!!
75,"First time In the cinema since lockdown.
Ok I agree, not Crowes finest hour but come on !! It was entertainment and a bit of a well earned release after all this ****. To all those who left a bad review ... lighten up for *#*## sake !!!
It's a movie, a bit different, yes predictable, yes with inconsistencies but did you really expect a movie about road rage to be an award winner ?? Get a life !! In future stay at home for the sake of the rest of us."
76,"Russell Crowe stars in the new Thriller ""Unhinged"" and gives an intense performance which has become a staple of his career. Playing a man who has lost it after the loss of his job and marriage, The Man kills his ex and her partner before burning down their home and vanishing into the night.Rachel (Caren Pistorius) is a woman who is seeing her world slowly crumble around her. She is in the midst of a contentious divorce, has just lost her best client, and is struggling to take care of her son while dealing with her brother in financing moving in with her so she can afford to pay for a needed care home for a family member.
As one thing after another mounts for Rachel and dealing with heavy traffic as she tries to get her son to school to avoid a detention for being tardy; she honks and makes and aggressive turn in front of the Man. He takes offense to this and drives alongside Rachel and demands a since apology for her actions. Rachel has long since lost any sense of caring and does not provide a sufficient response which further triggers the Man.As some very aggressive road rage follows; Rachel believes she has put it behind her and drops her son off at his school. While filling up her gas tank Rachel sees that the Man is following her and when her efforts to diffuse the situation further trigger the Man she sees just how dangerous and highly unstable individual he is.
What follows is a deadly game of cat and mouse as the Man taunts Rachel while exacting his revenge on those in her life all the while preparing for his next encounter with her.Crowe is fantastic and gives a very intense performance without ever going too far over the top and becoming campy with his performance which is often the case in films of this type. He is a compelling adversary who commands the attention of the viewer and one can see that he is an individual who has simply snapped from the pressures and reality of life and believes his actions are justified.While I was able to predict one of the big moments near the end of the film; it was delivered In a slightly different way which was refreshing. The film was intense and compelling and Director Derrick Borte keeps things from become too over the top especially in the last part of thThe film wisely relies on the strength of Crowe and the supporting performances and provides a welcome return to cinematic features for viewers as long as they are willing to overlook some minor things and focus on the intense story and compelling performances.4 stars out of 5"
77,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Derrick Borte and crew brought an intense, unforgettable thriller. The story is about a young woman who is targeted by an unstable man due to a road rage incident. When the trailer was released I was eager to watch this film and I have to give recognition for the one who edited the trailer and the song picked out was ideal. My expectations were not let down, loved every second of it even though they could have pushed the length a lot longer because there was enough room for the man to keep terrorizing her. I love the reality of the concept of having bad days, everyone has baggage, and everyone also has a limit, not many know how to not take it out on others. A scenario many have lived through perhaps not by road rage but a simple start of oversleeping. By doing so it begins a chain reaction of being late and anyone who is around will be targeted by their rage.I love how this film projects the message of not taking out your rage to a stranger because your baggage is your own and it's not fair to target another person. I also like how it points out the dangers of not having a cellphone locked and the dangers of putting makeup while driving. So many fantastic details this film had and the most important one was the incredible performances. This is the kind of film that would never have worked if the actors were not chosen correctly and thankfully they were outstanding. Once the road rage begins the intensity doesn't stop and there was one way to end this film. Its predictability was obvious for the moment I watched the trailer, even though it was clear the scenario wasn't. I kept wondering what they will cause for them to send the message, and out of all the situations they picked a good one. I think if the honk lovers watch this film they will learn not to honk needlessly.The cast was phenomenal especially the lead actors Russell Crowe and Caren Pistorius! Russell Crowe was excellent for this kind of movie, his acting skills are always on point, and his rage was so terrifying, a true nightmare of anyone who would stand in his way. Caren Pistorius deserves to be recognized, what a performance to remember. She was a natural, loved how she was terrified every step of the way, it was truly felt and her other emotions were flawless. One of the reasons I didn't want it to end was because I wanted to watch more of her performance, I hope she keeps landing great roles like this one.The composer David Buckley brought the right music to keep up with the thriller of the film. The movie doesn't have a music theme in which it doesn't have anything memorable but at least his music was focused on the intense scenes and he hit all the right notes to keep one on edge."
78,"Me & my husband watched this, this weekend. We both really enjoyed it. Is it a movie with a lot of thought provoking moments and something different? Maybe not but I love thrillers and this was definitely one. I'm normally not a huge Russell Crowe fan but he played his part great and was extremely believable!! The mother & boy did a great job as well. Sure there were a few moments in the movie I was like ""Really!! You need to do this or don't do that"" but if they did exactly what we think we would do then the movie would be over before it started. It does make one think because in these days there's so much road rage. When both people have a bad day it could and has turned tragic..At the end I think she learned her lesson though. It kept us both entertained, acting believable and covered my eyes a few times. So to me it was definitely worth watching!!"
79,"Russel Crowe does a good job at playing a very dislikable character! I liked it enough that I was entertained the entire time. I did find myself face palming my self on behalf of the mother multiple times though. But if she was super smart, it wouldn't have been a stressful movie! Stresses viewers out, does what its supposed to do. I for one, will never honk at anyone. Ever."
80,Forget the haters and the low reviews. This is one of the best movies I've seen. Russell Crowe is amazing as were the rest of the cast. Not much back story true. But it's not needed. No point to the movie itself. I hid my eyes through much of it but nearly cheered at the end. Mum was badass and Russell Crowe was scary as!! Footnote. I'll never beep my horn again !!!!
81,"This is a movie about car chasing and murder. yes it is a movie tries to be a thriller
but the fact to the matter is, it cant be applicable todays society. maybe would be ok 10-20 years ago, but now we have all the car plate recognition systems, face recognition systems and so on. with the first crime the man did or the one that at gas station, it would take no time for police to get catch.
so think that it can be possible to trick the technology somehow and do whatever he wants to do like a T-800 terminator, maybe it only maybe can entertain you.
my opinion is, this movie is just one big plot hole"
82,It was an enjoyable mindless action packed movie. I'd recommend giving it a watch. There's a lot lot worse out there but this one was good
83,"REVIEW - UNHINGEDIf you drive you have possibly experienced road rage, normally it's the finger or shouting but what if........A women who is hardly organised and is late for everything is driving her son to school (late again) and gets involved with a road rage incident with definitely the wrong person who then targets her and her family to get his revenge.Slow start but soon ramps the suspense up especially as the unhinged violence sometimes simply comes out of the blue and can be quite shocking.Acting not the best but definitely an enjoyable watch but nowhere near as good as Kidnap with Halley Berry!Rating 8 out of 10"
84,"This was a perfect return choice film, my first during the Covid, but makes barely a 7. This psychological action thriller is road rage on a higher level, but is not really instigated by the poor fortunate woman soul, who this murderous psycho Crowe, who kind of hams it on at the start, continuously pursues, and makes this hell day for her. This is the, ""What if, we crossed paths with a psycho on a rage, is more like it?"" We've all been there, behind that driver who won't move, when the lights hit green. If that unmoving motorist is off in space somewhere, or is just a unrelenting psycho, I go with the latter in the instance. This is the road rage, or just rage movie that keeps coming at ya, and really doesn't stop for anything in this highly entertaining, engaging, perfect 90 minute time frame, of film. The movie does have it's flaws, but there are some incredibly tense and heart pumping moments, and I really did like the plot of story. Crowe's terrifying performances ups that intensity, one revengeful driven psycho, and he does have his reasons, where he's someone you're glad, is fictional, as you'd never wanna come across this nut in real life. Unhinged, is a film you underestimate as to how far Crowe's ""the man"" (he does have a name, and no front license plate) character will go or more statedly does, and there is some quite ugly violence and shock. On the whole Unhinged is a nasty film, from the opening frame, and is great if you wanna kill, not people, but 90 minutes. Thank god for happy endings, and Pistorius, who we really sympathize with, as this was the last thing she needed on this particular fay, the victorious, valiant beauty, we can take delight in sharing her golden moment of revenge. Good dramatic actioner that like I said, keeps comin' at her, it's attribute."
85,"Gave it a 5 from Russell's input. Lifted it from a 3.5 out of 10. Mum is an idiot, not too bad over all but her choices were very dismal. Cringe ending that sent rating downhill real fast... ""think twice better be nice moment"" dropped the whole scoring out of 10 below 5 as a base. Some good moments."
86,"Movies like this roadrage story are always full of unbelievable ability off the protagonists to bypass normal society protection and law enforcement. This is a gripping tale of this ilk, with some scenarios that gets the heart beating faster. What other reason would there be for watching it?
Could have eliminated the cheesy final courtesy tap but this tale is no worse and better than other films of the type."
87,"The Good: If you're looking for a popcorn film to fill your Friday night, this will do the trick. It reminded me of those campy 90's thrillers like Fear (Wahlberg), Double Jeopardy, and Conspiracy Theory but set today. They didn't skimp on the gore or the action, so I was delightfully surprised how brutal it did got. If you're like me, the best parts will have you saying, ""Damn, didn't see that coming?""The Bad: Sadly that's also what you'll say from the worst parts of the film. The mother makes the worst decisions. She's basically a nasty person, and in some cases, down right stupid. But that's the point I guess. Sadly it's not as memorable as the some thrillers might be. It's a good time killer and made for few jumpy people who are not used to these films. Today's teens will dig it.The Ugly: I didn't expect an award winning performance from anyone in this madness but Russel Crowe did the best he could do with what he was given. The man delivers at every scene and refused to dial it in. The young actor playing the son is little stiff, but bless his heart is he genuinely smarter than the adults here. As I say about most films, don't pick it apart or you'll be very disappointed. Go in blind and just enjoy the chaos."
88,"Such a gripping movie! Highly recommend watching this, Russell Crow is outstanding"
89,Skip this garbage and watch Falling Down with Michael Douglas instead. Russell Crowe is twice the size and half the actor in this ridiculous movie that doesn't make any sense.
90,"Best movie I have seen all year.
Russell crowe is outstanding in everyway."
91,"I think the film is short but it's better then put more unnecessary and boring scenes, russell performance is perfect as usual (not surprised) cause he's always like that , for the film I'll give maybe 7/10 but with russell 100% will be 9/10 at least, he made THAT and i was feel like I'm the one in that situation , very impressive!! LOVE IT ."
92,Excellent film with a great storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.The plot was well written with a small cast who gave the story justice with their acting. The child actor played his role well.The film does have a lot of violence in and the car chase was amazing.I would recommend this film for anyone who likes thrillers as its one of the best I've seen in while.Russell Crowe at his best with his acting as a mad man.
93,Great movie 10/10. Highly recommend to everyone. Actors were amazing. Great job!!!!
94,"This was the first new movie I saw after the cinemas reopened after lockdown, watching it on a double bill after inception, for the sole reason that the showing of empire strikes back was cancelled, this was an entertaining movie that was adequately tense and didn't overstay it's welcome.Unhinged doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel of the thriller movie, and falls into a lot of the trappings of the genre, but is a fun time with a few friends.Russell Crowe steals the show with an excellent performance7/10 worth a watch you're looking for a reason to go to the cinema and have already seen tenet, otherwise I'd wait for it to show up on Netflix."
95,Unhinged is more of a horror film than a thriller... Phenomenal performance from Russell Crowe...
96,"Russell Crowe is just awesome as usual. But the thrilling experience throughout the whole movie is truly the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much.
Ignore other negative reviews. Just go see it. You will not regret it."
97,"Russell Crowe's depiction of a MAGA supporters reaction when confronted with truthful facts is incredible in this movie. The only thing missing is a red cap and twitter updates about how all of what is happening is because of fake news and the radical left. Physically and mentally Crowe plays the perfect part of an angry, short phallused republican down to a t, aside from yelling racial slurs and having an inter-family relationship with his sister the film is accurate in every way"
98,"'Unhinged' is a good dynamic and tense thriller with nice performances.The writing is ok, and it feels like some thought was put into it.It could've been greatly improved if the ending was rethought though. It's too unrealistic and I wish we knew more about Crowe's character. I don't know why they decided to rush through the ending like that. Also, a darker ending would've worked much better in my opinion.But it's still a good watch since it's tense and short."
99,Great film! Kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending was amazing! I would definitely watch again and keep in my movie collection!
100,What a great film to get back in the cinema for. Sound and acting is top notch! Highly recommended for a film that is what it says on the tin.
101,"I mean the scary thing about this movie is not how much thrill and scare it has, but because it shows how anybody these days could break of pressure and cross the line to craziness. We're living in not so easy times."
102,From start to finish an amazing ride. Russel Crow has outdone himself in this epic masterpiece.
103,"Darkly exciting and often terrifyingly violent, Unhinged takes a simple concept and turns it up to eleven, with rapid pacing, unrelenting performances and an impressive shock value right from the start. It may go a little far at times, lacking the dramatic depth to back up its intensity, but there's something undeniably entertaining about just how dark a movie it is.Unhinged does try to bring in some deeper themes to the table, attempting to look at the potentially catastrophic consequences of the average person's pent-up stress in the modern world (symbolised a little heavy-handedly by traffic congestion). However, that's not really where the film's darkest and most exciting value lies.Instead, it's in the simpler, more chaotic action and thrills of the story, as we follow Caren Pistorius relentlessly pursued by Russell Crowe playing a man at his wit's end, intent on destruction and revenge no matter what the cost.In that, the film goes to lengths that I really didn't expect at first. Its opening scene alone is pretty shocking, but it's the fact that Crowe is so remorseless throughout that makes things all the more terrifying, coupled with genuinely frightening violence at times.The intensity of that violence and the dark, unrelenting nature of Crowe's character makes Unhinged hit a whole lot harder than your average thriller, though it's fair to say that it does jump the gun with its shock value, going very far very quickly, meaning that the events of the latter half of the film are less horrifying than a snowballing narrative would have afforded.Still, Unhinged is really well-paced throughout, and the performances from both Pistorius as the protagonist and Crowe as the antagonist are excellent throughout. Director Derrick Borte does well to keep the film as entertaining and exhilarating as possible even when it does go to darker lengths, though he fails to craft a more palpable tension that could have made this even more exciting.The road rage element of the movie is highly reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Duel, but through the way Unhinged focuses on the antagonist, we understand why he's terrorising an innocent driver, and as such don't get that same bewildering and terrifying mystery and anonymity that Spielberg's classic thriller throws up/The deeper themes of pent-up rage also remind me of the brilliant Argentinian thriller Wild Tales, albeit with a darker twist that also brings in elements reminiscent of Cape Fear. It's fair to say that Unhinged doesn't quite bring those ideas to life in the most eye-catching fashion, but in harking back to those films it certainly makes for an exciting watch.Overall, I was really impressed with Unhinged. Intense, fast-paced and exhilarating throughout, it's a darkly entertaining watch with unrelenting violence that genuinely shocked me throughout. It may not hit home on a deeper, dramatic level, but with parallels to cinematic classics and its own excellent intensity, it's a thrilling watch all the same."
104,So about this movie I did not enjoy this at all she had so many opportunities to call the cops or drive to the police station like why are you wasting your time crying me throwing up instead of fighting it's just unbelievable
105,It was a very trilling movie I had a great time watching it and allmost every second something cool was happing
106,Exceeded expectations. If your into this kind of movie it's worth the ticket price.But absolutely worth renting once it is VOD
107,Road rage meets our ultimate fear. We talk about could happen is portrayed on film. Great suspense and action. Not so much on the acting.
108,Absolutely loved it. The scissor was classic !! Russel Crow's performance was dynamic and scary lol
109,"People who over judge nowadays are rampant especially I'd it's not a biopic or war movie. This is a bare bones thriller, action movie, yes the victims make stupid decisions and yes some of the movie is hard to digest BUT just go with it, imagine this could happen and sit back and enjoy. Russell Crowe is at top form!! I also like how hes not being Hemsworth and all buffed hes just an average man with amazing acting skills. This has some amazing scenes great action sequences and worth seeing in the theater. I enjoyed it MORE than the extremely overrated tenet!!! At least this 1 I understand and I love the ending quote!!!"
110,"I went it with very low expectations about this film as there weren't many reviews and I though it would be a typical shooter/chaser. However i was pleasantly surprised. It's very intense and I thought the plot was excellent with many twists that you wouldn't expect. Of course the main character never does the most logical thing but it's interesting to see how it all unfolds. The movie is quite graphic which I was slightly unprepared for so I took a star off for excessive violence.
The cast was excellent and this is a rare moment when you see Russel Crowe play a villain. He was perfect for the role and so were the other characters. Overall crazy movie that I very much enjoyed!"
111,"Russell Crowe is definitely Unhinged! Solid performances from Russell (The Man) and from main characters Caren Pistorious (Rachael) and Gabriel Bateman (Kyle). A nail biting and suspenseful 90 minutes. It's not original, it's a bit cliche, but you will not regret watching this film! It may even teach you some things about road rage! ;-)"
112,Only thing worth your while is to guess how much weight Criwe hass gained.You are warned!
113,". . . as its villain ""The Man"" blends elements of the Oval Office Super Spreader, his anti-American amoral Red Commie KGB boss in Moscow's Kremlin and the typical bearded self-appointed pale-faced militia bozo out to kidnap, torture and behead popular U.S. governors. The Man is a thin-skinned Neanderthal with a perpetual chip on his shoulder, out to burn down our American Homeland like a younger version of Mitch Gravedigger or El Graham Cracker. This crazed monster pick-up driving road hog literally totals 17 vehicles owned by other citizens, while causing 11 traffic fatalities. Though this American Carnage, coupled with the four people he savagely slaughters with various tools and kitchen utensils, may seem to pale in comparison to the 240,000 (under-counted) U.S. men, women and tykes painfully perishing under the Pariah Pachyderm Pandemic Party between March and November, 2020, at least ""Rachel"" shows viewers how to snuff out these super-spreading Flames of Hell Fire for our Ultimate Victory."
114,"I loved this thriller. So unhinged..
You should watch fellas."
115,"I really don't understand the relatively low ratings. Okay, it's not some fancy arthouse-film, nor a blockbuster superhero thing, in fact it doesn't pretend to be anything more than ""just"" an action-thriller, but in that capacity it's in my opinion a d*d good one! The premise is original and the trigger for all the goings-on is very recognizable (who didn't honk or gesture at some time at a driver who for no reason seemed to hold up the traffic?), the pace is extremely high throughout the movie, the violence is heavy and the villain (impressively and extremely convincingly played by Russell Crowe) is hair-raisingly scary and intimidating. Caren Pistorius did a great job too, and it may be so (like so many know-it-all reviewers pointed out) that in the story her character made some dumb choices, but come on, picture yourself in her position, do you really think that you would have had the time to consider the most intelligent and rational decisions?!? To me it all seemed very understandable and realistic. Anyway, I sat on the edge of my chair the whole movie long and absolutely loved it!"
116,"All the crap aside, when she could open the garage door to send her son inside, why dint she park her car inside garage and shut it down?? This is one of the most senseless english movie i have watched so far!"
117,"I got home from the cinema after going to watch this with a friend. I went with low expectations and came out feeling like I had just had a great cinema experience!!
The film does not think you are stupid - it shows you that it knows what it's doing! (I feel this could be lost on some people).
I literally haven't stopped chuckling to myself over Russell Crowe's performance - he plays an absolute nutter who has taken his perceived bad luck very badly - exactly how it should be taken if you want to make a movie out of it!
I almost jumped out of my seat the first time it took me by surprise in a particularly shocking way (you will know which part I mean if you have seen it). I was prepared for the few others' that followed (and they do follow)....
I didn't expect to be describing this movie as a dark comedy! Me and my friend left chuckling over Russell Crowe's grunting and huffing as he aims to go out with a bang!
I fully allowed some of the gaping holes in the story, sat back and enjoyed the movie - really good fun - possibly a mix of saw, final destination and die hard 3? Russell Crowe also reminded me of what Alex Jones could be like if trump doesn't win the 2020 election too!"
118,"I thoroughly enjoyed this a ton. Does it have elements from other rage meltdown thrillers? Yes, but it still delivers the destruction and anger that's so fun to watch on screen. Can I relate with it? Probably more than I should, but Crowe unleashes what many including me have fantasized about doing In moments of unfair lunacy of society toward us. His performance is menacing but still you can identify with his fury. The action and intensity is palpable and doesn't let up. It could honestly be one if the best thrillers of the last few years."
119,"If you combine the movies Falling Down, The Hitcher, and Duel you get Unhinged. It had its moments. worth watching. Russel Crowe did a decent job at being the villian.
worth checkin out."
120,"What a waste of time! We walked out. The plot was stupid, the situation was stupid, People sitting around having breakfast and a man violently kills someone and nobody call the cops. WOW. Get a root canal instead of going to see this movie."
121,"I know this is not a truly attractive film for cramming or judging but Unhinged is your undecidable choice. The plots are so predictable as you can see on trailers. Indeed, the moral of a whole story is transmitted neatly : ""Easy come, easy go""."
122,"This movie was so thrilling and suspenseful! Russell Crowe's performance was really terrifying. This movie reminds me of Joy Ride, but in the opposite. Now this is a new thrill ride to enjoy and it was really worth it. 10/10"
123,"Unhinged for me was one of the best movies I've seen this year, the sheer ferocity of Russel crow, and pace of the Movie kept me glued throughout, watch it you WON'T regret it."
124,"This is a great movie, ignore the bad reviews, it might not be original but the acting is supurb."
125,"This starts off quite well and has some good tense moments such as during the initial encounter between the characters of Russell Crowe and Caren Pistorius. The trouble after this is that Pistorius's character who you are presumably supposed to be rooting for, is not likeable whatsoever so I imagine I wasn't the only one rooting for the 'bad guy'. Obviously in real life I wouldn't like someone going round killing and hurting people, but in this movie, it was fun watching him messing with her.So the film is set up for a thrilling second half, but then as others have said, it turns into torture porn as the producers might have been worried the viewer would identify with the 'villain' a bit too much, so they decide to make him do terrible things so you remember who it is you're supposed to be siding with. Except it doesn't work because Pistorius is never likeable at any point, her acting is terrible throughout and she maintains the same expression and calm demeanour even as she supposedly fears for her life and those of her loved ones, and people are dying around her. She later takes a severe beating from Crowe's character who is a huge strong man, and she shrugs these off like it's nothing. At the end of the film she is still calm and barely has a scratch on her, or a hair out of place. But she triumphed against the bad man, hurrah! A darker but I daresay more satisfying ending would have been if our anti-hero had triumphed or at least got away, but I guess films have to be simple and neatly tie everything up nowadays.Russell Crowe's performance is good but he deserved a better co-star and the film needed a better writer."
126,"What an awesome movie. This was one of Russell Crowe's best performances. Besides a slow moment this movie checked all the boxes. Strong emotions throughout. First movie that my wife and I have seen in the theater since March 2020, we all know why, and we couldn't have picked a better movie."
127,"When was the last time you honked at a motorist who ignored a green light at an intersection? The contemporary road rage thriller ""Unhinged"" shows what could happen if you honk at the wrong guy. Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe is the murderous motorist in ""Unhinged"" who sits through a green light while our impatient heroine hammers her horn three times. Mind you, Hollywood has made some better road rage movies than ""Unhinged,"" but this gear-grinding demolition derby surpasses most with its spectacular stunts. In some respects, Crowe's ""Unhinged"" villain resembles the Michael Douglas character in ""Falling Down"" (1993). A defense industry engineer who had lost his job, Douglas behaved like a hero initially before he reverted to villainy. Comparably, Crowe is cast as a former executive who has suffered a similar fate. His company fired him in time to deny him his pension. Although the filmmakers generated some sympathy for Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down,"" neither German-born director Derrick Borte nor ""Disturbia"" scenarist Carl Ellsworth show a shred of sympathy for Crowe's felon. As this exciting, 90-minute, R-rated, nail-biter unfolds, this paunchy maniac storms into his suburban home with an ax. He slays his ex-wife and her lover, and then incinerates the place. By the time he has settled behind the wheel of his massive 4 x 4 Ford pickup truck, flames have engulfed the residence. The attraction of his frightening film is the contagious aura of paranoia it induces. Road rage stories are a dime-a-dozen, and road rage villains often have short-tempered fuses and feel unfairly persecuted. The infantile-minded, gargantuan-sized Crowe confronts audiences with an ominous performance that fuels the hysteria in this testosterone-laced thriller and turns it into a gripping, white-knuckled experience. Caught between this lunatic and civilization is a susceptible, young single-mom Rachel (Caren Pistorius of ""Mortal Engines""), whose back he could crack like a toothpick!The morning begins badly for this divorced beautician because she has overslept. Desperate to compensate for lost time, she takes the freeway. While she is creeping through snail-like traffic, Rachel receives a phone cancellation from a client about a hairstyling appointment. Things turn truly ugly when Rachel swerves off the freeway for an off-ramp. At the intersection, she finds herself delayed by a gray Ford pickup. The negligent driver sits through a green light. Now, Rachel cannot get her son, Kyle (Gabriel Bateman of ""Lights Out""), to school on time, and he dreads detention at the end of the day. Like any good movie, ""Unhinged"" suggests you tap lightly on your horn rather than lean on it like Rachel does. Unfortunately for her, the stalled driver is Tom Cooper, the maniac who slaughtered his ex-wife with an ax. Tom struggles to apologize and then encourages Rachel to apologize, too. She refuses, and he vows to make her day atrocious. Predictably, all Hades breaks loose! Tom tails her to a convenience store. While she is paying for gas inside, Tom swipes her smartphone from her car. When an innocent bystander intervenes on Rachel's behalf, Tom runs him down. This good Samaritan leaps atop the hood of Tom's Ford to avoid injury. The momentum topples him backwards into the street and into the path of an oncoming sedan. The motorist crashes into him and sends the good Samaritan cartwheeling. Once Tom has stolen her phone, Rachel finds herself at his mercy. Cheerfully, Tom empties her bank account via her banking app and sends it to her ex-hubby.
Later, Tom keeps Rachel's appointment with her pro bono divorce lawyer, Andy (Jimmi Simpson of ""Date Night""), at a nearby restaurant. Tom gets chummy with Andy before brutally shattering his nose with a ceramic coffee mug. Were this not enough, he stabs Andy in the nape of the neck with a butterknife! Customers in the restaurant record simultaneous videos of Tom's manifest indifference to life. Before Tom leaves Andy slumped dead in their booth, the entire city knows about this public menace. Eventually, our heroine flags down a cop on the highway. Tom rams him, spinning his police cruiser like a bottle into the path of a cement mixing truck. The cop is crushed to death! Earlier, Tom had visited Rachel's house, seized her brother's fiancée as a hostage and impaled her on a bread knife her pusillanimous brother, Freddy (Austin P. MacKenzie of ""Speech & Debate""), had brandished in his own defense. Afterward, Tom duct tapes Freddy to a chair, douses him with lighter fluid, and ignites him as a Crescent City cop (Michael Papajohn of ""American Ultra"") barges through the door and shoots Tom in the shoulder. Of course, one itty bitty bullet serves only to deepen Tom's rage.Watching ""Unhinged"" is like being taken for a ride. Most of the time the heroine and the villain careen through harrowing streams of traffic. The exception occurs when she eludes Tom long enough to vanish into the suburbs and launch an offensive. Suspensefully, the filmmakers spring surprises on you when you are least prepared. Caren Pistorius' Rachel makes a plausible damsel-in-distress who wrestles with tough choices and terrible consequences. She struggles to stay one jump ahead of her psychotic enemy. Naturally, Russell Crowe creates an unforgettable predator with his evil, pugnacious presence. He seems as invincible as the slashers in the horror chillers ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Part of the thrill of watching a flesh & blood, hyper-violent thriller like ""Unhinged"" is the drama remains strictly on a human level. You'll identify with Rachel soon after she tangles with Tom, and your abhorrence for Tom will grow exponentially with each subsequent encounter. Like a good boxing movie, you'll want to shout at the screen, spar with those shadows, and swear at the villain. For the record, the setting for ""Unhinged"" is New Orleans, but the filmmakers avoid the iconic French Quarter, so the scenery is comparatively anonymous. Altogether, ""Unhinged"" lives up to its title, and you may think twice about honking your horn in the future."
128,"This is the story of an unstable man who confronts a woman in an intersection. This unstable man tries to show the woman what it means to experience a bad day. The story is simple but appealing. You can feel the elements of the thriller genre in every scene. Russel Crowe is awesome like always. I can't forget his memorable acting in movies like Gladiator 2000 and 3:10 to Yuma 2007. I think using sound effects and background music could be improved. In summary, if you are a fan of thriller and action genres, I suggest you watch this movie."
129,"Everybody loves Gladiator, but to be honest, Unhinged has a way better performance of Crowe. Although the viewer might see some resemblances with Walter Sobchak (Big Lebowski) 🤣.The movie doesn't overcomplicate the motives, therefore keeping the tempo and the suspense on point. The action is great, except the Demolition Derby scenes doesn't do anything for this movie.I didn't knew Caren Pistorius yet, but her performance has made me curious for her next performance.All in all clean suspense movie 👍🏻."
130,"Tension all the time, very good performance, nice twists, no plotholes and so a very good reason to come back to cinema after all the boring streaming b and c movies.
Only the scene after the showdown was a little bit unrealistic, to let them go and drive alone away after their horrortrip."
131,"A little dose of Duel, a sprinkle of Falling Down and a splashing of Red Eye .... updated for 2020 but still with a 90's feel.A great little popcorn thriller to get you back into the cinemas and forgetting about covid for an hour and half.Russell Crowe is frightening and disturbing as a guy having a really bad day. Caren Pistorius plays the young mother who triggers her own day from hell.If you're after a taut stand-alone thriller with some decent shocks and no CGI, this is a good one."
132,"It's a psychiatric character in a revengeful persecution with a lot of unnecessary extremely graphic violence. It does do the trick of keeping you tense and occasionally flinching, but lacking in plot, character development and meaning."
133,"I let the negative reviews convince me I needed to see how bad this was for myself. I worked on my crochet the whole time, so I can't say the 90 minutes were wasted, but I AM glad I didn't pay money to watch this.There are SO many problems and questions and issues that I can't even list them all. Like, what city was this even in? All the cops and plates are super generic, with no identifying marks I could see. Her kid is going to an elementary school, but looks 13. The traffic is always super accommodating to car chases and stupid driving, and while they appear to drive multiple miles between locations, time seems pretty meaningless. The news could infodump all Crowe's background about being fired and divorced, but couldn't list the make and model of his truck? If Crowe was following her and tracking her via her tablet, how was he in front of her in the neighbor's car? Why didn't the son just call his Fortnite strategy the Smoking Gun Strat? Couldn't have been more obvious is giant neon letters had flashed on the screen saying ""This will happen in Act 3!!!!""As a character, Rachel is the most annoying, stupid, worthless, getting-what-she-deserves protagonist ever. I don't blame the actress for how much I disliked the character, just the script. From the moment she's on-screen, she grated on my nerves. Plus, with how terrible and selfishly she drove, I had NO sympathy for her being called out. Then she remains dumb and spineless, until it's time for her to be ""smart"" and ""strong"".However, I saw the bones of something that could have had potential. Right about when the chick putting on mascara was killed for no other reason than to kill a distracted driver, I realized that as a more tongue-in-cheek/dark comedy/sarcastic movie, the messages would have played better. Just lean into the obvious messages and points the writers want to make, be blatant about their feelings, and not waste everyone's time with trying to be a serious thriller. As a snarky Falling Down, I could have had a better time."
134,"Unhinged (5 out of 5 stars).Unhinged is a great thriller film that will put you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The movie is insane with its prolonged car chases and Russell Crowes menacing performance is intense. Sure, this movie is close to how reality is with unstable people losing it in road rage. The opening credits montage of a lot of road rage scenarios happening all around. The opening scene with Russell Crowe playing a character known as the man. As he is sitting outside a house on a rainy night. With an unstable personality that snaps. From there, every one better watch out if they ever run into him.The plot follows a divorced struggling mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) and her son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman). As they are both running late. Rachel is driving aggressively trying to avoid traffic jams. Which looks like every direction is bad. Until a truck in front of her does not move on a green. She honks. And cuts him off. Which sets The Man off on a very long road rage that will leave many bodies behind and a run for Rachels life.The film is intense. The direction does well in putting you on the edge. Showing Rachels desperation in trying to save her family. The music score works well in building the tension and suspense. The car chases are crazy. With The Mans truck slamming into other cars. The cat and mouse chase leaving many accidents behind. While the police are always a step behind. As they are tracking these murdered victims.Russell Crowe did a great job playing the man. He was menacing every time he was on screen. Just glaring. He is unpredictable and unstable. Caren Pistorius did a great job playing Rachel. A mothers desperation trying to survive this one long chase.Overall, if you are looking for an exciting thriller that is an edge of the seat thrill ride. This film is definitely worth checking out."
135,Most of us has encountered this character in real life especially on the freeway. Maybe not to this degree. But scary. It's just not worth it. Being right with a ticking time bomb tempers out there. I know it's hard... but just walk away.........sooner than later. Bully psychopaths always meet their match. 🍸👌✌🏿👍🏿👌
136,"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after reading lower rates reviews on this movie. I cannot understand why anyone would give this movie such a low rating!It was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the movie! Unpredictable, suspenseful, non-stop action, great acting & great cinematography! Well worth the watch, you won't be disappointed!Disregard the negative reviews, this movie is a must see!"
137,They made the female lead unlikeable tho. Sad when you can't easily root for the victim. Deff worth watching. Very entertaining.
138,"Great entertainment that keeps you thrilled throughout the whole movie. I LOVED IT!
Yes, it's not perfect. Yes she's pretty stupid. But so what? Take it for what it is and ignore all the haters who dislike all movies recently made.
Give this movie a try, trust me."
139,"This is my first review and after reading some of the others I decided to give this movie a 10 due to some people rating it very low for stupid reasons.
The movie is actually a 7 in my eyes but I'm hoping this review will help pump it up because of some silly reasons for being bad.
To say the reason for a low review is the bad decisions made by the leading lady is just crazy. Without the bad decisions how could the movie even start.
At the start of this movie if the character had just apologised then the credits would have came up, The End. Lol
Be realistic this isn't real life and for
a movie to work things have got to go wrong and things can't go wrong without bad decisions."
140,What a film its been a while since I last watched a film that left me glued to the TV a masterclass of how to do a film In my opinion
141,I thoroughly enjoyed it. Excellent performance......It kept me paying attention all the time I was watching.
142,"The ones that didn't like the movie must be use to disney style movies, the acting was good, the story kept you interested, and it was good escapism. @ 2 things i learnt from the movie, Americans must be the worst drivers with the way you saw how the accidents happen and most Americans must be A..holes with their attitudes and rage. because this movie shows it off brilliantly. I'll watch this movie again no problems"
143,"Thank god there are tons of films where russel crowe is a nice,humane person to comfort myself from the horrors expelled in this pure sosio/-psychopatic thriller in a race on life and death under the influence of hydrocodone.its an intense thriller with extreme and relentless terror as a result of a minor morning traffic incident that honked into something big. there are some moments that really shocks, but also a few moments in the plot where the mediocreness of stupid actions made by the victim irritates , even a grumpy old man, that have had some stings of road rage himself, where the sudden psychotic /angry feelings comes over you before you snap a finger, and youre honking, breaking , shouting and throwing fingersignals in all directions possible wishing by all might that i was a policeman in a civil car.so its a tale well worth seeing, its a natural reaction to most of us, and im sure it can develop this far in real life... therefore a recommend"
144,"The film director did an amazing job building and keeping up the intensity of this film. Tons of vehicle crunching accidents. Russell Crowe is fierce and unmerciful with his unrelenting drive to make that woman pay. It definitely held me at the edge of my seat. Yes, Commander Maximus, We were entertained.I did have some nitpicks. I don't think the news courage during the opening credits were needed and I found them extremely distracting. Also some of the CGI cars don't seem to follow the laws of physics for a vehicle of their weight. The minivan was driving down the roads as through it were a formula 1 car.My nitpick is they went easy on Rachel. Despite being thrown across the room multiple times like a ragdoll, she still manages to only get minor bruises. Was she too pretty to wear beatdown prosthetic on her face? The pair of scissors in the eye was lame too.All in All, I am giving it an 8/10 because the story is tight and enticing."
145,"Very suspensefull. Russell Crowe was good as the creepy guy. Sure the main mom made some bad choices. And she wasn't very likeable in the beginning but that had to be so, for the story. I was really surprised and will definately watch again.
Thanks for this one."
146,"WoW!A really action-packed film from start to finish with just the right amount of gore to make you think ""O-M-G""... This film was exciting and Russel played the crazy man so well. Really, the whole cast did well and couldn't fault any of them.The plot was the usual but done in a great way.I would really recommend this film to people who are 'angry drivers' like me. Better than any anger therapy classes!!!Gave it a 9 because it was action all the way that had me rivetted but there were a few things like when nobody helped in certain situations or called the cops in others, but 9 is good."
147,"Unhinged has a basic appearance and looks like another bored entry into the stalker thriller genre, but appearances can be deceiving. Russel Crowe, whilst not in his greatest film, gives an unsettling performance as the mysterious man who is this film's antagonist, with a very unhealthy and unkempt appearance about his body. The character he portrays is carefree about police or the people around him while he is committing crimes, he doesn't care who is following him, he only cares about who he follows, making him a deadlier force for the protagonist. The main character is very well acted and adds to the movie a surprisingly good reason to care for her. The film has problems too, people do lots stupid stuff and Fortnite is written in the story, which it already deserves a star down for alone. But overall I think a fan of suspense/thriller/horror movies will enjoy this for the performances, especially Russel Crowe, who gives a good performance playing himself."
148,"""I don't think you know what a bad day is! But you'll find out."" The Man (Russell Crowe)B movies like Unhinged rely on revenge regularly (recently Retaliation and previously Cape Fear), and the result is usually cheap thrills and over-the-top bad guys just waiting for the ineffectual middle-class professionals to get their revenge on the perps.Unhinged's The Man is an obvious metaphor for the angry, disenfranchised, unemployed divorced weak man, whose anger comes out in road rage, in this case aimed at a young mom, Rachel (Caren Pistorious), who represents all the divorcees navigating kids and jobs without help. The action is tripped when she flips off the big guy (The Man), who is not moving at a green light. He promises her the bad day in the above quote.The formulaic car chases ensue, well done as usual, with a scene in which The Man visits her lawyer waiting in a café. Shades of the verbal torture for which Hannibal Lecter was capable and a salutary way for director Derreck Borte to relieve the road tension. Similarly did a café in The Hitcher relieve and heighten tension in the same scene.The Man starts off the film by burning a house with occupants, making this a bad day for him for sure.Special notice should be given the use of mobile phone technology, ubiquitous nowadays in film but especially important for this plot. The phone allows bad guy to send harrowing images to families and track unwitting victims, and to be tracked himself. Unhinged gets the tech right, making it integral and a comment on the ambivalence of our inventions.In the end this movie is laughably good, a faithful servant of the revenge genre while touching on contemporary issues that themselves torture modern harried young couples.""Revenge is sweet and not fattening."" Alfred HitchcockBTW-I saw this thriller in an AMC Dolby Theater. ""B"" movie that it is, technology makes it superior viewing for any movie."
149,"I loved this movie, and Russel Crowe was brilliant as always. I was on the edge of my seat and it made me jump a lot.Yes the movie is violent, he hates rudeness and wants to teach people really what a bad day is..I liked the fact the movie did not drag, as I have a long running joke with my partner and ask her, could that movie be shorter, and in most cases the answer is always yes.. lol.. not for this one though....It you like Saw, and like a movie that makes you jump, then this it it."
150,"Fast paced, stimulating thriller. I enjoyed every minute."
151,"You may want to add a few plot twists to make the story more interesting. Instead of one guy terrorizing this woman, make it a mob of people. When she tries to protect another person from them, they begin to terrorize her instead. They find out where she lives and go to her house, screaming at her in the middle of the night, breaking her windows and threatening her family. When, terrified, she tries to call police, she discovers that police are not responding to 911 calls and in fact have been totally disbanded. As the story goes on, have the mob attack her little mom and pop shop downtown, loot everything inside and throw a molotov cocktail at the building, burning it to the ground. Police again, cannot respond and are nowhere to be seen.
When she begins to realize that no one else will help her and that she can only rely on herself to keep her and her son safe, she grabs a weapon to defend herself. And when the mob comes at her again, attacking her by swinging a skateboard at her head, nearly killing her, and a second points a gun at her, ready to pull the trigger, she fires back in self-defense. But though she saves her life, she loses everything, and at the end she is thrown in prison on a first degree murder charge.
You could also include a worldwide plague to add a little drama, but that would probably be a bit too over the top.
Just a suggestion....."
152,"Well, I knew saying sorry was important but this puts a whole new spin on things.Russell Crowe is excellent as Tom Cooper, the vengeful maniac driver full of unspent road rage. He's a big chap now, and when angry, you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him. But Rachel did...Good, purpose-driven car chases - none of those endless nonsensical ones down every nook and cranny that take up half the film.The film is brutal, dramatic, violent with a fair few shocks along the way. The writers did a good job incorporating the use of technology into the script without letting it dominate the plot - this left room for a strong storyline and meaningful dialogue.Some echos of Breakdown (Kurt Russell) and a hint of Deliverance (John Voight).Thoroughly entertaining and highly recommended but not for the faint hearted."
153,Thought the concept would make for a decent film for our first night out in six months after lockdown. What a disappointment. Non-stop car chase/violence/blood & gore. No story line whatsoever.
154,The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it has an ending. Couldn't come soon enough though.
155,"This movie isn't amazing, but it is a pretty surreal 90 minute rollercoaster. Russell Crowe is so intimidating in this movie it made me question whether I would take my chances trying to come between him and a victim.The cast that surrounds Crowes fury is adequate enough, but this is Russell's movie, you're going to see how much havoc he can get up. I enjoyed it."
156,"Thursday 20 August 2020
First Film of Choice after lockdown at The Plaza Dorchester - Unhinged. Russell Crowe stars as a very disturbed man who takes offence at a small mistake made by a fellow motorist on the freeway. What ensues is a downward spiral of road rage going very very bad as he targets his victim and everyone she cares about. This is a very tense thriller which even in the simplicity of its plot had me on the edge of my seat with a nervous knot in my stomach throughout. An excellent piece of acting from Crowe - his character becomes increasing more disturbed as his rage takes him beyond all reasonable behaviour. A truly well titled film. If only she had said she was sorry........!!!!"
157,"My first time back to the cinemas since Covid19 & I was very excited to see this one & it didn't disappoint. You get exactly what you expect. A fast paced thriller that doesn't drag on. Straight into it & plenty of epic scenes to follow. Russell Crowe plays such a great bad guy & this was no exception. The plot is pretty basic & the story was predictable but a great set of actors makes it worthwhile, especially on a Sunday when you just want to go to the cinemas & not do too much thinking for 2 hours. Highly recommend if you go into it not expecting a masterpiece!"
158,Safe your self an hour and a half by watching paint dry. You will thank me for it later.
159,"Did not go in expecting much, but damn..... Will you think twice before road raging at somebody!
Some pretty brutal scenes and crowe is an awesome psycho!"
160,"Another sexist, predictable, cliche boring movie. Oh man a creepy guy is stalking a poor helpless woman zzzzz...And man has Russel Crowe let himself go. When did he turn into John Goodman?"
161,"Someone once said, you don't have to side with a villain - but you should at least understand where they are coming from. That was very much the case in 'Unhinged' for me. Russell's Crowe's character did some unforgivable things that I obviously couldn't get on board with, but I at least appreciated that he was trying to prove a point to someone and show them that being a terrible person can and should have consequences. While I liked that side of things though, on the other side of the coin I had real trouble getting on board with the supposed protagonists of the film. They were simply not likeable people in any way. Basically the film just decides that they are the victims and so we the audience should go along with it. The was one of the only let-downs though in what was a very good movie.The film has lightning pacing. A little time is spent setting things up and introducing us to the characters. But once Crowe's character comes into the mix things kick off in a big way and never relent. This is not a film you will be checking your watch during. I also loved that because the film had an R rating it felt like anything could and would happen. Nothing was off the cards - and there are some very violent scenes. The person I was watching the film with actually said they felt a little uncomfortable at times. I thought the balance was perfect however.It's great to see Crowe still getting work and doing films like this. His performance isn't perfect - his accent tends to come and go for one thing - but there is no doubting that he is a very watchable actor. I really enjoyed 'Unhinged' and would certainly recommend you check it out once it comes to a theatre near you."
162,"Unhinged
2020
15
Director: Derrick Borte
Starring: Russell Crowe, Caren Pistorius, Gabriel Bateman, Austin P Mckenzie, Anne Leighton etcOverall rating 89/100Unhinged is about something almost everyone is familiar with, road rage. Single Mum Rachel comes across a man with a troubled past who makes it his mission after she honks her horn at him to make her life a living hell. Wow what an experience Unhinged was, I was on edge for the whole entire experience, let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I thought the main performances were fantastic, the tense tone was great, and the themes expressed were clever in terms of linking to modern society. The lead performance from Russell Crowe was fantastic, he did a terrific job at playing this kind of role, he was terrifying to watch throughout, and his character made you genuinely fear for all the characters lives. I also thought the performances from Caren Pistorious and Gabriel Bateman were very good as well, I believed every emotion they were expressing, and they made you really empathise and care for there characters. The tense tone was executed well throughout as well, I was on edge permanently during the whole duration of the movie, they never let you sit still or breathe, there was always something tense or bad going on which I loved, I also thought the themes linked to modern society was also great, it was really intelligent and oddly fits in with what is currently going on in the world what they expressed, themes such as police violence, road rage and people being more expressive and not caring about the law was shown in detail, which made it really hit home and made for a powerful opener to the film, as well as it being bought up in multiple different situations.My next few positives would be the use of sound, gore and Jumpscares. I thought they very effectively used sound to build and create tension, whether it was the beeping of horns, or the disturbing grunting from Russell Crowe it was used effectively to create fear for the other characters and for the desired tone and atmosphere. The gore and Jumpscares were also used effectively, the film didn't overuse the gore which was appreciated, but when there was some they went all out, which really impacted the scenes a lot more and made you feel even more fear for what Russell Crowe's character was capable of, I also appreciated the use of Jumpscares, I don't think these were even that intentional, but at times there were scenes that was completely silent, and then there would be a car crash or the beeping of a horn that would really effectively catch you off guard.Now for my only two negatives for the film, I thought some of the characters were fairly dull, and I would have liked more development with Russel Crowe's character. I thought the characters of Rachel's brother and his girlfriend were fairly bland members of the cast that didn't really do anything for me whenever they were on the screen, They just lacked personality and no effort was made really to make the easy to connect with or likeable which was a shame. My biggest issue with the movie would be the lack of development for Russell Crowe's character. There brief moments of development or hints and further developing his character that never really went anywhere, we know he got divorced and the script mentioned he had nothing else to live for so pain is all he wanted to inflict, but they never truly went into any detail into his character, so it would have been nice if the movie was slightly longer, so they could spend more time further developing his character to make us, the audience actively understand what's going on in his head and understand his past.My final few positives would be the chemistry between characters and the great final act. One of my favourite parts of the movie was the chemistry between Rachel and her son Kyle, there relationship and how it developed throughout was great, the film explored the effects of divorce on relationships with children as well, but as the film went on and Kyle needed his mum, Rachel stepped up to the plate and protected him with everything she had. Finally, the final act was truly fantastic, the went all out with the tense tone, gore and intensity of the performances, leading to a extremely tense, entertaining and satisfying ending.Overall Unhinged is a fantastic movie, that is one of the most fun and intense experiences of the year, and apart from a few character issues ticks most of the boxes."
163,"At first the main character annoyed the heck out of me; but that was the point. She is an obnoxious idiot who doesn't care for her husband who she will divorce, doesn't take care of her kid properly, and is a lazy slob who is late for everything.Her ability to drive a car is borderline non-existent, and thus the movie is allowed to continue because we enter Russell Crowe's character into her life. By the way, I loved his performance in this story as a broken man who has lost his mind.The non-stop action and drama worked well, despite some nonsense events occurring; mainly my complaint is the protagonist is an idiot that makes terrible choices and this somehow gets rewarded by the end of the movie.In some cases this felt like it could have been a modern and more insane version of 'Falling Down', but they really dropped the ball. We didn't learn enough about the raging driver, who was the best character in the film.The end as I touched on was really poor. The protagonist has plot armour for some unknown reason to me. Then it ends; how bland.6/10 good for a watch but should have been much much better."
164,The lead actress' acting: terrible. she makes the worst decisions too.
165,"Title says it all.Big intimidating vehicle. Crazed and deranged man. Russell Crowe shined in this to be honest.The -3 stars is purely out of my own personal expectations. I was eager to watch it and I watched it ""blindly"" (no teasers, no trailers) and got 75-80% of what I expected - Tension fueled action thriller. I felt I was a bit let down by Russell Crowe's backstory and his motivations in his spree. That's all. But in this kind of movies the backstory probably isn't the center piece. Which is acceptable.The movie is pretty straightforward - deranged psycho causing chaos because he snapped. I liked it. I recommend it."
166,"I hate you Russell , what an acting ,,chapoo,,
This movie made my adrenaline at the highest level"
167,I thought it was a pretty good movie. Very entertaining and at times cheesey.
168,"Unhinged is a good time for anyone who appreciates a fun slasher/thriller. It's a bit like Falling Down with Michael Douglas except with a much less sympathetic and more psychotic lead. Russell Crowe admirably goes for broke with his performance and turns in something incredibly memorable.At times, I was reminded of films such as Duel and Joy Ride and there's enough suspense to keep things engaging."
169,"Why didn't she just apologize? 🤔Reminds me of René Girard's mimetic theory : « If people imitate each other's desires, they may wind up desiring the very same things; and if they desire the same things, they may easily become rivals, as they reach for the same objects. ».She's got pist off losing her biggest client, and then projected her rage by honking aggressively and being impolite with a stranger. She pursues the same object as him : to be recognized by others, all responsible for her failures (her ex husband, her client, a stranger). At the end, her punchline just before killing him (« Here is your f... courtesy tap ») makes her an equal of him, not his opposite."
170,"But hardly new - It is like Falling Down (1993) and Changing Lanes (2002) had a child but it is well acted from the now corpulent Crowe and Pistorius. It does not disappoint in the action stakes as well as its total attention to how life in this modern world can push someone over the edge but it comes nowhere near Joel Shumacher's brilliantly directed Falling Down (1993) or Michael Douglas' magnificent over the top performance in that masterpiece of cinematic overkill and has none of the pathos and intelligence either - this one is a pure rollercoaster ride of uncompromising psychotic violence with little in the way of backstory or pathos or characterization.No punches pulled, no woke nonsense just a story of everyday motoring in USA, heck it could be any country in europe really as violence and mental instability has been affecting road ragers for decades like the notorious Kenneth Noy case so is not that far fetched especially in America these days so all in all a very above average thriller and a good nights entertainment."
171,"There is no real storyline here - the entire plot has been summarised in the imdb blurb i.e. 'After a confrontation with an unstable man at an intersection, a woman becomes the target of his rage.' That's literally the entire movie, him just harassing her for 1 day.
I feel like this movie really needed more depth to it. Perhaps if he started stalking her over a period of time, that would have built more suspense & made it more interesting. Rather than him doing everything crazy in 1 day - which was highly unrealistic."
172,"Russell Crowe, oh dear what has happened to your career? Unhinged fell short of any kind satisfaction, thank the lord it was not any longer in length😌. Looks as if they gave all the Budget to Russell's belly, the title should have been called demented.Trying to be a modern Falling Down without the acting or story line. The first movie in a long time where I kept looking at my watch...very predictable and without much soul. Funny as 15 minutes in and I wanted the woman dead...dreadful, made me wanna hold the horn down on my car 🚗"
173,"Respect for my man the Austrian! Even if he wanted to do his worst on a film, we'd find something in his performance to praise. Have nothing negative to say about him. The wannabe damsel in distress and the antiquated scrip is another story! Unrealistic plot is frustrating because no one in our day and age would be so dumb as to let this scenario get out of hand. As another commentator stated, it lacks common sense and we're not a gullible so don't give Hollywood your money; many many many free options to see this at no charge."
174,"I can without a doubt say the intro was the best part of the movie. Watch the intro, walk out of the cinema and ask for a refund. If this goes online on amazon or netflix, just stay far far away from this movie. Total waste of time, bad acting, bad story, full of inconsistencies."
175,"So after what seemed like an eternity since I was at the cinema last, my final film before hand being Bloodshot, I finally got to go back when they re-opened today & this film was the first one I got to watch!The story of unhinged follows a single mum who during a brief bout of road rage becomes the target of an unhinged overweight man who takes his down-on-his-luck rage out on her, her friends & anyone who gets in his way & tries to stop him!I found the film to be quite good! It was definitely an edge-of-your-seat film which kept you engaged from start to finish! It had a sort of government conspiracy type feel in the opening credits which made me wonder what the film was going to entail... The film definitely after watching had a ""moral of the story"" type message going on when it boils down to road rage, while also saying that you shouldn't have to back down from confrontation & fight for what is right!The action & was on point & epic! Not to mention shocking, raw, loud & in-your-face! The chase scenes added to this & made you feel for the young woman who was being terrorised by the nut-case behind the wheel with a loose screw in his head!However, the film did have some ""oh pi$$ off!"" type moments in it! Plot conveniences etc. But for the most part it wasn't too bad, though it makes you question what would happen in real life & what wouldn't!Overall a bare-knuckle thriller! A definite recommend watch! 9/10"
176,"Yet another movie that insults the viewers inteligence. I'm not even going to bother to name the many things that are wrong in it for it would be a further waste of my time, and I think I've lost enough.
I just can't believe Russell Crowe, Oscar nominee and winner, accepted a role in such a stupid movie. I mean, it pays the bills but, really?"
177,"This was the first movie I have seen in the theatre for six months due to the lockdown and I have to admit , I wasn't expecting too much especially when I heard that Nic Cage has turned down the lead role . It must be bad right?WrongRachel is running late to work when she has an argument at a traffic light with a stranger whose who has decided to make one last mark upon the world by teaching her a series of deadly lessons. What follows is a dangerous game of cat and mouse that proves you never know just how close you are to someone who is about to become unhinged.Maybe I enjoyed this more than usual because it was the first film back at the cinema ? Who knows but I found it tense , and anxiety inducing . I was literally on the edge of my seat as were other people in the theatre.Don't get me wrong , it a brutal , violent and nasty . Some of the violence is shocking at times and I'm surprised it got the 15 certificate it did . The horrendous car crashes make you jump and the deaths are way over the top but I like films like that . It may not be to everyone's liking , that's for sure .There is one other shocking aspect to this film . Russell Crowe.
He looked like has eaten a horse . I couldn't believe how fat he was. There is no way the character is meant to be that big so he can't use that as an excuse .Unhinged is a 90 minute trip into hell but in a good way ."
178,"Unhinged: A dark road rage thriller which creeps into horror territory. Russel Crowe is an angry man, we learn that he is psychotic in the pre-credits sequence when he murders his ex-wife, her new husband and burns down their house. Rachel (Caren Pistorius) has the misfortune to cross Crowe in a road rage incident and he decides to give her ""a bad day"". This involves chasing after her, shunting her car, attacking or killing those who come to her aid and targeting her family and friends. There are shades of Falling Down, Crowe has lost his job, his partner, his home, he feels the whole system is rigged against him. Rachel isn't without fault, she could have de-escalated the situation when the incident first occurred (her young son was in the car) but instead insulted Crowe. Doesn't justify any of the mayhem which follows though. Multiple vehicle collisions caused by Crowe, a truck T-Bones a police car, he runs people over willy nilly. Crowe portrays a restrained psychosis, never seeming too angrt as he smashes a mug in a face or sticks a knife in the back of someones neck. Tension is maintained throughout the 93 minute running and the main characters are nicely fleshed out, suggesting a back story. Pastorius isn't just a victim as she devises plans to fight back. Directed by Peter Borte from a screenplay by Carl Ellsworth. 8/10"
179,"Had to leave a review for this movie, ok so its not the most mind bending story but for what it is wow! So Russell crowe is having a bad day and is very angry, he bumps into Rachel who is also having a bad day in a traffic jam. Crowe doesn't like the way she honks her horn at him and demands an apology to which she refuses so that makes him even more angry and he starts road raging to a point which turns him psycho, like i said not the most riveting storyline. But wow is this movie god damn intense! Crowe is superb as the very angry road rager who completely loses his head and decides to completely ruin rachels life. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, its violent its intense and crowe is very watchable as a maniac! The film doesn't drag at all its breakneck speed doesnt allow you to get a breath, just when you think crowe couldn't get any more psycho he takes it up a level again. Very good movie, severely underrated. Its a popcorn movie for sure so don't go in expecting a complex mind blowing thriller because its not. Its fun its fast its furious and its intense, strongly recommend to check it out"
180,"I couldn't get thru this mega POS film with fat ass Crowe playing the role of a suicidal megalomaniac and mother who is dumb as sh..t. What a terrible unbelievable road rage film for the likes of anyone who is alive in 2020. By far the worst story ever. After 1/2 hr, I had to turned this crap off because it was that effing stupid. Hey Russell...WTF? Worst film ever."
181,"She makes the wrong choices over and over.
A Prius flip over a minivan at 8 miles an hour?!
Who rages around a city for hours unchecked on a killing spree?!
Hard pass...."
182,Its too naive and sick. Good acting but nothing more!
183,"This is not a thinking person's movie. Purely a ""Shock Value"" film. So many SMH scenes."
184,"Silly, half baked storyline...a main character driven by toxic male qualities meets dumb horror tropes.Brings back memories of Rutger Hauer/C Thomas Howell original version of The Hitcher with its nonsensical, over the top sequences, which never took itself too seriously--- where this films does.Violent in its premise and a tough film to endure, and not because of violence, but because its misplaced and ineffectively worked into scenes that are eyerollingly bad.This isnt even midnight festival schlock grade. File under Dumb and Dumber, and not the Carey film."
185,Unhinged is a cross between the classic movies Falling down and The Hitcher. Well worth watching.
186,"Unhinged manages to create a claustrophobic feel to a car movie. Not an easy task.
Russell Crowe plays the redneck well with simmering anger heating up to boiling and bubbling over throughout.
Wearing a fat-suit seems un-necessary and is somewhat distracting throughout. Crowe is already a couple of pizzas and a few beers close to the heavyset requirement - so this seems strange as best.
While there are suspend belief moments - a couple of standout scenes make this a tasty roadside snack, including the service station scene which escalates fast - and the quite excellent cafe/coffee shop scene.The whole thing has a Rutger Hauer, Hitchhiker vibeWe have all seen, or perhaps felt, road rage incidents. And this is captured well in moments. But perhaps not so well in other - which had a hangover feeling of CHIPs highway prangs (how on earth was a TV show that was predominately about car accidents and massive pile-ups such a hit?!).Caren Pistoriuos - does a convincing job. She does seem a bit sweaty and shiny throughout - but even that adds to the surface tension."
187,"This is one of better new movies I watched now. Lesson is obvious: to cool off or be patient on the street or in vehicle. and to avoid common mistakes like using phone while driving. Intro, events, actors are high quality ones, and this movie looks like real interesting movie, even if it is bit amateur and low budget or less famous. Good enough. Recommended."
188,There must be no police in this city as this guy can cause havoc whilst driving same vehicle and no consequences for his action wtf
189,Don't understand the negative reviews. I thought it was a good film. I guess you can't please all the people all the time
190,"Russel Crowe looks like a mini-truck. Without any movie releases, he must have been on binge eating to become so monstrous looking. But, it suits his character.The director never bothered to dwell on the subject of his (Crowe's) reason for that mad rage.We do come across road rages on a daily basis, when we are on the road, but in this movie Crowe acts like a maniac (without a proper reason).Believable performance by Caren Pistorius (as Rachel).Time pass thriller."
191,It has barely enough quality to make it to made for TV status. Russell Crowe gained 100 pounds play in this garbage can I have a movie.
192,"This movie does not make sense in any way. He is just killing people at daylight and yet police was not able to catch him. In summary, the story has many holes and I felt horrible about the unnecessary violence. This is just very low quality movie."
193,"The real criminal here is writer Carl Ellsworth. This is such a dumb movie that can only have been written by a complete moron. Someone who conjures characters that are incapable of rational thought, and whose actions are so moronically contrived as to propel this cast of dunces through the quagmire of Ellsworths mind. I honestly believe it takes a bit of psychopathology to think of the scenes in this movie and then to string them along in a way that is so conversely unimaginative that it strains all measure of basic credulity.It's disgraceful. It's a waste of time and money."
194,Don't waste your time! This is pure terrible! Don't waste your time! This is pure terrible! Don't waste your time! This is pure terrible! Don't waste your time! This is pure terrible!
195,This film should be studied for anyone who wants many examples of movie clichés. Good acting from all and still entertaining to watch but don't expect anything more. Russell Crow looks like he ate Russell Crow.
196,"Not Crowe's finest moment, but still a moderately entertaining film! He drives super psycho angry! Lots of cool crashes and final destination style deaths! Crowe either got super obese for this role or his fat suit and make up are top notch!! Either way, his sweaty fat guy is seriously creepy! Okay peace out!!"
197,"I like my psychological thrillers to be practical and possible, after all that's what makes it thrilling. This movie was terrible on all fronts. Completely illogical and in no way shape or form made any kind of sense. Save your $5 and wait for it to come on cable and even then it would be a waste of your time."
198,I watched it to the end but I just felt irritated by the main females acting being dreadful and the fact it was so ridiculously unrealistic. This could have been so much better. I had high hopes despite the rating of 6 because I'm a real Russell Crown fan but I'm stunned he even signed up for this dreadful film....
199,"Slow start, more action as it goes but it's difficult to get over how the cops can't get this guy"
200,Shame on Russell Crowe for making a movie like this. I will acknowledge that the movie IS a mirror of this year with the divisiveness and hate that has been so pervasive this year. But there is enough reality that we do not need a reminder. Don't bother watching this piece of trash.
201,"...But way too many car chases. Boring.
The cars go fast and zoom zoom!! We get it...."
202,"First, the mom makes a million bad decisions and the dumpster fire of a last fight had her taking more hits than an MMA fighter.Absolute nonsense."
203,"This was supposed to be a good movie but it wasn't. Although the production and acting were good, the plot was so unrealistic, if not annoying, which I guess has turned most people off. Worth the watch if you want something to kill time with, though."
204,"The only thing i loved about this trash was the credit ending. one of the worst movies i have ever seen . bad plot and silly characters .Unrealistic and became laughable early on .
Such a wast of money and time . and of course Russel Crow's talent which was the only reason to watch this snoozefest ."
205,"Just unbelievably awful.I love Russell Crowe. He is such a great actor.
But I seriously cannot believe that he was even in this movie.And unbelievable waste of time, don't bother"
206,"Not a bad film, but found it hard to care about the main character. All could have been avoided if she took responsibility and showed some manners lol"
207,"Plus 5 for Russell, minus 5 for everyone else.I doubt it was the intent, but I was rooting for Russell. The protagonist(s) have no appeal. At best they are annoying, at worst they are exhausting. (E.g. Rachel's unbearable, ever-present breathy inhalations sound like the actress has a collapsed lung or two.)"
208,"The film takes an incident of Road rage and does what any road rage film does. So no surprises on that. But a lot of scenes are contrived and cliche too. All actors were splendid and Russel really made me hate him, so kudos to him and his psycho expressions. Worth one time watch. Don't look for anything different though."
209,"There are a lot of pros and cons about Unhinged. The pros would be the acting and the intensity of the story what makes it entertaining, but on the other hand the story is also one of the weaker points as there are so many bad decisions it just get a bit ridiculous after awhile. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story but you will find out for yourself that the bad decision making from the victim makes this movie just good enough for a one time watch, nothing more. Russell Crowe did a good job playing his character. I have a friend working in Hollywood that is in constant contact with the ""stars"" and one day I asked her would were the nice ones and who were the less pleasant ones to work with. Her immediate answer was Russell Crow as most unlikable actor she ever met, very full of himself, treating people like garbage. My point of writing this is to make it clear it couldn't have been that too difficult for him to play this character as that's what he is in real life. He basically had to play himself. The rest of the cast did a good job as well. Too bad the story had so many issues. I would rewatch Falling Down again if I wanted to watch a movie about somebody losing his cool. The idea is the same but Falling Down is just much better."
210,"""Unhinged"" is a harsh thriller ... hmm noooo, it's such a funny movie, I laughed throughout the whole movie and that's good because the movie didn't make me feel bad. Well, in fact, the film is pretty stupid, it is full of nonsense and absurd situations, very poorly developed characters who make the most stupid decisions, Russell Crowe is not bad enough, but he does not take out the whole film, Caren Pistorius also looks good in her role. The message of the film seemed strange to me, not even the message itself, but how the film shows it. Yes, this is a rather urgent and true problem of society, but this film presents it all very clumsy.
The atmosphere of the film as a thriller is so-so, but I had a good laugh. And perhaps the rating could be lower, but the film did not disgust me and I watched it with interes, the film is certainly rather weak, but I did not expect much from this film."
211,"And car chases. and lots of crashes, and closeups of grim, sweaty faces - this movie's for you!If, however, you like an unfolding story structured with at least a modest amount of logic, Unhinged will disappoint. Two examples (among many): Caught in a rush hour traffic jam, the protagonist - Rachel - has issues with a big guy in a big truck stopped beside her. A minute later he's directly behind, repeatedly ramming her car. Does she (or anyone else nearby ) call 911? Nope. Shortly thereafter Rachel stops at a gas station , fills up, then strolls into the convenience store to use an ATM and get a snack. About to exit, she sees the maniac has parked behind her car, glowering big time. Does she accept the cashier's offer to call the cops? Heck no, because... Well, because that would be logical.Strangely enough she does accept a patron's offer to get the truck's license plate number. A brief, violent scene follows. I think that actor's name is Stephen Louis Grush, but he isn't even listed in the ending credits. IMDb does list him, however. He did fine with the small role given him."
212,"You will get from this movie exactly what you could expect after watching the trailer. It's a fast paced action movie, and the action is good. The plot is simple, it has very little character development and I don't quite liked the lead actress.Yes, like almost any other action movie, there's questionable decision making, some wtf moments, and some unbelievable scenes.No, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you don't have anything else to watch, it will at least entertain you."
213,Great performance by Russel Crowe and he has put on a bit of weight since his Gladiator days. The supposed heroes of the story left you thinking how stupid can you get. Also like that the antagonist Crowe was allowed to be a proper bad guy and not the kind where he doesn't actually cause any damage. He caused plenty and as much as they'd like to portray a happyish ending that's life long trauma and all for a lack of civility.
214,".. but for a plot that wants to be realistic, it's really not. Exaggerated and really lazy and stupid writing.For once, the cafeteria scene is not realistic at all (without spoiling it) and the fact she doesn't go to the police after the gas station.Meh of a movie. Had to stop it just because it was annoying."
215,"About time someone made a movie explaining the importance of a courtesy honk. I personally prefer a single light honk but this may be regional. I'm starting to think this may very well be a documentary about a day in the life of Russell Crowe, or at least behind the veil. The thought of Russell and a phone alone would probably strike fear in most. 2 light courtesy honks out of 10"
216,"This film start with a man breaking into a house, killing the people in the house, and burn down the house scene! As turnout, this film is about a mother ""Rachel"", need to survive from the killing of a psychopath(Russell Crowe), after she refuse to apologize for honking the psychopath! Entire film full of intense car crash scene, bloody shooting scene, bloody stabbing scene, ram over with car scene! Make the film quite watchable! The martial art fighting scene in the film have things broken in the process! Make the film quite excited to watch! At the end, Rachel stab the psychopath at the eye to kill him! Rachel refuse honking the car in front of her at the very end of the film! That's it! A must watch thriller film!"
217,"It's a bad script, nicely executed .
Overexaggerated like most Blockbuster films, it is made to appeal to a broad but uneducated audience.
The overall message of this film is: ""Don't honk at anyone without thinking"".
The female lead is terrible at most of the film, while Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance.
Overall, I should say ""good job"" for all of the crew, since this is the result of professional work.
At the same time, I would not recommend this movie to a cinephile."
218,"It seems kind of apt that the heroine, if we may call her that, is played by an actress named Karen (Ok, it's actually Caren), because that pretty much encapsulates her entire character.One interesting game to play while you're watching this movie is to work out the inspiration for the scriptwriter who wrote this movie. Was it a driver who'd had a nasty run in with a road-rage driver, who, inspired by the terrifying encountered decided to turn it into a scary, action-packed, thriller? Well, maybe. But my bet is that Carl Ellsworth was actually someone who got flipped of by a Karen, just like Caren, at some traffic lights & the movies increasingly improbable, sadistic & over the top violent response to a road rage scenario, actually reflects guilty empathy with the bezerker Russsell Crowe character.while Crowe's character's actions are evil, reprehensible, & completely disproportionate there's something about how annoying the main character, her quintessential Karen-ness, that kind of justifies it.It's not great. It's hard to believe & frequently frustrating in being so, but I enjoyed it nonetheless"
219,"Russell Crowe dials up his inner Rutger Hauer (""The Hitcher) and Michael Douglas (""Falling Down"") to reap terror on a boy and his mom who don't give him a courtesy honk. Skip this ""meh"" road rage thriller and check out the aforementioned titles instead."
220,"Somehow the film reminds me of falling down, but it's still something completely different. It's entertaining and definitely a recommendation to everyone who likes a good old pursuit. Don't expect too much though because he's not really making anything new in his genre. It's good for in between, or on the way to work;)"
221,This reminded me of Falling Down with Mike Douglas but not nearly as good. Very disappointed that this was a movie Crowe decided to make. Must need the money.
222,"So much great talent, especially Crowe and Pistorious, wasted on an orgy of violence and just more silly car crashes! Save your money! Thank you."
223,"Love this movie. Also Duel and Joy Rides are my favorites. Some things on this movie also reminds me of Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"""
224,"Big bad Russell Crowe is coming to get you! The award winning actor plays an unhinged (and how!) maniac wreaking mayhem and destruction with anyone and anything that crosses his path. One fateful morning he comes across an unlikely duo who bring out what he does best leading him to his eventual undoing. Tense, disturbing and with lots of laughs the film doesn't pull back with its horror and unintentional humor. Seeing an overweight sweaty and grimy Crowe being psycho tickles the funnies to no end with comedy substituting for terror easily. Too many unrealistic coincidences and a mother-son tandem falling short in the victim role show the scriptwriter's and director's capabilities leave something to be desired. This is a plot that could have been great had it been fleshed and worked out more. Nevertheless this is still a watchable and entertaining flick to fill some time in your quarantine blues."
225,"Russel Crowe was perfect to play this ""unhinged"" character.....the movie had me hinged to my seat filled with anxiety within the first 10mins. One of Crowe's best and most memorable characters."
226,"First movie back at the cinema in 5 months thanks to Covid, and it didn't disappoint.There are plenty of plot holes to pick apart, and stretches of the imagination, but the pace of the movie keeps you in suspense throughout and it's well acted by Russell Crowe and Caren Pistorius.There were a few pretty brutal jump out of your seat moments that you just don't get to the same extent watching at home, so altogether, well worth venturing back to the big screen for."
227,"This movie was just great.
Don't take it too seriously and you will love it"
228,"I liked this movie better when it was called, ""Falling Down."""
229,"He went out of his way to be convincing. When he punches a woman in the face it looks like he uses the full force of his body and connects.
His curve to unhinged is believable and well delivered, and we get motive and we see WHY he is like he is, something so often missing for mainstream protagonists. ""He's a baddie, he just is, that's all you need to know etc"". Not so here. Crowe shows us why this dude is going off the rails.There was quite a bit of sign posting, scissors, etc, and everything felt a little planned, no real surprises etc, but, it is what it says on the box."
230,There are so many times this guy would have been stopped by the police or beaten up by passerbys. The idea is a great idea for a movie but the execution is horribly flawed.Now I'm off to kill a man in a diner very slowly while 20 other guys just sit and watch....
231,"The only saving grace of this movie was Russell Crowe and it's relatively short running time. The acting was horrible (besides Crowe), the characters uninteresting, the storyline predictable, and the stupidity of the events within and their sequence was just infuriating. It was seriously frustrating watching the ignorant protagonist do everything EXCEPT what anyone should have done in such a situation just to keep a weak plot alive. Not to mention the amount of horrible coincidences that had to take place for this movie to work and make sense...seriously painful.Some movies are so bad that they're good. Some movies are so bad that they're just bad. This movie was so bad that it bordered on comedic...but it didn't intend to, which makes it just THAT BAD."
232,"Unhinged - Pretty damn good! Or maybe just the fact I haven't been to a theater in 6 months. Today was their first day open so I had to go see something. If you like high tension psycho thrillers, you'll like this movie! The beginning was a bit slow and I was afraid it was going to be a dud but then theres this one scene at a gas station that makes you go dayem and it ramps up to 11 and never stops til the end!Not a lot of plot really but I didn't want anything I had to really think about a lot. Some dumb decisions and places where you go why the hell did she do that but if not for those scenes we wouldn't have very long movies would we?Theres a few downright brutal scenes, even made me cringe a bit and I'm a horror movie fan. Russel Crowe played crazy dude really well. He made his eyes look so dead at times and then crazed. Believable and scary!If you're looking for award winning, skip it. If you just want something fun to remind you what going to the movies is like, this will do the trick!"
233,"I'm sure like most of you in these lean movie times, the star power of Russell Crowe made me check this one out... but man, what a BUST.A shockingly overweight Crowe wastes his talent and our time with a nasty little by-the-numbers road rage flick that had me fast forwarding by a third of the way. Indeed, quite why an Oscar-winning actor of Crowe's stature would sink to this level is truly baffling.More FAT-iator than Gladiator I would seriously avoid this travesty like rush hour in a hurricane and go check out the Michael Douglas classic Falling Down instead. You'll thank me later. Or else! Beep beep."
234,"How stupid is she? Cops aren't avail as they are responding to an accident on the freeway she just caused. Turn around.Then when she says ""Here's your courtesy tap and kicks him?"" Really?She ruined the movie making stupid choices. Way to go Hollywood making women more victimized and not strong characters.She could have been a strong character but I wouldn't waste your time with the main celeb in this and not sure why he gained weight for this pathetic role. He's on a downward spiral as he ages."
235,"This movie was a complete waste of time and after having just come off a long period of no new movies and finally being able to go back to the movies, this was a terrible first choice.It portrays a man who is bitter at his ex and between eating a dose of hydrocodone that clearly wouldn't affect a man of his heft (and Russel Crowe is a far pants size away from his gladiator day), he is also annoyed that a woman behind him honked at him when he wouldn't go during a green light, so he decides to follow her and make her day a living hell.And between being a total ripoff of other movies who have this same plot, it's so unrealistic because there is no way this dude can do all the things he does to people and continually get away with it over and over. We didn't see how it ended because I was slowly edging out of my chair to try to hide from having to watch anymore of this my husband said three magic words ""should we leave?"", I slid out of my chair and out the door to the movie so happy to not have to watch any more of this.I don't even care how it ended because it is so stupid I am sure if I guess I'll be spot on."
236,"Russell Crowe being one of my favorite actors, I had high expectations from Unhinged. And it was brilliant.A very convincing performance from all actors deliver for a horrifying experience in this action packed thriller.The intro of the movie sets up for a great message that returns throughout the movie. Road rage is a problem that is seen more and more everyday, all over the world. Although being it over the top in this movie, it does cement the thought in people's brains.A must watch for every thriller and horror fan!"
237,"Excepting some nice acting by the main characters. Otherwise, unrealistic with a a silly script, unless one thinks that the perpetrator is a total loon who has no better business to do than harass someone to death over a small mistake. Nice to see a beer-belly, sweaty and violent Russel Crowe, though. Blows his handsome Gladiator left over image to smithereens."
238,"Saw alot of road raged at you tube but this film shows how bad it could be, many abit exaggerated. Suspense from the start until the end. She the woman makes alot of stupid decisions! If the intention is to ensure frustration, well its suceeds. Russell Crowe is fantastic in any role hence the 3 stars."
239,What a film.. literally from start to finish it puts you on the edge of your since. Great performance by Crowe. Wow lol
240,"Simple plot, modest budget and mostly unknown actors. There's not much setup for the plot, the movie starts easy and things go from there, however once Russell Crowe's character enters the scene the movie becomes and intense cat and mouse chase full of brutality and thrills. Main actress is fine, but the real star is Crowe, his dynamite performance elevates this movie to a whole new height. If you're a fan of his or a fan of ""edge of your seat"" thrillers, watch this and you won't disappointed."
241,"Raw, brutal and very entertaining. This movie reminded me about Falling down with Michael Douglas from 1993, but its a lot more brutal. Then again this ismore about the victims and not the perpetraitor. Great actin, great production with very good action"
242,"People were hyping this movie up so much, I thought it was going to be one of the best ones this year. It was not. It's actually not that good at all. It survives on a very shallow level, and is just extremely silly."
243,"Russell was incredible. I was terrified of him and what he would do. The part of Rachel was cast well, but they could've made her seem like she had a lot more common sense. Very suspenseful, that's the reason for the 8 out of 10 points."
244,"The movie had potential. From the trailer I thought it is gonna be a good thriller. Especially with Russel Crowe in it raised my hope. But the movie is utterly rubbish. The only thing that lady character was doing in the movie is looking for stuffs in her bag and in her pocket. It was so annoying. The character of Russel Crowe portrayed with super human power, no amount of beating or injury can make him weak. All in all an utterly garbage movie."
245,"Assuming the world with bad ass around, does this movie tell us be patient and don't be late? It's quite familiar for the situation we may encounter in life. The ending is what the mother learnt. For the story, it's totally exaggerated but that's the movie highlight. Single mother fight for her son safety get audience sympathy, that's how the story design. The car crash scene probably the most relieving, to me."
246,Another unrealistic and illogical story exploiting the acceptance of white male vigilante anger.
247,"Coming from someone who is primarily into violent and gory horror, action, and thriller types of genres, this one was almost a little too much for me. Russell Crowe is a BAD dude in this. I mean, like he's gotta be in like my top 3 most messes up antagonists.Anyway, its not like over the top and above the average as far as gore goes, its just wildly brutal. I found myself getting sick to my stomach throughout the film. It takes a lot for a movie to get to me as far as like violence goes and stuff, but this one just made me wildly uncomfortable. I understand that is kind of the point of a movie like this, but on the flip side you're supposed to kinda enjoy the unease this type of movie brings you, and I had trouble telling whether I really did.The acting isn't bad at all. Russell Crowe is a great actor and this movie is no exception. The one thing besides the brutality and subject matter of the film that was a bit on the negative side for me was the fact that he got away with stuff for so long. You may find yourself asking how the hell he hasn't been arrested or taken down yet throughout the whole thing. I'd like to think that if this were happening in real life, there would be a SWAT team or something on top of him like white on rice.Overall, its worth a watch. You may find yourself enjoying it more than I did. I'm setting my personal score right at the 6 star mark that the movie's overall rating has on here right now."
248,"Struggling recently divorced mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) is struggling to provide for her son (Gabriel Bateman) and dealing with mounting personal and financial pressures. Rachel's day gets worse when a chance encounter with a motorist (Russell Crowe) results in her being chased across the city and her life torn apart.Unhinged is a serviceable thriller that will do its intended job of killing an hour and a half, but probably won't have much staying power. The movie's script is not very well constructed, and is filled with all manner of contrivances and excuses to keep the movie going rather than any logical sense. But the movie does make up for its screenplay in other areas.The performances from everyone are really good. Russell Crowe is absolutely terrifying as the villain, a man with a hair trigger temper who's consumed with rage and will stop at nothing to destroy a stranger's life for simply honking at him at an intersection. It's a really good performance as Crowe goes from toying with people to killing them without a seconds thought. The movie is also well directed by Derrick Borte who keeps the pace fast and the tension tight which helps to overlook some of the holes in the screenplay.The movie isn't on the same level as other vehicle based thrillers like Duel or Changing Lanes as it lacks the psychological strengths of the former and the character strengths of the latter. It also doesn't compare as well to other rampage movies like Joe, Hardcore, or Falling Down, and while the movie doesn't try to be on the same level as those kinds of movies, it does dip its toes in social satire with its usage of expository news coverage and cell phone videos as well as pointing out Russell Crowe's character's blue collar background which has been neglected and resulted in an increase in raging rampages, but these feel like little more than window dressing as its clear the movie doesn't care about actually talking about the issues it raises.Unhinged is perfectly fine for what it is. It's a reasonably exhilarating chase film with above average performances that'll keep you enthralled to the end credits."
249,"Should be required viewing for new driver's to encourage good driving habits. While some parts are unrealistic, the underlying theme is powerful."
250,Russel Crowe had a great performance as well as the mom very disturbing in a good way to think a person who go through all these evil and meticulous ways to ruin a person's life keeps u in su s pense the whole crazy ride I wanted to jump into the movie and destroy him I was really routing for the mom great movie
251,"I went to this movie without researching it, and boy I'm glad I did. Even though there are a few minor plot holes that keep the narrative going, on the whole this was a well constructed and believable drama.
Russell Crowe was great as the menacing road rage aggressor. Caren Pistorius and Gabriel Bateman were well cast as the (not so) hapless victims. Sure a couple of early decisions set in train the unfolding of the plot, but hey doesn't everyone make a few bad calls occasionally?
I found the pace of the movie and the building tension to be gripping. It really had me on the edge of my seat until the 'climax'.
Definitely worth a visit to the cinema to watch this, if you can forgive a few necessary plot accelerators."
252,"After reading the reviews here I expected a bad movie with poor decision making. It was agood film for what it is, which you know from the title.The main actress didnt make any very poor decisions, even including the initial confrontation. You dont mess with a frustrated, tired, stressed parent on the morning school run. Also during the pandemic many people choose to not social distance or wear a mask despite scientific advice that could save lives. Now to me that's far more unbelievable than any decision the charaters of this movie made.In all, it was a good horror/thriller with a good fast pace that you dont have to think about too much. Just right when your a tired, stressed parent."
253,Just fat Russell Crowe reinacting his average Tuesday.
254,"This is a page turner on screen. I give it a 5 star. Russell Crowe was amazing, as usual, especially since he has never had a role like this. You're on the edge of your seat the whole way. Yes you going to say nobody could be that stupid a few times but Yes I recommend it, James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 11/23/2020"
255,If I ever meet Russell Crowe I ask him for $10 back. Might be the worst movie ever.
256,"The plot is kinda unconvincing as the villain is too strong until causing so many death and accident. But I do enjoy the movie so much, literally keep me on edge of the seat. Very good movie to kill time.Lesson learn today, if a conflict can resolve by saying sorry, just say it, never let the issue escalate until totally out of control. And mind you driving etiquette."
257,"I am really upset that Crowe was in the cast of this movie... good actors, without a story..."
258,"Well, not quite a good movie, but it's not too boring to watch. You will find yourself asking too much questions during the movie (why she just don't drive to the police station, why she is not asking someone for help and call a police, etc), but anyway, it's dynamic enough to watch it. Although I prefer to see Crowe in better roles... Idea and message is guite good though - be polite in traffic, you never know who is in the car next to you :)"
259,I saw this tonight and thought it was very exciting and tense. Russell Crowe can be very menacing. I liked all the characters and thought the acting was very good. The action scenes were realistic and terrifying.
260,"I totally get how Russell Crowe's character lost it and went on a killing spree. He lost his wife, his job and on top of all that, his wife has apparently moved on with her life and is now living with another man-don't know if it was a boyfriend or lover. Crowe then goes on a rampage, starting with killing his wife and her partner and then felt like he had nothing to lose which he indicated by saying, ""suicide by cop is fine with me"".In the meanwhile, the main character, Rachel, is having her own encounter with bad luck-due to her own irresponsibility.When the two meet at a traffic light, they both allow their pride and emotions to take over and now the fight is on.I enjoyed the movie; however, I found myself screaming at the television because Rachel kept making the dumbest decisions.Why would she take her son out of school instead of simply calling the cops and have them go to her house? Instead, she chose to put her son's life in jeopardy.Once she got to her mother's house, why didn't she simply drop her son off and lure Crowe away from the house??? Did she really think her 100 lbs could beat that big man!! When he was beating the crap out of her I actually found myself saying that's what she gets for being dumb!Overall, it's worth the watch, but be prepared to watch the protagonist make foolish decisions."
261,As a screenwriter I find it absolutely appalling that they even made this movie. It is so unrealistic. The only reason it's getting a two is because Russell Crowe makes it a really good bad guy
262,"Really, all I have to say is.. ""WORST COPS IN THE HISTORY OF FILM"". Hey, I know a movie's a movie, but my lord! Apparently, there's only 1 police department in the whole county. Oh,...but I thought John Goodman was wonderful."
263,"Firstly the FBI and other data show that north of 90% of road rage murder in the US is an urban thug phenomena. Maryland for example has a population of six million and its main city Baltimore has a population of 600,000 yet more than eight in ten road rage murders in Maryland occurs in Baltimore (same with murders during car jackings, and drive-by shootings).But more jarring than the demographic choice of the makers is the decision to have the lead woman character, the victim, make continual and absurdly bad decisions, over and over. Sure panicked people can make some bad decisions, but this is so pervasive in this film that one has to wonder if the writers think every woman is an idiot."
264,"6.0 rating? Hardly. IMDb ratings are mostly aligned with my own but I have to differ greatly with this rating.Implausible, largely ridiculous and barely worth the the $2 Redbox rental."
265,"Yes, after all these movie-crisis due to the Covid when i saw the trailer to be honest i was expecting better movie... it has some quality moments (acting was good, bloody scenes was realistic, car scenes was good) but there was a lot of unneccesary stupid lead actress decisions and a lot of cliches... it was an ok average movie after all...
6/10"
266,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Boasting a ferociously captivating Russell Crowe as an absolutely lunatic driver, Derrick Borte delivers a purposefully exaggerated premise based on something that occurs every day to pretty much everyone. The rated-R action is surprising in its amount of gore and unrestraint in murdering every character in the most shocking yet incredibly entertaining fashion.However, Carl Ellsworth's screenplay lacks character depth, leaving the viewer with barely any knowledge of anything remotely relevant about the protagonists besides basic relationships, which are merely used as plot devices to more bloody killing. The narrative goes through hard-to-believe developments, and the ending still possesses the cliche ""dumb protagonist's decision that no sane person would ever think about"".Still, I defend that its main narrative is closer to reality than fiction, especially the first two acts. In the end, my main issue might actually be that Caren Pistorius' character was indeed guilty of the event that propelled everything. She demonstrated arrogance, selfishness, and the inability to simply apologize to someone who was initially polite. That, to me, it's her biggest sin and the reason why I couldn't care less about what happened to her or her family.Rating: B-"
267,Russell Crowe what a evil performance . Good movie to watch.
268,"""What's this guy's problem?"" I'll tell you. He's a sicko with a 4x4 pickup and he is played by Russell ""I just put on fifty pounds"" Crowe. Crowe's character doesn't have a name. Yeah well neither did the sadistic, faceless truck driver in Spielberg's Duel.Anyway, Unhinged is my latest review. It features Crowe as the psycho to end all psychos in a flick that makes you readily question honking your horn. As a guy who is full of motorist frustration and a whole lot more, Crowe comes at you like the Terminator with a rather vile chip on his shoulder. The opening scene where he kills his family with a hammer while burning their house to the ground is early proof of that.Released on August 21st of this year with a hasty running time of 90 minutes (that's being generous), Unhinged is depressing, merciless, desperate, and savage. It's probably the wrong movie for 2020 but I saw it anyway. Directed by a guy looking to upset the viewer while making no apologies (German Derrick Borte), Unhinged is just as much a thriller as it is a snuff horror film. If it didn't have the power to make me effectively squirm and question my morals, I would have totally written it off (no pun intended).Featuring some brisk, streamlined car chases and filmed almost entirely in New Orleans, LA (a popular shooting location these days), Unhinged blurs the lines of good taste even for an R rated endeavor. It's about a mother and son who get into a road rage incident with a mentally unstable brute (Crowe in full on beast mode). Unhinged while farcical in its approach, is still pure evidence that even in broad daylight no ordinary denizen is safe. Off the ""hinges"" and Mendoza Line recommendable."
269,I don't understand how someone like him took on a gig for a movie like this...
270,"It almost reached the level of watchable. You just find yourself saying ""why doesn't she do... anything else"" over and over and over and over.
They try to explain away the poor police response in the premise, but how about other random people? One guy running around with a mini van is apparently an unstoppable force.
Not good. Russell Crowe made a decent bad guy I guess."
271,"As others have said, go immerse yourself in Spielberg's Dual instead"
272,"Really intense and good.
I watched it work zero expectation and no i haven't watched the trailer too
But i liked it intense, good acting, fast pacedA worthy watch"
273,"So sad to see one more star to fade and cripple. Does Russell follow the path of Nicolas Cage, Mel Gibson and Johnny Depp? This C movies leaves no doubts about that - he does. He would better let this script go than agree to attach his name to it. Even worse, his acting is horrendously one-dimensional. And I agree with previous reviewer - one courtesy honk from a similarly one-dimensional lady, and this disaster movie would have never occurred"
274,"Honestly, looking into the idea of the movie, it isn't bad at all (it's actually interesting). However, the way things role throughout the entire thing is just nonsense. We all know that there was no way they would've made it in real life if he had found them. The movie's purpose is to make people understand that if you are an a**hole to others, you deserve a punishment but it doesn't happen in the movie itself. To me the more predictable and contradictory the worse. It's a disappointment for i expected more and better. Again good idea, but not worth 1h15m of your time.
One star for the idea and another for pity..."
275,What a great way to kick off Saturday night with Unhinged (2020) a wild ride indeed with Russell Crowe. We need more of these thrillers not Hollywood keep spitting out trashy movies of 2020. Thanks.
276,"No decision follow common sense, story is completely flat, everyone but the ""bad guy"" is totaly dumb and make the worst possible decision any given second."
277,I love Russell Crowe but this movie was horrible! Like who sits around and watches someone getting beat up in a restaurant or get run over and not call the cops? Who watches someone getting badly rear ending not call the cops? Also why didn't she call the police from the beginning? These are the questions the whole first half of the movie I had as I couldn't even finish watching this movie cause it was so bad!
278,"I live in Michigan. As soon as I started this movie, I got vibes this was supposed to take place in Metro Detroit. Rachel is basically poor, living in her mom's house because she lost her hair salon and now does her client's hair at their homes. She drives an old Volvo and can't afford to buy a new car. She seems to live in a nice neighborhood where her neighbors have money but she doesn't. Her brother is unemployed, trying to start a company that will probably never happen. Her daily life involves driving all around the city, constantly stuck in traffic, worried about how to pay her next bill. She gets stuck behind some guy in a pickup, honks, only for this guy to lose his mind and decide to get payback from her for not being a nice driver.It was only when the news announced that something happened in Auburn Hills, won't say what and that Russell Crowe's character worked at an auto plant as a middle manager that I realized it was supposed to be Metro Detroit. FYI, Auburn Hills is the northern part of Metro Detroit where the Pistons used to play and where Chrysler is headquartered. Too much of it seemed familiar before though because if you live in Michigan, are a millennial, probably a college graduate and aren't financially comfortable, this is pretty much your life!That to me was the true horror of this movie. Not Russell Crowe's character, just how soul crushing this state is and how horrible the people here are. Some of the worst people in this state drive those huge pickups and try to bully drivers with them! One even tried to pretty much fight me on the highway entrance ramp for tapping my horn! The people here are so ignorant and high strung that dealing with them on a daily basis is like walking on eggshells!Nice touch with Rachel buying the Powerball tickets in the gas station. Many of the smug, privileged, sometimes even working class natives frown on lottery here but anyone with brains knows a dollar or two here and there is the price for escaping from this state.Not sure how you'll think of this movie if you're not from Michigan but if you are, you might find this movie more disturbing than it's supposed to be!"
279,"After reading some of these reviews, when I went into the movie, I was expecting the main lady to make lots of dumb choices, and so I was on the lookout for them the whole way through, but I didn't find much, so maybe I'm just stupid myself... *shrug* :-/ There are a few small things I guess, sure, but most of it made sense to me. I'm more bothered by a certain scene where there are tons of people there, but no one has the guts to do anything about the badguy going crazy. On the whole though, I found this sufficiently thrilling, and Russel Crowe does a fantastic job as the lunatic villain."
280,Absolutely rediculous and complete improbable scenes and action!
281,"Exciting and amazing movie by Russell.
Sound effects were great."
282,"This is probably one of the most violent and disturbing films I've seen in a while. For me it feels like a mixture of Uncut Gems, Collateral and probably a bit of Speed with a pinch of Lars Von Trier too. Technically, Unhinged isn't a bad movie. Russell Crowe's performance is really good, he is menacing and scary, the action scenes, especially the car chases, are great and the viewer's really on the edge the whole time. BUT, for a film aiming to create actual fear and to make the audiences feel uneasy, this film is way too unrealistic at times. Seriously, this plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese! More importantly, I find the film's ethics to be quite disturbing. The way Unhinged tries to make excuses for violence and certain actions, the way it portrays people and society and its subtle messages really angered me. I understand why some people will find this movie enjoyable, I enjoyed the action scenes too, but unfortunately not the movie as a whole."
283,"We are usually more on TV series since a few years, especially action stuff. The recent movies we tried to watch were becoming rapidly boring, too slow or too long introduction. So, we try from time to time to watch a movie with my spouse and we didn't expect much from this one, except that I am a fan of Russell Crowe and wanted to give it a try. Honestly this is a must see, I told my friends and family.
The introduction is short so you jump quickly into the topic, the pace is well maintained from the beginning and the performance of the actors is very good even credible.
Ok, one could say ""but why she doesn't do this or did that"", but we all have been there one way or another (getting angry on the road or crossing path of crazy people, not meaning we misbehaved).
Now the story goes down, very down into the fragility of human being, and this one will be remembered the next time we will want to honk at someone.
Congratulations Russell, please come back !"
284,Even a kid can direct a better movie. No logic. Utter waste.
285,Good concept - Russell Crowe was probably the main good thing about the movie. He pulled it off well but horrible plot holes sadly
286,"Who's paying for hating this movie? This movie is at least 7, especially when you consider movies this days"
287,"Russell Crowe can't act bad, that's the good news. The bad news is the story and the sometimes idiotic choices our heroin makes, which of course means, the writers did a bad job. Compared to the story of Falling Down (Michael Douglas, 1993) you can't ignore that the storyline of Unhinged is, well lets be tender, improvable. Whereas Falling Down is a gripping and suspenseful thriller with elements of drama, Unhinged got the potential to be study material for coming generations of script writers, how not to do it. Unhinged: unbalanced due lazy and bad writing, and a waste of a good cast and production."
288,"I mean what the hell, simply waste of time. A desperate failed attempt to make a thriller, unrealistic with C grade acting, action and plot. One has to wonder if the people involved were so desperate to put out something that they did not even care to evaluate the movie material. Avoid"
289,"Gave it a 6 because of Russell Crowe. Without him it'd be maybe a 3 or 4. Silly movie, but at least it was a short one. Without Crowe I would've stopped watching 5 minutes in."
290,"When you are known for your good looks and you become like that, you keep low profile !"
291,"Prior to seeing this film, I never knew that Russell Crowe would be capable of playing the bad guy, as he has always typically been the protagonist, or a good guy in pretty much all of his other films, but he really does a fantastic job in this film. I would also say that he sort of carries this film, as he is not only the best actor in it, but he also gets many of its best scenes. This film is a lot better than I originally thought it would be in many ways, as it is constantly exciting all the way through, well acted, and has great special and practical effects. However, the one major flaw is the choices that just about all of the characters other than Russell Crowe's make. Basically, everyone in this movie are completely stupid, especially the protagonist. Towards the beginning of the film, after having honked at Crowe, she has the chance to apologize, but instead decides to verbally assault him, which is what causes him to ultimately go on his rampage. Instead of going to a police department or getting help from someone, she is constantly running away and hiding in different locations for short periods of time. She also makes several careless mistakes throughout the film that cause even more loss of life. Ultimately, she plays a large role in the deaths of several people throughout this film. Unfortunately, her lack of judgement throughout the film sort of takes the audience out of it sometimes just because it is so unbelievable at times, which really hurts parts of the film throughout. Apart from that, this is director Derrick Bortes first major motion picture, and I would say that he does a fairly good job with what is typically a pretty basic premise for a film."
292,WHY Crowe did this movie is beyond me. A lame thriller at best. This had potential to go somewhere but that got lost pretty quickly.Lame story and the decisions she makes are ridiculous. I cant say anymore.I cant find anything positive to say except the beginning scene was interesting. Do NOT waste your time watching this rubbish
293,"Too many people over analyse movies, yes there are plot holes etc but who cares. It's a great ride, Sit back and enjoy!"
294,"This film had great potential but it was wasted but numerous plot holes and incidents that just don't make sense and are completely unbelievable. The one liner at the end was just stupid, and the near car crash in the final scene was just bull. Such lazy writing, I mean why not just do it at a junction where it would make sense rather than have a car pull up bang in front and shout when they were in the wrong."
295,"No, I didn't finish it and have no intention of doing so.
It was perfectly built to rub your/our noses in what we've come to enjoy so much."
296,"I turned this off not even half way through. She leaves her phone in her car with the door unlocked and goes to put gasand surprise, surprise her phone gets stolen. Then Russell Crow's character goes on a terror killing a guy in the middle of day at a busy diner and he just walks out. So unbelievable."
297,Most useless thriller ever. Main character is SO STUPID. Frustrating to watch.
298,"In my opinion Spielberg directed the definitive road rage movie 49 years before Unhinged came out and it's still by far superior to this film. Duel is a stripped down lean, mean thriller by comparison to this weak entry in the genre of road rage movies. It's a pity that this film depends mostly on graphic physical violence scenes to get its momentum and shock value across, particularly since when its main plot is predicated on a road rage incident. There isn't much in Unhinged that has not been seen before in other, better movies like The Hitcher , Breakdown or any number of road movies or 'breaking-into-a-house' type thrillers.The main character is unlikeable and not we are not really given any reason to side with her other than her being terrorized for no good reason by a demented rage-aholic. Though this may be intentional, the movie never gives us any indication this may be so.Russel Crowe is menacing throughout and certainly is a versatile actor, but seeing him in recent movies is a bit unsettling, since I can't help but worry a bit about his ever expanding girth. Overall Unhinged is rather light fare for an actor of his standing. I hope he can get back to doing more prestige movies."
299,"My husband said this is a good movie. So i watched. And yeah well its a good movie. It's a good advices for everyone who use to drives and act like arrogant on the road act like ur the only one who has business that you will never know who you gonna deal with,"
300,"A decent thriller with good acting (Crowe is truly unpleasant), but with a script that unfortunately pushes through by coincidental happenings and with characters who makes dumb decisions. I feel often that writers should question themselves ""Does this make sense? Is this logical or just stupid?"" ...and stop using stupidity to push the script forward."
301,"..cause he scared the living hell out of me. this is no masterpiece by any mean, the characters are flat and kind of uninteresting. but something about it made my heart hurt and my stomach turn. disturbingly brutal and vile."
302,Really fast paced and and shocking. Don't over think it
303,"RC was an excellent actor before and shortly after Gladiator-surely there is material out there in Hollyweird that he could run with - well, maybe not - maybe money is tight...don't see how that's possible but it could be...Still love his acting but would love to see him in something that would reflect the enormous skill he showed in the 90s and early 00s"
304,"Everything in the film is spoon fed to the audience, from the close ups on the propagandists phone, to overly specific bits of information mentioned.Somehow a mid 2000s pickup truck, and 1990s Volvo are able to ham around the streets and perform better than most supercars, while bulldozing everything in their path. One of the greatest moments being when a small sedan throws the antagonists minivan flying into the air, and upside down, totaling the indestructible van with 10 feet of acceleration.
Russell Crowe's character is thicc, therefore he is able to perform like an Olympic athlete on bath salts, although he is shot, and involved in many accidents.
The director shows how everyone is brainwashed by there phones. An example of this is shown when Crowe's charterer rear ends the Volvo over and over, and drivers around are too distracted to hear the deafening metal on metal noises.This film was horrifically bad in terms of plot, and realism. There are many extreme gore scenes thrown in, it seems to make up for this. The film is not so bad it is good, but near the worst it can be without becoming satirical. Crowe's acting was pretty good, but the protagonist felt as though she was not human. A person reading a poorly written script, nothing felt convincing.
The son just accepts all that is going on, and casually throws a one liner joke to the mom, about her not honking her horn, in light of half of the people they know being brutally murdered.
The characters lack depth, the continuity doesn't make any sense, and the ends do not seem to justify the means in this film, especially given the potential it could have had. The Fortnite references, and the super dated U.I they added on the iPhone for copyright reasons is very cringe, much like the entire film, which I hoped would get better the entire time I was watching it.
This is a unrealistic, in your face, anti distraction, anti rage film which is spoon fed to the viewer for cheap thrills."
305,This movie lacks all common sense. It's a dream ... the producer/directors fantasy. It full of subtle stereotypes. It deserves a Oscar the grouch award ... a gold plated garbage can!
306,"What could have been an exciting thriller proved to be a total disappointment. Have been annoyed by a film that much for a while now. Big fun of Russel Crowe and to be honest his acting was spot on, but the scenario was just awful."
307,"Plot: reasonable until she gets fired😂
Don't even wanna go ""deep into details""..
Russell is great actor but i can't understand why he didn't ""try to change lots of it""..i mean it could been 10x. better..
The acting of the ""mother""..""greatest without emotions on very disturbing matter ever""👏😂
The kid was ok.
All in all..one of the stupidest movies of all time..(considering it has one Russell Crowe in it)."
308,"Ok...it's ridiculous, silly & u want to slap the mother many times...but it's an entertaining film. Has enough thrills, tension & violence to keep u watching."
309,"First off, this guy has gained so much weight his eyelids are bulging over his eyes.I don't know how many of these are paid reviews, but this movie is a complete disaster. Everything about it is cringe, and sure kids / teenagers might get a kick out of it however, considering this is filmed as a serious drama / suspense film it drops the ball hard.Russell was a hero of mine from the gladiator , this ""film"" should not have happened; why, why why why why.....how desperate were you for money?I still think this guy is trolling us with this movie, no way it was meant to be real.Watch it, like i did , it's fun to laugh at the crappy editing."
310,"Had massive potential but failed at every turn! So disjointed and disappointing. Russell crow was great and believable as a lunatic but there was no meat on the bones of this story.
I'm with another reviewer..The best line "" here is your courtesy tap"" so funny!"
311,"Could this movie signal the end of Russel's major movie career? I've seen this with many former A listers like Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage. It started with one bad B or C grade movie and then it soon became a norm, today I don't even look twice at any film bearing the faces of these two great actors.Unhinged is not horrible but it not good either, it is a standard straight to DVD B or C grade type film pity it had to pull Russel down into those realms. It took a few attempts to eventually watch the entire film. I had quite a number of cringe moments. I wasn't thrilled."
312,"Russell Crowe makes a great psycho.All the acting is good in this film.The reason I've given it 5 stars instead of higher, is due to the all the holes.
Characters doing really stupid things. Not doing obvious things etc.It really, really, really let's the film down.I don't know if this was due to poor direction, screenplay or editing.
The stupidity, for want of a better word, in decisions of the main female character is insulting to the viewer. This isn't anything to do with the acting. It's the writing or editing etc.
I watched and heard myself saying things out loud to the screen in frustration. The issues are just so obvious. I don't understand how they didn't pick up on this in the editing room and fix it.It's a real shame as the acting is good, Russell knocks it out of the park as a psycho and the action scenes on the road are cringeworthy - even covered my eyes at one stage at the carnage!If only there fixed the glaring issues in the characters reactions/inaction etc.Watch it for yourself, see if you see what I did.Was good to see Russell on the screen again."
313,Falling Down...Michael Douglas...no difference except for cast
314,"I saw the trailers, so I knew it wasn't going to be anything special. I just wanted to see it because I wanted to go to the movie theater. The movie starts out pretty good, but after the main character and her son hit the highway; everything goes downhill. There is no character development besides the two main characters. When three characters get killed, you don't feel bad because you only saw them on screen for two minutes earlier in the movie. And when one of the characters turns out to have lived; you don't even care. The plot of this movie is so ridiculously bad that it's actually funny. This is the worst movie I've seen besides ""The Intruder"" last year."
315,"I just got out of UnhingedMy first new movie in the cinema's since Onward back in March.Ok, you know wait you are getting when you are going in, but it's just a tad too predictable for me, there about five things referenced early on, that you know will come back into play later on. That said it was still intense and enjoyable enough.Looking remarkably like John Goodman, Russel Crowe is excellent, Caren Pistoriious is really good too.I think most people who enjoy this type of movie should find something to enjoy.Trailers shown were
Top Gun: Maverick
Tenet
Six minutes To Midnight
Parasite Noir"
316,Was those wrong choices she keeps making on purpose!? Damn!! Very frustrating to watch!
317,Waste my fuuuuukkkkkkiiiiiiiinnnnnnnn preciouuussss time..
318,"This film was meant to get people back to the Cinemas? Seriously
So in a country where at least 50% of people have guns, this bloke with NO Gun, can drive round do as he pleases, do as he wishes to anyone in Public Places with CCTV and not one person has a gun.
Lost a lot of respect for Mr.Crowe, i hope he got paid a lot of money for this, cause its total Poo, a 3 is being very kind"
319,"Crowe's performance was absolutely brilliant and thats it!!! The movie depends solely on that.. the story and events were badly written, yes its a thriller but every move is very predictable.. very disappointed!"
320,"Been watching alot of old school movies these last few months. And new releases like ""unhinged"" remind me why. This is just another crazy person chasing a hot girl type of movie with nothing new to offer.This movie is predictable as hell, with the usual lame thriller boxes ticked off. The killer is unstoppable, the heroine is dumb, their plot armour is crazy thick, and mobile phones of course decide to stop working all the time so there's an excuse for the movie to continue.It's interesting to see Russel Crowe in this kind of thing, and it might of succeeded with an extra car chase or 2. But instead they went with too much of the familier. Making this one a massive flop you should definitely avoid."
321,"A waste of talent, especially Crowe and Pistorius! Just more gore and car crashes. Laughable in a sneering way! Save your money!"
322,"Although the story could have been better, it had too many flaws. The 911 operator blew off the call, large city but cops can't respond to a woman who is being chased by a crazy road rage demented driver, no one calls the cops when a person is murdered in a busy restaurant. The list goes on and on. Russell Crowe has moved to B or Even C movies. Not worth theater prices. Wait 2 months and it will be on free tv channels."
323,In the introduction of the film you start detesting the protagonist and the rest of the film is extremely unrealistic and cheesy.
324,"Predictable, lots of mistakes, exaggerated and stupid. Couldn't wait for the movie to finish."
325,Typical violence from the Hollywood's murder and manslaughter factory that keeps spitting out this kind of crap to make people feel upset and bad. Nobody gets away with anything and everything is punished by death. Thanks Russel !!
326,"In Russel Crowe's next film, he plays a man who gets a bad seller review on eBay, so he mails himself to the protagonist and kills all her pets. In the end, the leading lady who obviously has no sense at all, kills him with a parcel opener after yelling ""Buy It Now mother lover""
The moral of the film is, if you are a recently single woman, don't go out, don't EVER wrong ANY man and don't even eBay!"
327,"Gave up after half way through due to boredom.
No story line, Bad acting, Not believable, Silly script, Over the top violence, Unrealistic to the point of humorous. Only gave the film a chance due to Russell."
328,"Brilliant movie, and the only movie that's on par or better than Falling Down (Michael Douglas). Made me jump a few times, well scripted, acted and filmed. Some traffic stunts were as good as the Terminator movies. Thoroughly enjoyable realistic escapism."
329,Russell just made my day!!! To be honest I have been looking for this kind of movie for a long time. It could have been done better though but d emotions behind it all is just awesome
330,"Illogic, stupid, empty movie. I regret wasting my time"
331,This is so unrealistic. 'Orca' Crowe killing and crashing everyone and everything in sight and the cops are nowhere in sight. Even when she calls 911 to report the SUSPECT is right behind her the 911 operator tells her everyone is busy with a crash that Orca created. Many bad decisions and one of them is ME watching this waste of time. Slimfast is the answer.
332,"Russell is the only reason I wanted to check this one out. Oh boy he was pure evil with his expressions and physical presence. The movie is a zero logic adrenaline rush which worked in a few parts. But as the story progress it turns out that the director forgot about the real world and created his own world where a psycho can do whatever he wants without even bothering about any consequences that too in the broad daylight. Usually we see the cops in every movie arriving at the crime scene in a couple of minutes. Here we see Russell's character driving like a maniac smashing cars breaking every traffic signals, killing people and yet not even a single cop bothers to chase him down. Where was the freaking Helicopter which we see in almost every movie like this. Maybe nobody cared much!! The acting of lead actress was miserable to be honest.. In many intense scenes her acting and expressions felt totally flat.
Cant rant more about this movie coz it doesn't deserve any more of an attention.
Kill the logics and forget you had a brain and that's Unhinged for you."
333,"The gripping trailer of Unhinged left me gasping for the film earlier this year. Only last night was I eventually able to sit down and see it after a unconscionable delay due to the prevailing coronavirus pandemic which only helped to add to my growing impatience and to further building my hopes up.However, after having spent two long hours seated in front of the screen, I conclude that the trailer may have been perfectly concocted, but the film is utter rubbish, a huge disappointment. My initial hopes were dashed in the blink of an eye, in a matter of minutes into the film.Why did Russell Crowe agree to star in this film in the first place? Was it because the role was offered to a more appropriate Nicholas Cage, but he rejected it and Crowe came along and snapped it up out of hand because he badly needed the money he was paid for it?Take my word for it: films play with your imagination, but nothing in this particular one is plausible. From the wishy-washy mother who is being road-raged to the invulnerability of Crowe who can get away with his crimes and nobody around him dares to stand up to him or at least call the police. He spends most of the film driving his SUV at full pelt around town and infringing every speed limit, but the police do not show up. This film is not in line with what would happen in real life. It is totally unreal, and that is where the film fails to capture your attention, to relate to it.You do not get to like the characters or feel sorry for them: Crowe angry and guzzling psychiatric medication the entire film, the pusillanimous mother who doesn't know whether she is coming or going. The only one who saves this film from the blazing fire is the little boy whose interpretation I really liked.Do not waste your time and money on this film. If you had high hopes like me, sorry to burst your bubble, but this film is not worth a damn. Watch End of Sentence, for instance and you will enjoy every minute of it."
334,"Russell Crowe has in Unhinged taken on the physicality of former rap star Biggie Smalls and the temperament of his younger self. Russell ""I'll have two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45's, one with cheese, and a large soda"" Crowe goes off on a woman for honking her horn a bit too much, so much that he goes off on a literal killing spree on comedic levels. This is a movie where people are unresponsive to the sight of a man getting stabbed to death, police do not exist and people are oblivious to any form of vehicular violence. This is a cautionary tale of not honking your horn."
335,"Do you like movies with painfully stupid female protagonists? If so, this is THE film for you.Our protagonist is established as stupid and incompetent from the very get-go, when she oversleeps and misses an appointment. Turns out, that's just the tip of the iceberg!She goes on to make stupid decisions at every single opportunity in the film. Just when it couldn't get any dumber, the writers decided on completely arbitrary technology rules, just to force another encounter.Save yourself the frustration of yelling at the screen and go watch the original Halloween, instead. John Carpenter doesn't hate women and didn't make painfully stupid female protagonists."
336,"The main character is constantly making questionable decisions to the point its unbelievable. Crowe plays a great part tho, but thats it."
337,Im not sure what half you ppl watched to call this good and give it so many stars but use are slow.. I get this kinda stuff happens but the inconsistencies that was in it im with the other guy that said cant wait for it to be over.. Directors are just throwing stuff together and calling it a movie WOW
338,No spoilers here but why Russel you were one of my favorite actors how could you fall into that kind of unrealistic bummy plot that even the dullest budget movie can do better what happened in your life ..ok was so excited to go to the movies with this pandemic thingy to finally watch this ? I m mad more about these reviews that puts an average of six rating????waste of money waste of time . Who will rate this boring out of time unrealistic flop 6 or five or even 1. Put one because there is no zero and please quit acting russel or apologize to other fans .you lost my respect for you as an actor!!! And wait for the others lile me or anyone with logical brain who ll watch this nonsense?!?!?
339,"If Rachel had only had a screen lock on her phone, this movie would have been over in 15 minutes. Seriously, who DOESN'T have one???"
340,"As you can probably see with my summary line, this is quite the downward spiral we are experiencing with Russel Crowe. Of course he is the villain in here and there is no doubt about that. First couple of minutes we see him do something so horrible, there would be no coming back from. Although we don't see things explicitly enough (something that will happen later on, if you are squeamish you've been warned) at the start, it is harrowing and quite crazy.Russell Crowe cherishes in his role, but of course the main character has to have to hold her own against him and I would say she succeeds. Road rage is quite the insane thing, but it seems like people do tend to be on the edge and even more so with all the waiting on the road (too many cars and all that). Add to that family and job related stress ... you can understand if someone is not entirely friendly to say the least. That is for the main character, not for Russell Crowe. Nicely done even if still flawed when it comes to how things could have gone. More than decent enough, because the tension is held from start to finish"
341,I know every movie isn't meant to be realistic. But so many parts of this movie have the main character acting like an idiot and doing stupid things. The performances and dialogue were just awful. It's like a Lifetime movie.
342,"Over dramatic, unrealistic, and gruesome movie. We wanted to walk out 15 minutes in. Not entertaining at all. All day he goes on a killing spree with very little police interaction. Traffic is horrible and comes to a halt for everyone else in every direction, except for their scenes. He's able to chase her all over the city. Looks like it takes place in LA and yet he shows up at every corner, always one step behind her ...Please 🙄"
343,"Unhinged was a movie that somehow released in theatres in these covid times. The premise is ""that a mother who leans on her horn at the wrong time, to the wrong guy. ""Road rage"" doesn't begin to describe what he's about to do to her and everyone she knows"". It's a very silly premise but feels very 2020-like. My interest in this movie was mostly the fact that I got to see Russell Crowe as a villain which is not something you get to see often. However, was the movie a sweet ride or did it make me ""Unhinged"".Firstly, Russell Crowe in this movie is fun to watch. He plays Tom Cooper who is a mentally unstable individual who causes chaos for our protagonist Rachel Flynn (Caren Pistorius). There isn't much depth to his character or anything and for the most part, Russell Crowe just gives an exaggerated angry performance but it's still very entertaining. Caren does a relatively good job as the Rachel and Gabriel Bateman likewise as her son Kyle. They give good performances and do a good job in conveying the fear of this ""road rage"" of Tom.Apart from that, the movie is just extremely silly. You have to REALLY shut your brain to enjoy this movie. Our main character makes some choices that feel really dumb and questionable. You also wonder why she wouldn't do certain things that would be more obvious to do. Likewise, the cops in this movie are absolutely terrible which doesn't feel believable whatsoever. They somehow struggle to catch a killer whos car and face are visible while knowing his objective of terrorising Rachel. They don't hack the phone this killer is contacting her from or have someone protect her and her son. They don't ever maintain contact with her or go on a huge manhunt for this killer is ridiculous. This movie wouldn't have lasted 90 minutes if the cops in this movie were remotely capable. The movie has a lot of questionable logic so if you start questioning everything then the movie becomes very difficult to enjoy.The action scenes are not impressive or anything either. Most of the car chase is just generic looking car chases. I actually laugh during some of these car chases because it can come off as really silly. There is a scene where Tom repeated rams into Rachel's car from behind and it just looks visually quite funny. Also during this scene, none of the other drivers reacts whatsoever. Something I also found funny in this movie is that it seems none of the other civilian drivers knows what a ""brake"" is because they always end up being the one to cause massive damage. During the third act, it becomes a very silly fist fight and it feels very 90's especially since Rachel gives a cheesy one-liner. During the fight, both Rachel and Tom are somehow to able to stealth without making a sound which is such a cliche from old action movies. The movie also ends in a cheesy way with a very silly message of ""don't road rage cause they might kill your family"".Overall, the movie is dumb. There isn't really anything impressive about the movie and I really wonder why they thought it was a good idea to put in theatre around the ""Tenet"" release date. Nothing really makes sense in this movie and its, not like the cinematography or the score is good. However, there is some fun to have in this movie because it borderline is ""so bad it's good"". Seeing Russell Crowe play a crazy guy in a short 90-minute movie is not the worst thing you can be watching."
344,"No one helped on the diner and he just walked away from the restaurant and no one helped?!What happened to the gas station staff to call the police? To the diner?This is set on a first world country, really?!He can pay all her cash to other just like that? Not gonna happen.Too bad it was russel crowe..."
345,"Let me just say this, do not listen to the bad reviews cause they don't know movies.. you have to understand it's just a movie so there will be some dumb decisions being made during the movie. I will say this tho the movie was great! A lot of action the entire movie and it was intense.. I would recommend seeing it for sure.."
346,"When the creator says this is supposed to represent a trum supporter....then you know the presmis of the film is just political trash. on top of that, this would not be an issue if cops were involved, esp with so many damn witnesses and people he assults."
347,"Russell Crowe, an actor notorious for his bad temper, plays an unstable man who road-rages a woman (and her family) after their encounter at a signal turns annoyingly sour. Caren Pistorius plays Rachel, the single mom who Russell Crowe's psychopathic character comes after. Written by Carl Ellsworth (who co-wrote thrillers such as The Last House on the Left, Disturbia, Red Dawn, and Red Eye) and directed by Derrick Borte, the opening credits of Unhinged gives you sneak-peeks of real-life road rage and how deteriorating mental health has become an alarming issue in recent times.We're shown that Rachel is already finding it tough coping with her divorce, bringing up her teenaged son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman), and staying punctual in general. Her unemployed brother and his girlfriend also stay at her house. Crowe's character (who addresses himself as Tom Cooper in one scene) is revealed to be a killer in the prologue itself, the reasons for his murderous rage explained over news reports in later scenes. At first, Tom's reasons for targeting Rachel feel random. Later on, it becomes evident that she's the ""ideal next target"" because of her failed marriage and her incapability of assuming responsibility for her mistakes.Tom's insecurities about his own flaws (along with his toxic masculinity) are projected onto Rachel, who just happens to have ""another bad day"". While Tom's backstory is only told fleetingly, his determination to punish Rachel for not sincerely apologizing to him takes things to the next level. Being an action thriller, a third of which happens on the road, you get to see many vehicles flipping, crashing into walls and each other. The action, delightfully over-the-top, is well done. The (actual) thrills, however, remain minimal. Some brutal fatalities are showcased in all their glory, but the plot somehow struggles to shift into high gear.Crowe is great fun as the unflinching road-rage psycho - the right kind of menacing and proving to be a legit threat. Caren Pistorius exhibits her vulnerabilities in a strictly serviceable performance (though she gets a pretty badass moment in the end!). For a thriller to work, the decisions taken by the protagonist (in an unforeseen situation) is what drives it forward. For what it's worth, some of them are downright questionable and unrealistic. If you can get yourself to believe that a psychopathic criminal can go on such a rampage in broad daylight, Unhinged may be an okay watch. For me, it was a little less than okay."
348,"I lost count of how many times I shouted that as I watched. Felt too far fetched and over-the-top. If you're ok with 4-6/10 entertainment, it does the job. But if you're looking for something in the 7-10/wo range, watch Falling Down instead. 🤘🏼"
349,"A movie in which unbelievably ridiculous things conventionally happen to further a silly unoriginal story.You lose interest in the rest of the movie after the ""villain"" casually murders someone in public and walks away like its a video game with the cheats on."
350,"Do not watch this movie, this is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. How it has a 6 rating currently is crazy to me. It should be a -100. So bad I don't even understand what Russel Crow was thinking making this movie, he was Gladiator for goodness sake."
351,"Russell Crowe steps out of his box and plays an over-the-top villain. Caren Pistorius plays the protagonist and her son is played by Gabriel Bateman. There's no other big names attached, and the movie is too fast paced.Tom Cooper is poorly written. Opening sequence before opening credits shows how strong he is. We didn't need to see this, because mystery of a villain is scarier. Rachel is written even worse. We are set off the bat to not root for her. She backs down too easily.The film quickly ramps up the ridiculousness and it trends upward. Rachel allows for too much to happen, people react horribly -- almost as if they aren't human beings -- and the end makes Tom to be like Michael Myers. Police work is questionably written as well.I'm not even gonna mention the terrible car chase sequence -- oops. This film is okay, it's a good popcorn flick. But you cannot sit there watching and attempt to suspend disbelief for this stuff. Everything that happens would not happen in real life. It's so over-the-top exaggerated. This is a real fear for a lot of people but this film would just not play out like that in real life.As good a premise as the film was and the trailer to entice audiences to check it out but it's better on paper than in film. Russell Crowe keeps the film from being one of the worst films made."
352,"The plot for this movie is great, but the storyline is absolute trash. People just don't behave the way this movie portrays."
353,"Russel Crowe's latest film will have you at the edge of your seat, terrified and hooked on right to the end of this tale of road rage and possibly a statement of the pressures of a contemporary life in the city. He plays 'The Man' who, as the director would have you believe could be anyone of us. This is somewhat true and for this very premise of the film it reminds me of Michael Douglas's 'Falling Down' though the latter explored the protagonist's character in startling detail. There isn't much time for that level of character development in 'Unhinged' beyond the initial 20 minutes of the film but it is rather fascinating to feel dread and terror for 'The Man' and also feel sorry and remorse at the same time. This is of course entirely to Crowe's credit as he is one of the best actors around.
The film then descends into a terrifying ride of revenge, threat to life and dangerous driving which looks way too real and that is the strength of this film. It never lets up and seeing a burly Crowe play this terrifying protagonist feels real, the terror and pain felt by the plucky mother who rankles him feels real. Crowe has done with this film what Tom Cruise did with 'Collateral', it is definitely worth a watch more than once. Keep a glass of water by your side, you will need it, it is terrifying, it is that good."
354,In the credits there was a listing for Crowes dietician. Otherwise decent movie. I couldn't believe the amount of times the woman turned around to look back while driving especially at high speed. Fun movie to watch with the family on Thanksgving or Xmas. LOL.
355,Not one cop is looking for this man after what he did in the beginning. Come on now.
356,"Its one heck of a movie. It is fast paced, action pack and Russell crowe does it again but this time is a one mean badass man."
357,"People posting poor reviews due to not liking the protagonist should probably try to remember that if the plot followed all your genius ideas then the movie would have been 20 minutes long. I don't think there's any thriller or horror movie where we don't curse the main characters for not doing what we would do.
This is one of those movies that is so scary because it's realistic. We've all experienced road rage, from at least one side. I've been followed home and it's nerve wracking not knowing what kind of crazy is behind the wheel of another car. Say what you want but this movie will have you thinking twice before giving a stranger a hard time."
358,What an intense movie😱not what Someone would expect from Russell Crowe!
359,"This is so brutal on so many levels. Firstly, the broad that started the chaos (we'll call her Karen) is a pain in the ass right from the beginning. Self centered dummy couldn't bring herself to apologize, and that's when it all went south. Frame by frame it only gets worse. Bad acting, a snowflake kid that was cringe worthy everytime he spoke, and a 300 pound Russ Crowe didn't help. The police aspect was so unbelievable it was painful. You can make up your own mind and watch it obviously. All I can say is if you actually do enjoy it, well friend, there really isn't much help for you."
360,"In ""Falling Down"" Michael Douglas played the frustrated person who had had enough of traffic, with an almost gentlemanly feel. But that was 1993 and how divided we have become. Unhinged 2020 is an all or nothing, suck you in, violent ride of a film. Reviewers who give it 1s 2s etc have been hit between the eyes and are feeling this movie. They may not like what they see but they sure are feeling it.
Russell Crowe deserves an Oscar for his performance and carries the film.
Is it for everyone? No. Personally I did not mind that the PC (Politically Correct) barriers were gone. I could understand when you lose it that is what happens. Others will squirm and shout disgust. So if you just want Disney go there this ain't for you.."
361,A better Falling Down when it comes to violence and and action. Where Michael Douglas was the wise cracking guy who snapped Russell Crowe is the guy who becomes unhinged and plays the bac guy beautifully. Crowe did a fantastic job with this one.
362,The story line was well done. The filming was terrific with incredible screen shots/scenes. The sound track was great and matched the movie. The acting was fantastic. I regret not seeing this in the theater. Nice job to the cast.
363,This is the worst movie i have ever watched in my entire life
364,Russell Crowe at his usual best. A good entertainer that keeps you on your toes throughout. More than that a good message shared by the movie.
365,"This film is one of the worst thriller I have ever seen, it is a total nonsense."
366,"Yes there are a lot of unreal extreme nonsense in here. Scenario-wise some things don't add up and are rather unreasonable. And rather violent.
Why you can watch this film and have fun:
1-Russel Crowe: i m not a fan of Russell Crowe and his aggressive persona but this role fits perfectly to his physique and acting style and he makes a pretty good villain.
2-it is an entertaining action thriller with a lot of wow! and oh! moments.
3-The film has good pace and never gets boring.
4-If you don't have much to do or to watch, then you will be entertained with this.
5-simple story: road raged angry as f driver is chasing mother with child and so... chaos erupts.
6/10"
367,"I like the movie because of the message!
I enjoy to watch because the movie has the ingredients to a good thriller
But, come on... this lady.... bad choices...
it's the classic kind of movie when everyone make stupid choices... and everything converts to favour the villain!"
368,"Crowe is absolutely frightful, a brilliant performance from him. Just Watch it without criticizing every single Word spelled by anyone. Its a movie after all, its not based in real life events!!!"
369,"I was farily disappointed with this movie. Although the action sequence was great but I find it to be very unrealistic. We have some guy going out on a kiling spree and no cops to be seen. Restaurant seen when he was beating this guy and eventually killed him, and everyone stood their watching all this time; and again, no cops. When he tailgate the girl and bang into the back of her SUV during a traffic jam, and no one cares or find that unusual? Just terrible."
370,"I drive slowly after watching this movie, worry I might somehow piss someone off like Russel Crow lol... A bit copy of ""Joyride"" but still it managed to keep me at the edge of my seat from start to finish."
371,"Whilst the plot is laudible and acting believeable, the motivation and actions of the characters are rubbish. I have just spent 50 minutes of my time, that l will never get back, shouting at my TV. The actions of the female lead are not plausible n the least. I am more than capable of suspending my disbelief, but this film takes the biscuit. What a crock!"
372,"I guess 6.2 stars is more than fair. I like Crowe's work but this one seems a bit off. Script doesn't get you attached to the characters. Weird. Watch if you don't have anything better, but most will feel the same I did."
373,This movie is soo bad that after 20 minutes you have to turn it off time wasting
374,"Woman honks horn at man who has recently suffered very bad luck and he starts trying to destroy the life of the woman. This is the premise. It's well executed and well acted. It's a decent movie.I am more interested in the subtext. Like most Hollywood movies the woman is portrayed as absolutely faultless and the man is the big baddie, but it isn't the case if you look at the subtleties.The mother is running late for work. She is late because she got up late (irresponsible). On the trip to drop her kid off to school, his dad (divorced) calls to inform that he won't be able to meet him for a prearranged appointment (boooo.. sssssss.. what a deadbeat dad) and the mother aggressively chastises the dad. Then, the boss of the woman calls and tells her she's fired because she's late for work again (aww, omg. That's so unfair!).. (double standard). The mother then abuses a man, repeatedly long honking her horn because he was slow to move from a red light. A little later the man draws up besides her and apologises profusely, explains that he's had a lot on his mind.. recently divorced and lost his job weeks before he was due to get a pension (intentional parallel to her issues that we're meant to care so much about). She doesn't accept his apology with any grace, and refuses to apologise for her own road rage. She calls her divorce lawyer at a cafe. The lawyer is a a simp, working for free because she is having sex with him, even though she knows he is married. Driving away from the cafe she is still on her mobile phone and she nearly causes an accident at a junction because she is driving while distracted.. Then the fun starts as the man who she earlier upset comes back to give her some just desserts.You aren't meant to recognise all of the above. All of the above is so subtle as to be subliminal. You aren't really meant to notice what the woman DOES or has done, the movie intentionally washes over it. You are just meant to like her. The movie wants you to overlook her complete irresponsibility, nastiness, double standards and immorality and accept the black and white dichotomy. It's a weird kind of psychological manipulation that we see continually from Hollywood. The moral is that even when the woman is bad, she is still pure as the the snow is white."
375,"Very entertaining in parts from a shock brutality petspective. However the plot could have so much more, when the curtain falls the only comment to be made is ""is that it? """
376,It's hard to believe the movie cost 33 million to produce. All of the movie budget must have went to pay Russell Crows salary.
377,"Good message though for defensive drive.
I watch this just because of Russell Crowe"
378,"This a great movie, especially if watching on the big screen.
Russel Crow's mean face suits this movie, its not over the top but enough cringe to sattisfy.
If anyone gives this a bad review, Russel will make your day bad...VERY bad..."
379,"Too violent, unrealistic....RC is a great actor but no, just no."
380,"Stupid, predictable, boring, lots of errors, poor dialogs. A bad movie in general"
381,Crap too many inconsistencies not worth it for me but good luck
382,"There was nothing At all worth watching in this film , The person that made this film should be tarred and feathered , They are not an artist no one associated with this film is an artist"
383,"I gave it a one because, in reality, that's what it deserves. Its a terrible movie. Very frustrating to watch for the first 20 minutes or so, but then, as you let go and give in to the outrageousness of the whole thing, it becomes a very funny movie to watch and make fun of with a date or your significant other.
The mom looks like she's maybe five years older than her son. The son is supposed to be 13 or 14. Her brother is so unpleasant that you're almost cheering whenever something bad happens to him. Oh my god, Russel Crowe seems to be auditioning for a John Goodman part, he has let himself go so badly I could hardly believe it was him.
The sheer ridiculousness of the situation and the characters unwillingness to do any of the common sense things that anyone else would do in reality led me to just give up on trying to take this movie seriously and start laughing my butt off at what was taking place in front of me.
Despite being obscenely overweight, Russell Crowe gives an intense performance as always, but of course, he's hampered by the lack of sound scriptwriting and some pretty weak preformances from the other actors. The film makers seem to have a very low opinion of the capabilities of the police who come off as bumbling at best."
384,"What a bunch of rehashed garbage. The premise of the movie is unrealistic and totally blown out of proportion. Mr Crowe has seen better days and certainly better movies than this sad, sad attempt at creating something interesting."
385,"Don't waste your time! The acting, the script... everything is bad in this movie!"
386,"In the first scene we see a peeved Russell Crowe take a pick-axe to his ex-family and then set them on fire. He got the bad end of a divorce. The opening credits are filled with scenes of road rage. Wonder where this is going? We are introduced to Rachel (Caren Pistorius ) and her family. She is also going through a divorce. The two subplots meet on the street and Crowe over reacts to a woman blowing her horn while he naps at a green light.I would have done the 911 call a lot sooner. Filmed in a city on I-95 that has a lot of traffic. Crowe gives his name as ""Tom Cooper"" who is an Australian-Dutch cricketer. Part of the film is a home break-in type (like you didn't expect that) and the rest is Caren Pistorius in a panic mode in her car. She couldn't carry the film. Can't Denise Richards or Jennifer Aniston play a mommy?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
387,"Russel killed this role! It's a very fun ride, and thoroughly entertaining. I don't go into movies like these expecting Academy Award worthy criteria, and neither should anyone else. Is the plot predictable? Of course it is! Are there some typical cliches? Yep! If your standards are too high for that you're too smart and should go watch The Kings Speech for the 100th time."
388,"With cinemas in the UK reopening, the search for content that isn't just classic re-released films has elevated ""Unhinged"" to a wider release than initially might have been planned. And though it's fairly run-of-the-mill, I found that, maybe just because I was happy to be out of the house, it was a decent enough time.On a stressful morning of trying to get her son to school, Rachel (Caren Pistorius) blares her horn at a driver who's too slow to move away at a green light. Unfortunately for her, the driver (Russell Crowe) has already committed murder that morning, and with nothing left to lose decides to teach Rachel how horrific ""having a bad day"" can really be.One thing you couldn't really accuse ""Unhinged"" of is being particularly original. There's elements of ""Duel"" in the car chase scenes and of ""The Hitcher"" in the torture moments and of many slashers in the conclusion. There are times when you won't agree with the choices that Rachel makes and that can be frustrating, although I suppose sometimes that's half the fun with a film like this. You'll also be on to what's happening in terms of him tracking her well before she is. There's really very little here that you haven't seen before.One element I did like is that Crowe's character isn't interested in trying to keep himself under the radar, the police are on to him straight away, and even more so following some scenes with a nice cameo from Jimmi Simpson and there's none of the ""crazy woman overreacting"" stuff, which you might have expected in a film like this. The visual effects are pretty solid stuff, particularly for a movie that doesn't appear to have had a crazy budget - a lot of the car crashes appear to be mostly practically done and they usually work.Like I said, maybe I'm more forgiving that I might have been had I chosen this from a full selection of movies, but given what's available at the moment, it was alright."
389,"Glory to the narcissistic brute and family violence perpetrator justifying murder of innocents,through his warped raw end of the family law system justification is ultimately shallow and, seemingly unintentionally ,comic.Crowe belittles his acting capability in his terrifying ( for about three quarters) but one dimensional role.His evil is a sledgehammer ,yet the attempt to attribute a modicum of blame to the female victim is ridiculous.
May be that was the intent ,but the problem with Unhinged is that ,if it was, you doubt it by the end.
Otherwise reasonable acting , fast paced tension."
390,"Time flashed by, totally engrossed, Russell Crowe had my son and I glued to our seats. My son said ""gory but exhilarating"". I am a criminal lawyer, I know psychopathic obsession, the lead here has all of that. An experience to see."
391,"Had me on the edge of my seat. Maybe predictable, but enough surprises to keep it more than entertaining. Crowe is a very nasty bad guy. Well done. The whole film has a nasty anxious vibe which is great. Definitely worth you while."
392,"I can only hope that Russell Crowe hasn't actually gone quite to seed to the extent depicted in this quite decent road-rage movie! When ""Rachel"" (Caren Pistorious) and her son ""Kyle"" (Gabriel Bateman) have rather an unpleasant encounter with him at a set of traffic lights on their morning school run, she just shrugs it off as the normal attitude of other road users... Only, well, Crowe - maybe called ""Tom"", but we never quite know - turns out to be a vengeful maniac who can bear a grudge and then some... The plot itself is pretty derivative and fairly far-fetched, but Derrick Borte does manage to successfully create and sustain quite a bit of suspense and tension as Crowe, himself on great form, proceeds to terrorise the woman and just about everybody she knows/cares about. Next time, just hold off on the horn snd smile!"
393,"In the 2 minutes the 2 main characters collide the real bad guy in my opinion is the mother who's portrait as the Hero, Both suffered terrible things, partially self inflicted, but the guys realy tries to be polite despite being a psychopath. The mother who's having a bad day is behaving like a antisocial person and triggers the psychopath.
The struggle between the both is realy exiting and capturing. Granted the violence inflicted by the psychopath is is realy bad, disgusting and in no way rightheous but in the end triggered by the mother.
So in the end with all the collateral damage the Mother is still made to be the hero she's not in my opinion. Her antisocial behaviour triggered all the events in this movie, had she been a bit more polite & forgiving the movie would have ended right there :)"
394,"This movie is pointless,
it's one of the worst movies i've ever watched."
395,"Please ignore any reviews above a 5.Russell Crowe. Body suit? Or just fat? Either way it looks like he's given up on life. Shame he didn't give up this movie. It's plain awful. A simple plot choice which had to be wildly exaggerated yet still follow the same predictability and mundane tone. So many bloopers, so many unnecessary predictable moments, no characterisation at all, no in depth background of any character, just a silly boardroom idea bought to the big screen which I imagine 90% of the budget was spent on casting Crowe. Let's face it, his acting skills makes a movie. But not even this one was salvageable with 10 A-listers!Dialogue - terrible!
Plot - Predicable
Acting - All but Crowe atrocious
Point - noneGlad i streamed this movie for free because I would have been fuming if I had paid to watch it!!Avoid like Covid-19"
396,"Man, Russell Crowe packed on at least 200 lb. for this role! This starts off with a home invasion and murder by Russell Crowe (BTW - it is never revealed whom he is killing, and he also burns the house down with gasoline). The next scene is just some annoying family talk which I find repetitive, and which is typical of films in Gen-Z which I have trouble relating to. A young woman takes her son to school, but gets stuck in traffic, all while making at least 2 calls to people. In the process of the traffic rush, she runs afoul of Crowe's character in his truck, and he taunts them while the windows are down, and builds up his rage as the woman talks back rather than give in and apologize. The woman drops her son off at school, at which point Crowe catches up to her at a gas station. The situation deteriorates from here. In a news broadcast, it is revealed that Crowe's character was fired from his last job for molestation of a minor, and he also has had one too many blows with his ex-wife, and feels that his work life is to pay only alimony to her, and he has at this point snapped. I have to take exception to where the story is going: they try to make the usual, shallow trope of ""people who feel left behind eventually become dangerous."" I think it is kind of irresponsible of Hollywood, when they make stereotypes like this. So, after the usual body count, the story unfolds just as you would expect it to. There are a few good car crashes to round out an R-rated level of violence. The one thing I noticed is the usual, cops-show-up-for-the-cleanup rountine. In real life, a murderer like this would not run around like in Grand Theft Auto; he would have been caught well before this!! A convenient scene for the plot device is when the woman calls the cops, and they say, ""Ma'am, we don't have any units in the area to assist you."" That wouldn't happen in real life!! Just don't expect miracles if you go and see this. It isn't exactly for repeat viewing. Although it has its moments. It kind of has a little bit of, newsreel footage, like as if to say, ""this is what the motif of this movie will be about"" (ie road rage, domestic violence) and of course, they have news clips of psychologists, talking about society, and what makes men snap. It's been done before on movies like Summer of Sam, the newsreel footage montages."
397,"Plain, dumb, fun. Just a cool lil thriller, with a over the top Russel Crowe. Nothing special, Just a simple but fun to watch movie. Just go check it and escape for 90 minutes, out of the real madness"
398,Russell crow should be ashamed after being an academy award winning actor to star in such a predictable horrible movie. Also I would probably put this movie under the category of comedy because after the first 10 mins of him chasing her with road rage...it does become quite comical
399,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal. Keyword there is ""movie"". It's just a movie. There's nothing in it that you couldn't have picked up from the description. It's basically just Russell Crowe killing people in today's often backwards world.Not an award winner. Not even a nominee. Just a movie to watch to kill some time. 8/10 on its own kind of scale."
400,"Unfortunately even if Russell is an amazing actor, he could not pull the rug off his mediocre movie, the list of nonsense decisions made it even harder to watch and enjoy it.
Who wrote the screenplay should be fired, it could be a great movie overall but the execution... Too poor!!!"
401,"Crazy stuff, as advertised. crow plays a good bad guy. like the famous first film by Spielberg about the truck chasing the car down a mountain. Road rage is for real. we were trying to figure out where this was, some big city where traffic is awful - maybe California somewhere. the roads were always wet? had to laugh when the tow truck put the car on the carrier upside down. some funny parts but overall scary. in a time when blue cities are getting burned down and cops getting shot like sport - this is possible. get a CCP and learn how to defend yourself. this movie was a pretty good indication of road rage on steroids"
402,"I love Russel Crowe in this, he played the perfect psycho!!
It's scary to know this stuff really happens, hopefully not to this extreme!!
This movie showed us how f--d up this world really, I think the actors were top notch."
403,"It started out very scary, intense, and thrilling. But after he kept UNLIKELY getting away with it and being out in the open, and her doing stupid things over and over, especially towards the end like going in an empty house and parking the car in driveway to be seen. I stopped feeling sorry for her about half way through"
404,"I gotta say this film is pretty decent for a thriller... kept me on the edge of my seat. but too many dumb plot devices spoilt it.
the minute the son ask the mom why she doesnt have a password on her phone, i knew whats gonna happen next.why did she leave their phones in the car at the gas station?she's stressed out, absent minded and sloppy.why she puts her wallet on top of the car when filling gas?nothing happened but still i think its dumb to do that.why she did not keep her eyes on the road when she talks to her son?nothing happened but its dumb to keep turning back to talk while car is moving.why no one tries to stop the doc from being stabbed in the restaurant?samuel l jackson and john travolta was in a different diner.why the cops did not come in pairs in this movie?one cop entering the house and shot the killer.... one cop driving in the car.how did brother not hear any glass shattering noise at home?chubby killer was once a ninja.how did killer get out of the flipping car so fast and unharmed?again... ninja from Beverly Hills Ninja.who would have thought playing fortnite has its benefits?im gonna force my kid to play it, telling him its gonna safe his live in the future!russell crowe scares the heck outta me in this film. he did a good job."
405,"And again we have a movie with an evil middle-aged white men. The movie had potential, but they decided not to develop it. The plot starts okay, the characters were introduced decently, the actors are okay, but at the end you're going to see a mediocre movie at best. Yes it does have some dynamics, some tension, but you won't see anything extraordinary or complex. It's just a middle-aged angry white dude who's angry at everyone and everything for his miserable life. And for some reason he's super strong, super determined, nobody can stop him and he can literally wipe out everyone in the city if he likes to with bare hands and nobody can stop him, not even the cops. If you just want to waste 80 minutes by watching some thriller then that's fine, you may enjoy it, but there are tons of better movies out there."
406,"Make it short... not worth it.
Stupid choices, not realistic, classic hollywod naive drama with no sense.
But they do it over and over again. Its frustrating..
Hollywood, you suck 🤷‍♂️"
407,"A gem of a movie! A minor incidence leading to a major catastrophe with bodies all over the place. Worth seeing and very exciting. Starts off slow but the action starts about 5 minutes into the movie, so settle down and relax watching this real thriller.Don't ever lose your cool when driving. You have been warned!"
408,Very good thriller with Russel Crowe as a bad guy! :)
409,"Solid but noarrow movie with one the the most vicious antagonist in a movie. The movie goes straight to the point and does very well at audience capturing. Russell's performance was top notch and made him more scarier. The movie is short motherless and wished they had touched on more characters... and some part of the story, we still don't know what triggered a man to have a bad day in the first place. Fun to watch and recommend it."
410,Don't know why the low marks great movie. Have a watch you won't be disappointed. Very good car crash stunts and good acting
411,"This movie is actually pretty good. We havent had too many good movies during this crazy time, but I like this one a lot. It's a good thriller. Most of us have been involved in some form of road rage, so this is one movie we can relate to. Russell Crowe played his role to perfection. He's legit terrifying here. Just ignore the low rating and just watch it."
412,"Just she has to say sorry and story over but i know writer has lot to add to make story.. I laugh when she overthrow his car then he beat her,instead of go behind him to stop she directly go where her son 8s hidding so he find him...lol.."
413,Better than a lot of recent films that have come out. Crowe is very good.
414,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat for most times, russel crew is an amazing actor."
415,"The family depicted in this film is so annoying, so unrealistic so PC that after a while one starts rooting for them to be removed from this Earth one by one in the most horrid way.
Can people live like that?Not even suspension of disbelief can makes us go through this mess without face palming every few minutes.And, wth happened to Russell Crowe? He is gross. He should be in a spa, and not working in this type of garbage."
416,This movie was hard to watch and even harder to finish. So many many plot holes had me yelling out 'wtf'. This is America. How did no one pull out a gun at some point in the movie? Am I really expected to believe the female main character is that daft? Had she any brain cells the film would've been 30 mins long. And to boot the movie definitely fails the Bechdal test. Just no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
417,"Unhinged is a fast paced Psycho-Thriller with a great perfomance by Russel Crowe.
This Movie mixed different genres like Psychothriller and Action and some Horror, Crowe is great as the Psycho, and the Car Stunts are well filmed. The only weakness is the female lead actress which is annoying at times. I would say one of the best Movies from 2020.
Recommended."
418,"Are you kidding?!?! The script is really disappointing, one phone call or driving to a police station is what it takes.
And yet you have to watch all the stupid choices and exaggerated lunacy.
All that because of a horn honking"
419,"Caren Pistorius can not play a credible character. It is simply amateurish and utterly embarrassing. You do not believe a single word she or her son utter. Stanislavsky - the guy who trained Mikhail Chekhov - the guy who nearly trained the entire hollywood tradition would say 'Ne Veriu!' - 'I do not believe'. Or we can say: ""Jesus Wept!"". Horrible, unprofessional amateurish acting. I just switched the film off after some 15 minutes being unable to watch Caren's acting. That saved me also the possibly horrible sight of the degraded Crowe, the initial scene of him ""burning down the house"" was quite an in-credible ""un_acting"" too. What a horrible non-professional anti-artistic silly world we live in."
420,The car on its lid on the back of the recovery truck at the end of the film did it for me.. no f##ks given lol
421,"The film start in way that makes you feel, it will be a chair grabber kind of thing, but in many scenes you can not ignore the poor acting by the main character nor the stupid choices by the script it self."
422,"Lazy and uninspiring, a total cliché of all that is boring. A waste of Crowe. Such a shame after looking forward to a good thriller."
423,"In a word - bloated.Bloated as in monotonous unimaginative chase sequences. Bloated as in uninspired superfluous cinematography. And bloated as in a cliche performance by a once non-bloated Russell Crowe.As for the juvenile script and film school direction - extremely bloated.""Brothers, what we do in life echos in eternity"" - Maximus Aurelius ~ GLADIATOR"
424,"Russell Crowe says everything through a filter of "" The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick.""He does evil as well as he does honour so this film benefits from that."
425,"I'll start by saying that Unhinged isn't an amazing film. It's not one that I will remember with great clarity in a few weeks, or one that I will make a point to rewatch every year. It won't be on my top ten of the year, and I can see why it might not work for some people, but I must admit that I had an absolute blast with the film.The performances from Russell Crowe, Caren Pistorius, and Gabriel Bateman were all electrifying. Crowe completely disappeared into his character, and he was truly terrifying to watch on screen, whereas Pistorius and Bateman managed to act on the drama and emotion in such a compelling way.I was worried when I went in to watch the film that I wasn't going to believe that this character wanted to hurt Rachel so badly just because she honked at him whilst driving, but it worked a lot better than I expected. We can see where Crowe's character was coming from, even if we despised him.That's not to say that it didn't strain credibility, because my main issue with the film is how unbelievable it gets in a lot of scenes. It was still entertaining to watch, but it would have been nice to have a little verisimilitude. There were also too many convenient things that happened, and certain plot elements that didn't make much sense.I also felt a lot of other films in the DNA of Unhinged, so it wasn't entirely original but that's hard to do nowadays with the quantity of films that are being released.The filmmaking aspects were fine, but nothing special. It wasn't a film that was trying to blow people away with the cinematography or a deep screenplay, and so I enjoyed it for what it was. I highly recommended seeing Unhinged if you like thrillers and want a film which you don't have to concentrate on too terribly much.SCORE: 76%"
426,"Unhinged is an entertaining, if underwhelming movie. Russell Crowe is absolutely fantastic as the psychotic Tom Cooper. He delivers an extremely menacing performance, creating a genuinely terrifying, yet detestable character. The movie also uses tension extremely well. There are very few jump scares and, when they are used, they're used to great effect. Several scenes play out in pure silence, making a far more uneasy experience. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn't great. Caren Pistorius does well as the lead, however her character makes incredibly stupid decisions which endanger the lives of her friends and family. Gabriel Bateman also plays a child, who is obsessed with Fortnite, placing the film in great danger of becoming dated very quickly. I also believe that this movie doesn't respect the audience's intelligence. At various points, the message of the film will be spelled out for the audience in an awful case of breaking the rule of 'show, don't tell.' Especially in the insulting title sequence. However, I'd still recommend this film for the tension and Russell Crowe's magnificent performance. However, just wait for it to become available on home media."
427,Not Russell Crowe's best work a great thriller with a few twists and turns - best seen on the big screen if you get the chance. Definitely recommend.
428,Considering there is nothing else on at the movies this was a 5 out of 10. Average at best but Hollywood has been quarentined so I guess right now we really shouldn't expect good movies for a while
429,"Power act by lead actor ,create intense feel throughout the whole film. Everything going smooth in the first part of the movie,as story going on, it's full of loopholes it's seems the lead actress got a problem in decision making while everyone knows when this thing happen. Writer should create a story to convince audience why actress make this silly decision,and that's the reason why I don't care about the lead actress live or dead due to her decision making. Or man, now still having a phobia of pressing car horn due to seeing this movie."
430,"As ""Unhinged"" (2020 release; 93 min.) opens, it is ""4:03 AM"" and a gay we later come to know as Tom is clearly not having a good night in his pickup truck. He breaks into a house (presumably of his ex), and sets the place on fire. The next day, we get to know Rachel and her teenage son Kyle. As she is driving him to school, Rachel gets into an argument with Tom in his pickup truck over a green light/red light. Next thing you know, Tom murmurs ""You don't even know what a bad day is, and I'm going to show you!"" At this point we are 10 min. into the film, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director Derrick Borte (""The Joneses""). Here he brings us what in essence can be summed up as ""road rage on triple steroids"". That's all you really need to know about this film. Even though it's all utterly predictable, I nevertheless found myself tensing up in my theater chair. The long (and I do mean, long) car chase sequence will make the hairs stand up on your arms. Russell Crowe is the perfect ""bad guy"". Has his real life weight ballooned to what we see in the movie or is this just movie make up? I don't know the answer, to be honest. The up-and-coming New Zealand actress Caren Pistorius is spot on as the single mom who is the target of the road rage. Bottom line: I had slim to none expectations for this film, and I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it.While some theaters have been open for about two months (showing mostly classic films or indie and foreign films), ""Unhinged"" is the first wide theater release in the ""new normal"" era of COVID-19. The Sunday early evening showing where I saw this at the Cinemark here in Cincinnati was not attended well (less than 10 people). I think it will take a top-notch film like Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" to get people to return to the theaters. Meanwhile, if you like a good road rage action thriller, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
431,Not much to say. A thrilling watch but the ending was totally predictible. Slightly cheesy at times. I enjoyed the experience but will never watch it again. Also the police in this movie were shocking
432,"Pretty intense. At one point the film picks up and never stops. There are a few great things about the film in terms of how one can learn about how technology can be used to ruin a life, how decisions on the road can come back to haunt us, etc. I tried hard not to like Caren Ellsworth, but she pulls you in. There's a reason why she won ""best upcoming star"" or something or other. She's like the action star younger sister version of Jennifer Connelly."
433,"Toward the end of the movie when Rachel is driving up the driveway the garage door is up, next scene door is close, Near the end of the movie where she is driving off in the same car that she T bone the minivan with Russell Crowe is not damaged"
434,The first half of the movie is extremely entertaining. Unfortunately the 3rd act is absolutely brutal and all its short comings that could be previously overlooked come to light in the worst way. Russell Crowe is obviously awesome though.
435,"I saw ""Unhinged"", starring Russell Crowe-Man of Steel, Gladiator; Caren Pistorious-Mortal Engines, Slow West; Jimmi Simpson-Westworld_tv, White House Down and Gabriel Bateman-Child's Play_2019, Lights Out.
This is the first movie that I have been able to see in the movie theaters since they have opened back up-due to Mr Corona-and it was a good one. If you have never experienced road rage, this movie is the very definition of what road rage can become. Russell plays a man that has been having a bad day-It involves finding his wife with another man, but that's beside the point. Caren is a woman going through a divorce and trying to raise her son, Gabriel-so, yes, she too has been having a bad day. She has just talked to her lawyer, Jimmi, who gave her some unexpected news about her divorce, and it's not good. It seems like everyone is having a bad day. But, when Russell and Caren have a run in with each other-and tempers flair, as well as their horns-well, that's when the road rage surfaces and Russell wants to teach Caren a lesson in courtesy. There is a lot of violence-some pretty graphic-and it will make you think about honking your horn at a stranger in traffic ever again.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violent content and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
I liked it and would buy it on DVD."
436,In a movie When a person He don't if he get shot my cops man just imagine how Hovc he is going make .. movie do have some cheesy dialogs but that don't stop me from enjoying unhinged.
437,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Starring Oscar-winning Russell Crowe, this gripping road-rage drama was written by Carl Ellsworth and directed by Derrick Borte. Also called a psycho-thriller, this movie will make you wonder what happened to civility and respect in the world today. Maybe this is a movie we all need to watch just to remember to be a little bit more kind and patient with each other. Here's the deal: it all starts with you.The film's release kept getting pushed back because of the pandemic. It's now opening in actual theaters. Do you think you'll go? I received a screener to watch from the safety of my home. Yay! Hopefully, the movie will go to online streaming soon too for those who don't want to go inside theaters.Due to the brutal violence, this is NOT a movie that a lot of people will enjoy.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
People flip the bird
Profanity and lots of F-bombs
Disturbing scenes of death and destruction
Brutal violence, especially with lots of innocent peopleTHEMES:
Road rage
Aggression, anger
Our words and actions have consequences
Learn the art of a ""courtesy tap""!
Learn how to apologize
Violence and retributionTHINGS I LIKED:
I appreciate murder scenes when I don't have to watch the gore, but know what's going on because of the audio. It's so much more terrifying.
Fun fact: The trailer features a cover of Nirvana's ""Heart-Shaped Box"" from the 1993 album called ""In Utero.""
Writer Carl Ellsworth also wrote Disturbia and Red Eye, both super intense movies. Like those, this movie will grab your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. The tension is non-stop.
I like seeing Jimmi Simpson
The female protagonist isn't very likable. She's a mess and so the character you feel sorry for is really her son.
Good sound effects and intense music.
There's a super cheesy and cringe-worthy line toward the end of the movie that will make you laugh out loud.
Some critics are saying the video montage at the beginning of the movie is unnecessary, but I thought it definitely made a point.
The stuntwork on the car crashes and chase scenes was very well done.SURVIVAL TIPS YOU LEARN:
Always have a plan B
If a crazy person is stalking you, go straight to a police department
Always have your chargers for your cell phone and tablet with you
Courtesy tap and be kind to people. Everyone is on edge these days during this pandemic.
Don't make noise when you're hiding from a bad guy!
Don't be so quick to honk your horn when you're annoyed with drivers around you. You don't know what their day has been like...
If someone near you starts to get violent to others, get out of there!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Russell Crowe sure has packed on the weight, but then again, haven't we all during this pandemic? I don't know if he gained weight for this role or not, but it does give heft to his character in a very menacing way.
Some scenes were unrealistic and unbelievable. I don't want to give you any spoilers here...
Some things just didn't make sense. Again, I don't want to give you any spoilers here...
Most characters make terrible decisions. It's super frustrating to watch, but I admit it engages you in the story by wanting to yell, ""Nooooo!"" at the screen.
Brutal violence of women and children... NOT OKAY.
You don't get any big backstory to help you understand why Russell Crowe's character is so evil. In that regard, he's just as evil as the insane villains in many slasher/horror movies.
There's a moment in a car where there is obvious dubbing because the video and audio don't match the character's lips. What the what?
There's another moment when people are sitting around eating while Russell Crowe's character goes nuclear nearby. What the what?INTERESTING LINES:
""We are going backward."" - voice during the video montage at the beginning of the movie. It sure seems like it with all of that's going on in the United States right now.You can see more of my review on my Movie Review Mom movie channel and website."
438,"I was looking forward to this movie but at the same time a little concerned about the potential ending. Was it going to fall into the current societal/political landscape or was it going to live outside of that paradigm and just have a non statement ending?
Well I'm not going to answer here but I will say the movie has some great moments and is a good ride.I did wonder if Crowe was just a little hangry?"
439,"While Russell Crowe does a decent job of trying to float this bad idea of a movie, it just doesn't hold up in the end. A pointless 1 hour and 26 minutes of taut stalking scenes where the heroine (if that's what you want to call her since she is quite despicable) makes one dumb choice after another. I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie."
440,A poorly made movie that lacked realism and common sense.
441,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I was so disappointed.
It was extremely predictable and certain situations just defied logic.
Russell Crowe is barely recognisable as the overweight psychotic road rage killer. He was good in his role, but even his presence cant save this disappointing movie."
442,"Spoiler alert!To make this movie believable would be to have the protagonist hopped up on meth not opioids. Hydroxy puts you to sleep, it doesn't hype you up! That's what one of the main risk factors are. But make the public believe this about opioids too, why?! It's already getting harder and harder for those that need the medication to live a half decent life as it is. This message in this type of movie is more reckless than the road rage plot of this movie."
443,"Worst plot worst everything.
I laughed thru the whole movie, like dude go to the police, once he already run over someone, why keep on going lol just horrible, but great acting of Russell . Nothing else"
444,The stupidity in this movie is on a whole new level. I never wanna watch this again.
445,A gargantuan Russel Crowe road rages his way into a murderous spree as he relentlessly torments a young mother who honked at him at an intersection. The plot is as dumb as it sounds. The inevitable and utterly predictable conclusion is cheesy and lame. I give the cast a smidge of credit for making the most out of very little.
446,"I didn't particularly like the film. Russel Crowe is an excellent actor, but he got it wrong in this production. When we watch it, we immediately remember Falling Down, this one with a very convincing script and story, bringing the viewer to the main character's point of view.In this case, we are witnessing only a collection of violent acts, many of which are impossible to occur in the real world. The acts went to great lengths to characterize the character, getting fat, etc., but it didn't work.It is the type of production style b, totally unnecessary, not worth the price of the ticket and going to the cinema."
447,I have seen hundreds of movies and I can say without a doubt that this is the worst one I have ever seen. its super boring and very predictable
448,"The movie Kidnap with Halle Berry has a lower rating than this one, that's something hilarious. I guess people had higher standards back then.
About this movie... No parent would risk their kid's life this many times. The movie is a mess, but whatever, if you don't have anything else to watch, just watch it and laugh. Sad to see Russell so fat, he doesn't seem healthy at all."
449,"Unhinged, directed by Derrick Borte, introduced a pretty interesting premise, with a handful of okay moments, but due to the sloppy execution, it shortly became a bland, by the numbers film, that was quite predictable. Borte had a decent game plan coming in, making this a tight, self aware, fast paced action/thriller, but the action itself was below average, really lacking in the suspense and intensity categories.My biggest issue with the film was the inconsistencies. There were just too many occasions where you would just need to go along with what they were going for, because it truly made no sense. There were a lot of things done, strictly to help service the plot, and it almost took me completely out of the film.Borte had a tough time crafting his own style, feeling like a complete recycled ""action/thriller"", that had one of the most boring color palatés, and really choppy editing. I can understand the tone they were trying to set with the grey and blue colors, but the cinematography as a whole was just boring and drat.I can appreciate Borte giving us the bare minimum on our characters, due to this being a high-octane action/thriller, but they are so wooden! There was almost zero character development throughout, creating no real connection to any of the characters. Russell Crowe was the selling point of the film, putting on a really good performance. Caren Pistorius also put on a realy good performance, but her character was given much at all, making it really hard to care for her.The screenplay by Carl Ellsworth, is literally whatever. With this particular style of film, it isn't the easiest task to put together a hard-hitting script, so it's hard to completely fault him, but the screenplay didn't offer much at all to the plot or characters.Overall, I didn't hate Unhinged, due to the fact that it never got boring, but there was a lot of potential to be grasped, and it almost completely flopped."
450,"Boy isn't it good to be seeing new films in the Cinemas at last, this is the first new release I've seen on the big screen since Bloodshot back in March.The concept of this film is very simple after a woman has a interaction with a very unstable man on the road, she becomes his rage as he gives her the ""worst day of her life"" by turning to rage, it's a very silly concept that is way over the top. This is one of them films where you need to almost turn your brain of too enjoy.Despite the dialogue not being the best the actors gave good performances. The special effects were great in this film, the film is entertaining and enjoyable despite some issues.Overall I'm going to going to give Unchained a 6/10."
451,Worst movie in 2020.. What was everyone thinking on the set. This was pure craps and the people who gave this above a three must be between the ages of 1-25..
452,"Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Poor scripting, poor acting, poor storyline, poor everything. Every single scene makes you mad about the actions that are taken to stop the antagonist. Has 0 in common with reality.
So what was his bad day, being fired? So he has to take it out on a stranger.
I repeat DO NOT make the same mistake as me and watch this slop of a movie."
453,Just watched the movie and cannot stand the actress and her son. She needs to improve her acting skills first.
454,"Russell Crowe gained all that weight for this garbage movie? How desperate can he be? Did he even read the script? This movie was terrible. There was no surprises, no twist, typical ending, and was just flat out boring. I'm not sure if this was suppose to be an action movie or suspense or what but this movie SUCKED. Crowe might even miss a role in the Gladiator sequel because he gained too much weight. What was he thinking?????"
455,"Didn't expect much from it at first, as this is the first movie I watched in the theatre this year. It was so good. The story set up in a very realistic way, literally like everyone could possible to run into in real life. It is unpredictable, the whole time I was stressing out and can't stop think about what I should do in that situation. This movie literally give me anxiety lol.I like the way how it focus displaying Rachel's mental status, I think this actress did a great job! as seeing her panic and freak out I kinda feel sick too. A few car crash scenes are shoot very well. The storyline overall plan well, tho there are a few things that doesn't make sense but overall it's a great experience.I think this movie made a such a strong point: people are so impatient and angry nowadays. We are. We really should slow down be reflecting on what really making up like this. Whenever there is someone driving too slow, we are all become extremely irritated. I personally had experience in both roles, being the one that drive too slow and being the one road range. (More often the first one. We are all thinking : what's wrong with this person driving so slow?"" But maybe there is an external reason for it, maybe he is a new driver that scared of go on road. We should learn how to not blame others all the time.After the movie we walked to our car and coincidentally there are a couple of cops arresting a homeless man. And we also ran into a car that stop at the intersection doesn't move when it should. Of course we didn't horn at him, but lmao."
456,"Great acting job by Russell. Really thrilling story, doesnt get boring. But the end, yes the end...
It's just so poor. Probably been written by the ten year old daughter of the director. Could have been a really great movie."
457,The ending of the movie is a WWE championship unrealistic.
458,I have only ever walked out of 2 films. This being the 2nd!I found the start promising but sadly it just got worse and worse. At the point they decided to go to Grandma's house instead of the nearest Police Station I walked.I love a Cheesy switch your brain off kind of film but this wasn't that at all. I honestly think they thought they were making a serious tense thriller. None of the characters were likeable and the script was absolute toilet.If Fat Russel Crowe is that hard up for money can't we just Crowd Fund for him and save us all the time wasted!
459,"A struggling mom on the surface, a vile and self-centered woman at her own breaking point, just happens to cross paths with someone far more over the edge than her. The film's ultimatum forces viewers to choose between an inherently terrible person and a murderer.During the second act it is revealed our protagonist may have even more hidden secrets: She was likely promiscuous during marriage and her separated husband may not be the evil guy initially portrayed in the first act.If it weren't for a truly innocent child being entangled into this dark web of revenge and justice, viewers would almost certainly be empathizing with ""The Man"" (the only identity given to the role of Russell Crowe's character by the filmmaker).For viewers, ambiguity on exact personal details, and absence of the husband as a character in the film's entire second half, are seemingly the only tactics deployed to prevent swaying empathy even further away from our protagonist.Overall, this movie that has its moments in fast-paced action sequences, but fails to create any sort of relatability or laudation for it's characters."
460,"No, not what you think. This was our first theater movie in the new COVID era. There wasn't much on, but we needed theater popcorn. So, this was our movie. 30 minutes in, we couldn't handle it anymore. Out we walked in my fiancé's and my first movie walkout. Bucket list item checked.This movie was horrible. All except for Russell Crowe's acting. Hence the 3 stars. Without him....0 stars. It started off barely plausible, and it devolved into a complete mess. This was a sacrificial lamb for the studio and the theaters. Bring on Tenet...SOON! PLEASE!"
461,"A lot more entertaining than I expected. Russell Crowe is intense as hell, though probably could have done with a trip to the gym beforehand"
462,"If you have time to waste and 12 years old boy brain than watch this movie
I need my 15 bucks back."
463,"SCARY & INTENSE! Acting was very good. I would think anyone that sees this movie will think twice before honking their horn, flipping someone off, or yelling at someone that angers them while driving because you never know, the person you're going off on, may be having a worse day than yourself. Talk less, smile more, and be kind to others, especially while driving!"
464,"Loved this movie. Crowe was amazing, absolutely riddled with rage the whole film. Highly recommended giving it a try."
465,"Surprisingly enough, Russell Crowe is actually quite creepy in this. Although it is a little bit over-the-top, what with the violence, the gore and the illogical thinking oh, it's actually not that bad of him and spooky and how real a situation like this could possibly happen to any of us. I liked it, it's worth your time and I think that Russell Crowe will surprise you."
466,"My friend was recommending me this movie called Unhinged with Russell Crowe telling me it's like Falling Down with Michael Douglas but more on like on steroids, Russell Crowe was really intense in this movie he put on a little weight with a beard and looks like a deranged John Goodman, it's very fast paced non stop action and a lot of intense peril I strongly recommend that you check out this movie it was on the wow-factor in my case so check it out and you will thank me later."
467,"Ever since I heard of the film and watched the trailer, I knew it was all I needed to see right now: a new big action movie. Unhinged was just that. Having finished it minutes ago on Zee Plex (glad they brought it to India), I found it thrilling, captivating, fast-paced and also shorter than I'd expected. Filled with adrenaline-fueled action sequences and never-ending tension, it's just the kind of film I prefer watching a lot.Unhinged skips a lot of character commentary and development, allowing us to get fully immersed into the action: which is just right for a film of this type. Just try picturing a road rage action thriller without melodrama or character commentary and this film is it. It has got enough car chases and crashes to make you jump from your seat, and also has moments where you can feel uncomfortable. The director has extracted brilliant performances from a limited cast and directed the film efficiently. Cinematography is also spot-on and the soundtrack (especially the ending one) is splendid.It's been months of sitting home without going to the movies. Unhinged is for anyone who enjoys action thrillers. Sure, it doesn't allow you to know the characters fully, but that's the reason it truly works; it manages to make you decide who to root for and who not to, even when you know you don't know them fully. That's one of the many positives of Unhinged."
468,"This is a most see movie..
I cant say much negative about it..
i recommend it"
469,"Russell Crowe is brilliant as always. Cant say i felt sorry for the divorce lawyer guy. Should have just given a courtesy honk I suppose. Didnt like the part where he went after the son, that was just not okay. Cooper would have been more a believeable character if he didnt go after the kid."
470,"Started out great despite the typical dysfunctional American family situation. No wonder Biden got elected.
Quickly degenerated into stupidity, overblown nonesense and a typical formulaic catch phrase punchline.
Not even Russell could save it.
America; you are doomed."
471,"Considering that a great percentage of this movie revolves around our villain (Crowe) using a strangers mobile phone to wreak his mayhem, has the writer/director considered that a PASSWORD or thumbprint (or face recognition) is USUALLY needed to ... er... ACCESS the phone and it's contents?
Shame really because it's otherwise a high-octane thriller with some awesome effects.
Deaths, car smashes galore (some very graphic ones) abound. Crowe is dark, brooding and of course, psychotic and in total control of the chaos although I couldn't believe how fat he is now, or maybe he hasn't lost the weight he piled on for his role as Roger Ayles in the excellent recent mini series?
Yes, it's gripping, but what about that phone?
She honked yes, yes, but she should have passworded the phone!! Oops!!"
472,But they never caught the guy. He wiped out my entire contact list. It was sad.
473,"Though the public is eager for new cinema, silent during the lockdown due to coronavirus, this recent release, UNHINGED, is hardly the type of 'escape from reality' that most seek from the movies. With tension high and temperaments fragile, this story visualizes the extremes of hate and violence and rage and vengeance that are at the narrowing periphery of our view of the current world situation.The story, by Carl Ellsworth, is directed with near intolerable propulsive energy by Derrick Borte and cast is excellent. The concept is that of the effect of rage on several characters. An anxious but thoughtless young mother, Rachel, (Caren Pistorius) is having a rough day as she drives her son Kyle (Gabriel Batemen) to school. As she hurriedly honks at a paused vehicle driven by an unstable man (Russell Crowe), she ignites the man's rage and from that point on the story is one of the man's vengeance to make her 'apologize' for her discourtesy - a diatribe that includes murdering and torturing Rachel's family ties and friends. The manner in which the gruesome chase ends is best left to each viewer to discover.Russell Crowe invests his performance with venomous authority, both in physical girth and in manner of speaking. He epitomizes road rage and its consequences in a manner that make this well created film almost unbearable to watch. Given our current milieu this extreme form of response is all too credible - and perhaps the film serves as a warning of just how grim the uncontrolled anger can be!"
474,"Was the movie at times predictable?? Yes. So are other movies. Do you find yourself talking to the lead character sometimes because of a less than sane choice she made?? Yes. Just like you do in horror movies. But I enjoyed this movie and It had me tense at times. Russel Crowe made a pretty good guy who just lost his fecal matter I would recommend seeing it. And it even teaches you a life lesson....."" courtesy tap"" people!"
475,Very exciting movie kept me at the edge of my seat! good acting and very suspenseful!
476,"He CRAAAZZZZZYYYYYYY! This is a must see. Toward I was hoping he killed her. I did not like her entitled, rude privileged a$$."
477,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie, but has a lot of scenes that do not seem realistic :-("
478,Here's your courtesy call...loved how they used this 2 liner in movie
479,"Russell Crowe has to have created one of the most repellent characters in recent memory in this aptly titled film.We never fully learn the motivation for the unnamed, pill-popping, obese rage-a-oholic for being so angry at the world. Clearly, the unhinged protagonist is there for a pretext for a non-stop action film.On the receiving end of the man's rage is Rachel, who is also having a bad day. In her case, however, she stoically resolves to make the best of things and to attempt to fulfill her main task of getting her son Kyle to school and to meeting with her attorney friend.The major shortcoming of the film is that it is far too unpleasant. At one moment, Rachel feels that she must exit the vehicle in order to vomit. That act was credibly motivated by the nauseating conduct of her nemesis.The film was technically competent with the action-packed chase scenes, some of which recalled the techniques used in such classics as ""The French Connection."" However, the final effect of the film offered little in the way of redeeming values other than the momentary triumph of the human spirit over evil."
480,"Just don't worry about the plot holes, and enjoy the movie for what it is. Simple, straightforward movie about road rage. Crowe and Pistorius are quite watchable."
481,"This was an incredible psychological thriller of a film that I am glad I watched. Though there's nothing particularly special about it it's definitely a must watch within the evening hours. My heart raced as I sat on the edge of my seat in the finale. The action sequences throughout made up for the slow times as the unhinged man races through the city to teach Rachel a lesson about courtesy. The biggest negative I had with the film was the car crash endings. They seemed a little far-fetched with vehicles being run over, or flipped, too easily. However, it didn't take away from the film too much.Overall, a good movie that can be watched at least once with enjoyment. Russell Crowe did a great job of being an unstable man and bringing the fear to life with his raspy voice and his deathly, not a care in the world stare. Being a little more courteous to those around you as you never know what they are going through should be the biggest takeaway of the movie."
482,"You can't get enough of russell crowe .
Everything he does is a masterpiece..
And even if he is not fit this just worked perfectly for him in this role .. highly recommended .. great events and came together perfectly"
483,The only thing that is probably unhinged are the hinges on Russell Crowe's refrigerator.
484,"This was a good movie, I wasn't going to bother considering the bad reviews. But I enjoyed it a lot..."
485,Definitely 1 of my top movies for this year.Russel Crowe showcases a different kind of rage in this one. A very entertaining movie to watch from start to finish..

487,It is like Michael Douglas in Fallen Down in cars. Crowe is pure evil. The fleeing Mum is annoying and the worst driver ever. Good movie and had me on the edge of my seat all throughout.
488,All the actors were good in this Film even the unknown ones it was a great story played by a good Actor reviews on this site these days are getting more and more moronic as each day and new Film is reviewed it must be the Lockdowns sending all the reviewers doolally thinking about it it was happening before the Lockdowns perhaps they are giving the Films Bad Reviews because they just can as I said Obtuse & Moronic
489,"Great, epic, thriller!!! Every moment and turn so fun!!! Russell Crowe crushed it!!!! LOVE IT!!!!"
490,"A thriller / action film that essentially brings out a social phenomenon and problem, the pressure of everyday life, the stress and all the anger that accumulates and that in some cases can erupt wildly. In this case on the asphalt. Good idea, and although the whole script of the maniac chase etc is very common, quite a good job was done, good interpretation, direction, enough action and interest in the whole film and relatively short duration so that it does not get boring. A typical example of how with a normal script, but with a very nice and complete job, a good movie can come out and offer to watchers a good time. Totally recommended to everyone, a nice movie of its kind"
491,"Half way through the movie, I'm like I wanna check how high of reviews this movie got. Thinking it's gonna be in high 7s or 8. 6 is ridiculous. This movie is amazing. Russell Is perfect for this role. You don't see A list actors play bad guy specially this amazing. The girl who's the main character very very real. Perfect movie for a rainy day ay home. None stop action, please don't listen to bad reviews. You will not regret this movie"
492,"I mean I know the story was kind of unrealistic, Some scenes were exaggerated.
But boy; the thrill and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat.In summary, if you're not really looking for a great story yet love the suspense. You have to watch this movie."
493,"I never knew russel crow could be such a scary phsyco,i wanted to kill him the moment the movie started,great & exciting movie,really enjoyed every minuete of it!! I dont understand all the negative talk here."
494,I like this movie it was good to watch and learn how other people be scared for their life that why I'm glad I don't drive
495,High octane brutally mad Crowe just out for an afternoon of vengeance!! On the edge of your seat wanting to grab a lifeline to help the initially unsuspecting Woman to Crowe's angst driven Man. It's a smashup man driven to burn everything and everyone. A glimpse of social commentary that feels almost like it could happen to you! Enjoy.
496,Great thriller with non stop suspense. Definitely entertaining to watch.
497,"Really, no where does anyone call the police...they're not even out looking for a guy who just burned down a house with two people in it......he runs a man over in full view of the gas station attendant....still no cops anywhere.......of course Russell Crowe plays this guy cause this is what he's like in real life, a tool.
Remember he bashed a bellhop in NYC with a phone and the guy sued, hopefully he really got a BIG chunk of money in that out of court settlement.. such a shame, he was so good in Gladiator, but now a has been, washed up.....
Like this movie....."
498,A road rage horror thriller. Start to finish interesting and full of thrill and tension. Good acting by russel crowe
499,"I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie. From Russell Crowe's persuasive perfomance as the villain to the exciting car chases , the movie really keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. I highly recommand this movie for a good thrill and it will definelty make you think twice before beeping your horn at someone . 8/10"
500,"If ""Gladiator"" was is this physical shape , he wouldn't even have survived round one"
501,One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Russel Crowe got really fat.
502,"Russell Crowe has let himself go in more ways than one. Porky and out of shape. Crowe's physique is long gone from the days of his Oscar winning turn in Gladiator.This is a laughably bad, cheap B movie. Essentially an exploitation movie that strives to be more respectable Grindhouse as it has an Oscar winner in it.Crowe is Tom Cooper, the unhinged man who has already killed his ex wife and her new partner when the movie begins.When under pressure single mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) is taking her son to school and is late due to traffic. Rachel clashes with Cooper when she repeated honks him when the traffic lights go green.Cooper wants an apology and is upset when he does not receive a sincere one from Rachel. So he decides to stalk her and make her life hell by stealing her mobile phone and going after her friends and family.The makers want to make a statement about the growing problems of road rage. This is really a tawdry violent thriller which insults the viewer's intelligence.No one calls the cops. A man gets run over outside a petrol station and the cashier was aware that Rachel felt afraid. They would have CCTV footage of Cooper.Rachel's friend a divorce lawyer is beaten up and later killed in a packed diner. No one rings the police while it was happening.Rachel is chased all over the place, there are spectacular crashes but no police cars are about.What really takes the biscuit. How far was her son's school. In the next city?"
503,"I don't know if it is good or not?
But i learned 2 important things
1- don't us horn
2- don't eat too much cuz don't be like Russell Crowe"
504,I wouldn't advise anyone to watch this. The only good thing is that it's short.
505,"If not for Russell Crowe, i wouldnt even give this 2 stars. Suspense okay but unrealistic."
506,Please don't watch this. Awful!!! Why do they make movies like this??? Nothing more to say. Just don't
507,"After 20 minute it was abundantly clear what we're dealing with here. I watched it till the end just for the sake of my sadomasochism, I guess. There's no plot at all. Just screaming and cursing and violence. The executives don't even care anymore. Anything goes. Maybe it just doesn't make sense to put on anything good the screen this times, when there's no way to watch it in the movie theater... Another one just below any decent level. Russel what the hell?! It's not you league! Have some respect! 2/10 only (!) for your good performance."
508,"Very bad script, acting..
Just can't believe Russel accepted this roll
There is hour and half that I would never see again in my life
Terrible"
509,"This would never happen today. There would be 10,000 videos of this whack in 15 minutes and he'd be arrested.Also,.... this is why I have a 9mm Ruger in my car.Only giving it 5 stars for Crow cuz he's just awesome."
510,"Worse time to watch, so confuse about this movie and the idead of director"
511,What was the right choice? to say nothing when a car ran a red light and almost ran into your car? what was the idea of this ****??? well yes people are more nerves in traffic and of course it's not good to shout at each other and to rage at others but! we are people with tongues! we can talk! we should talk instead of getting anger. the end of the movie was the worst I've ever seen!
512,"Each point was positive for the killer, no police, no one can stop him in the restaurant....etc moving in the city confidant as no police, and no 911, pushing her car in the traffic, the people are blind, she call the police with her son by waving hands, she didn't use the car beeb that it was the reason for all this problems 🤣 I watched this movie because i like Russell Crowe,shame👎🏻"
513,"Cannot make any sense out the decisions she made. To be honest her driving was terrible yet caused yes she had an issue with the other chracaters driving..
40 minutes in and I wanted her to die because she the the opposite of what any normal person would do. Crowes character is causing murder and mayhem in front of people constantly and not a sign of the police being called."
514,"This reminds me of the classic films of this genre such as Falling Down & Changing Lanes. Russell Crowe (the Man) is as good as ever. It paints him as the villian but I do not think the protagonist Rachael (Caren Pistorius) is all innocent in this film as she had a bout of road rage & is too proud to apologise. I could imagine that One Republic song ""Apologise"" playing at that moment. This is the catalyst for everything that happens thereafter. One might refer to her as the Karen character that is full of rage and entitlement but she has tried her antics with the wrong guy.Some might suggest Rachel deserves some retribution but the Man took this to the most psychotic level. Who on earth leaves their phone unlocked these days as Rachael does so any Tom, Dick or Harry can steal and access All her details?! It makes for good plot convenience.This film is thrilling but it only works if you leave out all rational thinking/decision making. At least the ending shows some character development that may have made this film null and void."
515,"A lot of things make no sense and the script is bad, really bad"
516,"Enough with the one star reviews. I gave it a 7 as 7 is watchable for entertainment when bored as heck.
Crowe made it watchable with his acting, and much in case because it was dam entertaining watching a John Goodman bad guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣Dam he got fat!"
517,"I don't know if Russell is wearing a fat suit or he let himself go, but good lord, he looks like Goodman in this movie! Now a review of this movie, it's decent, and has its moments. A little predictable, but could have been better. If I had described this movie in 1 word, it would be, 'meh'"
518,"This movie was good. Usually I'm the one who says don't believe good ratings, but this time I'm the other side. :) Don't believe bad ratings. In the thriller, I look for the tension that this film indeed had. I also appreciate the brevity of the film. The premise that makes road rage happen is totally stupid, but everything else is fine. Great sound and great Crow. Some comments have said that the film was unrealistic - were the Avengers realistic? Or Spiderman? :) Anyway, a pretty good movie."
519,"Just utter nonsense in all honesty.
Absolutely nothing in this makes sense and covers more tropes than any film i've seen i think.
I like Russell Crowe as an actor, he's been in some excellent films so this is a real disappointment.
He kills the guy at the petrol station, but the attendant didn't phone the Police? He murders in cold blood the protagonists 'friend' in the cafe and no one phones the Police, but it ends up on the News...
Every time she phones them, the Police are busy dealing with carnage that he's left behind and can't spare any units. Add to the fact of course she can't find her phone, but then loses it to Crowe somehow.
Then her big plan to 'catch' him at her Mum's house... She was putting a lot in the hands of fate on that one. What if he didn't park right outside the house? How was she going to ram him?? How did he find the house so quickly?? How did he know she was going to a house?? Why didn't he speed on once he'd corrected his overshoot and taken the same turn as her??. If it was all an enclosed cul de sac why didn't he sit at the main junction for 10 minutes and see if she was just doing a loop of the thing before shooting off down the 'highway'??
It was just all too scripted, people done stupid things because it fitted the plot, things ffell into his hands, because it suited the plot. It was all forced and far too convenient how things played out for Crowe in this i'm afraid to say.
If you want something to just sit back and watch and not have to engage in it mentally in any way, then this might suit you. if however you want to be awake while watching a film, find something else."
520,I wanted to like this movie but it was so bad. The main character is so unlikeable from the go that it's very difficult to feel any empathy in the story and then that one-liner - what a gaff. The people comparing this to Falling Down are doing a disservice to an amazing classic. Not to mention there are 8.5 minutes of end credits just to get this up to 1.5 hours. This falls short in every way.
521,"I kinda liked this... the female lead kept making dumb choices, otherwise maybe they wouldn't know how to move the plot along. So I kept having to force myself not to think about that in order to keep watching. Definitely got the adrenaline going, though! Russell Crowe made a great villain - I understand he's probably not too nice a person in actuality, sadly, though."
522,"Excellent theme, very poorly executed, absolutely unreal, with absurd situations, an implausible script"
523,"This is the most senseless movie, and in the usual circumstance I will not not even consider reviewing it, but only because of Russell Crowe starting. Something I was asking throughout the movie why she kept driving? or why on earth you will go and hide at home and wait for the most dangerous psycho instead of just take your sun and go to the police or even the nearest starbucks... it is just very stupid movie.."
524,"There were so many contradictions and weaknesses and unrealistic things in this movie that makes it a new genre I think , so congrats guys"
525,I usually rate a very good movie as 7. One minus is that she must be killed at the end instead of killing off the guy. I understand the guy's rage very well and I hoped she be killed some way or another while watching. There are so many angry men and women out there. I totally agree and the film grabbed a very good point of view. Worth watching.
526,"I dont know how he got this rate
Overall stupid
Bad story
Nonsense in all decisions"
527,"Quite intense, plot a bit far fetched for no courtesy tap."
528,Movie was good overall but the ending of the movie wss a bit to over dramatic and a bit unrealistic. Trouble was it wss a bit to false.
529,"Russel Crowe smashed this out the park, perfect acting from the beginning to the end. The movie was perfect up until 1 hour & 15 minutes in, the last bit. That woman did not explain to her son what she had done was selfish, dangerous and immature. She refused to even agree to disagree to the man who explained his situation politely, sad reality in today's world. It took her son on his own at the end to state ""good choice"" when she stopped herself from hitting the horn in anger. She will be the Victim in this story for the rest of her life, never admitting to her bad judgement (sound familiar?)"
530,"Could have been a very good movie but the script is just too bad. Chase scenes are thrilling from time to time, but I cannot understand why she chose to run instead of many other ways she could have avoided being subject to such rage. Just simply she could have pulled in front of a police station !"
531,"Great actor, good actors, and great idea were lost in translation. Unhinged is the proper title. So sad."
532,"The worst movie that probably Russel Crowe acts.......he had a tension to accumulate weight very early on but this is ourage and people close to him should take care for helth reasons....the movie is so unrealistic that can be compared only with another flop.....""Kidnap"" with Halle Berry"
533,I love the drama and suspense but the choices the writer made were very unrealistic. The events would not have happened that way. Great concept though.
534,"That's what you get for corrupting the foundations of society - single egoistic desperate 'mums' in a worthless vegetative state, scared cowards as 'children', sad excuses for human beings indeed. Oh, and their almost masochistic 'no to guns' - makes it even worse. Cool content. Execution is okay, nothing stellar. Old Russ was intense. It's still a B-movie, don't get your hopes up, don't expect any degree of realism as well, it's geared toward..special demographic. CGI low speed chases were ridiculous. Decent gore barely earns it honest 4/10.
PS. The only driving you do with your check engine light on is a short one to your service station, my dear 'liberal' friends (as a bonus you'll get to spend some of your free youtube money and support local peasantry, so you can virtue signal about that with your 1.5k$ phone). Get that into your brain boxes, yaaas."
535,"First of all It was so bad to have a bad actresss with an amazing actor ,she have a pocker face ,no emotions in her face ,we were laughing on her nonsense reaction all the movie
The movie byitself is not that smart and a bit boring"
536,"First, the movie starts strong and looks great for the first 10 minutes. Then, when you see a 400 pounds version of Russell Crowe on a truck, it starts to sink by itself. Don't get me wrong, it's a good violent film but too simplistic. You know what is going to happen next easily. Last, not sure where is the overweight of Russell comes from, but looks like Hollywood is not going to take him more seriously as a lead role actor. He looks pretty bad during action scenes. Anyway, just a violent thriller to spend a good time and forget in a few hours."
537,"Five for crowe. I start hating the movie after first few minutes. She is so careless, dumb that I couldn't really feel for her sorrow. She isn't sincere with her job, don't know about best routes for avoiding traffic, and takes her son to school late frequently. And the choices she made through out the film!! Horrible. She could've immediately drove to a police station after picking up his son. Most importantly she took a name for Tom to kill..... Lots of plot holes."
538,"The script itself is rediculous, and the preposterous choices made by the characters throughout the film degrade some good acting to leave a film that is extremely disappointing to say the least."
539,"Russell Crowe is great as always, but if someone like this stole your phone wouldn't the first thing you did would be to call up the provider and cut off the account? Lots of action but the substance is somewhat lacking."
540,"Russell is great as bloated old man terrorizing a woman and child on the road for no reason. Give it a look if able, certainly not worse out there and of its genre."
541,This movie is utterly ridiculous but I'm still entertained. Sure you can question peoples actions during one of these type movies. Or just sit back and enjoy a tense entertaining movie that's under 1hr20 .
542,"One of the dumbest films i have ever watched in my life ! , nothing makes sense , all people are dumbs , the police is usless and not existing !"
543,"I liked the movie, it was suspenseful and partially unpredictable (apart from the obvious use of the scissors). But the ending, where she choses not to honk, is not a mature conclusion to this movie: a bit on the nose and anticlimactic (teaching us to be polite!!). Wouldn't it have been better if we didn't see her finding the scissors in the first place? Or the movie ends simply with the death of the villain?"
544,"Russell Crowe is a good crazy guy although the writing is a bit week and the suspense seems to be weak .
Some of the violence is brutal some scenes lack.ok for a free movie"
545,"I'll be brief. Reviewers either love or hate this movie. Why? Simple. Plot=predictable. Crowe=AWESOME. I hate to see him so large, and I hope he gets surgery or something, but he redeems the thinly manufactured plot to make this a thoroughly entertaining film. Watch it for him, if nothing else. Oh, and young Justin Bateman's performance as Kyle is notable, as well."
546,I have seen some Russell Crowe movies and LOVED them. Saw this and FREAKED out at his amazing acting skills. I'm guessing by how many drugs he took must have been hooked high.
547,Ignore the criticism except for the main woman shes dumb and makes stupid choices from the geico. Crowe went all the way for this movie fits perfect for a mad psychopath. First scene starts out in the rain where it shows how destructive he is after his divorce.
548,"A prerequisite for ""distracted driving"" not to mention Road Rage."
549,"Most people seem to agree that the main character, Rachel, is terrible and this entire movie would've been avoided had she done 2 simple things: 1) Apologized at the beginning, and 2) Lock her phone.The entire movie I had no sympathy for her at all. And the guy chasing her basically achieved everything he set out to do, including getting himself killed. He won in every sense of the word. 1) He taught her a lesson, exactly as he said he would, 2) He killed a bunch of people along the way, and 3) He got himself killed. Win-Win-Win.I enjoyed the movie for what it was, and Russell Crowe's acting is ON-POINT."
550,"A very good watch!! Never a dull minute..! A few of them moments where your screaming at the tv!! But a good thriller, jumpy, creepy and full of violence ""unhinged"" perfectly named!!"
551,"I learned my lesson this movie is a must see, after watching this no more road raging for me"
552,"Just watched this movie and I enjoyed it. Plenty of action Crowe was great in his part. Reviewers say unrealistic, is a movie about a Spider-Man or a Batman realistic it's a movie just enjoy it. I say give it a watch."
553,"First off, ignore anything less than 8 stars. I watched the trailer which looked brilliant and then I read the reviews and was unsure as to watching it. Dont always take reviews as gospel. 99% of the time I wont watch a movie based on bad reviews but this has shown me I was wrong and we need to run with our instincts sometimes too. I love edge of your seat thrillers and it's rare I find one I havnt seen. And those giving it a 1 star are on a different planet altogether! Watched this with my wife tonight and we could barely breath the whole way through. Stressful is an understatement. Crowe is brilliant. A complete nut job! If you love movies like 911 with Halle Berry you will love this. A rollercoaster from start to finish. Dont read any more reviews. Watch the movie. You wont regret it."
554,The bad guy should have won.......at the end it ends the most cliched way ever.....scissors to the eye....yeah that pathetic
555,"Russell Crowe might not be a mystical creature or a hellish devil monster.. but wow was this stressful and impactful. Maybe thinking this is something that could easily happen amplifies the effect.
His lines are brief and memorable, as well as a scary performance that is perfect. The other leads are also great at their ""simplified"" roles! The movie is also 1 hour and 30 minutes. Pretty concise and fast paced throughout it's duration. There is almost no wasted space in this well-packed story. Also, there is a meaningful message, both good and bad.An easy recommendation to anyone that likes this kind of films, and a great visual representation of why people shouldn't stop being people no matter how pressed for time or stressed they are.. we never know how bad someone's day is."
556,"Don't waste your time watching this really stupid movie...I stop it after 20min of watching.
Bad really bad"
557,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie , it has decent acting and enough action to whet anyone's appetite . Russell Crowe played an outstanding part and was truly convincing as a level-headed psychopath . The rest of the cast were exceptionally good , my wife and I both recommend this movie if you're stuck one dreary afternoon , it's an eye opener ."
558,"Duel + Falling Down + doses of Speed and Saw = UnhingedThe script, written by Carl Ellsworth (writer of Red Eye, one of my all time favorite movies), is very intelligent and delivers on non-stop intensity. Speaking of which, the latter is also largely thanks to Russell Crowe, who is BEYOND terrifying in this. Great performances from Pistorius and Bateman as well. Credit to stunt work and cinematography too!Highly recommend seeing this if you can! You won't regret it!"
559,"Russell Crowe is the perfect actor for this character. Intimidating, bad tempered and aggressive. Caren Pistorius is a fisty mum. Gripping story, lots of car chasing scenes, psychological thriller. Overall great acting, good movie. 7"
560,"Edge of your seat thriller that successfully entertains.The over-weight Russell Crowe bad guy works well, his 'unhinged' body adds to his menacing presence. When he throws his weight around it's also believable.A solid thriller that looks great and feels quality. Performances are convincing and I was hooked to the end."
561,"And Russel doing a good jobEntertaining!If your not going too deep thinking about the movie- and just enjoy it, this movie is worth watching.He is angry. Oh yeah he is"
562,Totally unexpected. Really twisted and heart pounding. Thought the acting was strong.
563,"Didnt have any big expections of this movie -and I still Think Its hard to decide what I think about it. Dumb, but also brilliant.
Russell Crowe does a great job as the road rage driver. They could have dugged deeper in his back story, and why he does these things...I like how they shows all typical people in traffic, and how reckless most of them really are - just as it is irl! And how vunerable you are when all your information is leaked thru example your electronic devices (contacts, photos, calenders, passwords, map position etc).Some logical gaps, as always, but still - When you see all those small ordinary things and mix it up with a chubby anger brilliant actor as Russell, you will get a decent thriller..."
564,I was waiting a long time to see this movie and I'm so glad I got to see it today on the big screen. This movie was very intense and the acting and cinematography was great. I loved this movie and I highly recommend it.
565,"So when you collide Duel and Falling Down you
end up with Fast paced thriller that Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Ignore all the negative reviews yes the plot is full of holes and you will be screaming at the screen for the main characters to do things differently, there is non stop carnage for the last hour which is great fun. Russell Crowe is great as the deranged bad guy looking like he's really piled on the pounds, it reminded me of Stallone in Copland. It won't win any awards but it's definitely the sort of movie I'd happily watch again sometime. Go into it with low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised"
566,"Crowe makes such a good bad guy, i love it when your typical good guy role goes bad. great performance on an action packed ride. some of the other actors were poor but if you focus on crowe it will be ok. great flick"
567,"It seems some reviewers, both professional and amateur, have forgotten that some films can be created simply to entertain. These days it seems preaching the new religion is all that's worthy of acclaim. As this film doesn't do that--indeed, a woman is punched in the face a few times by a hulking behemoth of a man (sin and shame!)--it's to be labeled 'nasty' and 'vile'.Of course, that's exactly how the antagonist was supposed to come across--nasty and vile. Those are the very characteristics that lend credence to the idea that he's a dangerous, demented, and despicable individual. Perhaps he should have gotten down on bended knee and apologised for his toxic masculinity, his whiteness, and his privilege, for that would have given us quite the villain indeed.Anyway, as thin and paint-by-the-numbers as the plot is, I found myself not wanting to look away, even as I reached for a chocolate and this is a very rare occurrence in this day and age for a film. For a movie to have me glued to it for its entire runtime something entertaining must be going on. And it is. It's entertaining, fast-paced, and enthralling. It's neither Shakespeare nor is it Robin DiAngelo (thankfully), and it doesn't pretend to be. It's just a bloody satisfying way to spend 80 minutes or so if watching a movie is something you feel inclined to do.Jolly good, clean fun. Consider this your courtesy tap (I can do in-jokes)."
568,"It's actually a pretty good thriller and Russell Crowe in his overweight is good as the bad guy.
Moral of the story is ""don't curse at other drivers...""
I don't think that a similar story has ever been told before. The film keeps you on edge most throughout. I enjoyed it, but it won't be classified as classic"
569,"I had low expectations going in and that's pretty much what I got.These types of films are hard to make believable and you will always find holes. Why didn't she just go to the police? or at least phone them. When did RCs character have time to plant a mobile phone, tape a ipad under the seat etc. Also, his character didn't make smart choices but acted on pure rage which makes the planting of phones highly improbable. Not sure how he got so much information from a mobile phone (conversation with lawyer was odd). Just silly stuff.So, suspend your belief and it's a bit of an old fashioned ride similar movies in the early 2000s like Joy Ride and Blacktop. Not a mind twister just entertainment and I'll probably forget it after this. There was a mismatch between Russel Crowe and Caren Pistorias. She seemed too light weight to take this role on and RC was way over the top. At times you could hear him wheezing carrying all that extra weight. Not a huge fan of RC but he did well and his commanding voice is instantly recognisable. The story was let down by the script and direction could have been tighter. I just didn't care about the characters enough.For mindless entertainment without thinking too hard it's a 4 from me."
570,"Get's 5 stars ,just because of my big respect for the past achievements of Russell Crow...This film really put him down, not sure if he will be able to recover...
Not the worst movie, that I've ever seen; but extremely unrealistic, main character is very unlikable and stupid...One redeeming quality is the son...the only one well balanced and clear headed individual in all film...unfortunately no one is ever listened to him)
Anyhow, a film to watch ,just in case of deadly boredom and unavailability of anything better..."
571,"Unhinged has a simple premise, but something everyone can relate to on some level, doesn't have to be traffic related.Someone driving, constantly looking back and not paying attention to the road's uneasy to watch and makes me anxious and apprehensive. Making it hard to sympathize with Rachel already, then for her to react that way to a stranger in that situation's just asking for it. Your actions have ""bloody"" consequences. You have no idea what state that person's in. If they're unstable, you bite the bullet and avoid ever seeing them again. I do like her fight though. Crowe plays a top-notch villain, but him as the good guy makes for a better film. Though I'm still kinda on his side, heh. His characterization's also too ""thin."""
572,"Russel Crowe did a decent job portraying a dude that just cant take it anymore.
The script could have easily been knocked out on a Sunday afternoon. was the fortnite reference meant to bring in a younger demographic..?
overall a real waste, with a paint by numbers script, that couldn't be saved by a great actor."
573,"Unhinged is watchable, but its just chock full of those lead character (victim) bad decisions, so it can be a frustrting movie to watch in those moments as you are rolling your eyes all the time.Started out good, but the decisions complile one after another to steal most of the excitment in this film. I am guesing most of the good writers have migrated to television, just a guess."
574,"So a maniac is after the female character at a red light where he kept reverse and ramp-up to her car and she just sits there and then runs away from him, and all the people on the roads, is this how America is now? What happened if she doesn't move her car? The lawyer was killed at a cafe shop and all the people there did not do anything about it. All of the nonsense makes the movie irrational and the ideal behind it is meaningless. I hope America and American never get this way ideally or realistically, to the sick director, you can go serve Hitler.!"
575,"There should be a law prohibiting such movies, they aren't just a fiction but a nonsense that makes all US look like a bunch of imbeciles.
and ridiculous moral at the end - be vegetables.
how deep has fallen Russell Crowe, an Oscar winner."
576,"We actually thought should be in the comedy section. Thought provoking really on ""what would I do"" in the same situation. Filled in time in this crazy times."
577,"This is a bit of a car chase movie with a linear and uninteresting storyline. If you read the synopsis you know everything about the movie.There are no surprises - nothing to get you thinking about what happens next - or anything of any particular interest. Some of the choices the characters make are just stupid - but then this isn't a film that requires much intelligence on any part.The acting is ok - not there there is too much to the characters.This is one to watch if it happens to be on TV and there is nothing else worth watching. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
578,"How did Rassel Crowe get himself to such horrible movie?
it is even not class B films, it is much worse!"
579,What were the people involved in this movie thinking? What happened to Russel Crowe's career? Why does he look like a crossover between Fred Flintstone and Homer Simpson?.
580,"Meaning no social comments, or ways to symphatize with the antagonist who snaps.Lots of phones and devices, and a guy that kills a lot of people at random. Throw in a couple of car chases and a fat Maximus Deredius trying to look evil, and there you have it."
581,"It's soo soo sad to see a legend like Russel Crowe fall that low!! I'm literally heart broken for you Russel!!it was too tough to stay in the theatre watching this weak piece of work, i just stayed for the love of russel and to have a full picture of the movie so i can rate it fairly,all the time i have had but one question in my whole soul,,, what possibly could convince the legendary and very brilliant actor (Russel Crowe) to put him self in the embarrassment !!, it's waaay beneath him, and if you don't get my point, just watch one of these movies, a beautiful mind, Les Misérables, The Next Three Daysnot much to say, it's just a typical a trying to be thriller movie, it might entertain too many people specially those who don't know who is russel crowe and don't care about anything,"
582,...for this movie. That's the biggest take away from this really movie bad movie.
583,"I cant remember have i rated some movie so low. This was horrible, main character was so stupid. Wasted my time."
584,"After seeing the trailer, I was really looking forward to this...it looked right up my street.But it just didn't deliver.OK, the film looks great, sounds great and the acting, for the most part, is on point. But it lacks substance. Relying on the same old 'stalker' tropes. Characters make weird decisions that nobody would make in the real world. It was more like an hour's worth of content from an episode of a cop show, that was stretched into a feature-length film.I found myself mg taken out of the movie by the unrealistic things I was seeing. Cars crashing and killing people, when they clearly have enough time to slow down, or swerve at least. A lunatic man going around killing people like crazy and no police can seem to apprehend him, even though they have his plates, his picture and tons of mobile phone footage...and to top it off - HE ISN'T EVEN HIDING!I struggled to watch this to the end, because i feel it fizzled out after 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, it was action-packed throughout...but it's all action with no substance. Didn't want to root for either the protagonist, or the antagonist...both were under-developed and unlikeable.Half the characters aren't even important to the story and they are only there so Crowe has someone to kill.Had potential...but sadly didn't deliver."
585,"This is one of those washed up former A list actor movies.You know, the kind whose budget goes to the former star for a week's worth of work and the rest of the movie is made cheaply. The only saving grace is that at least this is made in North America, instead of Eastern Europe. Crowe will surely join that camp soon.The script is written by a child. The direction is the close-up cheaply made style.Crowe, with his hillbilly accent, is bloated and walks through his role.It's a sad sad demise for a once good actor. The consolation is that he's barely in the movie."
586,"The only thing worthwhile in the film is Russell's acting, the others a disaster, a pity because the theme was promising"
587,"Realistically, how many people get out of their car leaving their cellphone behind in real life (27mins)?! That is where I thought the plot went downhill!!!!"
588,"Lame writing.. waste of a good actor.. russel crowe used to be a good actor, extreme non sense.."
589,So bad. The acting. The story. The predictability. Russell put on all that weight with no hope of an award. It's bad. Don't believe the high reviews - they trying to bump it up.
590,"Along with everything else one would expect from a Crowe led film. I realise that it's difficult to surpass A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator but what on earth compelled him to agree to this one? The only plausible explanation I can come up with is that, unlike Bale who famously undergoes body transformations in preparation for many of his roles, Crowe simply wanted to justify his previous lack of diet and exercise. The film's script is poor, the heroine annoying, her family not really likeable, and there's a nagging question why this wasn't made into a 12min short. 3 for Crowe being in it, otherwise worse that trash. Unwatchable rather than Unhinged."
591,"I would have been happier if the movie was simple, predictable but enjoyable the same time but no, it was a freaking mess..."
592,"Disclaimer: This is my first reviewNo offense to the actors or all the people who worked hard to put this together, but who green lit this script? This movie is the opposite of Cape Fear. No story, no good setup, holes in every encounter. It's really too bad they wasted all of the hard work for this."
593,"This could have been a really great character based psycho thriller/drama.
It's not though the main reason being that it lacks subtlety COMPLETELY
The whole story basically gets ruined in the first 3 minutes when we watch the antagonist kill his ex and her partner then burn down their house. So going forward we know this is a maniacal, violent murderer. So we actually expect the worst of him from the very beginning. So we know that he will go after the heroine and her son and try to kill them the moment they meet. There isn't any steadily unfolding sinister process as there could be. There is no tension, no shocks no surprises, the complexity of the plot is that of an old arcade game.
One dimensional killing machines worked well in classic horror movies like Friday 13 or Halloween where the murderer was some unstoppable supernatural human monster but this is just a fat, sick, bitter middle aged man we otherwise know almost nothing about only that he is driven not by supernatural powers but ""toxic masculinity""
The whole thing is completely unrealistic, annoying, it comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. What a waste of effort and talent again, Hollywood."
594,"Really scary, and I like scary movies, but somehow sometimes this was a bit to intens, violent and disturbing? But entertainment from the top."
595,Just nothing appealing about this except for Crowe's performance. Predictable and just not entertaining at all. Never a good sign when you have to force yourself to finish the movie. Just bad all around.
596,"Started off intriguing, while there were multiple conspicuous expositions that were uncalled-for at the time, which tried to cover up the upcoming major plot-holes of the movie. This pretty much spoiled all future dilemmas the characters would face. Yes, the exposition was warranted, but it had to be done subtly. This would obviously play a major part of how the movie will progress, so instead of later on when the time comes around to recall the exposition, the audience will instead from the beginning of the movie await the moment the exposition will come into play - awful, ruins the suspense almost entirely.The acting is reasonable, some were awfully bad and the two main protagonists were great. The dialogue is very cringe-worthy and so is the script. There were a lot of social commentary thrown in throughout the movie - most noticeable in the opening credits. The way the movie starts leaves nothing mysterious about the story and eventually just becomes predictable - not boring, but predictable. Even though the suspenseful music tried its best at making it feels suspenseful - it really was not."
597,"I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie even though I was the one who wanted to see it in the first place. The plot is all over the place, what should have happened is: guy kills people, is filmed and seen by everyone. Police arrests him shortly after. Movie length: 3 mins. Instead I had to watch an hour of it before I figured out the police was not going to show up and all my hopes were placed in vain."
598,"Useless price of logic, nothing in this movie represents what would happen I real life... How did this script even get funded"
599,"Russell Crowe should never have accepted such a role, what a pity, it is a thriller more action than thriller where the plot is completely empty, good actors with an empty script, a man gets unnerved in a traffic problem with a woman and because he chases all of her family for no other reason, nothing more empty. Well filmed but disappointing."
