0,"It's not the most expensive movie, or the best plot but honestly this movie gave me flashbacks to the good old days of family adventure movies.
It has adventure, it has love, it has companionship, it has humour and it keeps you wanting to learn more about the world. It makes you feel good.I only wish it were longer and I hope they make a sequel."
1,"It's a lot like zombieland which is probebly one of my favourite films. The main character is not will smith or the rock, it's a skinny nobody. Dylan Obrien is amazing. The film is funny and the action is great. The monsters are also really cool. The dog is a badass. I'd love a sequel. more characters more worldbuilding stuff like that."
2,"Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it's been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.
Dylan O'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg's ""Columbus"", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin's ""Little Rock"") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone's ""Wichita"")... Confusing?
Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot.
It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp & clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game.
Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of ""Boy"" the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.
You may have to suspend belief a bit in a couple scenes... But just remember you are watching a movie with giant frogs and snails and it shouldn't be too difficult. For me it's a 7 but a strong one."
3,"""Monster Problems"" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.The characters are excellent. Dylan O'Brien proves once again that he can be a one-man show, Michael Rooker is great as ""Michael Rooker survival samurai""; and the dog is just fantastic. Other secondary characters also do not fail.The design of the creatures is perfect; and adorably scary. And the main theme of the film, which basically tells the story of a person leaving the suffocating comfort of his hiding place to find something that makes him happy, in the midst of a pandemic of monsters, I think it is something that will touch the sensitivity of many people that now live the dramas of self-isolation.It's the best post-apocalyptic film I've seen in a long time, a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere, and I recommend it to everyone, even the cynics.I give this movie 8 stars out of 10."
4,"I was prepared for another boring to death movie flick, making questioning my taste on movies. I was surprised in a good way.
The movie had it all, great FX, good acting, Monsters, unseen twists, everything i needed for a Saturday night.And most of all, for bad or good, an open ending that leaves room a return (which traditionally will suck).Highly recommended."
5,"This is one of the best recent adventure films. It avoids many clich√©s that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure.Even though the action scenes were sort of predictable, it didn't deter away from getting absorbed into Joel's story and caring what happened to him and the other characters. It had some small lessons in it too, which added to the story.Its a little too adult for young children in my opinion. Young teens though would enjoy it."
6,"Ignore the bad reviews, it's actually a pretty decent movie. Nothing original, however much better than most movies they make nowadays.Dylan O'Brien is very talented and carries the whole film well. This is not Shakespeare, still it's fun and good for a movie night with friends and family."
7,Really enjoyable movie and not as predictable as you'd think. I was surprised how funny and original 'Love and Monsters' was considering the overdone genre but it is an adventure worth taking. If you're looking for a decent weekend flick then I strongly recommend you give it a go.
8,"This movie was fun to watch, the acting wasn't bad at all, CGI was decent.
Compared to Jumanji for example, which I found was a bit too much and overacted, this one is exactly what you would expect, but not too intense and forced.
Looking forward to a sequel."
9,"This movie is a solid piece of entertainment. Good acting, some funny jokes, good CGI & it's got a nice pace. Also quite a few likeable characters in it. Definitely worth the watch."
10,"It's a very entertaining movie. The opening was very funny and it perfectly explained what we are dealing with here. There is some very emotional scenes. The acting in very good. You will love the little girl. It's got adventure, comedy, action and mainly monster so what are you waiting for."
11,"Love and Monsters was a fun film to see and it is actually after a some time a very fun new realease that surved its purpose and goals that it was trying to reach.Story was very inspiring and sweet at same time,it had some emotional moments and some romantic ones that were justified and that didnt felt rushed at any moment.Characters are also very likeable and i was able to root for them during entire runtime expecely towards the Dylan O Brien one,cause he was highlight of a entire film,special effects were also pretty solid and they done a good job to.Love and Monsters was a fun film to see for all families"
12,"An amazing entertaining adventure with scary monsters, intelligent writing, and an inspiring story about the value of friendship and family. All coated with a good sense of humor. Defiantly one of the best movies of 2020. I saw it twice in a row. Highly recommended. And kudos to the dog Boy. He is a protagonist as much as everyone else."
13,"An apocalyptic film without zombies is worth its weight in gold these days.
The monster were kinda silly, but the story, the pace and the character were pretty good.
Filming locations were also great and different from the usual Hollywoodian sameness.
And, Thanks God, there were no ""in your face"" PC proselytism, which was refreshing.
Love and Monsters is the type of a film that a father can watch with his daughter or a mother with her and son and without feeling embarrassed most of the time."
14,"I loved this movie, and if you like cool monsters designs and comedy Zombieland style you will love this movie too, the main character is funny and rest of the cast played their roles really well, the movie takes turns that you don't expect and is overrall awesome."
15,"Its a great movie. So fun and entertaining. Joel is not your typical action hero, He's more like us (and everyday man). But his development throughout the movie is great. One of Dylan's most enjoyable and fun movies. I loved it"
16,"What an awesome movie I loved every minute of it.
I don't want to spoil anything but if you like the journey movies you will love this."
17,"This is your typical family friendly adventure movie. It has a plain, simple plot (and don't try to put it through the ""credibility test"", because it will fail miserably), predictable and cliched. There's not a lot of character development either. It has some humor (not very good), and some heartwarming moments (kinda...). Overall it's entertaining (considering it's intended for kids and teens), but forgettable."
18,I was not expecting much but it was a really good movie.
19,"This is a light-hearted movie and it gives off really good vibes. Don't compare it to other apocalypse and zombie or monster movies because it is kinda different. It is also not predictable as you think, you are gonna be surprised especially in the last half hour ,it will go in a different direction in a very good way. Also it does carry a message and it is not just a pointless fun movie. It is suitable for kids and for family watch, it will be really good if you watch with your family in this quarantine, it will cheer you up and it is really suitable for this time in a good way. I really hope you give it a shot because you won't regret it. And of course who doesn't enjoy watching a movie with Dylan O'Brien in it."
20,"Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Monster Problems"" (aka ""Love and Monsters""). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.And now that I have seen the movie, I must just say: wow!""Monster Problems"" was definitely a wonderful surprise of an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in ""Monster Problems"" was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in ""Monster Problems"", then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how ""Monster Problems"" turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren't given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch ""Monster Problems"", because this movie was great. I was genuinely surprised and entertained with what writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson managed to deliver.My rating of ""Monster Problems"" is a sure eight out of ten stars. This movie deserves a sequel, no question about it."
21,"Good movie to watch on a weekend night when it's cold or rainy outside or you're just stuck in quarantine. Interesting premise, pretty good creature cgi, a main character that becomes much more fleshed out as the movie progresses than he was at the beginning of the movie, lovely side characters and some pretty cool scenery. Straightforward plot with a few surprises and twists along the way, some cliches too. The acting and the screenplay were decent, nothing groundbreaking, but the movie is definitely worth a watch if you're bored!"
22,"Super cute and a good twist on the ""apocalypse"". It kept me interested! Hopefully they will have a sequel cause it deserves it!"
23,"I don't write reviews, so this one will probably kind of suck, but man I loved this movie!! I went into it with little to no expectations and was shocked by just how good I found it. Enough to be added to my list of favorites for sure. The main character - thank god - is actually likeable, unlike so many protagonists before. The romance, despite being integral to the plot, isn't forced or overwhelming. The characters actually respond to traumatic events accordingly instead of brushing it all off like nothing happened (perhaps it could have been done a little better but at the end of the day it's a rather light movie). And perhaps most importantly - it's chock full of super cool monsters, with an adorable canine companion as the cherry on top. Definitely check this out if you get the chance! Warning though: it might be a bit more emotional than you expect (I teared up a bit at one scene, LOL)."
24,"At last at 2020 something good,adventure, entertained happened. I was waiting with hope after i watch the trailer and it is worth it.Happy watching..There should be a sequel. Please make part 2.."
25,Wasn't expecting much. Haven't seen too many good movies this year. But this is quite good. Good action and effects . Recommended
26,"... or hunter gatherers reunited. A very easy film to dissect and ridicule but its heart is in the right place and there is an ecological message amongst the mucous, membranes and slime. If you're happy to paddle in the shallows, toss a very endearing dog a crab stick and be reminded there's no courage without fear you wont be too disappointed unless, that is, you suffer from entomophobia, in which case you may have a few problems with these monsters from the off."
27,"Ok maybe a 4 is too harsh, but it doesn't deserve more than 5 stars that's for sure. It's basic acting, basic plot, no originallity...i know very few good movies have premiered since the pandemic took place but we should not lower our standards..."
28,"Just saying.
10/10,
Michael Booker and Dylan O'Brien were great."
29,Okay this year i know there havent been alot of theatrical releases but this is by far the most fun and fast paced movie ive seen i the theater much less rented the mvie had huge laughs rushes of action and enjoyment the character of the little girl was a riot and i highly recommend seeing it for more reasons then one its also family friendly for the most part
30,"The protagonist just won't shut up. Cringeworthy dialogue delivery. all attempts at humor fail, unoriginal story, boring. You can tell you've seen characters like that in other movies, except the dog.CGI was just good enough but the monsters were terribly underused. The events build up the tension, but they are quickly resolved without any effort, so no real moment of rejoice throughout the movie. They even tried to spice up the story by introducing a villain in the last half hour. Nothing special happens though.Better see something else, unless you are easily amused by generic teen-ish acting, bland characters and a plain story with couple of nice moments here and there. The dog was the only likeable character."
31,This movie is aimed at kids and teens. I'm neither. But the story is boring and predictable. Some of the monsters looked realistic whereas few are bad CGIs. The story rides on the lead character's supposedly innocent and charismatic looks. But the lead character is only innocent. The finale is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while. And I'm pretty sure now the movie's world population will drop from 5% to 0.5%.
32,"Yeah it's all been done before, the unexpected hero, the unexpected tutors. But it just works. It doesn't take itself too serious but the message is. Your life stops when you let fear take over. There will always be monsters out there. Just go out, suffer, learn and be a better person."
33,"Its been a long time since i saw a movie where the scriptwriter cared so much about his script. It remind me films from the 90's. clever plot twists, sentimental but not cheesy moments, metaphorical meanings and all this on a teenager monster movie!!!! well done."
34,"I have no idea what I just saw.
Is this supposed to be funny ? A bit scary maybe ?
I guess it's a movie for kids but it's absurd and vague. I didn't care for any of these characters."
35,"Its like a mish mash of every adventure teen kids movie ever made. They even had the song ""stand by me"" in there. No one does anything original anymore."
36,"In a world rampant with covid-19 pandemic, entertainment has suffered badly. Even third-rated movies become favorites with high ratings given by ordinary entertainment-starved people. This flick is one of them.The first 20 minutes are a total waste of time, with terrible dialogue. it livens up a bit when a journey is made and we meet some monsters and a dog. These creatures and the dog become the highlights in the movie, far outstripping the actors in a weak plot.You must make up your own mind. It is not an adventure nor love, but a feeble comedy. Some people may actually like it."
37,I wasn't expecting much but after the first 30 seconds the movie hooked me. I watched it with my nephew who at first balked and it pulled him in. The special effects are well-done and pretty solid. The story moves at a good clip and the characters are relatable and you like them. Just regular people just trying to survive. It was just a lovely movie to watch although the plot on the surface is not a nice reality. I will watch again and learn and thing or 2. I highly recommend this film. Well done!!
38,I was a bit hesitant at first but it turned out to be amazing.Far better than what I've seen in a while. Fantastic movie with an top notch combo of action and movie.Dylan being Dylan performed wonderfully and I'm looking forward to more sequels.
39,"Dylan did his part the best without any exaggeration and a scene with robot is emotionally well taken which reminds me of fallout game.rooker and ariana on the other hand nailed their roles.doggo named boy is lit with love and cuteness. its a pg13 movie so literally you can't expect kill cam it's a sure entertainer for kids and adults.
The only part which i felt odd is during the end how they kinda mushed just to get it done and gave it a ending which ain't deserved which questions arises love or leave..
All together it's a good movie and expecting a sequel."
40,Dont see these very often these days. Great famlily fun!
41,"One of my now all time favorite films! It does a great job of keeping a consistent entertaining pace without dragging on drama or romance thankfully. It's action scenes are brief but fun while inspiring a sense of wonder with it's fun monsters. They crafted a world I want so desperately to learn more about! The creature design wasn't very fantastical and that is actually quite good as they are supposed to be mutated versions of Earth's flora and fauna. The movie is visually a treat to look at with some beautiful locales used for the movie that give you a true sense of exploration like any good adventure film should. I found the story to be quite heartwarming and not because of the romantic nature of the main story but the more important side story, a boy and his dog surviving the apocalypse. Now let's hope the Monster Hunter movie will be as good!This is a film I hope gets more entries and I will be gladly buying it on Blu-Ray the first chance I get to support the studio."
42,"Kind of almost familyfriendly scifi action, postapocalyptic story about the superbugs overtaking planet earth, dividing two lifes appart, leaving them seperated for 7 years, till the hamradio starts queking and our main hears that beloved voice of hers, and then the journey towards love and sunsets by the beach start, having to conquer super maggots, crabs and leaches from fairfield to point reyes, though vaccaville wouldve been easier..its an adventure, its not badly made technically but the story and some of acting are cringeworthy, and the plotspeed slow, but if you can endure one presidents 2 hours massmeetings, than you may be able to stand this out too.its full of colour, visual and sound effects, it has some superman riddles over it but its an okay enough watch to start your weekend with. a 7 from the grumpy old man."
43,"Looks great, lovely effects. but not scary or particularly thrilling , it all felt ,to safe no threat, and overly long. If you are 8/11 enjoy. Having said that, if you want a film to watch with your young niece or nephew, it will work well. I like many of the children's films that have an element for the adults, but I did not find it here. Not sure what was missing."
44,"Very good, super fun, easy fun movie to watch with family or friends"
45,Loved the originality of the movie with fun spontaneous comentary from main character. Hope a 2nd comes around!!!
46,"Love & Monsters - Just see it! It's an end of the world love story with monsters. Got a few laughs in it and gets you wound up in the characters. Acting is good, production is good. There really is nothing bad I can say about this movie. It's a feel good family type flick. I think there were a few curse words and a few people get gulped by monsters but it's done in a fun way. If I had kids I'd let them watch it.When I finished watching I had that same good feeling I've gotten with movies like Jumanji or Goonies. It's the kind of movie you'd walk out of a theater with a grin on your face thinking ""that was fun""Oh yeah and Michael Rooker is in it so thats a plus"
47,I wish I got to see this in the theaters. Let's hope they make a part 2 it was so good!
48,"One of the most thoroughly enjoyable films of 2020, spectacularly well made, for dialog, performances, monster effects, scenery, audio, lighting, all are amazingly well done, leaving the viewer to be engrossed in the story.
The difference between this and major blockbuster monster films of the Kong and Godzilla style, is these characters are more real, and you feel the need for a sequel the moment the finale plays out."
49,"The movie handled the emotional and comedy elements very well. In the movie, the journey of the character and his spiritual and emotional development in this journey are very well explained to the audience. I have watched many films starring Dylan O'Brien. But he did very well in this movie."
50,"When I first saw the trailer for Love and Monsters I thought it looked like a fun movie but would probably fall short. I then read some reviews on here of people ripping into it but I always like to decide for myself.After watching it I can honestly say ""Some people have forgotten how to have fun"".We live in such a jaded world where some people cannot just sit back and enjoy a fun adventure movie anymore.Is the movie cliche? Yes!
Is it predictable? Yes!
Do you see enough of the monsters? Yes actually (some people have said otherwise, I don't know what film they were watching)But is the film fun? Yes it is!Its not going to win any awards but the film takes you along on Joel's fun and sometimes tense journey with a pooch called Boy (as well as some other characters along the way).Stop being so jaded people, learn to have some fun again. Watch Love and Monsters."
51,"Trust me, no movies are perfect at everything but Monsters and Love got me good. It's a satisfying story with lots of love and adventure. I'll take the concept of adding monsters as something I can relate with personally. It's so heart-warning!"
52,"What a pleasant surprise! A fun and extremely well crafted monster movie with great (sometimes spectacular) CGI, great acting, and a stellar script. Perhaps the single best decision the creative minds behind this movie made was not making ""Boy"" the dog a CGI character.
Every single detail has been carefully considered from the storyline, character relationships, to the gorgeous Australian landscapes.
Simply put, this movie is about Love and Monsters, but taking the journey with Joel and Boy offers the viewer so much more.
You'll watch it more than once."
53,Just watch film great adventure acting top notch cgi great. My fav of 2020 great film.
54,"A decent entertainer that will keep you engaged in its wonderful post apocalyptic world filled with monsters. A usual storyline in an unusual world that gives a wonderful message in the end. It conveys that love remains intact in a world where humanity is still clinging for its survival. Its not about the love between two protogonists but his love for all the things like dog, strangers in a bunker and all that's left in it. So, if you want to forget your everyday problems and engage in a heartwarming story...this movie is for you. GO FOR IT..."
55,"What an incredible and entertaining movie, a great comedy with an emotional story that representing how amazing it is to be a team through all the dark times, a good feeling film despite having a monsters in it lol."
56,"This movie is amazing. The jokes, the action, the story line: though I felt sad at some point. But in all, I didn't regret watching it. Thumbs up guys."
57,"I've always loved a good monster movie. Be it a huge Godzilla or Tremors from underground or underwater horrors like jaws or crawl. It's should pass these thresholds, decent acting, must have heart, decent CGI and sound design and likeable characters. This movie qualifies all.It was a surprise to see Dylan and Jessica pair up, although they have less screen time, they both are good. Michael Rooker and young Ariana are a delightful pair to watch. Although I wish they tagged along longer. But probably the highlight of this whole movie is Boy, the dog. He shines in every frame he is in. It was wise choice on writers part to have the protagonist and dog tag along. We don't see much of that these days.The action is cool. Sometimes the story comes to a halt but it's okay. All in all a great entertainer worth watching couple of times. Go for it."
58,"This film will not change film history, it will not be remembered for having a stunning plot or being clever in some other way acceptable to the penalizing critics BUT it's fun and a great escape. It provides the right balance of hope, comedy, action, romance and 'buddiness' for the whole family to get something out of it. We thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend that you skip the over critical reviews and just make up your own mind. Would I have done certain things different? Yes, but so what? The film is a perfectly good watch for all the family!"
59,"Great movie. Not very slow main character is amazingly played and great story line. Sometimes a bit predictable but thats one of the things that makes the movie good. Especially the dog Boy i grew very found of.
I dont think it will happen but i hope for a second movie where they have to travel to the mountains and reunite with others"
60,Had pretty low expectations but I enjoyed this. I'd happily watch a sequel
61,"I so loved this movie, the story was very good, based on an old story line with new tweeks added, several spots brought a tear to my eye, the acting was very good, the dog was SUPER, and thank goodness stayed till the end, so often I think wrighters pull the ""let's kill the dog"" trick to stir up emotions, happily not this time, a wild ride. I will definitely watch again."
62,"I won't go into detail about the movie, but I gotta say that is is a really enjoyable watch alone or with family! The plot is kind of missing a few things, but in the end it's still rather fun to watch."
63,The story is simple but does things to keep you interested but this movies landscape and monsters IS THE SELLER! Loved the art and concept on all of them and absolutely think a sequel would be great!
64,"Not heavy, entertaining, that hits home deep fundamental ideas without trying to be explicit. It is love and monsters!"
65,I just gave a shot when i have nothing to watch. It was very enjoyable movie. No any lag scenes. Its romantic movie tooo... and a new genre of apocolypse... i wanted a sequel of it...
66,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Michael Matthews, this fun comedy Paramount Pictures is a non-stop adventure that is actually playing in theaters now, as well as on Amazon. It's super funny and family-friendly for all ages. Surprisingly, 2020 has given us several new movies for the Halloween season, but this one is the best by far, in my opinion. It's not really a Halloween movie, but there are some monsters.I was thoroughly entertained by this hero's journey movie. Plus, it offers tips that might actually be helpful if things continue to go wrong in 2021. ha ha
I know a movie is good when I can't wait to watch it again and that's how I felt after watching this movie!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of kissing and couples cuddling.
Some profanity, sometimes by a little girl.
People in perilous situations.
There are lots of dangerous creatures, but young kids probably won't be too scared. They're mostly giant, mutated insects.
Some violence.
People get drunk.THEMES:
Couples, relationships, love
Courage
Friendship, unity
Hope
ApocalypseTHINGS I LIKED:
Dylan O'Brien does a great job as the protagonist in the story who is a ""noble warrior floating on the wings of love"" as Michael Rooker's character describes him. He has perfect comedic timing, can do action, and brings on the feels. He's charming and inspiring and extremely effective in this role. Throw in a dog for his companion and you really want to root for him. There is satisfying character growth. He got his start in Teen Wolf but I didn't see him until The Internship and then his breakaway role in The Maze Runner.
The exposition at the beginning of the movie is pithy and helpful to understand the conditions of the new, dystopian world. There's a lot of exposition, but it didn't bother me too much since we need the information to better understand certain scenes.
You get to see a lot of fun and creative monsters.
The protagonist/narrator says a lot of amusing things.
The conversation with Mav1s was entertaining and touching. Melanie Zanetti voiced Mav1s and Kala. Cool magical sky jellies.
If you love Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) as I do, you'll get a kick out of seeing Michael Rooker, who played Yondu. He's perfect in his role and is so likeable.
Ariana Greenblatt was pretty doggone adorable.
Great musical score by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp.
There is a little bit of back and forth in time, but viewers won't be confused.
I laughed at Joel's reaction when he first saw the Australian stud-muffin.
Some beautiful cinematography by Lachlan Milne.
The adventure is non-stop and super entertaining.
Great CGI and practical effects.
For a minute or so, I thought one of the Hemsworth brothers was in the movie. ha haTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There was a part of the story that was completely left as a missed opportunity. The dog named ""Boy"" always held on to a red dress. I thought for sure Joel would find the owner of the dress and that she would be his true love, like Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away That would have been sweet, right? Instead, we never learn anything about the owner of that red dress, so it's just assumed she was eaten by monsters.
There are some missing details, but none of them are super important.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"
67,"Didn't expect to like this movie so much, but I did. Definitely worth the view. Watch it and enjoy."
68,"Love and Monsters - Really entertaining, hilarious, inventive, emotional and with a surprisingly big heart. Worth a watch!"
69,"This movie tries its hardest to avoid the true love cliche, it really does. But in the end, there it is. This movie was so close to being something fresh and original and great. But it was still just a little trite. Perhaps some studio exec got hold of it, I don't know.It was still fun. I still liked the characters."
70,"It's not easy to create a markable movie about monsters and teens. ""Monster problems"" achieves the goal. Strong monster caracterization, decent acting, plausible plot. Quality ingredients to make a plaseable moment. And the dog, of course..."
71,"I always love Dylan O'Brien on every his movies. He's doing great on ""Love and Monster"". This isn't only about love, it's about a motivation for love. I can't tell what's on movie, you better watch this. it's worth to watch"
72,It's just not a very good movie. The storyline is boring. You barely see any of the so called monsters. And when you do the SFX are horrible.And the bottom line is this: you just never really care about the kid looking for his girlfriend. He's not a sympathetic or likeable actor. In truth he's no even a good actor.
73,"I went into this movie thinking that it would be some great escapism. And it definitely was. This isn't a horror movie. It's an adventure, a romance and a comedy. It's the end of the world. Or is it?I hate to get serious with this review, but it really felt poignant right now. Don't be afraid of the monster outside. Get out and live your life. What a great message. It really hit home.Anyway, I can't remember any specific flaws to the movie. It was fun, it had its moments of emotion and it had it's moments of suspense. I really can't ask for much more out of a movie."
74,"What a great feel good movie. The monster were original and fantastically done, the casting was on point and the plot was excellent. Highly recommended for a family evening. I hope they do a sequel."
75,"Amidst all the madness that 2020 has already unfolded, here is one entertaining gem of a movie. The story is simple, a teenager falls for a girl and is willing to risk it all to chance meeting her traveling through the life threatening journey of 7 days across open land infested with other worldly monstrous creatures. When the premise of this movie is love how can monsters not be gentle as well. ""Aww, that's sweet"", that is the expression viewers have when they see the final fight with a giant sea crab. Overall its a great watch for family with kids and some warm food."
76,5 out of 5 stars.Love and Monster is a fantasy post apocalyptic adventure film about Joel (Dylan O'Brien) who is surviving with a colony underground from a monster apocalypse. Which the film does give a brief introduction about how the monsters originated and mutated. Without giving away details. His girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) is in another colony 40 miles away. Which Joel plans to get up from underground to go on a journey to reunite with her. He comes across a dog. And two others Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Learning survival tips. And how to face his fears.It is an adventure coming of age kind of story. Its a bit fantasy. Action. Sci fi. And a little bit of a love story without getting too sappy into that genre. It is sure as a lot of fun. The script delivered making Joel as a lovable character who is a bit of a runt in his colony. Where he sticks out as the least productive person. While everyone is mastered in surviving and fighting monsters. Seeing him come up from underneath and clueless on where to go is a lot of fun. The direction plays a little like zombieland mixed with a little bit of a road apocalypse film like Mad max but in a family friendly version of it.The film does have some exciting action sequences with them escaping from monsters and fighting back. The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does have a climatic battle on the beach with a giant like crab of a monster.Dylan O'Brien did great playing the character. Adding emotional depth to his journey in reuniting with his love. After feeling isolated from losing his family. And being separated from Aimee. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt did good too. Jessica Henwick was also great playing in a brief role.It is a fun family adventure apocalypse film that delivers heart. Action. Adventure and a bit of humor.
77,"I usually don't like movies that include so unrealistic things (like monsters in this movie). But I loved this movie. It has such a good and inspirational story. I think that the main actor Dylan O'Brien as we saw as a hero in the series of movies ""The Maze Runner"", just ads a better perspective to this movie. I think that this movie is going to get a lot of positive reviews, if it hasn't already. And that should convince them to make a part 2. Where we could see their journey into the mountains.
They could make the movie easily 2+ hours long because the end was in my opinion a bit to short.Thanks for a great movie and I hope I'll be able to see part 2!"
78,"It was a great movie, I accept it.. it really made me laugh a lot and entertained me a lot too but there was a basic mistake, and that is when the chemical from the nuclear weapons created such enormous mutations in insects then how come humans are still the same? I mean if those chemicals affected the insect they should've affected humans and animals too right? I mean after all we are on the same land, breathe same air, eat almost veg/non-veg, so it should've affected humans too, Right? Other than that, movie was a lot of fun."
79,Not the most original plot but it worked. Enjoyed it from start to finish even tho the ending was very predictable for me. Humor here and there which made me smile a bit. Dylans performance reminds me of teen wolf and i really enjoyed that. Monsters looked amazing and there was alot of intense scenes.
80,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, I just sat down to watch it and I'm glad I did.They don't make enough movies like this anymore, ones that the whole family can just sit and enjoy so it took me by suprise.Sure it's aimed at a younger person than me but it's not condescending either. Sure it's been done before and has a certain amount of predictably, but - It was good to switch the brain off and go for the ride.Like I said, 'nice' - We need more of that in this world."
81,"Movie's about a server who becomes slowed after years of the rotted cheese inserted in his gums. Terrible plot, i mean, who really wants to see a guy kept on the floor by a bunch of slim plastic pipes. There's also a female medical doctor show with weak needs. They show her after work in the pool burping"
82,"I hadn't heard too much about this film before watching it tonight & I just had to make a review to share my thoughts. The story is very well written & doesn't take itself too seriously. The basis felt like 'Zombieland' crossed with 'The 100' & this film had lessons (like Zombieland had Rules) & in The 100 they needed to know if the ground was survivable. In this, after 7 years of living underground, going outside is a massive task. The adventure is just a whole lot of fun, Dylan does an incredible job especially with his comedic timing which I didn't know he had. The scenes with Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt)) & Clyde (Michael Rooker) who he meets on the way are great additions & add so much to the film. Boy (the dog) is such a hero & worth watching just for him! Overall I think this film is a whole lot of fun with a ton of heart & about living, growing & not being afraid of what might happen. Just live a day at a time."
83,"A movie for everyone, but does the best for teens, you really can't ask for any more from this movie, it pretty much covered it all as its title Love and Monsters, you get exactly both of them.The only thing I'm uncertain was the love relationship, I feel it was a bit more of a friendship than love TBH. If you consider the number of years the guy's already lived without the girl and all of sudden he feels he can't live without her, and had to go on an impossible journey, that's crazy. And the girl doesn't deserve the ending, that's not love in any way."
84,"With any monster movie, there are many tropes consistent with the genre. A real sign of a good monster movie is one that surpasses the norm, as well as keeps the tropes entertaining. This movie does just that. The plot is interesting, the scenarios are funny and exciting, and somehow this movie sends important messages and emotional scenes without and clunkiness in the storyline. It is by no means a classic, but I would absolutely watch it again. It is a great movie. There is only one question I want answered: WHERE THE HECK IS BOY'S DRESS?! This is something I desperately need to know!!!"
85,"""Love and Monsters"" - a film that I liked surprisingly. I really liked the world of the apocalypse, all the monsters turned out to be very interesting and quite frightening (it's a pity that there was no huge spider, I would have looked). The graphics and visuals of the monsters were good too. All the characters turned out to be charismatic, except for the villain, who seemed clich√©d and silly to me. In addition, the amazing actors Michael Rooker (Clyde) and Ariana Greenblatt (Minnow) were very cool here, and Dylan O'Brien (Joel) surprised me, he played his role very well, I really liked him. The film is very funny, sometimes even sad. For what you can blame this film, it is a bit banal and predictable plot, but it does not interfere with watching the movie. If you just want to relax in the evening and watch a movie, this will do, I advise you to watch it once."
86,"Bit of a surprise this one, I was expecting it to be pretty crap to be honest but as it turns out its not bad at all, well paced, well acted and better than your average end of the world rubbish that's out there. Don't get me wrong, it's no classic but there is enough going on, it has moments of humour and the characters are likeable enough - well worth a watch."
87,"Ok, I wanted to watch a cheesy movie while my wife was putting together a jigsaw puzzle. ""oh, this has monsters"" so it can't be too bad, maybe it'll be ok to watch. Well, the monsters were done well, the story is ok, and Joel (who has a tendency to freeze helplessly) is helped along by a couple of surface dwellers who teach him some of the tricks to stay alive. And he picks up a dog along the way. I'd recommend this to folks for an escape movie."
88,"This was a fun escape from reality. All of the acting is great. O'Brian's comedic-timing is spot-on, as always. The storyline is a true nod to the good in humanity amid the worst of circumstances."
89,Finally some decent CGI this just proved CGI is fine when studios actually put some effort in. Definitely worth a watch.
90,"This film came out of nowhere. I hadn't heard anything about it, but I took a chance on it and I loved it! Love and Monsters was a really fun entertaining film. I really enjoyed the combination of romantic comedy and sci-fi/horror. It was well written, the acting was on point, and the film direction was very good. I really enjoyed the world-building in this film. The atmosphere and monsters were done very well. The post-apocalyptic world in this film is much different than in others where it's dark and murky. This film was bright and colorful and really showed that after 95% of humanity was gone, the environment took over un-restricted. Planes buried in mountains covered in vines, buildings overgrown with plants and trees, etc....It just looked really really good. Also....bonus points for having the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life! I think everyone who watches this is going to fall in love with that adorable brown puppy...and how could they not??? Great movie! Very well executed and definitely leaves you wanting more. I hope this is the start of something new!"
91,2020 needed more entertaining movies like this. Highly recommended for an upbeat and fun movie night. A true adventure.
92,"This movie is worth to have part two. If Zombieland have the sequel, this movie is worth to have it too. And i like Minnow at this movie. I hope the sequel much more better.
My score : 7.5"
93,"I think these a new a idea in a moive
And lot on unexpected things happened
So I better sure I recommend this movie to watch with friends"
94,"Love this one it's Maze Runner meets Monster Hunter plus young love , good CGI nice story no slow parts at all!!"
95,"If you like Zombieland, this movie should be right up your alley. Joel, the main character, is a very likeable guy and he has a great dog. And then throw in Michael Rooker and Minnow....you got the makings of a good movie. It was much much better than I was thinking when I went into it. It was very entertaining. The FX on the monsters were really well done. The plot and story are great. Now this is the kind of movie that I would love to see them make a sequel. And once you watch you'll know why."
96,"Wait for it to be $10 or less if you must...it will wait for you and still deliver its full measure of movie magic; but if you can safely swing the $20 purchase price currently being asked, I'd say pony up, because the makers of such a special presentation certainly have earned the right to earn their money back on this one, and in these weird days a risk deserves a reward, yes? This is a fun movie that will withstand many watchings, and will be a treasured part of your collection for many years to come...consider it an investment in joy that will pay dividends for as long as you remain able to find the Play button.
Remember: the secret is in the eyes! (That will be explained once you've seen the movie...otherwise it probably just sounds weird!)

97,"I enjoyed every minute watching this movie,very
Impressive acting whole love & monsters crew really did a great work. Thank you"
98,"Love and Monsters is an incredible action adventure that's funny, emotional, heartwarming and surprisingly tense. Dylan O'Brien gives an incredible and extremely charming lead performance and Jessica Henwick, Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt are all great. Michael Matthews' direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The CG is really impressive. The music by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp is fantastic and the soundtrack is really good. However, it's brought down slightly by a couple of predictable twists in the third act."
99,"Great characters, flawless story, beautiful cinematography. An amazing journey..."
100,"This was so so fun, entertaining, funny and most importantly clean! No nasty stuff just plain good'ol monsters a lil emotion & love mixed in, it was brilliant! Would love the 2nd version."
101,Really enjoyed this movie. Very good special effects and quite a few good actors. Dylan O'Brien & Jessica Henwick especially make very good leads. Lots of it played out differently than I thought it would. Would definitely like a sequel to this at some point.
102,"I strongly recommend this movie, very entertaining, it's been a while since i have seen a good entertaining movie such as this one, funny, mysterious and really well done, acting was perfect and the CGI really well done, more movies like this one please!"
103,"Director/production - 7; Story - 7; Cinematography - 7; Acting - 8; Makeup/FX - 7; Sound - 8; Music - 7; Personal motivation - 9; My average - 7,5One of the biggest secrets of 2020 that came out!!! A simple lovely story with some pretty good acting with unexpected hearty characters."
104,"This movie was just what I and presumably everyone needed since we are all bunkered up through this quarantine. The movie is basically about a boy who himself is in a bunker due to external threats and rises up face them and go on entertaining adventure. But somehow the studio didn't seem to know how to release this one which is really sad because it's a good family movie everyone could enjoy right now. I was just lucky enough to stumble on a way to watch it, it's just too bad almost nobody will even hear about this one."
105,"Very fun to watch, good acting, good story, I enjoyed every moment!"
106,"I just saw this movie with my dad and 2 kids (13 and 9). It was a cute, funny, sometimes thrilling adventure. My dad normally falls asleep during our movie watch but he was glued to the screen. The kids loved it. We all said this was hands on the best movie we've seen all year and we've seen a lot. The kids are still talking about it almost an hour later."
107,A lighthearted and semi-fresh take on the post apocalyptic genre. Dylan O'Brien can effortlessly play the bumbling fool with the quirky one-liners. This is a great watch for anyone that is just looking for some laughs and a story with a little heart. Graphic's were surprisingly good and the movie has a great pace.
108,"Love the monsters, good acting definitely worth a watch!!"
109,"People who loved this movie either( i liked it)
A) didn't watch teen wolf
B) watched teen wolf and loved seeing ""Stiles"" again üòÇ"
110,"I really enjoyed this movie, I hadn't heard anything about it, it's honestly a pleasant surprise. Main character is well cast, great supporting characters, brilliant special effects, entertaining, a kind of road trip feel too it.Highly recommend tucking in an watching this and I hope they make a sequel."
111,"Not going to blow anyone's mind that's seen a movie before, but it's a really solidly made movie. Well paced, well acted, and basically all of it lands.It's long enough to feel worth it, but not stretching its material. Does a good job of implying a world outside the borders of the frame, without feeling like characters are reading a wikipedia entry.Overall, worth the price of admission, and the kind of thing I hope hollywood starts doing again."
112,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Been a fan of O'Brian since Teen Wolf and of Henwick since she outperformed everyone in Iron Fist.
The acting was solid, the cgi very good and the story line flowed nicely.
I look forward to a sequel."
113,"I was extremely, and pleasantly, surprised by how much fun this movie was.The story was unpredictable without being stupid or talking down to you, the characters made genuinely good decisions and were not brain-dead monster fodder.In fact, one of my favorite moments happens half-way through movie, when a character has to help his dog friend escape a giant *********Instead of the movie having somebody else acting like a Deus Ex Machina, the character genuinely ends up pushing himself to save his friend, and kills the creature.Finally, FINALLY, another movie that joins that rare category of being fun without being cloyingly moronic."
114,"There are no words to describe how boring, untalented. and uncreative this movie was. Don''t waste your time or money watching it."
115,Not that good. Pretty generic and overall not action or comedy. Nothing unique about it either. Will be forgotten in a couple weeks. I would just skip it unless you are 10-14 yo.
116,This movie is incredible especially the writing which I thought was thoughtful intelligent and hilariously funny
117,"Easily the best movie in 2020, for it's originality and not being another copy paste Hollywood mess. It sounded wacky, so I watched it - but it was a warm surprise - a story that everyday human can connect to, and that makes a good story for me - something that aims for your human emotions, and not your pockets or frustrations. If anyone from the production crew reads this by a 1 in a million chance: thank you kindly. True art, not just breasts, bicepses, killing and effects. Also: Boy <3"
118,"This is the story of a boy who is living among giant monsters. These monsters are ordinary insects and animals which are bigger because of chemicals. These chemicals are released by the human to prevent an asteroid from hitting planet earth. The boy loves a girl and after 7 years decides to leave his colony to find his love. He takes a dangerous adventure to meet his love again. The story is a genuinely nice one full of adventure genre elements. There is a wide variety of natural scenes in the movie. Special effects are awesome. I liked the background music and sound effects. The main actor Dylan O'Brian was awesome. In general, I recommend this movie to adventure genre fans."
119,"Watched this with my wife and boy and we found it quite enjoyable, nothing ground breaking but a fun romp!...I hope they will make a sequel!"
120,Love the simple story. Love the characters. Great execution. Heartwarming ending! Solid feel good movie!
121,"Of course there is hardly a way to make a movie about the post apocalyptic world and the struggle of those who survived absolutely original but still this movie stands out from the boring CGI focused shallow stuff by managing to find a balance between being a light hearted nearly comedy like flick and a thrilling sci-fi action horror.
It's got a likable underdog type hero with a great character development arc and some other life like, interesting characters including a really cute doggo.
I actually consider it a far better recent attempt to make a good humanity fighting to get its world back genre than any of the new Terminator movies."
122,"This has a great mixture of adventure and romance in an apocalyptic lifestyle from what's left of humanity. This movie is not only eye catching but it has excitement as well as an interesting plot and I think more people should actually watch this. 9/10 for the good time while watching this movie. Good job! Glad to see our Aussies taking some credit as well, Go Go Australia!!!"
123,"This movie makes me cry, laugh I love it teaching you something good in life"
124,"This movie is unexpectedly amazing, I loved the whole thing! You won't regret watching it."
125,"I didn't have very high expectations but this movie was amazing. No politics involved just a straight feel good, fun story! Cannot wait for the 2nd one to come out. This is the movie I needed right now."
126,"For an apocalyptic movie, it's a very rare take on relationships post-cataclysm. The movie is an adventure/horror comedy, but there's not too much insane gore or blood really. You can most definitely let the slight older kids watch this one with the grown ups. Michael Rooker is always a treat and his character is played perfectly. The movie even has a dog you grow an unnatural attachment to. I would be full steam ahead on a sequel for this!"
127,"I loved this movie! I was expecting something very stupid, while not Oscar worthy it was nice escape from politics and covid. Very cute and worth the watch!"
128,I was expecting a second rate movie but what I got was a wonderful well writen and acted film that made me happy!
129,"There is a lot wrong with the dialogue. It makes me wish I had set up a web site called ""Things they SHOULD have said"".
But all in all, it's pretty good, and it ends well, without any major mistakes.
Maybe except the huge things that moves faster underground than most things do under water. I mean, laws of nature? The hunt would be so energy consuming it would burn more calories than it would catch. If it was even possible to do for any thinkable creature, (that's why I don't like Dune).
But that's normal Hollywood (etc...) errors. Just make us scared, a stressed people is a good people... really?
But it's very entertaining and the actors do a great job. Graphix are awesome, not perfect, but awesome.
Some good giggles. Some emotional moments.
Well worth it for a 55 year old fantasy nerd :-)
I feel it could have been more like a Disney movie, less fright and more love, but that's me.
Not recommended for kids under 16 (I really mean under 30 hehe)
Enjoy"
130,"What a refreshing movie. No preaching, no agendas, no wokeness! Shocking! Hearkens back to the good old days of adventure films and a bit of coming of age films as well. The protagonist Joel is controlled by his fear and it takes his love of a girl to strike out on a quest to find her in a world where mutated (from tiny to huge) cold-blooded creatures and insects have taken over the world. There are a few Deus Ex Machina events thrown in there, and it is pretty predictable but that's OK - none of it feels out of place. Nothing to complain about as far as production values (sound, camera work, score, lighting, etc). An enjoyable family movie for sure."
131,"This is one of the best movies I've seen all year.
Hints of Star Ship Troopers and a Zombie Land vibe, come together to make a disaster movie not so doom and gloom.
I can see a grabbing hole that could have been filled and put the icing on the cake it involves a certain red dress and a dog and the potential of a new love interest, but as in life just like the movies you can't have it all.
The cast all do great jobs Michael Rooker and the wee girl have a Big Daddy and Hit Girl type relationship which works really well.
The CGI monsters aren't going to blow anyone's mind but they're enjoyable. The movie's a fun ride with plenty of frills and emotion, one scene in particular strikes such a balance of beauty, emotion and sadness all backed by the song ""Stand by me"".
You feel for the main character as he goes on his journey and grows as the film progresses nothing's rushed and he doesn't go from zero to hero montage style in 5mins.
Some times all it takes is a little luck a grenade and 5 secs üòÅ."
132,"It's a fun, interesting and very moving movie. Enjoyed every bit of it. Want love and monsters 2 also."
133,"The beginning was kinda boring for me, but all changed with the appearance of the dog!)After that the film became so much more dynamic ,kind and funny! Overall ,decent one time watch."
134,"Love and Monsters is a feel-good movie like everyone else is saying. The performances are sincere and you do care about the characters. There is nothing you haven't seen before in Love and Monsters story-wise but in the end I was left entertained and wanted to see more from this world. The acting is great, the story is sweet and the action and effects are great."
135,"Love and Monsters is... actually pretty great.I found this very funny in a year where everything ends up being bad. I really wanted to dislike this film just because it looks like a big CGI fest from the trailer. To my surprise, Love and Monsters is more than that.
It is a journey about (in my point of view) overcoming a tragedy that defines you.Love is mostly just in the title, this is more of an emotional ride than a teen romantic comedy stuck in the apocalypse. Go watch it. ""You better."""
136,"This movie had a lot of potential and honestly had me hoping that it could revive the slowly dying dystopian genre. But nothing can do that, not even Dylan O'Brien, who by the way absolutely gave an amazing performance. It's just that this movie brings nothing more to the dystopian genre, it's a journey movie like other journey movies, it should have been called Dystopia: The Cliche. Now don't get me wrong it's an good movie it's the fact that there are tons of movies just like it."
137,Almost every aspect is ripped off of zombieland.... Just not as good. The dog is the best character by far
138,"Why have such an emasculated main character?!Can't Hollywood just have a regular male character, anymore?!"
139,Everyone who gives this a high rating says nothing about the film yet the ones who give it a low rating mention things that annoy them..alot of fake ratings on here I must say..
140,"When I was released in India in Hindi dubbed?? I love it
Please dubbed this movie in Hindi"
141,"This movie was very fun to watch, after so long time I felt I was watching something good.
While I'm a fan of many of the headlining actors, the premise sounded a little goofy and I worried it would be a bit B-movie-esque. It was actually very well done and so much fun from start to finish. O'Brien does a wonderful job making Joel both believable and relatable. His character Joel indeed begins as a loveable, pathetic, little hedgehog and it's a fun ride watching him come of age and find himself. The premise behind the monsters is neat, the romance was well done, all in all, it was just an incredible movie."
142,"Went into this pretty negative expecting to see some zombies etc but actually wow what a movie, its not going to win awards but it was really fun to watch, good character development and the comedy is pretty solid.Thank god for a original spin on the post apocalypse stuff this year."
143,"Damn good movie, very emotional , perfect direction and music. Mixture of LOVE and monsters. but i really didnt like the End part, where he did this for LOVE but ..in the end he was heart broken almost. very bad scene. hate that girl."
144,It's my all time favorite movie. It's so good. They have depicted monsters in a very good way and all the characters have played their roles perfectly. And of course Dylan O'Brian is the best of all of them.
145,Nice Storyline and director came out with an unique ideas
146,"Consistently good, nice message, and never ""lets you down"".
It's a tad formulaic, but it's easy to follow and the presentation of the plot-idea is good enough to make it stand out. Nice characters all around and good use of quality CGI.It's one of those movies that are a pretty great first installment, and that can (possibly) be ruined by a sequel if they aren't careful enough. But right now, I wouldn't mind watching the follow-up."
147,"Such an amazing entertainer. Good graphic, action, adventure, emotions, you name it. This movie will give you. I would love to see a sequel."
148,"I started this thinking its the same old monster movie, but it's was actually very fun. Main character is unconventional and fun at times. The monster were a new idea and fantastically manifested. I think u shoud try this movie if u have spare time."
149,"Nice simple adventure story, great way to waste an 1.75 hours."
150,"Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work."
151,"The most unexpected thing about ""Love and Monsters"" is how charmingly enjoyable it is throughout. Whether it's the well-fleshed out characters (the dog being the clear standout with probably the best arc in the whole movie), the fun monster slayings, or the amusing happenstance luck of the self-deprecating protagonist, there's not much left to hate in this otherwise simple movie.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A catastrophe mutates and enlarges all the bugs on Earth who then wipe out 95% of the human population. Seven years into the apocalypse, a hopelessly love-struck dork named Joel sets out across a dangerous Earth to reunite with the girl from his past.THE GOODEST STUFF: The pacing is tight, meaning there isn't a single scene that doesn't drive the story forward or develop the characters in some way. Nobody feels wasted, and the script gives you a real good sense of what each person is like, even if they're playing to somewhat of a stereotype (like the smart-mouthed 8-year-old survivalist girl whose all the amounts of plucky we've seen before, and yet still a scene-stealer.)And can I say how refreshing it is to see a post-apocalyptic movie like this where every human isn't a murdering bastard who is just out for his or herself? The humans in this movie are actually helpful to each other, you know, in the way that most humans are in emergency situations. Imagine that!Surprisingly, the movie pulls off several tonal shifts that are quick and well-executed. You'll be laughing one moment, terrified the next, and then almost in tears after certain flashbacks bare a character's soul in an unexpectedly touching way. It's the best kind of rollercoaster ride because it hits all the right emotional beats, even if, in the end, it does feel kind of small.Which is probably my biggest complaint...THE WORSTEST STUFF: ""Love and Monsters"" feels like it has a much bigger world to explore than the 80+ miles of terrain our hero journeys across. I mean, it's not like a ton more exposition is necessary, but the story alludes to other survivors out there and hints at an ending that we don't really get to see. Its story is essentially a VERY small piece of what looks like a much bigger puzzle. It's not enough to ruin the movie by any means, but the ""smallness"" is enhanced by a couple of hasty editing choices and a third act that feels a bit tacked-on when there is more interesting stuff to explore.CONCLUSION: ""Love and Monsters"" is sincere in its sweetness without being sickeningly so. It's got a great sense of humor, an extremely likable cast, and a fresh take on the post-apocalypse genre. It's the perfect feel-good movie for 2020 with a clear message that may or may not have been intentional: enough hiding; it's time to get out there and live your life."
152,"By looking at the title and the poster for this movie, I didn¬¥t really expect much.
But I was pleasantly surprised by a overall enjoyable movie with fantastic special effects.One of the reasons I couldn¬¥t rate it higher is because there is just so much more that could have been done with the story. Don¬¥t get me wrong I am not judging the movie for what it isn¬¥t. It¬¥s just that in relation to the amazing effects and interesting characters-monsters and fantastic setting the story is a fairly mundane, straight forward affair.Here¬¥s to hoping that a sequel will be green lit."
153,"Love and Monsters is a movie that I enjoyed very much. It's similar to - I guess - Percy Jackson (young adult with monsters) and I liked the characters and the story.This post-apocalypse film takes place 7 years after the world ended and radiation created these giant bugs. Dylan O'Brien (The Maze Runner) plays Jo√´l, a young man who has to travel 85 miles through savage land to visit his girlfriend who might be in trouble. Not being a hero (but he can cook and draw!) he's lucky to meet a guy named Clyde (Michael Rooker as a non-villain) and a young girl named Minnow. They both teach him how to survive this nasty world. He also finds a dog named Boy that will accompany him on his journey. Just in time he reaches the colony of his girlfriend...Of course, Love and Monsters is no Oscar material but the acting is good (Dylan is charming and I love Michael Rooker), the deserted world looks cool and the monsters are not scary, but fun. The dog looks fake sometimes, though. Storywise there are also some nice little surprises (the robot!). The movie even ends with a possibility for a sequel and I wouldn't mind that.A charming tale!

154,"It's not the most expensive movie, or the best plot but honestly this movie gave me flashbacks to the good old days of family adventure movies. It has adventure, it has love, it has companionship, it has humour and it keeps you wanting to learn more about the world. It makes you feel good."
155,"A good fantasy movie. Acting is good with good characters. With every fantasy world, there will always be plot holes or things that don't make sense, but if u don't look for it, u'll enjoy this movie."
156,"In Love and monsters we are greeted with the loveable and goofy character Joel Dawson, a character who is so beautifully played by Dylan O'Brien who brings his normal fun satire to the film. The satirical reliefs that O'Brien's character provides gives a well rounded range of themes within the film. Overall the film's story is easy to follow but still lacks a few needed aspects. In hindsight the film could have included more fleshed out backstories to some of the characters, in some instances characters like cap are not explained with enough depth. I would have liked to have seen these types of characters with a little more insight."
157,A movie that sees a young man living and fighting thru monsters to go forward to his love 87 miles away.
158,"I thought it was really good! first, i will watch any and all movies or shows with dylan o'brien. second, his character was quirky and unique and just a fun character to follow throughout the movie. the plot was easy to follow and although it's not like this is top notch cinema, this is something i would watch again! the other characters and story like add so much depth and fun!"
159,"Never really heard much about this movie so was pleasantly surprised. This film had a bit of everything really... Great effects, decent story, great acting (inc Boy) and love of course!Great for both younger audiences and older ones too like myself.Could easily have a sequal too but for me... would have to be the same cast and same budget."
160,"Cutie Dylan O'Brien of MTV'S Teen Wolf and the Maze Runner franchise stars in this dystopian Horror fantasy. Some time in the future an asteroid heads towards the earth and is blown up but the nuclear fallout ends up mutating all bug and animal life which puts humans at the bottom of the food chain. Joel (O'Brien) discovers that his girlfriend is alive and 85 miles away. So he leaves his colony and makes the trek there fighting monsters and befriending a dog along the way. The movie feels very refreshing in its subject matter and execution. It's got charm, style and a charasmatic, engaging leading man. Although I never fully bought into the romance I loved the live action ""Manga"" feel of the material. It's fun, energetic and feels very much like something new.****/5
Eric: ***.75/5"
161,"Right off the bat, if you're a jaded ""end of the world"" movie snob, into over the top action sequences, extreme blood splatter and high body counts, this is not your movie.However, if you're looking for a movie you can watch with older elementary/middle school aged kids, that isn't painful for the adults, this is a winner. A coming of age story set after the end of civilization as we know it. There is humor, action and the right amount of peril to thrill, but not terrify. Even my husband said he was pleasantly surprised by how much he enjoyed it. The ending is perfectly set up for a sequel, and I would be interested in the seeing the story continue."
162,"Awesome movie, kept my attention. Acting was really good and the CGI and action sequences were more than decent. Hope this movie gets a sequel, love the character building."
163,"This movie is so good. So refreshing and genuine, I didn't expect this kind of goodness in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, I love monsters movies, but often I don't like teen movies. This is not the case, and I don't saying this is a teen movie. It is in some way but it is so realistic and serious in his stuff. Highly recommended. Years in no seeing such a good monster hunt film."
164,The plot of this movie is not anything new but it was probably one of the best new movies in 2020 . That saying there were not a lot of new movies but still fun for a lot of ages.
165,"First of all. People complaining that is a kids movie, saying it's for 5 year old, saying I'm an adult so didn't enjoy it. Where is your sense of fun? Adventure? Why has the child in you had to disappear because society tells you to grow up? You can be mature and still have a bit of fun and let the child out every so often
Anyways, this movie was good fun. Not the best plot, but it's an adventure. The monsters are a bonus and in my opinion are well designed. The main character is ok, but the dog steals the show. The end scene was a bit over the top but it reminded me of the old monster movies like Clash of the titans and Sinbad. This brought back lots of childhood memories for me. Don't take the movie too serious. It's good fun."
166,02 STARS FOR THE DOG AND ONLY THE DOG... This movie is so horrible...
167,"I get the high ratings this movie received as it's a well made and it's an entertaining movie. It's a light apocalyptic adventure movie, nothing to take too serious but certainly interesting to watch. The CGI's are well done and are the best part of the movie, it keeps your attention. To me it would have been even better with more different monsters. The plot is simple but effective. The cast is unknown to me but they all did a good job. It's a movie for everybody, that is if you're not too picky when it comes to realistic stories because this is all fantasy and will never happen, at least not in our lifetime. Good movie for this genre."
168,"Went in thinking Love and Monsters would just be another hack and slash monster movie. Was pleasantly surprised to find a post-apocalyptic road show with some depth.
The special effects are overall very well done but the environmental sfx are pretty awesome and don't hit you over the head.
The acting is very good and I see all the mains doing a lot more work.
Biggest flaw I saw was with the love story. There is no way that 2 healthy, unattached young-adults don't have sex after saving each other's lives. If they have a sequel maybe they will deal with that.
I highly recommend this movie."
169,"I went into this film with zero expectations. It is, by far, the most fun film of 2020. Well paced, funny, sweet and a little sad when it needed to be. It's set up for a sequel and I really hope there is one. Totally worth the watch!"
170,Tons of heart and just enough plot and twists to keep me engaged. Loved it
171,"If you've ever played the Fallout game series, you'll probably see a lot of similarities here! Which was kind of nice. Good movie, not too long, a little serious and not too serious at the same time. Definitely worth a watch"
172,"It's not a Hollywood Blockbuster but I actually enjoyed it and I'm 49yrs old. Obviously not intended for those little ones you have in your family, but those of ages above 10 and upwards along with adults will have no issues in watching it.Again I will say I really enjoyed watching this."
173,"With a refreshing and fun take on the genre, this post-apocalyptic adventure is a wild ride thanks to an excellent performance from Dylan O'Brian and his dog, Boy. The movie is exciting, funny and does a great job of keeping an entertaining pace without ever dragging on or being too silly. It's refreshing to see a movie like this in a year that feels like something out of a dystopian, apocalyptic story."
174,"A feel good, fun-filled, family flick. Packed with adventure and tense moments guaranteed to keep you watching. The CGI just works and the vibrant colours of this post-apocalyptic landscape pop. It blends the dramatic reality of trekking across unknown territory for seven days with comedic interludes to break tension. The acting from the main characters is convincing and you grow to love them.
I cannot recommend this movie enough, it's well worth a watch.
A strong 7."
175,Dylan O'brien played an amazing part in this movie. It is thrilling to watch the film even tough you are following the story of a nobody on a quest for love the movie has a lot of exiting parts filled with action. I urge everyone to watch it and enjoy the story. I would like to see a sequel to Joel (Dylan's part) his story and I think this movie has a lot of potential to turn into a franchise (if done correctly). Keep up the good work to al the movie makers out there.
176,I have watched this movie more than 5 times... Freaking love it
177,"Not a bad movie, though predictable. I don't understand how there's no Zomdieland in ""More Like This"". This movies are almost twins=) Michael Rooker's hero is the same as Woody Harrelson's. The emphasis on the rules of survival, again."
178,This was a good watchable movie. It has it's problems but the movie overcomes the problems with the emotional depth of the story and a great Dylan O'Brien performance.
179,"If they killed the dog in this movie I would've given it 1/10, the hero is the dog..
The story could've been better, but it's not bad.. they could've expanded it more and gave more time for the journey with the kid and the man who taught him things, it should've been like a year journey where he becomes really a bad ass, and the plot with the yacht captain was dull, very interesting premise and could've been much much better.. loveable characters I'd love if this was a series maybe?
anyways very entertaining but lacks a bit of darkness which should go with every apocalypse movie.
That being said, there is something else about this movie that makes it relatable for the time we live in, as we are becoming more and more afraid to go out, we spend our time cooking and around electronics.. the message here is to go out and enjoy our beautiful world.. make friends (not online) and be more out there and gain skills that we don't know we had in us."
180,"Expected this to be more fun. Dylan is a good actor, and from the trailer it looked that this was gonna be a decent ride. On the contrary the movie was hella boring, super slow, bad jokes, unemotional, unrelatable character, really didn't even care for Dylan in this one.
Utterly crap movie. Only good thing about this movie was the dog. The rest was predictable and lame. Suppose this movie is for a younger audience."
181,"I have always loved monster films & love that there's still scripts like this flying around out there. What I can't stand is the extreme lack of creativity or originality that is adopted to bring them to life.This just has zero charm or appeal and what makes it worse is the fact they obviously had an OK budget to mess with.Not even the special effects kept me interested, turned it off about halfway through. Last point, every character sucked."
182,"One of the worst movies i ever seenGARBAGEWhy do they keep making all these syfy movies
I mean if it aint a marvel movie its this crap."
183,"Went into this having heard nothing about it and not knowing what to expect, which is rare in this day and age. As soon as I saw that Dylan O'Brien was the lead I decided I'd give it a go, and it wasn't a mistake. O'Brien is in his wheelhouse here, playing on the likeable beta male sidekick role that made him a breakout in teen wolf. He brings humour and heart to a project that could have easily been a generic and forgettable affair, aided with some great supporting stints from the likes of Rooker and Greenblatt, however brief they might be.
Funny, warm and utterly charming. It's a family friendly Zombieland, without the expletives, the gore and...well, the Zombies. Well worth a watch if you're bored/down and in need of a good cheering up."
184,"Very entertaining, especially for the drought this year."
185,"I absolutely loved it ,every second of it .This is a new generation of apocalyptic movies different from the old dark and gloomy and sad movies with - everytime- a loss of a beloved caracter at the end. This one is brought to us with a lot of fun and EMOTION And if i had to rate the dog i'd give him a 1000/10 My best caracter"
186,"It's a great movie, a little buddy with a very normal body goes on an adventure, the jokes are awesome, the romance in it is not like 90% of movies, it's so so realistic , it's actually pretty inspiring for people who gonna face it, watch it guys, and gove it your rating here, and if you can go to cinemas and support it and one more thing, the relationship between people and joel and his dog is absolutly stunning"
187,"This movie felt like a really good surprise, the quest is simple and very well structured, making it agreably easy and fun to tag along as this young dude makes his way through a hostile world, meeting interesting and challenging people.
The character arc of the protagonist is very enjoyable, although the runtime is under 1h40.
The not Marvel grade digital effects give ""Monster Problems"" a B-Movie quality that makes it kind of even cooler, because it shows that the production had its heart in the right place and spent the money on quality actors, light, sound and of course story.
I give this movie a very well deserved 9 stars for the excellent unexpected surprise it delivers as a whole."
188,"I want a sequel... Thats it
Just give it a shot,you wont regret"
189,Loved this movie! Just what we needed to bring a smile during these hard times.
190,"Ignore all the picky nay-sayers on this one, I say. Now, I'm not exactly the fan of family-friendly feel-good movies or any such thing, but I do love me some imaginative and well-done movies, no matter what genre.""Love and Monsters"" is at least very entertaining, at best even a very inspiring and unique movie in these times. Is the plot original? Not really. The premise? Nah. But I hope you know the secret: you don't have to reinvent the wheel to make a good and entertaining movie. Take a nice script and a great director, take out all the identity politics that you might feel tempted to throw in, and trust that it'll be fine. And fine it is indeed. The world building is nothing short of impressive here, just visually. This film is an example of how you can create an absolutely convincing world without tentpole budgets, and it's done by creative decisions all the way. Just like in ""Dredd"", you will find that some nice establishing shots are enough to create immersion. However, that doesn't mean that the more complex creature shots aren't pretty good as well. Compliments to the filmmakers for making the budget count - there wasn't a single shot that took me out of the movie, not one.As for the acting, there wasn't a single actor that was bad. Everyone was decent at least, but some were outstanding - like Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt. Their screentime is limited, but they're pretty much the best characters in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with those two, to be honest, and I haven't felt like that in a long time. Dylan O'Brien does a great job as well, and with some dialogue tweaks it would have been even better. But who am I to complain? Well done, indeed!If anything, I would have given the whole script one or two more drafts to sort out some of the dialogue, but yeah, that's probaly just me.So, if you want to see some nice post-apocalyptic love story with a wholesome twist, some amazing dog acting performances and a really nice score, coupled with some visuals that are actually almost too good for this budget, then dive right into it. You won't regret watching this movie."
191,"I was a bit skeptical in the beginning of the movie, because of the cheesy plot; but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I liked how all the characters, even the villains, were likable."
192,Long time before we got a proper full wholesome entertaining family flick and litrally everything about this movie was great definitely repeat viewing classic
193,"This movie is fun to watch and entertaining. It has comedy and adventure. For the comedy part, most of the humor come from Dylan O'Brian's excellent performance. All main characters are likable and the dog character Boy is so freaking cute. This movie is very suitable for family to watch and for people trying to forget some parts of the reality such as politics. Not so much for forgetting the coronavirus though but I'm craving for fun movies with decent scale of production, and this movie satisfies that craving, at least for now."
194,Its frustrating to watch how they wasted such a fantastic high budget CGI world of interesting monsters by giving it a dull slow first hour of movie. the 'im a weak guy pity me' act gets tiring real fast without the wit & humour likes of Zombieland. the dog was the real hero & the great michael rooker was so under-used its a crime. fantastic last 30mins saved the whole movie.
195,"Movies are just not good anymore. The 9 star movie of today, was a 7 star movie 10 years ago.
We give these movies more than they deserve.
This movie was lazy and lacked depth."
196,"It's not an amazing movie, meaning the story is clear that it's not something wow and it's a bit hairy. And the face-to-face phase doesn't surprise me like other movies.. I looked for the puppy!"
197,"I think after lock down, this movie gain so much rating.
Personal rating 5.. And remember its my personal opinion.."
198,"I think I have watched this plot ten times before, I don't know but it's not interesting at all I watched only for dylan unfortunately, it has no excitement through the hole movie it's predictable. I didn't like üòí"
199,"I was very dubious with this film didn't think it would cut the cake, but giving it a chance i was very surprised of how amazing the cinematic is this felt like it should of been a blockbuster movie this has alot of heart warming moments with great written comedy I would highly recommend this film to anyone"
200,"It had great scenery and good acting. The plot was okay, could've been better but over all it was a heart warming movie. Hope there's a sequel."
201,"This film start with a narrator talking about mutated insects, and the introduction of the main character ""Joel"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Joel need to survive in a mutated insects world, while searching his girlfriend ""Aimee""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of playing dumb scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching things scene, overuse of the narration scene, and overuse of the song playing at the background scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the killing scene also portray by sideways! The only intensity of the film is the explosion scene! At the end, after meet up with Aimee, Joel decide to back to his colony! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
202,"Oh I wish this movie was longer than 109 minutes! The fun was so energetic. Dylan Obrian is funny and awesome as always. The dog ""boy"" melted my heart. This movie is really good for the end of a long exhausting day, it is refreshing"
203,"When a movie starts with an lengthy introduction explaining many things that happenned that you missed already, then you know there is nothing left to watch. I expected much better from Dylan O Brien. Maybe the character's writing was not good in the first place or maybe they should have chosen a younger actor.The plot is not great either. Monsters that decimated the entire planet's population and armies, consist half of them of insects that can die with one arrow and the other half of friendly monsters with cute eyes.The chemistry between the two leads is not there, there is no major surprise despite supposed twists. It feels like a 10 times unecessarily long mediocre episode of Love, Death and Robots.I should give it a 4 or 5, but I found myself missing The Horse Girl which was a solid 4-5. Besides, all the positive reviews are too biased. So 2 is enough"
204,"CGI is super realistic, acting is excellent! There are some unexpected scenes which you wouldn't expect it to happen."
205,"Fun light-hearted film. The whole cast is great. Dylan strikes the right mix with his character who is just an ordinary dude who perchance survived the monster apocalypse. His character is sensitive, wistful and a bit overwhelmed by the predicament he finds himself in. Jessica Henwick is also great, and not just your ordinary damsel in distress. This is really a coming of age film. It's heartfelt and endearing with a good dose of humour. The set design is kitsch and kooky and the monsters are really just fun/gross (not overly dark and scary). I'm a Queenslander so loved seeing the Gold Coast hinterland and beaches used to great effect. Oh and of course multiple scenes of Dylan and the gorgeous kelpie character bonding was a pretty good vibe. I would highly recommend."
206,"This film looks attractive and exciting from the poster, but it's not as good as you hope it would be, still I give it a 7 for effort it doesn't feel like it was strung together with nonsense and served to waste your time and money and also because it has been a while since we had a film like this."
207,"This movie had humor, suspense, convincing monsters, and good acting. The plot felt a bit rushed and insincere at the end, but was enjoyable enough.The CGI was well done and the monsters were creative.While this movie won't win any awards anytime soon, it was still a decent watch and you could do worse.[5/10]"
208,"This was a very pleasant surprise. It¬¥s a great creature feature about a guy that sets out on his own across a post apocalyptic California (I think it was California -though actually shot in Australia-) to get to his girlfriend.
All actors (all but one -Michael Rooker- unknowns to me) do a good job. The special effects, while nothing to write home about, are perfectly fine, the creature design is pretty cool and the dog is adorable.
I have probably overrated this a bit, but it¬¥s been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so thoroughly that I ended up with a smile on my face."
209,"As we all know, Dylan O'Brien's movies are always amazing, and this one was just as awesome! Joel is such a well developed and personality filled character, and I 100000000000/10 recommend that you watch it! There are a few sad scenes, and lots of plot twists, (and a great cast üòâ) so if you are thinking about renting or buying it, do it! Enjoy the movie üçø üñ§"
210,"Are we ever going to return to the good old days of PRACTICAL FX? The story has been done 1000 times, but what would have made this better were some monsters that actually felt tangible. I think we're too far removed from the practical fX of the past. This was generic at best."
211,"It was aight. But way to ""feel good or happy go lucky"" for my taste. Maybe if aliens were the enemies it be ok but given that monsters were the enemy, I expect a little carnage. And every time he defeated a monster they play victory music?! Seriously?! Like it's home alone?! But all in all it was aight but lil lame for my taste."
212,"It certainly could have been better, it's far from great, but it is an entertaining teenage movie and it is very nicely filmed. The effects are great.
Looking forward to sequel."
213,"As an aspiring director the affection in the movie was really good O'Brien showed alot in this movie happy, sad i felt it all."
214,"Was not expecting much from this but was actually a great movie. The acting was fantastic but the humour is what sets this apart from other comedies. Would love it if this would to turn into a tv series but would need the same actors. Really enjoyed this. Highly
Recommend."
215,"""Love and Monsters"" starts off as a teen romance interrupted by the apocalypse, but thankfully becomes much more than that and ultimately very entertaining.There is a welcome trend recently in apocalyptic movies (possibly due to the ongoing pandemic) of finding originality vs. defaulting to a zombie plague.Former ""Teen Wolf"" and ""The Maze Runner"" star Dylan O'Brien is an affably geeky guy that stumbles into the hero role. The monster scenes balance decent special effects with fun action.I would have liked to see more of the beginning's ""life in the bunker"" setup as it would likely have given the movie more emotional depth.But overall this is a very enjoyable family-friendly adventure."
216,I was glad I watched this film. It was fun filled distopian adventure with romance as its base. the characters seemed real by good performances from the cast.
217,"It's a fun ride with beautiful characters from the human and ""monsters"" part too, Dylan is amazing and the world is colorful with good imagination, Iam really hoping that the movie will get a sequel te see that world expand and show us much more from it. If someone has a power hand on this project please use it.
P.S. Boy is the MVP of this movie."
218,"If you are a adventure/fantasy/action movie fan, this is a movie you cannot miss.Fantasy, adventure, comedy... You name it, it's simply fantastic.Every aspect of this movie is so well done. The plot is great. Dylan O'Brien's character development was spot on. The worldbuilding was just right that you just want MORE!Aside from that, props to the special effects team. The CGI is great enough that it doesn't pull you away from the story. I enjoyed every moment of it."
219,"Of all the films that I've watched over quarantine, Love and Monsters is the one that deserved to play in a theater.Directed by Michael Matthews from a script by Brian Duffield (who wrote The Babysitter and wrote and directed Spontaneous) and Matthew Robinson (Monster Trucks), this movie creates an interesting world from the first frame, a place where an asteroid almost hits the Earth, but nuclear weapons destroy it. However, the fallout transforms any cold-blooded animal into a mutated monster and within days, most of the human race is dead.This all takes place seven years before this movie, on the night that Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). After reconnecting with her via the radio, he decides to leave behind the bunker where he's spent his life and cross the dangerous world left behind to find her.Joel has no survival skills at all, mostly acting as the cook for his group. Once he gets to the outside, he's quickly saved and taught what he needs to know by Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Then, he's on his way, seeking true love, which he learns the meaning of once he gets to Aimee's settlement.If you have older kids who aren't frightened by big monsters, this is a great movie. I'll give you a small spoiler and let you know that Boy the dog survives, if you worry about that like I do.Originally titled Monster Problems, this has moments of true beauty amongst the monster mayhem, such as when the Mav1s robot plays music for our hero and luminescent jellyfish float through the air.I would more than recommend this movie and hope for a sequel. It was an absolute blast and a real escape from the issues of the world, as all good movies are."
220,"One of the best things about this movie is the characterization, man they did a great job. I mangaged to care about every single character in this movie, and that is so rare nowadays. It was belivable in the sense that the characters were all so human, the dialoge was great and so was the acting. I first saw Dylan O'briens acting in Teen Wolf, and since then I've wanted to see him get to use his talent. He was good in maze runner, and in american assasin, but here he SHINES. Every single muscle in his face just sells thw preformance to me, he is there, in a world of monsters. And that dog was really cute too. Only thing I wish it would've been longer and that we get to see more of minnow and the survivalist guy. It's not a mind blowing concept or something I will remember for the rest of my life, but it is a good friday night movie to watch with friends or family. I need a sequel."
221,"At this point in time, Love and Monsters is simply one of the biggest surprises of 2020. On its surface, it appeared to be a very run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic film, but I do like Dylan O'Brian and the reviews were fairly strong.It succeeded my expectations and currently cracks my top ten of the year. O'Brian is fantastic as always, but the journey his character goes on was remarkable. That's down to the writing, but O'Brian managed to pull it off with ease. The supporting cast was also great, but we didn't really spend much time with anyone apart from O'Brian's character, Joel.The effects were astonishing, making the world feel realistic and lived-in. I liked the narrative a lot, but I feel like an extra fifteen minutes could have easily been added to a couple of key areas. The pacing wasn't entirely there for me, but it was a far cry from being bad and I liked that something was always happening.There were also a couple of questionably convenient things that happened, and real-word logistical issues. Aside from those negatives, which don't detract from my score a lot, I was floored by this film.I have already touched on the writing, but I can't stress enough how incredible it was. There were also some surprisingly touching moments. A sequel was definitely hinted at with the closing scene, so I hope it comes to fruition.Love and Monsters is constantly exciting, the action is great, it has a neat twist, amazing effects, brilliant writing, and it was compelling throughout. I cared about the characters, which made me thoroughly invested in Joel's journey.If you haven't seen Love and Monsters, please check it out. I can't recommend it enough.SCORE: 90%"
222,"I don't usually watch this kind of movie, I mostly stick exclusively to horror movies but on a whim I watched this because it promised monsters, well, I'm pleased I did as I thoroughly enjoyed it, the acting was great and flowed naturally, the cinematography was just stunning and the monsters done very, very well,and the writers brought us a great family movie as long as your kids can deal with a few monsters ,if not just sit and enjoy by yourself or with your partner,I promise you won't regret it."
223,"It was funny, pulled on heart strings, great movie to watch with family."
224,"I mean this thing is really geared toward the teen crowd and that's fine but just as an entertaining movie, anyone can really enjoy it. I'm a middle aged white male. I loved it.And this is how you write a movie. There are no unlikeable characters. There are villains and you will know who they are but all the characters are interesting. The concept is great and the actors are all great. The movie was put together well.I would honestly love to see a sequel."
225,"A light and fun movie. It has some elements from Zombieland, Into the Wild, & Maze Runner, yet it can still be entertaining and show how much Dylan O'Brien capable of."
226,"Giant creepy crawlies walk the Earth forcing people underground.
Why? Because of rockets and stuff - it really doesn't matter.This is an old school adventure yarn but with fantastic effects and action scenes.The characters in this are surprisingly deep and engaging and even characters that only get a short time on screen you still get a sense of who they are and care about them to some level.This is a mix of action and humour with a sprinkling of romance.Yes there are stereotypes in this that we have seen before and yes there are no real big revelations here - but it compensates for this by being really good at what it has and haves fun with it.
And this movie is fun.
These is a whiff of Zombie Land around this but the tone here is less cynical with a faster pace and more stuff going on.This is a truly enjoyable film about monsters with a story just strong enough to get you through without getting bogged down.Give this a go - you are unlikely to regret it!"
227,And keeps watching it everyday. Am I being a bad parent? ü§îüòÇ
228,"I really hope they do a sequel because my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie! The acting is great, the special effects were above average, and the entire movie is very entertaining. It was definitely a breath of fresh air during these difficult times in our world."
229,"I believe Love and Monsters should be added to your movie viewing experience. Good balance of comedy, love, and monsters. I love it. I love Dylan O'Brien. Just take it easy. Sit back and enjoy this feel good monster romance comedy..."
230,This movie has very nice and uplifting vibe. Enjoyed it a lot. Totally recommend to watch it.
231,"Gorgeous effects. Fun, but heartfelt plot. Great movie! Dylan O'brien is amazing as always"
232,"Well, it is what it is. An entertaining film, light hearted and fun. Dylan O'Brien doesn't look much like a nerd, but he tried. Michael Rooker is effective as the weird tough mentor, which kinda reminds me of Woody Harrelson's character in Zombieland. Jessica Henwick is right at home with pretty next door neighbor tough girl. The monsters stole the shows from the actors though, including Boy the dog. They are excellent."
233,Plot is simple and you can see what will happen. Fantastic elements are rich and enough to keep you entertained all the road.I would give 7 if there was no crab scene I mean that yat guy etc. It is much more cliche than everyhting in this movie. And humour in this movie is right on spot. An avarage good family watch movie. Can watch it with everyone anytime.
234,AAA CG and composition. I LOVED IT! It overwhelmed my expectations. Give it a try. Could be easily confused with a big studio moviejjejsjjshsjshshdhdhhdudjdjdjfjdjdjdjdjdjjdjejejdjdjdjdhehdhdhejjdjejejejejwhwhhwh* hwjshw uwvwhwh vwuw. Whwv wvwiw. W
235,"A great fun-filled and action-packed movie that has all of the best elements of a classic family adventure movie.As many other reviewers have already commented: It has adventure, it has humour, it has love, it has friendship, it has great FX, it has good acting, it has cool Monsters, it has unseen plot twists, it has a few tense drama/scary scenes, it has a cool dog, it has a terrific young child actress, it has some tame ""baddies"", etc. What more could you want?It kept a smile on my face throughout it's runtime and I can't wait for the sequel.While it is not quite up there with some of the classics such as Stand by Me, Jurassic Park, The Goonies, E.T. and The Lost Boys; it is a sufficient compliment to this film to say that if you enjoyed any of these films, then you will almost certainly enjoy ""Love and Monsters"".No need to spoil any of the plot by re-telling it here, just jump onboard and enjoy the ride."
236,"It's borrowed plenty from both, but still holds its own. Great popcorn movie. Bring on the sequel. Solid 7. The dog is awesome!"
237,"This is my new favorite movie i love it ITS AMAZING so funny,romantic and heart warming .they're so talented i love all of them.I RECOMMEND IT .go watch it NOW"
238,"As I started watching this movie, I thought this is the same basic plot as 90% of the computer adventure games I played in my teenage years (many years ago). The premise of those adventures centered on embarking on a perilous quest to save the princess (or girlfriend). In this case, the perilous quest involved avoiding huge mutated insects that have taken over the world. Our hero had plenty of room to grow along his journey, since he started out as the least likely to survive two minutes on the surface let alone 7 days.I decided to rent this movie because ""the girlfriend"" was played by Jessica Henwick. Henwick starred as one of the ""Sand Snakes"" in Game of Thrones. She was also the only bright spot for me in the ""Iron Fist"" series.Some of the best moments are when our hero meets up with a man and an 8 year old girl who teach him ""the rules of survival"". His dog ""Boy"" was also totally awesome.I enjoyed going along for the ride in this movie. It gave me 108 minutes of escapism where I didn't have to worry about politics or anything in our real world. It had an excellent third act, and if I was in a theater I may have applauded some. I only gave 8 stars because it was total escapism, and it really didn't have much to say about the world, other than perhaps suggesting that lockdowns may not be the way to go in our current pandemic. But I don't think they were thinking that deeply."
239,"2020 was not the strongest year for films. This one is not a hidden gem. The plot is simple and predictable. A wimpy guy turns hero was done before in a better way. Love story that makes very little sense. A bunch of plot devices. Lazy writing is too obvious. The moment when our hero's parents die in a car in only so he can later say: No! Yes, it was a very resolute and manly no. Obviously there was no way for them to open another car door and get the hell out. Anyway, there are villains in here too, and they also are done in the most simplistic way.
I am not saying you should not watch it but if you are used to think about films this one may no make you as happy as you wish."
240,"What's there not to love about this movie.It has love, adventure, fantasy, post apocalyptic, hope message and comedy. Dylan goes out of his way to tell the story beautifully while the support characters backs him up with great acting and adorableness. I didnt want this movie to end and I hope they make a sequel and more."
241,A movie about post apocalypse life where people are confine in their home(bunker/shelter) is just what we need in 2020. I really enjoy it.
242,"Watched this movie with no expectations and was really pleasantly surprised!
Yes the storyline was a familiar one but I think they pulled it off spectacularly!
A really enjoyable movie overall."
243,"Loved to see a good ole monster movie with good acting, script and just fun to watch. And happy to Dylan O'Brien back in a well deserved lead role ....."
244,I watched this movie just because I was bored and it turned out to be the best movie I've watched in this year..... Just brilliant..... And Dylan did a grt job...
245,"First of is there anything that dylan can't do. He is such a great actor. Movie was hell of a ride from the beginning. Fun , emotional, humor, action....it has all the elements to be called a great movie."
246,The story and emotions in the character really bumps you up .Such a good story and beautifully made.
247,I am waiting impatiently for the second movie. The storyline is very suitable for this.
248,"With a bit of a comedic vibe, this adventure movie delivers a lot of fun for the watcher. Great SFX, good acting and camera work. This movie truly deserves it's current 7+ rating. It was so much joy to watch, I'd want to see a sequel! And it's great for any age, weather you are 10 or 70, you should enjoy it."
249,"Everything about this movie is epic, Acting and CGI was on point and the story was epic üî• üíØ üëå üî•"
250,"Entertaining Movie with Good Effects and Animations.
Dog is Awesome
Just didnt like how the main characters beard did not grow 1 tiny bit even when he was out surviving for 7 days."
251,"This feels like babies first apocalypse movie.
EVERYTHING is a trope in this, but not in any kind of fun ""lets play with this trope"" way.If you're a YA, this movie might be passable, but only one where this is their first introduction to 'media'. NOTHING PRIOR!!! Including anything as technologically advanced as cave paintings. Might be too many tropes in those cave paintings.The plot is essentially: Young guy runs away from 'home' for 'love', and once he gets there, he realizes that young love was not what was important, but the journey here, the friends he's made along the way, and the 'family' back home that still love him.This movie feels like they copied Zombieland, removed the jokes, removed any clever bits, realized they had only 32% of a script left, photocopied a few pages to fill in the blanks and kind of slapped this together.The effects are fine. They dont look straight from a TV show, or from a DC movie.
Thats really the only positive I can add.Acting was weak. Story was bad. Love interest part was pointless. Main character should have been killed LONG ago in this world, as should the other colony.Re-watch Zombieland. Your night will be better for it."
252,Really light-hearted and fun movie with great cast and decent acting. What else can I say?! If you're here for a big franchise with lots of explosions you are on wrong place but if you want to have really good 2 hours than you will have as much pleasure watching this movie as I had.
253,The worst lead character ever written! Why did you really bother to write such bad characters?
254,Was not expecting this to be as good as it was . Really enjoyable movie and the dog is a star I hope they do a second
255,"Love and monsters is not new, we have seen tons of movie like this one but here there's something that it's not that easy to find in this type of movie and that is an, even far, perception of depth. Not so much in the story, that's is actually pretty coomon, but in the leading character that is played by O'brien in a very empathetic and raw way that you really care about him and you really believe in his efforts and his spirit. And that's not nothing.
I was even surprised by the pace that's not only fast, noisy, chunky it's also capable of find slow moments that help the movie to don't rush and think about which is the right way to continue the story step by step.
Sad so the action scenes are nice, pretty smooth, clear and enjoyable and the cgi does its job.
But, and there's always a but, the movie fails with unnecessary gags, some already seen stuff also unnecessary and those bad guys, especially those bad guys."
256,"People hold a myth about ""what's out there""boy acts brave and goes out there.boy writes book with monster guideMonsters are actually kind.boy teaches people how to live out there with monsters."
257,"Bad news: Asteroid Agatha 616 is headed at Earth. Good News: Rockets are deployed to destroy the asteroid and succeed. Bad news: The fallout causes mutation in insects and cold blooded animals. Humans live underground in colonies. Our story focuses on Joel (Dylan O'Brien ) who freezes at the sight of a monster, even after seven years. He has been separated from his only teen love Aimee (Jessica Henwick) who is at another colony 85 dangerous surface miles away. Joel decides he wants to see her and starts out on a trek.The story is mostly comedy. Joel meets Michael Rooker and young Ariana Greenblatt on the surface who are seasoned surface survivors who teach him the ropes. I enjoyed the film and the goofy creatures.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity."
258,"I hate when I can see shortcuts in movies, things that happened in a movie because the budget couldn't justify doing something else. That's often how I feel while watching Monster Problems.It starts out really great, we have this awkward wimpy main character growing through an adventure to become a role model to others.But many parts of the films ending just feel thoughtless and unrealistic or lower budget compared to prior scenes.There are alot of great characters in this but it just made me want to see more of them, I feel like this would have done better as a series than a movie. There was alot of content to explore and it feels cut short.It would have been much more fun to watch this instead of the borefest that is the walking dead series. This is a super creative story and the art and style, concepts, sound, character designs was fantastic, but the ""progression just felt like it had great moments, but it was a ""too good to be true"" feel to it.I guess that's the part where it feels like it was make believe or perhaps made for children because nothing bad ever happens in a world where it seems like it does everyday but we didn't get to see it.The beginning was great realistic, believable, but it ended like a fairy tale, a journey without a feeling of any struggle sort of like wow you made it and nothing happened except you had a few moments but never failed, when before it seemed like you failed everything."
259,This is a family film with the occasional cursing. It is like Jurassic Park but not quite as good. It is an enjoyable ride that has decent enough animated monsters. They shy away from any explicit deaths but what can you expect from a PG 13 Film?!
260,"This post apocalyptic movie starts on good note keeps you entertained in it's unique way and takes you on a adventure which is funny, emotional, scary and entertaining. A nice watch.A good one."
261,"It's hard to find movies now that don't overuse sex and nudity to draw attention. This was clean, funny, and very well done. I do believe it could have been longer with a trip to the mountains but maybe a sequel will be in the works."
262,"As someone who always checks IMDB before watching a movie, this is the first time I've actually left a review. This movie is awesome. Great special effects. Awesome story line. Very original. I hope this turns into a series!"
263,Great feel-good movie! Recommend for all family's. The dog is such a good boy and the hero of the movie. The end is a little different from the usual rom-com with good action sequences and proper CGI
264,"It's obviously a comedy so it's a lighthearted story which has some unbelievable coincidences. But still, it was entertaining."
265,"Lots of mixed messages, vague cgi, editing is weird. It's all over the place. And it is pretty dark, unexpectedly dark to be a 'family entertainment' piece. Acting is inconsistent. 6/10"
266,"Makes no sense, couple randos with grenades can survive for 7 years I'm sure more than 5 percent of the world could too, and figure out you can use monsters to your advantage much faster. Also the ending was very predictable and the crab looked awful IMO and how did even control it, yeah they shocked it but how did it know what they wanted? Had a couple cheesy lines and cringe moments like with the kid. Besides that it was kinda funny and some of the action was cool, the only thing really that stood out was the dog. Boy deserves and award for his performance."
267,"I thought that this was going to be just another awful 'monsters movie' like 'Monster Trucks (2016)' or 'Ghostbusters (2016)', but I was actually pleasantly surprised when it wasn't terrible in the end... sure, it's not a 8/10 or higher movie, but do I regret watching it? No, not at all. Would I watch it again? No, most likely not... but it's a perfectly fine way to spend 100minutes of your time... I would have liked to have seen more monsters and more action scenes, but I totally understand that that would have driven the $30million budget even higher and would have resulted in an only mildly improved film (could possibly have been an 8/10 film then, but no higher)... But overall it's a perfectly fine monster movie and can be enjoyed by the entire family. Would recommend watching once."
268,"All I can say is, please make sequel. Absolutely loved it"
269,"I was expecting a low budget B movie for teens, but got something very promising! I thought it was well rounded out. It reminded me a lot of Zombieland but less edgy, more heartfelt. I gave it a 7 because I thought it was definitely worth a watch and I'll be on the lookout for a sequel. That said, it was a little bland for what it was. It contained all the right ingredients but would have greatly benefited from a little more spice. It's not really an issue, I'm just saying I think they definitely had the right idea and could see this team pushing a sequel or another film to the next level. Strong hidden gem potential, great work.Good CGI, semi-original story, good pacing, thought the acting was fine, there were exciting moments, tense ones too, as well as light-hearted and emotional scenes. Very well rounded. Recommend to people who liked Zombieland or the original Jumanji"
270,"Love and Monsters is a flimsy lighter version of ""The Mist,"" done the right way.Over a longer period and through one perspective. It's well written, with realistic characterization and heart within the CGI surroundings. Well acted as well, Dylan O'Brien worthy of any leading role. Being family friendly perhaps holds it back a little, but the best film I've seen of 2020 thus far."
271,"I loved this movie, I'd pay $25 again for a sequel ;) For anyone complaining about the price, how else are they supposed to make money? Movie theaters are closed, if you were to watch it in one pre covid you would've payed even more. Plus this way for $25 you get to watch it over and over ;) I loved how it wasn't constant gore and action there were nice moments to enjoy and some good comedy in there. Dylan's awesome, he has such good range in his facial expressions and definitely uses that to his advantage. I've never seen an actor do that as well as he does. Loved the dog and the little girl, she added good humor and was adorable, wish there was more scenes with her and clyde! also the dogs original owner? i will never stop wondering who she was she seemed cool. gave it a 9 only because i'd like alil more romance but that's just the girl in me. Also hats to all the other people that contributed to this movie, the editing, script, production was just all insane *chefs kiss* it looked insanely realistic."

273,"Love and Monsters is a movie where I just watched it because it had ""Monsters"" in the title. I love monster movies and since new movies coming out are rare, I gave it a watch. The premise is simple ""Seven years after the Monsterpocalypse, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien), along with the rest of humanity, has been living underground ever since giant creatures took control of the land. After reconnecting over the radio with his high school girlfriend, Aimee, who is now 80 miles away at a coastal colony, Joel begins to fall for her again. As Joel realizes that there's nothing left for him underground, he decides to venture out to Aimee, despite all the dangerous monsters that stand in his way"". So was this movie a ""monster"" good time or a large-bore?Firstly, the characters are all great. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is a very frightened and nervous individual but gradually grows more confident as the movie progress which is done convincingly. Later on, in the movie Joel meets two survivors on the surface, Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), who eventually teach Joel the ropes on surviving. Clyde is the cool teacher and Minnow is the very loveable sidekick. The best addition to this movie is the pet dog ""Boy"" who goes with our main character Joel on his journey. ""Boy"" adds an extra layer to this movie by giving Joel, and the audience, someone to care about on the journey and leads to some intense moments. The director, Michael Matthews, made a great choice in including a companion for Joel as the movie wouldn't have hit the same notes if it was just him. Also, dog companions are great anyway. There are some other characters like Aimee (Jessica Henwick), Joel's goal, and they are all pretty good as well.I do have to give a lot of praise to Dylan O'Brien as he is very charming and charismatic despite playing a kind of nerdy loser type character. He makes Joel seem very relatable and successfully makes us root for him. There are also some surprisingly emotional moments sprinkled in this movie and Dylan's performance is very good, to say the least in making us feel for him. There also some comedic moments and quips from our main character that for the most part land and none of it takes us out from the emotional core of the movie.Let's talk about the monsters, they are great. They all have freaky designs but still, look reminiscent of the animals that they mutated from. The movie only has a few monster moments that appear but it works. Every moment where a monster appears is intense and suspenseful. There is also a great world-building and rules set in the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Not all monsters are the same as each monster have different ways to be dealt with and some monsters who are not as aggressive which was interesting.If I had to give a flaw to the movie then it has to be the predictability and the cliches in the movie. The story isn't anything amazing and you can probably guess all the twist in this movie since it uses so many cliches that you would expect. Right from the first 10 minutes of the movie you can probably guess one of the twists near the end since it feels that incredibly cliche. The third act of this movie is not as good as the first two acts which were focused on the loneliness and struggle of our main character. The last act feels like a completely different movie with its over the top nature that is mostly dumb action rather than intense or suspenseful like the previous action set pieces.Overall, Love and Monster don't do much new but that's okay. In the end, the movie knows what it wants to be which is the growth of Joel on his journey with some monsters and it does that good. The movie has a lot of heart and sincerity that isn't in a lot of movies nowadays. The movie is carried by a great performance from Dylan O'Brien and I hope to see more of him in the future. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie and I believe you will as well."
274,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Michael Matthews and crew brought a fun-loving comedic film. The story is by Brian Duffield and he has written a few movies I loved and now he has done it again. The story sets in a world filled with monsters and Joel makes a dangerous journey to be with the one he loves. The movie is a light charming adventure and having the lead character as the narrator makes everything feel more chipper. Also, the addition of the dog made it more enjoyable and he had so many great moments. As it is already mentioned in the title it is all about love while the monsters are the wall keeping them from it and this film shows how something impossible can be possible. It doesn't take it literally as a simple love, it is way bigger than that it directs on how to take risks to live the life you will love. I'm really eager for a sequel because this film needs one so desperately and hopefully next time they focus more on the monsters.The composers Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp gave this film the humor and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere with their music. It isn't something to grasp and yet it's just as simple to make this film work.The cast was incredible, Dylan O'Brien was hilarious as the narrator and his acting skills were spot on. Jessica Henwick was fantastic as well and I hope for a sequel for her to get more screen time. The storyline of them was perfectly executed there was no better way to unfold their story, loved how realistic it was. Now Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt were a badass-fun duo one of the best things this movie had. They were the backbone, without them the film could have gone into another route and of course, the dog also dominated every scene."
275,"I did not know Hollywood was still capable of producing movies which are simply fun. No politics, no muh strong wamen, no diversity pushed for no purpose, just good old fun. Thanks to everyone involved in the production of this movie."
276,"Loved everything about this movie. So much heart, tons of creepy huge monsters with great cgi, decent action scenes to keep it going, simple yet not boring story. Enjoyed it very much."
277,"I was hesitant first, but gosh, the ending was really cool. Although there was some plot holes, but the ending brought all together. Recommended"
278,"This movie lets you wishing to know what is coming next,"
279,"Films like this are very rare these days. The number of times a studio greenlights an original idea that has the feel of something that would've been in theatres over a decade or two ago is slim to none. Love and Monsters, although meant for the big screen, has just become available to watch at home and I feel that this gem of an adventure will go way under the radar. With a fun concept from start to finish and a real emotional core throughout, I had an absolute blast watching this film. Here's why Love and Monsters deserves your time.After attempting to save the planet, the human race accidentally created an apocalypse. Many years later, separated from his girlfriend, family, and now surviving with a group of warriors, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) ventures out to find the love of his life. With the world now infested with giant, mutated insects, the journey will not be easy. The premise itself feels almost too familiar to fully enjoy, but the visuals make it feel unique and the fun tone and uplifting performance by O'Brien made it all worth it. I've also been a fan of his performances for some time now, so I may be a little biased in that regard.Love and Monsters takes the concept of characters being dropped into the apocalypse and spins it on its head. Just when you think it's about to get predictable, it pulls a little fast one and keeps you on your feet. Sure, some of the voiceovers can be a bit much and even a little distracting, but again, Dylan O'Brien is just a very likable actor and he sells pretty much any material he's ever given. At its core, this is a family adventure film, but it's also PG-13, so there is an emotional depth that gives it a layer I wasn't expecting. Yes, it's a little too tame sometimes, but I felt that gave it more charm.More than anything, I'm impressed that director Michael Matthews hadn't worked on anything of this scale before. His work here is miles ahead of many Hollywood directors coming out of the indie realm and I really hope he continues to get more work. It would be unfair if the improbable box office for this movie hurts his future chances. It's not that I absolutely loved this film or anything, but Matthews' touch was very apparent and the movie felt like it had a personality. That's something most Hollywood movies lack these days.In the end, as I said, this isn't anywhere near a perfect film, but it's the most fun I've had watching a new release in many months. If you're looking for something to immerse yourself in a world that's both unique and entertaining, Love and Monsters could very well be the film you need right now. I was invested in the character of Joel Dawson from beginning to end and the emotional core of the movie really worked for me. I watched this film with a giant grin on my face and right now, that's really all I can ask for, especially when the movie itself is well-made. Though it has faults throughout, I absolutely recommend checking out Love and Monsters, now available to stream on some services."
280,"...told amidst the backdrop of a post apocalyptic world full of huge bugs trying to eat everyone.This was a good mix of comedy, adventure, and heart that was thoroughly enjoyable. The characters were likeable and the story wasn't too predictable. It's a shame that it didn't get a theatrical release and had to be relegated to PVOD. It deserved better than that.Dylan Obrien sure does like post-apocalyptic movies..."
281,"You won't find anything here that you don't see in other movies of the genre, most of the movie is a remix of already established tropes. But it is a great remix thereof. The actor of the main character especially does a really great job to portray the sometimes absurd story in the most believable way possible. This movie is a lot of fun to watch and a perfect homage to the 1975 film 'A Boy and His Dog'."
282,Love and Monsters is set seven years after the monster apocalypse with 95% of the world's population gone. It follows Joel Dawson who leaves his colony to travel approximately 85 miles to get to his high school sweetheart's colony. Along the way he meets an Australian kelpie named Boy who helps him along the journey. He also meets eight year old Minnow and her guardian Clyde. Both of them are wise to the current world and offer Joel some important rules to live by. The movie offers some much needed entertainment for everyone you can watch again and again. It is definitely a must see movie. I've seen some bad reviews and I'm left wondering if we saw the same movie or not. The one I saw was awesome and left me with a sense of absolute delight. You'll laugh and smile throughout the movie.
283,"Great movie, super enjoyable from start to finish with a great main character to carry it through."
284,Reminded me of the Tremor series from when I was a kid. But a very refreshing and modern take on the genre. Would definitely expect this movie to start trending once it catches on. Quite a cool watch during these trying times. I hope they continue this with a sequel.
285,This movie was such a surprise... I find it genuinely lot enjoyable and to add my surprise at the end I just connected to the characters which is rare for such movies .After lot of hit and miss on the genre this actually feels fresher and closer to heart with every characters clich√© you will find on such genres. And am clearly hoping for the franchise to continue wanna join them till the end of their journey.
286,"Apocalyptic films are nothing new, but the view of ""Love and Monsters"" on this genre is a little more lighthearted and with a bit of humor. Directed by Michael Matthews, the film is based in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity has died and the world has been overtaken by giant creatures.This film reminded me a little bit of The Maze Runner, and not just because Dylan O'Brien is in the main role, but also that the main character knows little about an quite dangerous environment in which he is, that he is fearful and, it must be said, he is running everywhere. It seems that these running fragments were even filmed in a rather similar manner. ""Love and Monster"" isn't with a very fresh concept, but the script and the charm of Dylan O'Brien make it a rather fun adventure comedy.Sometimes the environment was rather peaceful, even too peaceful, given that there should have been all sorts of creatures around everywhere. But in the end, this was comedy and the overall script was pretty good. So I will say that the film certainly deserves at least 7.Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is 24 years old and lives in an underground bunker with the group of survivors for the past seven years. When he restores contacts with his high-school girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) over the radio, he makes a spontaneous decision to go to her colony, located 85 miles (~137 km) away, to meet his love again. It would be easy if Joel understood anything from survival outside the bunker, but it certainly doesn't stop him from going. And then the adventure begins.During Joel's journey, the environment is displayed in great expanses, many forests and mountains. Urban environments have been well overgrown (I think a bit too much for seven years). At the same time, the various creatures he encounters along the way have also been shown fairly well.When it comes to acting, it seemed mostly good, especially where Joel spoke to the dog he met as with a real person and expressed himself in a monologue, as well as in a conversation with Mavis (""MAV1S""), where his emotions were very well represented. The music didn't stand out anywhere, though I liked the moment where Mavis played her final piece of music.In general, I would suggest that you do not go into the little details and don't think so much about those dangers of apocalypse, but simply enjoy it. The film shows this all from a different point of view and the main thing you have to remember is that it's an adventure comedy anyway. Enjoy!"
287,"Watched this today 16/10/2020 and though not the most original film I did actually find it rather charming and sweet some cool looking monsters .... Reminds me of an 80s type geek becomes hero type movie. Deffo the kinda film we need during this pandemic , just good silly monsterous fun , it would of been nice to see at cinema but hey home viewing Is just as good if you have a good TV and sound system , Dylan o Brien is very sweet in this"
288,"Yes I kinda enjoyed Love & Monsters, BUT the lead character played by Dylan O'Brien, was immensely frustrating by his momentous ineptitude.
(LIL SPOILER).
The events depicted in the movie, take place 7 years after the events that caused the insects to grow, BUT it would appear Joel has learned absolutely nothing about how to survive.
Just imagine your playing a really tough RPG game, set on extra hard and the companion your given, is the level 1 village idiot, (That's Joel).
But other than Joel's complete ineptitude, the movies worth a watch, given a 6/10 because of Joel.ü§£"
289,"Perfect balance of comedy, action and all important character development.
Well worth a watch, the only downside for me was that it is, currently, a stand alone film, I would happily watch more films/TV series set in this dystopian world with these characters."
290,"Great casting, love story, cinematography, action, adventure, science fiction, monsters. This is one of those rare movies that you can watch over-and-over by yourself or with friends. The dog was just too cool for school."
291,"A very enjoyable movie for the whole family. Glad to see Dylan O' Brian again in the big screen. The movie is a fun, comedic and monsterous adventure in a post apocalyptic world. Definitely worth of repeat viewings."
292,"Usually I'm the one who thinks films are underrated but geez guys this movie is a joke! From the silly plot to the bad cgi tho was neither funny, scary or inspiring unless your 10 yrs old. Kids will love it but this is Waaaaaay OVERATED! Laughable.. omg. What are the critics talking about?"
293,"I've never done a review in this format before... but I will do it now because I am feeling lazy.
PROS
It's got some stunning visuals.
Dylan O'Brien is a fun dude.
It's a great story.
It's definitely entertaining.
Doggies are A+ always.
It's surprisingly unpredictable.
It is mildly funny.
Monsters are pretty dang cool.
It held my attention from start to finish.CONS:
The characters are pretty underdeveloped, it wasn't until much later on that I even liked Dylan O'Brien's character.
The attempts at comedy often felt awkward and fall flat.
The writing is not fantastic, hence the underdeveloped characters AND underdeveloped relationships between characters.
Due to the poor writing the dialogue seems a bit clunky and unnatural. Performances are just OKAY.In terms of grading scale, it's a B-. Worth a watch."

296,"Went into this expecting more of the same from Netflix's past five year run, blend, idiotic, and uninspired. But lo and behold, this movie was none of these things. It was visually impressive, engaging, and just all around a good movie. The trailer doesn't do it justice.
I'm hoping this is the first in more to come, as Netflix has been dropping the ball quite continuously in recent years. This movie has heart."
297,"Very few films have impressed me of late. This was one of those films that made me laugh out loud, gasp with terror, and fill my eyes with tears. Great start, awesome 2nd act and satisfying 3rd. This film is up there, people. would watch again!"
298,"Dylan O'Brien's charisma goes the distance in the fleeting, but fun enough apocalypse adventure ""Love and Monsters,"" which has the actor navigating an obstacle course of convenient twists, unabashedly cute characters, and mega-sized creepy crawlies. He's done well in a school of acting that has alums like Adam Brody and pre-Lars von Trier Shia LaBeouf-the art of being a little neurotic, with endearing self-deprecation taking the place of any stable cool-and this is an excellent display of O'Brien's infectious imagination and comic energy. Plus, director Michael Matthews places him in a vivid apocalypse in which we're the ones in danger of being squished, as towering centipedes, snails, and slugs and more have wiped out 95% of the human population.It's a funny start then, how O'Brien begins ""Love and Monsters"" as a type of sidekick to a whole team of sexually active, bad-ass apocalyptic fighters, and he's the chef. Vengeful, mutated animals might have been created from missiles that tried to shoot down a massive asteroid seven years ago, but some things in life are constant-some folk shack up with others quickly than others, and some people are much better at facing danger head-on. And then there's O'Brien's lonely Joel, whose main skill is that he makes a good minestrone soup.After he makes contact with an old love named Aimee (Jessica Henwick), who lives in a different colony 80 miles away, Joel decides to tackle the unknown danger of the outside world, and leave behind this makeshift family who seem to be in their own action movie. Everyone warns against it, knowing that he freezes when he's been face-to-slimy-face with the monsters that have previously tried to break into the colony, but fear can be so tiring. Credit to ""Love and Monsters,"" it makes an intriguing hero flaw out of simply being too scared. Their survival of advice to Joel is a stern, ""Don't fight. Just run and hide.""By sheer determination to be with someone he first said ""I love you"" to right before the apocalypse, O'Brien's Joel navigates his way through a new world, passing along cliff-sides that have been turned into honeycomb, and through suburbs that have been swallowed whole by the greenery of nature. While walking through a backyard, he's attacked by a massive frog in a swimming pool, and is saved from its tongue by a quick-witted dog named Boy. It's absolutely not the last time the movie will use convenient timing to save our hero, but it's charming because of the dog, and the tight action sequence that unites them. The ""banter"" that O'Brien shares with the dog after is a delicate expression of Joel's loneliness, and amicability. Boy is a good dog, and a good listener.Later on, Joel meets two more charming souls, who add character to the saga and not much else. But they share a good comedic chemistry, with Joel still as the clumsy underdog, who learns from the tough-as-nails kid Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt) about how to fire a crossbow, and Clyde (Michael Rooker) the secrets of surviving day by day. During their travels, Michaels spikes the goofiness with a few tense moments, not so much from grand surprise, but a festering dread. Especially as Joel's flashbacks to seven years ago depict a gruesome end to everyone's loved ones, ""Love and Monsters"" has a vital sense of danger, mixed with its interest in using O'Brien for some frantic slapstick.The script by Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson (with story credit to Duffield) staples together its adventure together using voiceover and a whole batch of characters' good timing, but O'Brien's Joel is a strong guide: he's optimistic, excitable, and always likable. O'Brien helps give the movie a heart, and creates the movie's need for connection in ways beyond finding his dream girl-he shares an unexpectedly sweet scene with a talking robot, which gives a sense of gravity that helps the later moments when he's sprinting from an appropriately freaky centipede. ""Love and Monsters"" has a winning sincerity that helps it move along, even if you become more aware of just how narrow it is.Underneath everything, ""Love and Monsters"" has the feeling of a director auditioning for something of a ""Transformers"" movie, especially in its third act. The final showdown feels like a tacked-on calling card, but it's another smoothly executed set-piece of people scrambling during a monster attack, with some hand-to-hand combat thrown in the mix. It's also a good moment for the film's sporadic use of practical effects, when all of the crags, slime, and moss on a monster makes them seem even larger in close-up, something you just don't get from the other CGI creatures that chase people around in this story.But even more than for director Matthews, this is O'Brien's showcase. He makes you believe that Joel is sprinting for his life from some fantastic beasts, and that throwing himself into an apocalypse to combat loneliness is noble enough. ""Love and Monsters"" openly tells you it's not overthinking a single component, but with the spectacle of O'Brien's athletic work, that's not exactly the end of the world."
299,If there is an option for 0 rating then I would have given that. It's a total wastage of time.
