0,"I did two combat deployments to Afghanistan and one to Iraq. I can tell you without a doubt this movie is the most accurate representation of FOB/COP life, soldier lingo, and to an extent the combat.Most reviews I've read complain of sub-par dialogue and not a clear story as to what was going on prior to the attack, but I bet that most of the reviews were from people who have never been to war. In war Dialogue between soldiers is not interesting, it's dark, unfiltered, and usually disgusting. We degrade each other, fight each other, we say things so offensive and disgusting that most people would think we have issues. In war you also don't always have a clear cut mission that you can make into some grand Hollywood story. When you deploy you are supposed to find bad guys and help locals, that's it. Those hoping war has some interesting story will be disappointed. You sit around bored, exhausted, missing home, working out, eating garbage food, piss in tubes/bottles (first movie I've seen that showed the bottles), burn your own crap, watch movies, go on patrol and maybe get shot at. Every so often you get a big mission where the combat gets intense. Then it's rinse and repeat, that's how it is and I'm sure prior to the attack, that's how life on Keating was. This movie depicts life in the military so accurately that I was like ""my gosh finally someone did it, they got it right it"". So to anyone reading this, this is as real as you'll find it until something else is made. All those who talk smack about it are idiot keyboard warriors.The combat itself is good, explosions look real even the CGI ones were ok, none of that dumb fireball explosion crap, the dust and smoke generated from shooting and explosions to the point the soldiers in the movie were coughing from it was legit. Now I wasn't in this battle but I've been in my fair share of fights I can tell you that tracer rounds aren't as fruitful as you see here. Most of the time you get shot at an have no idea where it came from except maybe a general direction. Muzzle flashes also are hard to see unless it's at night and you could see them all over in this movie. Usually you just see dust or smoke from where they shot, not flashes. But Hollywood has to do this for the effect as it does makes firefights look cool and without seeing tracer bullets whiz by it takes away from the intensity.
Also the soldiers were able to yell and talk to each other from long distances. Yea that doesn't happen, war is ungodly loud, you have to be screaming in a dudes ear to hear you.
When the air support showed up finally, how it was being controlled didn't make sense, but that's just me being nit picky as not many people know what the hell is going on with that.
The tactics were decent, you could tell there was some military advising for sure but some things didn't make sense. Not sure if that's how it happened or just Hollywood though.Overall if you want to watch the most realistic depiction of how the war in Afghanistan is, this is it. To all the naysayers saying this is garbage, hate the way the soldiers talk to each other, or wish there was a more clear story/mission, you obviously have never been there.RIP to all the fallen in this battle"
1,"PREMISE - The Outpost depicts the battle of Outpost Keating, known as the Battle of Kamdesh, which took place on October 3rd 2009, close to the border with Pakistan in Afghanistan. The Outpost itself was located on the bend of a river in a valley, completely overlooked by high mountains on all sides. It was simply put, a nigntmare to defend and a prime target to over run. So it would be that 300 Taliban fighters would attempt to do just that over two fateful days that October.
In addition to the harsh terrain the location had other issues. Helicopter re-supply was extremely challenging and dangerous and could only be conducted at night (A previous re-supply attempted killed 12 people, not depicted in the movie) meaning only night landings when there was no moon were possible. Due the nature of the base being located effectively in the bottom of a funnel, in-direct fire support from artillary was impossible and the nearest close air-support was thirty minutes away. Into this nightmare scenario 53 American Soldiers were expected to defend the worst position possible, so the stage was set for a modern day Zulu and one of the bloodiest close quarter conflicts of the war in Afghanistan.THE CAST - Casting here is impressive and suspiciously full of the children and grandchildren of famous actors and directors. (Jagger, Gibson, Eastwood, Attenborough) Knowing full well that it is difficult to often tell men apart in uniform during depictions of conflict on screen, we have an interesting range of faces, the most easy to spot of which is SCOTT EASTWOOD, proving to be every bit his Father's son as Staff Sgt Clint Romesha, he and CALEB LANDRY JONES both give stand out performances but the rest of the cast are solid too, special mentions to: CORY HARDRICT, TAYLOR JOHN SMITH. and the ever dependable JACK KESY. Senior Officers are played by MILO GIBSON (Whose making a good name for himself despite the challenge of having to fill size 22 shoes) and ORLANDO BLOOM, who appears to have come full circle from playing PFC Blackburn in Blackhawk Down to playing Captain Keating here, whom the camp was ultimately named after. A number of younger British actors do incredibly well and even Producer JOHNATHAN YUNGER gets in on the action!PRODUCTION - The film was predominantly shot in Bulgaria, as you would expect for a film being produced by Millenium Pictures, but the set up for the camp is convincing and adequately conveys the issues facing the defenders, although the depiction of the terrain is slightly different. The first half of the film tells the story of the various officers who were stationed at the camp before leaving the final third of the film to depict the battle. It is here where ex-soldier turned director ROD LURIE and DOP LORENZO SENATORE do a superb job of giving us a balls to the wall depiction of the final assault and place you firmly in the middle of it, making me regret I could not have experienced the sequence on the big screen. Several long takes (all the rage these days) give a very realistic depiction of following one character in the battle, then another. They also employ a clever techique of depicting the deaths of the real personnel involved, seen primarily form the third person, which felt like a sensible and sensitive approach to the issue in question. One of the most dependable sargeants is wounded early on during the firefight which has an impact on the battle morale of the soldiers whom find themselves fighting for their lives minute by minute. Enough screen time is given to depicting the local political problems facing the American officers, who did their best under extremely challenging circumstances to placate locals.OVERALL - This film is one of the best depictions of close quarter fighting since Blackhawk Down and is extremely well handled. Some of the earlier dialogue between the soldiers lets the film down a little bit. Yes, we know soldiers do talk like this from time to time but some of lines are cringeworthy to say the least and I am sure this dialogue could have easily been improved upon, but minor gripes aside the film is a pretty gripping depiction of a stupid military blunder which cost the lives of several young men, completely unnecessarily. It does seem a shame however, that the release of this film, may have torpedoed a second film on the subject (RED PLATOON) based on the book written by Medal of Honour winner Clinton Romesha (Played by Scott Eastwood) - Eastwood was not able to speak to Romesha when researching the role he depicted due to this conflict which feels a real shame. So it is possible, we might see a second film depicting the battle. Bring it on."
2,"This movie (despite its occasional poor reviews) is fantastic. On a film basis, the movie does a great job introducing you to characters you'd want to learn the true story of. I read the book by Clinton Romesha (depicted by Scott Eastwood) last year entitled ""Red Platoon"" and always had an interest in learning more about the events that unfolded that day. This movie, in my opinion, did the book justice. As far as filmography is concerned, it was great. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that youd expect to see in a war movie. The added aspect of realism was the trauma that you can see in the actors portrayal of their characters eyes that can only be a glimpse into what they experienced. Watch the movie, read the book, or vice-versa. Just remember the names."
3,"I was a 2LT on my first deployment to Afghanistan and a Captain by my third. I am guessing that the film producers used some top notch military advisors, because, frankly, the book was sloppily written and full of cliches and errors on many levels. But the film itself is, for the already problematic and almost never accurate in detail or large picture, genre of war film, quite a good film.
On of the professional reviewers I read complained about troops ""bullying each other."" Really? WTF. That is very accurate and perfectly natural. Everyone is on the edge of their nerves and the banter you hear is accurate. There are a few small technical problems with the way the Taliban troops are shown to deploy and fight. But overall what you are looking at in this film is fairly true.
Could it have done more to convey the visceral nature of the fighting around some of the FOB and outposts? Yes, but I am not sure how.Give it a watch."
4,"Very accurately captures how soldiers interact with one another. The trailer worried me with a few ""Hollywood"" sounding one-liners but the dialogue, action sequences and genuine experience make it very authentic. I really enjoy how the film highlights the various leadership styles and approaches from those in command. This is a great film that I hope gets more attention 9/10."
5,"This is a great movie. Indeed there are, but there are a couple of great things about it:this was a movie based on true eventsthe action scenes are exciting and provide an engaging visual fellingthere is no sugar coating, the actions depicted on the movie real and truthfulIt follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently, but the goal here is not to explore the lives of each of them, but to understand the challenges of fighting a war in a place clearly indefensible. There are no protections against the mountains and everyone knows it, even the viewer as you get the first glimpse of the environment the soldiers were put in.I recommend this movie and I think you will like it if you also like movie based on true events."
6,"I thought this would be a B movie, but it is actually really good. It is truly intense, and brings you to the outpost where you feel threatened and desperate. I really enjoyed it."
7,"I didn't even know this movie was being made, but I first heard about it when it was touted as a ""pro-America military movie."" I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but it sounded better than the alternative.I served in Operation Enduring Freedom 7 and 8, in a little Forward Operating Base called FOB Tillman, named after Army Ranger Pat Tillman who died in that area (Paktika Province of Afghanistan, a few kilometers from the Paki border). We were one small Infantry company (A Company, 2/87) in a remote area, which was populated by neutral locals and Taliban forces. The American media called it a ""hot zone,"" and it was. The similarities between the setting in The Outpost and the reality of my unit's experiences are startling. Obviously, I'm a biased reviewer.That being said: I thought this movie was incredible! There were a couple of things I questioned the accuracy of, like soldiers firing full-auto M4s and the somewhat casual behavior of soldiers in an obvious death trap; but overall this movie gets just about everything right. Down to the small details like the water bottle used as counterweights to keep the exterior doors closed, and the local Afghan elder with the red dye in his beard. Those are the kinds of details that SO many Hollywood interpretations overlook. Also, the story this movie relates is an incredible tale of heroism, sacrifice and brotherhood, which really are common in the US military. Watching this film was a cathartic experience for me, as well as an enjoyable movie-going one."
8,"11 year army veteran. This rates in my top 3 films for realism and truth to the combat experience. Uniforms to terminology, they nailed it. Thank you for making this film and putting in the research."
9,"Very much in the mold of Zulu (1964). Love the realism of being in a real war, with ammunition and bombs going off left, right and center, and soldiers forced on extreme survival skills to battle incredible odds. Some fort - surrounded on all sides by mountains. Outpost is 100% certified as a feminist-free GUY popcorn-movie. Was going to give it a 7, but, in the light of that, think I'll give it an 8."
10,"This was very well made. Some soldiers that were on the battle participated as actors, giving it even more realism. All actors did an amazing job. They made me stick my eyes to the screen and not blink until the movie was over. The sound engineering was insanely good, as well as the post-production editing. I will not spoil the battle to anyone reading, but I can say that my heart was pumping like I was there.
Great job!I don't understand how this movie has less than 7 stars and also why garbage insignificant ""woke"" movies have the same rating as this one.
Wake up."
11,This one was hard to watch as a combat vet. I read the book and knew what was going to happen and it still hit hard. The first part of the film was necessary to show life in Army. Yes the dialogue is not PC and civilians may think the behavior is unprofessional. Those boys were very good at their jobs don't worry. Military humor down range is far from PC and Soldiers do a good job in finding humor in almost anything. The final battle is incredible and watching these Soldiers react and make plans under incredible pressure and chaos is amazing. The acting is great and Scott Eastwood was impressive as Romesha.
12,"I came to this as a silly B action flick, but it was very well acted, directed and edited. It feels very realistic and intense, and way more profound than I thought it would be. You come to care deeply for these guys and the absurdity of their sacrifice, the stupidity of war, especially in these circumstances.
It ended up being way more moving, interesting and even thought-provoking than your typical dumb action blockbuster, as fast paced as it is."
13,"War movies tend to get it really bad, or get it really right. This one gets it right.More of a docu-drama, than a narrative film, and non-stop ""WTF"" in your face the entire time. You instantly feel for the soldiers who were based in one of the most ill-conceived camps known. The ominous sense of dread and foreboding haunts the first few minutes of the film.There are plenty of ""gotcha"" moments where you think a certain soldier is going to be with you the entire film, only to discover they are not. It's jarring and keeps you on your toes the entire time.The handheld cameras are shaky, but not overly so, and bring you right into the terror that was that fierce battle.Every actor delivers a satisfactory performance, but it is Caleb Landry Jones who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Ty Carter. An incredible portrayal which required careful nuance, it's one of the best pieces of casting direction I've seen in a long time.A truly incredible film that will tear you apart, ""The Outpost"" quickly rises to the my top 25 all-time war films ever made."
14,"Never rated Scott Eastwood thought he was a subpar actor but man was I wrong he is amazing in this movie he shines and was without a shadow of a doubt my favourite character, as for the rest of the cast they all put in an amazing performance and the movie in a whole is just excellent, I love a good war movie and this is just that, trust me just watch it"
15,"""The Outpost"" is surprisingly a well executed, well acted and intense film about the war in Afghanistan. I was hooked from beginning to end.
.
In this war drama based on a true story, a small team of U.S. soldiers battle against hundreds of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
.
Director Rod Lurie takes the viewers inside the outpost rarely ever showing the enemy but always showing the bond between brothers. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding. I started this review off with the word ""surprising""; and being a B-movie I didn't expect much from ""The Outpost"". Turns out I was wrong and you should see this film.
.
Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
16,Indefensible outposts are still there. The movie is well plotted basing upon the actual events. A painful memoir.
17,"Dateline: October 3, 2009. The place is Afghanistan. Nestled under the steep incline of the Hindu Kush, the army outpost of Kamdesh is a poorly conceived site for Bravo Troop 3-61. Strategically vulnerable, the doomed men at one point in the film contemplate issuing the report of ""Alamo! Alamo!""Early in the film, a group of the soldiers visit the local elders, who recall the historic failures of the British and the Soviets who experienced the quagmire of Afghanistan. It is difficult for the locals to see the American imperialists as any different. The leader of the army entourage actually seems sincere when he talks of winning the ""hearts and minds"" of the elders, exactly like the failed policy in Vietnam in the previous century.With the Kamdesh site about to be closed, the Taliban plan and carry out a massive attack on the fort. The second half of the film is given over to the protracted battle and the clear sense that war is hell. The heroic soldiers stay the course until finally air cover arrives and the survivors evacuate.One of the most revealing moments in the film is when one of the soldiers attempts to explain the purpose of their ""mission"" in Kamdesh, but is unable to articulate any military or political goal. At another moment, the chain of command is discussed with the name of Stanley A. McChrystal named as the figure in authority responsible for what was later called in an investigation an ""obviously indefensible"" outpost.Both technically and in the screenplay, the filmmakers were successful in developing the ambience of ""the fog of war"" and the two decades of utter futility of American foreign policy in Afghanistan. It was a chilling experience that brought to life the nightmare of a remote military outpost in the Middle East that came to be known as ""Camp Custer."""
18,"This is one of the best war films, of all time. It is extremely intense and almost seems as relentless in the portrayal of war, as the Taliban must have been in their daily skirmishes with the American forces.This tells the story of the most decorated company of the Afghan war, their outpost, which happened to be a tactical blunder surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains and their fight to the finish which led to the highest battle honours.There are interesting insights on leadership and the effect that it can have on the subordinates as well as the opponents. Then, there are pointers about the instincts ruling the heart and the mind, in the heat of the battle.It is first rate and it is a real shame that it hasn't received the recognition that it rightfully deserves. among my top 3 films that I have seen this year, pre and post lockdown.
Its rating on Rotten Tomatoes (of 91%) is closer to the quality of the experience.Can't be recommended highly enough. Is in the unmissable category."
19,"The Outpost of the title was a U.S. military site designed to enlist residents in social expansion, but was located at the base of high mountains just miles from the border. U.S. and local soldiers and advisers would confront a never-ending loom of attack by rebels, who ultimately decided to make a statement.The key to this story and the way it is told is found in how completely unpredictably and abruptly the exchange of fire must be in warfare, especially in this precarious scenario. This is a defining feature of this movie, in its structure, in its suspense and in its character dynamics. The characters in Rod Lurie's The Outpost are young who may generally share the same age bracket but who are nonetheless at varying staging of life, displaced and frustrated guys who will be chewing the fat one second and covering their comrades in the next, against totally unseen enemies.I can only hope that movie-fan enthusiasm had a role to play in the casting of Clint Eastwood's son, Mel Gibson's son and Mick Jagger's son. They vary in their level of presence, but the film never conventionally signals when someone more ""important"" than someone else is on-screen. Everyone stacks up with each other, and they're all naturalistically revealed. Scott Eastwood, for one, has countless moments during which he must do something mortally risky while exposing his crippling fears, born out of empathy and experience.I'm aware that many professional reviews agree that Caleb Landry Jones steals it. There is no denying that.
What viewers need to know is that performance in a movie this maturely crafted, this carefully pragmatic about its potentially sensationalized subject matter, is not about centering any one character. Rod knows particularly well how loyal and synergetic soldiers are in platoons, squadrons and outposts.Jones is an inspired thread the film holds from the start to its final, crushing cut to black. Lurie understands how we all feel about the possibility of being involved in warfare, and how far out of one's element we would look to the rest of our squadron. The gift Jones gives us is the deeply felt human response to being in the very thick of the situation. He is alienated by the squad, because he is not like them. He wouldn't seem especially weird were it not for the fact that he is surrounded by ""proper"" pedigrees of American warrior.But somehow, in a brutal, tragic war film, there are no bad guys. No single deed is without dimension. Lurie has always been specific and definite in his choices. Here it is in how carefully everything plays out before an anxious camera which seems to be a silent addition to the cast.We are left with a story that is so compelling because no matter how immersed we become in it, how inescapable the thick of it feels, it is a needle in the haystack of stories like it, and other stories at other tiers of what has happened since we put troops in Afghanistan. One of the most important reasons why it is not an action-packed film, despite how sudden, brutal and prolonged the battle sequences are, is because it takes the time to show us regime change in a microcosm, how leadership matters, and affects what happens to those depending on it. It's a lesson we can all afford to take time to understand, for what should be terribly obvious reasons."
20,A bit slow at the start ... but wow what a fire fight ......
21,"I felt like I was playing Call of Duty for 5 hours. A mishmash of battles and irrelevant dialogue, for a basic mission. Sadly, I wasn't participating in this conflict. The realism was excellent, although heavily drawn out by a screenplay that needed to be much tighter. The casting was excellent and I felt although not all performances where great, they were convincingly real and emotional. It's not your typical Hollywood war film, but instead one of true grit war films that honors the real life soldiers that were KIA or able to return home. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but you'll be left unsatisfied with the overall storytelling."
22,"Situated in an isolated area of Afghanistan, Combat Outpost Keating is manned by a small force of US Army soldiers and very vulnerable to attack. After years of sporadic, light attacks, in October 2009 the Taliban attack in force. The odds are massively stacked against the defenders.Based on the true story of the Battle of Kamdesh, The Outpost does a great job of portraying the terror, confusion, camaraderie and bravery of soldiers in battle. Very realistic, giving the viewer the feeling for what an infantry battle must be like.Very emotional too, especially towards the end.Not perfect though. The set-up feels clumsy and long-winded. I get that the director is trying to show the bonds between the men but it seems forced and doesn't actually achieve the engagement level he is aiming for.Overall, worth watching."
23,"This film shows that each soldier is fighting for the person beside them. Shows the madness of working with people that don't want you there, and the incredible relief when the battle is over. Some people may see this as a fairy tale of toxic masculinity. Those people do not know the immense joy of being shot at and missed."
24,The movie portrays the suffering of young men sent to a part of world they don't understand just because someone on top was too dumb to know better .
25,"I'm not going to discuss the political aspects of this film, as it deals with them with about as much insight as John Wayne and The Green Berets does the Vietnam conflict. This film is rather more a memorial to some very brave US soldiers who lost their lives through monumental command stupidity when a 'hearts and minds' US Military Outpost was placed (even to my militarily-untrained eye) in the most ridiculous location in Afghanistan (or indeed the entire Middle East), as was apparently acknowledged both before and after the event by the US Military themselves.
Based on a true story, the film is basically a record of repeated attacks on the outpost by the Taliban, and the soldiers' attempts to defend the indefensible, interspersed with the usual soldierly chit-chat and team-building.
I'm not entirely convinced that the real soldiers (US Cavalry veterans) who died would be entirely happy with the way their Hollywood counterparts portrayed them - for example, that no serious effort was made to secure or patrol the surrounding heights throughout the repeated attacks, even though the attacks always came from the same place. Furthermore, the soldiers are presented as chiefly concerned with the chit-chat instead of being careful - like keeping to cover, and not strolling across an IED-lined river bridge chatting happily to your mate.
For the first three quarters of the movie, the firefights are chiefly of soldiers shooting at an apparently empty hillside, and it difficult to feel compassion when someone gets killed because they are all in the same camo and helmets and you can't really tell who's who. This is something the director obviously realised post-production, as the film is heavily overlaid with titles saying who is who, and also where they are (as the location is also pretty samey). However, in the effort to be fair to all the combatants, there are just too many to remember, and the only one who really sticks is Clint Eastwood Junior, sporting a ridiculous moustache.
The barrack-room backchat is heavily-scripted, un-funny and generally pointless, adding to the difficulty in caring about the characters. It may be that this is real US army-talk - regardless, it isn't entertaining to listen to.
The firefights are confusing and, I suspect, grittily realistic. Unfortunately, this makes them unsatisfactory to watch as you, the viewer, have no more idea what's going on, where the enemy is, or who is shooting at who, than the soldiers themselves.
In summary, the film is a sound memorial to the soldiers who died and an excellent lesson for West Point in military stupidity - but as a war-film it lacks a sharp script, necessary character development, any real insight into the Afghan conflict, or the kind of close direction required for complex battle sequences to be comprehensible."
26,"There are a few war-film cliches, but that doesn't make the those scenes unrealistic. And the rest is (to this non-soldier) very real! I don't see how this could have been done better. The actors go all-out, the direction is taut, the action almost non-stop, the effects convincing. Well worth a watch if the subject doesn't simply depress you too much."
27,"Fantastic movie and insight in the terror and fear of war. Incredible acting all around, i really felt the actors were there. They really made this movie, Oscar's all around! Effects and score were on point. Why this movie hasn't got a higher rating is a crime."
28,"I've been watching war movies since the fifties and this is the most rousing-harrowing-insane-based on a real-alamo event war movie I've seen.
Which up till now was the last third of ""Come and See"".
For me, this is essentially the Afghan version of ""ZULU"".
The criticism that the movie doesn't develop the 'minor' squad members is patently ridiculous. The movie is ABOUT them. If anything, this shows why you maybe shouldn't: it hurts when the stuff hits the fan and boy does it hit hard.
A deserved heavy weight of poignance pervades the credits.
Excellent work by Caleb Landry Jones.
Scott Eastwood's DNA causes him to appear to be doing a weak imitation of Clint."
29,"Because this is made for the unison , and not the bipartisan of the audience. its a film about usa's war on taliban in afghanistan, it has a very cliched build up with loads of rough and tough language and bullying among compadres en masse. that really is going on for ssome 45 minutes.but when the heat gets hot, i guess youll experience some highraised shoulders and stiffness in the neck, because the ''under attack'' action parts a really dignyfying and deadly to say the least, thanks to handheld free motion camerawork ,so here youre in for some good moviemaking.but there are much mediocreness in the quiet and spiritual moments of the story, and that makes the grumpy old man give just a 7.but if you like the topic and genre, its among the finest made over the subject, and some of the acting are pretty good."
30,"I loved every aspect of this movie: the acting, the realism of human interaction, human emotions, the realism of the battle. The characters were so vivid - each was unique, extremely convincing, human. The buildup was necessary in order to properly develop the characters, so that when they finally go into battle and die it impacts you deeply. The fight itself was one of the best, if not the best I've seen.This is a masterpiece.
May those who sacrificed their lives in the battle be forever remembered."
31,"I thought this would be a bit of a B-movie when I sat to watch it; partly because there aren't many 'big' films coming out at the moment, but also because it does feel like it is dressed up as a rather generic war movie. This feeling is a little justified perhaps, but mostly The Outpost does perform, in particular in the second half where the famous 4-day battle to hold the camp is played out. There isn't a lot of character-building, or strong dialogue scenes, but to be fair the functional talk and focus on structure does fit with the military nature of the story, and actually moments where we do get little details added to the characters mostly feel a bit clunky and unnatural within the bigger film.War is hell is clearly spelt out throughout the film, but in particular the second half sees a barrage on the camp and the viewer is effectively put in the middle of it. It is well-played so it is never 'exciting' like a war movie; heroics are not overdone but are just 'done' in a matter of fact way; deaths are not flamboyant or choreographed but rather they just happen, often with brutal suddenness. It all has an intensity that is befitting those that went through the real thing, and every aspect is targeted well to play to the chaos. The camerawork stands out during this. There are a few moments in the film where the camerawork is interesting but actually distracts from the moment because of how the camera moves (the bridge scene for example), but in the second half the mobility of the camera combined with the longer shots do work well to put the viewer in the midst of it all. The cast may not have a lot to work with in the detail, but they are wholly convincing in terms of their situation - you believe their lives are on the line and that they are under intense unending pressure.It is not a flawless film by any means, but it does what it wants to do and does it well - particularly delivering in that intense second half."
32,"The Outpost was directed by Rod Lurie, written by Eric Johnson which adapted the book by Jake Tapper and Paul Tamasy, and stars Scott Eastwood, Caleb Landry Jones, Jacob Scipio, Taylor John Smith, Alfie Stewart, Jack Kesy, Scott Alda Coffey, Milo Gibson, Kwame Patterson, Sharif Dorani, Bobby Lockwood, and Orlando Bloom. It follows the soldiers of Camp Keating (ne Kamdesh) as they deal with their position, anger, and Taliban.Plotting is straightforward and kept at a slower pace for the first hour, keeping the audience in the mindset and the boots of the soldiers, following their daily activities: scouting, intelligence, camaraderie, tension, and leadership. The focus is always on their thoughts, they start out with Lt. Keating (Bloom) who is a strong and down-to-Earth leader who tries to make peace with everyone as best he can. When out on an assignment, something happens which causes him to be replaced by Yllescas (Gibson) who loses some of the relatability that made the soldiers appreciate Keating. After Yllescas comes Broward (Patterson) who almost none of the soldiers like due to his nervousness and unwillingness to side or associate with his men. It's this constant demoralization and increasing attacks by the Taliban that keeps the first half arresting. The second half is hectic, kinetic, horrifying action. It does not stop and it does not feel fake, the pressure is felt on all of the characters when the Taliban forces start their assault and it only ever lets up at the end.Characterization was very good, particularly Romesha, Carter, Bundermann, and Kirk (Eastwood, Jones, Smith, and Kesy). They're all given adequate backstory and ample personality in order to stand out among the others. Romesha is quiet, to the point, and an excellent leader. Carter is probably the most interesting of the bunch with his prior professions being brought up, how he ended up in camp Keating, and why next to no one likes him. Bundermann is sort of a hybrid of the stereotypical American soldier and officer; he loves to insult his colleagues, get dirty, and have fun but is also entirely capable of stepping up when necessary. All of the performances are good, with Eastwood and especially Jones standing out as fantastic. The rest of the cast is solid, despite the audience having to play a game of remember-the-last-name since there are so many.For a war film, there is a lack of a message, which is surprising considering the subject matter. It works very well which is bamboozling to say the least. The Outpost has no intention of trying to sway the audience's view towards the conflict one way or the other which allows for greater clarity of the events. It focuses on the soldiers for the whole feature and it never once feels preachy; only intending to tell the story and put the audience in the shoes (or combat boots, rather.) of the soldiers to try and give perspective to outsiders. These men just wanted to be done with that outpost and it shows with the writing and the performances.Budgetary restraints do not lessen the impact of The Outpost, but they are clear at points. The explosions, costume design, layout of the camp, and sound design are top notch for any war film and it is clear that a lot of time and thought went into each building and each technical detail of the movie. One aspect that shines the brightest in this movie is the sound design: it's terrific and terrifying all at the same time. Gunshots feel lethal and close when they hit, explosions are loud and bass-y. And you know what? Bulgaria makes a convincing substitute for Afghanistan. The only thing that makes the budget clear is the overt clarity of the images in that the movie looks as though it was untouched in post, which could've done with some better grading, and the CGI which is pretty subpar. Thankfully the CG is rare and the grading doesn't take much away from the movie. The pacing is a bit on the slow side for the first half; which can drag at points and may have benefitted from a light bit of trimming. All together though, The Outpost is a very well made movie.As a whole: The Outpost isn't the best war movie, with pacing issues in the beginning and innumerable characters to follow, but it is certainly a solid one. The story is interesting, action is brutal, most of the characters are well-defined and easy to sympathize with, and has strong technical aspects. I recommend The Outpost as a well done, and well told story.72/100"
33,"And all us action fans have loved movies like these since the days of movies like Zulu Dawn. This movie packs a punch, it does have a slow buildup but this is for effect and to lead us slowly into what could only be described as a hells cauldron.It is rare to see action sequences as true to life as this and it really does leave the viewer reeling from the situation these guys were put in by the usual incompetent higher up in command as is always the case it seems since WWI and it has not changed. Some great performances and a fitting tribute to the brave guys who died defending an indefensible position in the war."
34,"The relationships. The combat. The dialogue. The tactics. Every little detail is near perfect. Those that are complaining about it not being a typical Hollywood popcorn blockbuster because ""they are all wearing the same uniform Sonora tough to tell who is getting killed and shooting at an empty hillside"" has no clue how the war in Afghanistan was. And that's okay. The violent side of the afghan war has never been better depicted."
35,"I waited a while before I watched this due the negative reviews on the internet but after seen it I just don't understand thise people.Okay, maybe it's slow in the beginning and there's a lot of scene's you think well, why and how and please explain but once things go wrong at the outpost this is a hell of a movie.Scott Eastwood. in the dark, his eyes and voice are really lik eclint. Said that, back to this flick based on true events. The cruelty of war is shown, friendship and death are so close. Effects are just on the edge of goredom.If you can sit throughout the first 45 minutes then this is really a good movie.

36,"Don't get it twisted. This movie will likely go relatively unknown, not unlike the Battle of Kamdesh. I'd first read Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha's book, Red Platoon, of which The Outpost is based upon, in 2016. The book tells the story of the men of Red Platoon stationed at Combat Outpost (COP) Keating, a COP the DoD themselves stated had zero strategic value and was nearly indefensible. Ever since I read the book I've wondered why this story wasn't more widely known and why the book hadn't been made into a movie. I can't be more thrilled that it finally has as this story needs to be as well known as Operation Redwing (Lone Survivor), Day of the Rangers (Black Hawk Down), and Operation Vigilant Resolve and Phantom Fury (The first and second battles of Fallujah respectively).The visual depiction of Staff Sergeant Romesha's book is incredibly true to the text. In the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha doesn't write himself out to be a hero, but instead gives the facts of what happened during the battle and focuses more on the actions of the soldiers he served with. The Outpost mirrors that depiction, showing you that there is no singular main character. The movie is a tribute to the men who fought in the Battle of Kamdesh.If you are looking for a highly polished war story like American Sniper or Lone Survivor, this is not your movie. Having served in the military, I can tell you that the dialogue between service members is very much akin to what is shown in the movie. It is crass. It is disgusting. It is not wholesome. It is irreverent. The movie does an outstanding job of portraying the military experience of ""hurry up and wait"". The first two thirds of the movie are heavy amounts of dialogue, scenes showing soldiers working out, or humping packs up mountains with the occasional firefight that may last 60 seconds.The last scene is a visceral depiction of combat and I feel it does an amazing job portraying the odds that were stacked against the men at COP Keating. You easily empathize with the desperation the men likely fought as they did everything they could to help their brothers in arms and to not lose control of COP Keating. The movie relies heavily on this empathy and very little on gory depictions of violence to grip the viewers emotions and attention. That isn't to say the movie is without bloody depictions of wounds or kills, but it is very tame Compared to other R rated war movies.In something, The Outpost is an outstanding movie that greatly does justice to the story of the Combat deployed service member. I can't recommend this movie highly enough to anyone wanting to try to understand what the military experience is like when bullets aren't flying or to anyone wanting to get an accurate understanding of what it looks like to have everything go wrong during war.Side note, my only gripe is that in the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha tells a story of the JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) directing air assets onto targets. At one point, the JTAC had to take a shit, so was squatted over an empty ammo can as he was calling in bombs. Would have found it hilarious if that had made it into the movie."
37,"Well, I really felt so touched and the movie is so great with bravery.
However, the events were so realistic."
38,One heck if a movie. The fights were real. Quite scary to even think what happened there. We are all lucky to sit here and comment. Brilliant figbtback by the American forces against the taliban. My respect to the soldiers. My rating 10/10
39,"The Big Parade, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Story of G.I. Joe, A Walk in the Sun, Pork Chop Hill, Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, From Here to Eternity, Flags of Our Fathers - make no mistake about it, The Outpost will be included alongside each of them whenever the great 'modern' (post-1900) war films are listed and discussed. Like the others, the new Rod Lurie movie balances the anti-war sensibility that any sane person shares with all of humanity with a rousing/worthy tribute to those individual people and 'bands of brothers' (Shakespeare, Henry V) who, as Tennyson said, do not have the option of 'wondering why' they are catapulted into in hell on earth, only that they must 'do or die.' An Alamo like depiction of an actual battle during our never ending war in Afghanistan, Lurie's film (based on a non-fiction book by Jake Tapper of CNN) does not so much document the fighting as it thrusts you into the epicenter of this human storm, the highest compliment any movie on any subject can ever be awarded. Though completed (and originally scheduled for release) in 1919 (long-delayed), we can only hope that The Outpost will be considered for Academy Award nominations for the 2021 Oscars. If it is, watch it sweep the Academy Awards - including a long overdue one for the under-appreciated director! DOUGLAS BRODE, Author: From Hell to Hollywood: An Encyclopedia of World War II Films (Volume I and II)."
40,Two thumbs up! Intense action and great acting. I've watched a lot of Afghanistan war films and this is up there with one of the best. Hats off to Caleb and the rest of the crew. Definitely worth a watch. Would of been great to watch this on the big screen. Unfortunately this film will lay in my hidden gem category.
41,"Having read both The Outpost and Red Platoon I was really excited to hear that this story was being considered for theatrical release. I wanted to enjoy it so much but unfortunately I found it falling short of my expectations. The timeline felt very disjointed compared to its written page counterparts. I believe viewers who aren't familiar with what happened or haven't read the books will have trouble establishing a emotional connection with the characters. The Outpost severely lacks character development; as such you aren't able to get to know them intimately so you don't develop a bond with them throughout the course of the film. I gave it three stars because of the authenticity and devotion to the story. I felt the cinematography, special fx & costumes were all extremely well done."
42,"I went in with relatively low expectations but this was great. If they had added some Lone Survivor music would have been better perhaps. Cinematography was like Black Hawk Down and acting was top notch. Loved Eastwood's character but even the last scene was a tear jerker. There were a lot of characters, but you still get to hear about their general personal stories. I hear a lot about one shot filmography but this worked awesome how it was used. Big recommend and also loved seeing the younger sons bring out their fathers' acting characteristics like Gibson's as well."
43,"Hris movie hit hard to any Vet out there that has been in the thick of things, have lost friends, and has know that they may not come home from the tour. If you thought the opening of Saving privates Ryan was impressive, this is that but for 2 hours long. Highly recommend the movie."
44,"Well, this film was a pleasant surprise. After a somewhat confusing start with a couple of introductions and disconnected dialogue that felt cliche, the film really starts building up and by the time the massive attack happens, you're completely taken by the film, it just grabs you and never lets you go. This is supported by great performances from everyone, especially Caleb Landry Jones, he was so good in this, even Scott Eastwood, whom I don't consider a particularly good actor, delivered a good performance.I was never in a firefight, but the way the film depicts it feels very natural and much less Hollywood-like, I loved that there was no pompousness, no cinematic heroism, just men doing the best they can in a moment of crisis. Everyone did their part and it was shown to us.The film also looks very nice, I have to admit that some of the camera movements and drone usage were surprisingly refreshing, I had to re-watch some of the moments twice cause of how good they looked (props to Lorenzo Senatore). Some of the scenes were complicated and had lots of things in those, so I really think this is comparable to 1917 in terms of technical achievements.I expected this to be either a generic action film or a propaganda vehicle, but it is much more than that in a better sense of the word. The creators did a very good job honoring the memory of everyone involved and giving a couple of messages that are not invented by people who write pompous stories or political agendas, but by people who were there and tried to survive, losing friends (and not only friends..., a great final scene, by the way).A great film, very down-to-earth, dry, authentic. I recommend this for at least one viewing, also, be sure to stay till the end of the credits, since there is a lot of interesting information in those.I live in Europe and I am not very close to these events, but I fully support such films that help to communicate information to people and keep the rightful memory of the fallen."
45,It's great to watch a movie without an liberal agenda. This is an American film about Americans. God bless those soldiers. Clint Eastwood's son is really interesting to watch. He looks just like his old man. Well worth the time.
46,"By mistake, I went into this movie with a preconceived notion. That just shows not to judge something before you've seen it. This movie is based on the true story of Camp Keating in the Afghanistan mountains bordering Pakistan. Very realistic scenes, acting was good on an overall basis of the entire cast. It shows how the Pentagon was pressured from above to place an outpost in an area that is indefensible. Which ever top brass decided to place a outpost in the valley surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains should be stripped of his rank and sent home. If you Enjoy war movies, this is just for you. 😎"
47,Deer Hunter used to be my all time fav number 1 movie. Now it's number 2. This was such a great movie for understanding war and what those soldiers went through. I understand PTSD better now. I have a new appreciation for Memorial Day. Watch the interviews at the end of the soldiers who made it back. I am changed forever.
48,Very accurate depiction of the Afghanistan war. Action packed and great character development. Will not disappoint!! Easily up there with Fury and Zero Dark Thirty! A must watch!!
49,"Honestly, how did they get Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood signed onto this? The movie is a complete mess! There's no real direction, the writing is poor, acting is really sub par and it's just full of clichés. I didn't feel an attachment to any of the characters and didn't really feel any suspense or anticipation as to how it was going to play out. Just badly written and directed in my opinion."
50,"As a whole i believe this movie was great,
It had some meh moments for the sake of movie making..
But AS A WHOLE its A LOT better than 1917 which was overhyped to the skies..Its mind blowing how ppl give this movie 1* for reasons like:
""Director was not from europe..""""Nonrealistic, nonfactual movie..""
All of the stuff those REAL SOLDIERS talked about in credit WAS in the movie..
One of them even played HIMSELF..""i didnt see a movie whe F word was used so often..""
Srsly? 🤣""unrealistic how soldiers behave to each other""
Unlike most ""real"" friends, soldiers are villing to die for the guy next to them..Ppl should pull their heads out of their 🍑
World is bigger than your room"
51,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Outpost"" (2020) was surprisingly better then i expected it to be before watching it. Directing, acting and cinematography were better then in you average action war movie. And this film which is based on very true events superbly depicted a modern battle i think - the handheld camera was superb and really added to the realism - during battle sequence i literally forgot that i was watching a movie and not a documentary - it was that good.Overall, ""The Outpost"" is a very solid action / war movie. It depicts very real situation and shows the brutality of combat masterfully. A very solid movie."
52,"I think this one is a great war movie. Keeping in mind the budget is not as big as other great productions the result is quite satisfactory.
First, the movie is accurate to the facts. Second, acting here is great. Even not big stars here, excepting Orlando and Eastwood, the main cast is great. Real and believable. Last, cinematography and setting is great. It's unbelievable were the soldiers were sent. That hole was a trap.
So, overall a great action war movie based on a true story."
53,"I was really expecting a cheap VOD B-Movie, but this is actually a pretty harrowing film. I don't know how 'realistic' this movie actually is, but it definitely had me on edge.There's not much character development, but (to me) it didn't feel lacking. It's really the building sense of dread that gets to you. All of these guys are gonna die.Watching guys trying to pull their wounded to cover while taking fire is something you see in every war movie...but the difference is that in this film, the camera just keeps rolling without a cut, pulling you in to the moment even moreso - and watching this on a big TV makes a difference. The camera follows as guys repeatedly run through a hail of gunfire to resupply their defenses, and you're right there with them. It's as close to a first person experience as you'll get.The Outpost is probably the best in it's category. It's way better than that stupid Mark Wahlberg movie, and probably has an edge up on Black Hawk Down."
54,"A realistic movie about the hell that is combat. Clint Eastwood's son gives an amazing performance here, close your eyes and listen to Clint .. awesome. To all the people that think combat is like a video game and wants to defund military, watch this!"
55,The film is beautifully acted and we'll shot. The battle sequences are realistic and intense. It is one of best war films I've seen in a long while.
56,"This is a war film based on a true story. It takes place at an indefensible base in Kamdesh surrounded by mountains, They are targeted on a daily basis. The soldiers are required to be diplomats to the people shooting at them. Of course, being sitting ducks invites a major confrontation. The film was realistic. You didn't know who would live or die from the start other than Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom. They get paid too much to die in the first scene. The film does not make any political statements. It does show the horror of war in such a way as to question it.Guide: F-word. Male butt nudity."
57,"As war movies go, there seems to be little middle ground - they either are well made or low budget disasters .This film does sit in the middle in a way .
It is not a good movie by any standards, but perfectly watchable if your expectations aren't too high .
It is not Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, Hurt Locker, or anywhere near that level of film making .Where The Outpost falls short is the skill and craftsmanship of its creators .
There is a somewhat coherent storyline, but it is filled with stereotypical scenes and dialogue .
The acting is unremarkable for the most part, which is good ; because the few times the cast members are trying to really act, it gets corny and annoying , showing their lack of competence .The movie really falls apart during the second half, when the action happens .
Battle scenes are very hard to do well, and here we have editing, filming, scripting and directing - you name it - that doesn't manage to put together a picture the viewer can follow and be involved in .
It's just a messy pile of repetitive, disjointed shots, repeatedly running the story into dead ends , without the connecting arch good film makers create to turn even chaos into a coherent story .But considering how many really bad war movies there are , I thing this one still deserves a 4/10 , if barely ."
58,"My humble Respect to all those who sacrificed their lives, and continue to do so for the greater good. Thank you for this film for giving them due recognition."
59,"While the acting is maybe the best part of the movie (with the exception of Orlando Bloom's accent), it's still only just ok. But the writing and direction are what really let this movie down. The dialogue is clichéd and the foreshadowing is clumsy and telegraphs virtually every plot turn. Don't have high expectations going in and you may not be too disappointed. It's a movie that's probably best when watched while you're doing other things like surfing the web, or folding your laundry."
60,Hard to imagine going through this! This movie in my opinion was very well put together and I was at the edge of my seat from the start. Highly recommend watching and I truly appreciate all those who have/are putting their lives on the line for our freedom.
61,I seldom write reviews here but this movie deseves some credit.It was a long time since I saw such good war movie. Good story and visuals. Watch it you will not be dissapointed.
62,"I love solidly made and well-acted war movies, Told with gripping realism, The Outpost is a thrilling technical feat and a worthy tribute to military heroes.
The acting was great from the cast especially from Caleb Landry Jones who give it all in the movie.
It's a stunning war movie that goes epic in a very claustrophobic setting."
63,"This film is not biggest hit but normally if true story movies like this or others hits slaright to theaters I don't get why this film could have a theater release but shamefully it didn't but I know why because of COVID-19 but I still don't get why this film is not a hit still alongside with Black Hawk Down, We were Soldiers, Lone Survivor, American Sniper, 13 Hours. and Many more out their then this is film for you to watch I prefer this film better then remake of Midway that came out this early this year I know this Japanese invasion American war but this is Afghanistan war film, I thought sometimes you don't know about true story films that happened but now when it's made into a movie you now know film and realityI thought acting is good not the greatest or perfect but pretty good acting nothing wrong with acting I thought it's bit slow and some of scenes are unneeded like could of been taken out but it doesn't take me out of film but this film is far too slow but hey it's true story film no issue with that but just like with 13 Hours it's not long film the piecing is a lot quicker could done something like that. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently like you got cast is Scott Eastwood aka Clint Eastwood son as SSG Clint Romesha, CPT Ben Keating (Orlando Bloom) and CPT Robert Yllescas (Milo Gibson) aka other related father son actor Mel Gibson son. story follows 53 U.S. soldiers and two Latvian military advisors who battled a force of some 400 enemy insurgents in north-eastern Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom and deep in the valley of three mountains in Afghanistan, battles to defend against an overwhelming force of Taliban fighters in a coordinated attack, but in first hour film nothing really happens besides soldiers are just doing their own thing and messing around that's all then war doesn't happen until like for next hour then that's when everything hell breaks everything and I thought action war scenes were enjoyable fun, thrilling keeps you wondering what will happen next, It follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that you expect to see in a war movie. The added aspect of realism was the trauma that you can see in the actors portrayal of their characters eyes that can only be a glimpse into what they experienced. Watch the movie, read the book, or vice-versa. Just remember the names who were very brave, helped fight war, fighted for their country men deserved a medal of honor and tons of awards just like with this film I wish this film could got delayed rather then slaright to VOD if this came out of cinemas then this would been a hit and maybe Scott Eastwood could been known and award for medal for this movie but anyway it's what it isit's crazy how The movie does a good job of capturing the nerve-racking tension of being posted at Combat Outpost Keating. The high mountains around the camp provided the perfect perches for Taliban snipers to pick off the soldiers. outpost so dangerous that they had to put on their gear just to go outside to use the bathroom man it's like getting out of bathroom after taking a dump or anything like that or if you in their someone fires a shot while your in their I know it's not funny but wow that was reality it's crazy that something we haven't even heard of before in real life story just like what you gonna see in this movie. in this film what real life soldier said says Clint Romesha that played by Scott Eastwood if you curious How often was the camp attacked by Taliban insurgents On average, we'd get hit three to four times a week that's really insane. what I read about film the true story film the reality that's how I
should say rest of film is true but little isn't true but hey that's how movies do they tell whatever it's true or not in it. film didn't shot in Kamdesh but they film and shot at set created at the base of a mountain in Bulgaria, not far from the city of Sofia. The entire Outpost Keating was recreated. The other two mountains that surrounded the actual outpost were inserted with CGI of Crouse film is based on company that made tons and tons great action films one of my favorite company's of time millennium films who did Expendables franchise, Hunter Killer, The Mechanic, Rambo V Last Blood many more to name I reckon it's great film company I luv and liked their films including this one I highly recommded watching this movie please give it a chance and give it a watch find a great time watching it's brilliant 8.10 for film and memorial of those brave soldiers who fighted their country and who fighted war will not be forgotten"
64,"The Outpost tells us the story of the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan - a small US outpost was surrounded and attacked by strong Taliban forces. The Outpost is a solid war movie with some fine combat scenes in the end chapter. Recommended if you like to watch such (war) movies like Lone Survivor, American Sniper, Battle for Haditha, The Wall etc.Last note: people expecting character development (means mostly personal drama), quality of dialogues etc. should watch something else but a war movie...."
65,"I am a bit mystified why this does not have a better rating. It was entertaining and realistic, with no boring parts or cheesy patriotism. It really showed how life in the army was in Afghanistan and the panic and terror and confusion of battle. Some other commenters have criticised it for being one-sided, but it clearly shows the battle from the US point-of-view, and why not? It is an 8 or 9; I gave it a 10 to try and help make up for the unfair low marks given by some others. If you want an entertaining and realistic action movie, you will not go wrong with The Outpost."
66,"As far as military movies go, they've got this one pretty much to a T. Even the mention of the actual callsign for that unit down range was spot on. Most of these movies don't really hit him unless you've been there. For me, I was there the day this actually happened. May have not been on that exact FOB, but I was 30 min down the road listening to it on the radio. A very good friend of mine was on that FOB that day...the token black guy is him. For Hollywood to actually get a movie right to damn near every comma is immaculate. The only discrepancy I have is the accuaracy of the date. But thats no fault of Hollywood, you can blame the big green weenie for that. They never want to be made out to be the bad guy, when they were in this situation. Its the same with ""Restrepo"", dates in that movie are wrong too. This fight didn't happen in 2009, it happened on July 4th 2013. Ask 3-61 what happened to the Blacknights when they got home from that deployment. Ask them where that callsign went. They either won't have an answer, or give you a bull**** one."
67,This movies was good don't know why it's underrated. The imersive experience of the wonderful shots were good.
68,"Very intense,true story.realistic battle scenes and well acted."
69,"No super hero stunts, no huge speech, just a very good movie based in a real life story."
70,"It was a tragedy that they were put in such a position by their commanders. It was a story of heroism and the bond that soldiers have in their commitment to fulfill any mission at all costs. The realism, acting, and production were incredibly well done. I finished with tears in my eyes, wishing I could run out on the combat field and help them get out and back home safely. A reminder of the gratitude we owe the men and woman who so proudly serve our country."
71,Thanx for the crew for such an amazing movie experience.
72,"I am a fairly well read man and truth be told I did not have the slightest inkling about this particular incident upon which the movie is based. You would assume that the strongest military in the world would be smarter than setting up a Base at the bottom of a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides.This is a story that deserved to be told and kudos to the director for doing exactly that.What irks me is when they try to mislead the audience by promoting a movie using a big name actor(If you can call Orlando Bloom a big name actor) who has a cameo in the movie. Orlando Bloom is in a cameo in the movie but the way the movie is promoted it would seem that he is the main character. As they say, build it and they will come. If you make a good movie the audience will come.Another thing that seriously irked me about the movie is the video game sort of directing. I am old school and that really gets on my nerves. Why repair something that is not broken. What was wrong with the way Saving Private Ryan was shot. Always makes me wonder if they benefitted in any way by doing something to appease a certain audience. How many video game addicts out there said....we dont generally watch movies but because the director made a movie that is shot like a video game we made an exception and watched it. I bet nobody did.Other than that its a really good movie. Definitely one of the best movies to have released since the Theater lockdown."
73,"This movie teachers you a lot about military discipline and management style. Absolutely heroic fight war. Salute!! You will not be disappointed, go on and watch it and enjoy it"
74,"The movie is well-made, the acting, directing and script is fine, but the idea of building military outposts in hostile Afghan territory, and in the open and poorly defended valley is just ridiculous. Therefore, taking into account the fact this is a serious military movie based on the true story that wants to pay respects to those brave soldiers who fought and died there doesn't make any sense. The essence of the movie is just lost.Regarding true story part, historically Afghanistan was never conquered nor ruled. There are many years of struggle with Taliban and thousands of foreign soldiers lost. Building such an outpost in the hostile territory is just silly. All those families who lost their members there should question intellect of those who sit in Pentagon."
75,"In my house, it was silent when this film ended. That doesn't happen often with streaming movies. The true achievement of this film is the heart and soul and heroism that's interjected between the white-knuckle action. Rarely do films strike such a fine balance. So many people are talking about this on social media, I'd expect the wave of The Outpost enthusiasm to grow and grow. Well deserved!"
76,The movie is bad but not that bad.It had a lot of potential but it felt like the dialogue was written by pre-schoolers and the acting was borderline bad. It felt like watching generation kill with bad actors and unnatural like soldier dialogue.
77,"Thrilling, Emotional, Realistic and some great acting."
78,Really well done. Intense from start to finish. The interviews at the end are inspiring. Brotherhood and sacrifice throughout the entire film. Highly recommended.
79,AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE TOP 5 WAR MOVIES OF ALL TIMES!!
80,"Watching the trailer I thought this looked better than your average military action flick, but trailers are nothing if not often deceiving, so I was cautiously optimistic.
Also, many low-to-mid budget military action films tend to have unrealistic characters and dialogue, so I was worried about that as well.
Happy to say that this movie really surprises you, in the best possible way.
I went into it somewhat familiar with the real life events, but if you aren't you'll probably won't know who's going to die and who'll survive.
What I particularly liked is the slow cook pacing, which sprinkles just enough action and tension up until the big battle to keep you engaged. The characters pretty much ALL felt real and flawed, and the dialogue felt incredibly natural, mixed with real military jargon that helped legitimize it more. The trailer present it as though this whole movie is one big action scene, when it reality the first half is the lead up to the terrible scenario that unfolds. I loved how they show the outpost morale being affected with each new CO, and they truly managed to capture the essence of occupying an isolated outputs where you're constantly having to deal with periods of boredom interrupted by intense near death scenarios. Not to mention, having to put up with centralized command and all the often inept bureaucracy of the higher ups. A poor execution of this idea would lead to a slow paced movie, but this is not the case. Not every scene is action-packed, but there is tension throughout most, and the flow is consistent and doesn't drag at all. They did a great job conveying the comradely and dissent between the soldiers (yes, those two things can co-exist). All in all, it felt A LOT more realistic than what I was expecting, and I was very much engaged. From what I understand they had real people from the actual outpost help them during filming and some even played extras. Worth the watch and then some! A very well-crafted glimpse of the outpost soldier's life, the frustration, feeling of helplessness, and outright terror and suddenness of combat. Battle scenes looked good for the most part. I can see the director was ambitious and wanted to show as much as he could from an up-and-personal POV. Didn't always work for me. You can nitpick on some stuff but I enjoyed the first half enough that the second half felt engaging even if I didn't love all the shots. Actors all did a great job throughout. Enjoyed this ride more than I thought I would."
81,Starts off a little slow but once the attack starts it's pretty intense watch the end credits as the real soldiers tell their story
82,If you like the general theme you will like this movie. Though if you like continuity and getting to know the characters then you might not. To me it was just a bunch of decent scenes in Afghanistan in random order.
83,A leader who hopes for peace. As much as he can get.Weird stuff goes down in the military. And some people do stupid things.Shouldn't the escort vehicle have a cover for the top gunner?No one should have to be in such a situation.I hope films like this generate more yearning for peace than anger.Awful quiet and solitary mess hall.
84,I was going into thinking this is just another action movie but its honestly so good im writing my first review!
85,Good movie worth the watch. Always sad to know it was a true story
86,So I was looking forward to watching this movie based on the cast and premise. It is filled with alot young and upcoming stars. Plus the fact its military movie and true story.The acting by everyone involved was great. It almost felt like you were there and were throughly connected to all of them. I also thought the visuals were vivid and out of this world. The movie overall definitely exceeded my expectations on few different levels.My only major complaint about this movie would be the pacing. I felt at first it kind of dragged for awhile. Kind like your dog when they don't want to go inside. However I recommend no one get discouraged because I feel like lot people did or might of. The last 30 or so minutes of this movie have to be seriously one most epic actions scenes I ever seen. If not the best in war film ever.Overall I would recommend this movie highly it is very engaging.
87,"This movie was felt very real. You could feel the heat, the smell, the dirt, the reality that war can be pointless. This is a very well made movie about real war, and Real Heroes with the help of great actors, a good director and a great DOP.I dont understand the low ratings."
88,"Excellent re-enactment of the battle of karmdesh, one of the bloodiest confrontations between US forces and the taliban, in 2009. The banter and dialogue is credible and the battle (which takes up the entire second half of the film) is brilliantly and chaotically executed. Cast is ably led by Scott Eastwood - who is beginning to look more and more like his father with each passing film. Incidentally, he plays a soldier called Clint - Sgt Clint Romesha, awarded medal of honour. Riveting stuff."
89,"Really shows the onslaught of Taliban forces. Really good film.Only negatives - Didn't like when Broward shot Scusa's dog.
& Didn't like how the soldiers took forever to do things and kept popping their head out when facing enemy fire - bit unrealistic. More urgency needed.Overall, belter Afghanistan war film."
90,Knew about this story from Netflix medal of honor series. Good to watch if you like war movies w firefights.
91,"Based on an actual battle fought between American forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan ""The Outpost"" is a raw, realistic depiction on the carnage of modern warfare and the humanity reacting to and affected by it. Vividly recreating the struggle from the American point of view the film recreates the interactions of the men as they face the daunting task of their mission where terrain and numbers are highly stacked against them. The horrors and brutalities of war are all too real here: gunfire, explosions, screams, blood and sacrifice hold court. The skillfully executed cinematography and good acting bring those to full force. Scott Eastwood is the heart and soul of the film as his tough and considerate portrayal give a gravity and depth to what leadership stands for. Slow-going in parts with lots of talking (this ain't no ""Platoon"" or ""Band of Brothers"") but the message gets through. War as it is whether you want it or not, this is a solid and unflinching look at combat."
92,"In coming to a war/combat movie as one knows you are in for with a title like THE OUTPOST, you bring with it as a filmgoer certain expectations: There'll be the tough brave rebel, there'll be the innocent who just wants to get home and put all this behind him, there's respected leadership and the leader who demands but hasn't earned respect, and then there's THE MAIN BATTLE sequence. Yup, the best ones have these tropes, the worst ones. And THE OUTPOST is not out to rewrite the book in the well executed war drama. But in effect THE OUTPOST hits these tropes with a kind eye and heart for detail of the very real young men this story is based on - nobody here is a cliche - even when their words and actions may at first glance render them as such - nobody's heart aches similar to another's, and we feel all the particulars of the here and now so adroitly and with neither political flag waving nor with insultingly on the nose sentimentality. These are just our soldiers in harms way... but in harms way multiplied by 100 and for no discernible good reason. THE OUTPOST is a painfully real story of an Afghanistan skirmish and the young men called on to defend an indefensible Outpost while making friends with the natives who don't want them there either. A great story doesn't necessarily mean a NEW story or an ORIGINAL story, no it means a story told with care and an eye and empathy for the details of the human experience. That what THE OUTPOST delivers upon. While at the same time... yeah it delivers the goods of a white knuckles war thriller. Rod Lurie's film is bravaura first person shooter you are there fighting a fruitless war in Afghanistan. It is a nightmare. Where COs are reassigned or just die in a skirmish in the night. Where a soldier you may personally hate May wind up being closer to you than anyone you'll ever know. There should certainly be best supporting actor Oscar talk for Caleb Landry Jones."
93,"As with Kilo Two Bravo, I find its best to watch these films in a way that allows you to back up and rewatch some scenes to fully understand all of the dialogue. Lots of slang and soldier speak, so for me I can't conceptualize all of it the first time through. Also takes some time to be able to truly recognize each character and tell them apart.With that said, this a great film about what soldiers deal with in places like AFG, I was vaguely familiar with this story having seen Sgt Romesha's story told in a documentary about CGMH recipients. But this version does a phenomenal job of putting you right there in the action. I thought the pacing was brilliant, slowly builds up to the epic battle, and I appreciated the fact they spent some time afterwards to explain what happened to each solider."
94,"I've always had a knack for biopic movies. There's a feeling of relatability. And this was one movie one could relate with coupled with the fact it dealt with historical accounts of soldiers in the Afgan war.
The transitions were totally spot on. Granted the dialogue could have been better, but it was a great effort."
95,"Yes it's a movie and therefore contains accentuated characters and some fiction - it isn't ""on-the-fly"" documentary/news. The storyline is based on actual events (note the word storyline it contains the word story).
Was I glued to the screen? Hell yes.
Would I recommend to other mature, understanding friends or veterans? Hell yes.
Note to the few critics wanting more - join up in the military and volunteer for active duty."
96,Why? 1000's of other actors in the world to play that role and they pick one that has the worst American accent this side of Gerard Butler. It really take me out of his scenes. It really all over the place.Otherwise this movie was a pleasant surprise.
97,"When I first read the story of the battle of Kamdesh I was hoping that Hollywood or one of the streaming giants would make a film about it. The story itself is truly amazing as U.S. soldiers overcome the odds of being outnumbered and at a tactical disadvantage to the Taliban when COP Keating is attack by massive insurgent force. When I finally saw the trailer for the film I was excited as it looked promising with a good cast, good visuals and decent effects. The movie ultimately did not disappoint in its dipiction of the battle and the events leading up to it. The film definitely gives a true insight into the conditions the men faced at COP Keating; the issues they had dealing with leadership, the locals and constantly being contacted by the enemy. The performances of the actors were solid, at some points in the movie you see a couple wooden performances but for the most part it was done well considering most of the cast are up incoming. I found Scott Eastwood's performance as Clint Romesha was good but sometimes it looked like he was channeling his dad Clint Eastwood instead. I think the best performance came from Caleb Landry Jones as Ty Carter. Another criticism of the movie is the writing, it felt inconsistent in quality. The movie had chucks of dialog that could have been better written or maybe the delivery of them could have been better. Overall this is one of the better War on Terror category war film."
98,"Way above average war movie based on real events not that much known... till now thanks to this well-made flick from the book of CNN's Jake Tapper.Cinematography, production, acting are all top-notch, well intertwined
in a story that engages you from second one.The sequence of events till the dramatic finale are a ride to a battlefield that you will appreciate to the max, not only because of its dramatic character, but because of its historic content.Eastwood is fantastic, you can tell he is got the best genes from his old-man, same as Briton actor Orlando Bloom as the first commander to give his life for his country. He will not the last one.If you have some extra time, you life historic action movies, and you have some bucks on your pocket, then i suggest you to grab your seat in your local cinema, and bring your brother or a male friend or your dad or cousin who love history as well.my humble opinion: do not make the mistake to bring a date or a girl or maybe your wife as this film has its share of blood, pain, tears, bombs, bullets and drama in the middle of war against a vicious enemy.but if your girl loves those kinds of things, then bring her on.The Outpost is one of the best movies of this year, in my opinion worthy of some oscar nominations, as you can tell the huge effort put into eat, you can see the directing and the photography shots are riveting.There is even a cultural clash examination as you may see different american commanders negotiating with tribe elders in the mountains of afghanistan. those scenes were very well done, with lots of care, respect and authenticity, making you realize immediately that The Outpost is not only guns and bullets.Enjoy the movie."
99,"Nowadays nobody makes movies about Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghan wars. UK and USA have this problem that they only consider history if happened in the 1910s or 1940s, nothing before or after is ever made into a movie. So The Outpost does a good job breaking this cycle. Finally we can see a war movie that is actually current."
100,The movie reminded me of other battles like Dien Bien Phu and Khe Sanh. Why anyone thought building a base at the bottom of a valley with hills on all sides was a good idea is beyond me.The character development was excellent for a movie of this kind. I found myself caring about the individuals as well as the whole base.The B-1 bombing run was one of the most memorable combat scenes I've ever seen on film.Well worth a watch if interested in movies of this genre.
101,"Realistic and full of tension, a war film that cuts to the point and proves that Scott Eastwood can be good."
102,My son is JSOC and yes they really talk to each other like that. The movie was such a real depiction of battle that it took a while for my body to calm down and relax after watching it.
103,"Great movie, but what really caught my eye was the camera work and long takes."
104,"Well done and a pleasant surprise. Lots of action, not for the faint of heart."
105,"Any real soldier who fought in AFG or Iraq knows enemies don't run around and yelling or coming to attack like that, or American soldiers talking all corny to each other and to friendly's like a bunch of goofy excited Americans.
Afghans don't look or talk like that. IT WAS ONCE CALLED ARYANA for a reason.
Also copied ending scene from Saving Private Ryan.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL FILM ABOUT AFGHANISTAN, watch one that is made by a real director, and those who know the history.
This director is a joke. The film is a joke.
You get 1 star because it's Eastwood's son."
106,"This film start with the introduction of the outpost establish by U.S. army, and a bunch of U.S. soldiers flying on a chopper scene! As turnout, this film is about a series of U.S. commander officers need to command a bunch of private soldiers to take down the Taliban fighters! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the yelling scene, and overuse of the switching left angle to right angle scene! Make the film unwatchable! Majority shooting scene never show the opponent getting hit! Make the film quite frustrated to watch! The explosion scene simply hit here and there, not intense at all! Barely intense scene is, the choppers blow up a bunch of Taliban fighters! At the end, Romesha talk to his wife! Carter talking about he can't save Mace! Still have a series of interview video footage of the real U.S. soldiers, alongside the credit scene! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
107,"Great movie everything and all actors were on point, sad story but needs to be told"
108,Very authentic and one of the best war stories ever!!
109,"* There are documentary scenes starting at the mid-end credit *The director Rod Lurie and crew brought magnificently to life a war film based on a true story about soldiers battling to survive against Taliban fighters in an outpost. I have watched many war films and this one made it to my top three, it felt so real as it can be. From the moment it started I instantly felt the greatness I was about to watch. The tension never stopped building up due to an unstoppable threat lurking all around them, what a terrifying feeling not knowing when they are going to be shot at and it captures the reality of it. The way they focus on the soldiers had a sense of truth by exploring what they do when they off duty giving them personality and how they miss home. Some are attached to what they left behind while others are focused on their mission to survive for what they left behind. The introduction of them was necessary for one not to only have a real war perspective but to get emotional when death comes. It shows how they look out for each other no matter even if they don't like one another, from the moment the mission starts all of that fades away and each of them tries their hardest to protect one another. It also explores how the chain of command keeps one in check of making a better decision due to rank, sadly it is something that happens everywhere, no matter what is right, following orders by rank is an obligation in which by this case could lead to victory or to disaster. The best line this movie had was: ""don't rush for failure"", something to be reminded of every day.The composer Larry Groupé brought one of the best suspenseful music. I have mentioned how I knew from the start that I was going to love this film and it was truly thanks to the music. So perfect for this kind of story, especially since it focuses so much on the tension, this music amplified the intensity with a haunting theme.The cast was perfection, everyone performed incredibly especially Orlando Bloom. I will honestly say that I was never truly a fan, yes he is a good actor but his name in a movie never had me looked twice at it until now. This performance was his best I have ever seen and he deserves an Oscar! The way he portrayed his character made me believe every word, I would have followed his commands without question."
110,"Beautiful cinematography.
Camerawork is superb so is directing and acting.
Started slow and built up to some of the best action."
111,"One of the best movie. I cried at last. It's not like playing PUBg or COD.
Man..! It's real a thing..!Salute Marines..! Semper Fi..!"
112,"War movies are thrilling, at least for us men. Haven't seen such an intense battle for a while. Good job."
113,"The Outpost is a new war drama movie directed by Rod Lurie, the director of Nothing But the Truth and The Contender.The film is about the American mission of a small group of soldiers consisting of 53 men, who defend the remote outpost Keating against the Taliban in Afghanistan. In this way they hope to support and defend the local population during social projects. When the US military decides to close outpost Keating, the remaining soldiers are surprised by a major attack by the Taliban. The soldiers must now protect the outpost and the population for the last time against an invasion of hundreds of Taliban fighters.Director Rod Lurie and photography director Lorenzo Senatore have portrayed the film in a good and exciting way. This makes it feel as if you, as a viewer, are also part of the small group of American soldiers, who are often attacked by surprise attacks by the Taliban. The film feels a bit like the war films The Hurt Locker and 1917. This film also shows well what life-threatening missions soldiers can experience and why some of these soldiers have received the Medal of Honor.Although the film is beautifully portrayed, you quickly forget who plays which soldier and what they are called. Only the more famous actors such as Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood can be recognized earlier in the film thanks to their fame. Despite this unfamiliarity of the cast, as staff sergeant Ty Carter, Caled Landry Jones still manages to put in good acting in the film and almost carries the film."
114,"This movie hits the high-points in the story of the Battle of Kamdesh. There are some real Army scenarios and stories in the movie but it lacks character development. The book is really long, the movie had to cut a lot of the story to make it ""fit"" within the proposed movie timeline. While the scenery for the movie looks great, and the action scenes are super-intense, more backstory and more development of the characters would've made the story's impact more effective. Yes, I've read the book, so my expectations were high. The movie is definitely worth watching, but the story worth more exploration to give the Soldiers who died proper honor and credit."
115,"A great attempt to draw you into the moment. Good acting, excellent cinematography and a hellish story. Worth a view."
116,Its been a while since I watched a war movie that gave me goose bumps when the end credits rolled but this one certainly did. Hacksaw ridge was the last film to do that. This film stars Clint Eastwood's son and the more well known actor Orlando Bloom. Basic plot as a group of American soldiers are stationed in the most stupidly positioned Outpost that leaves them as sitting ducks to the Taliban as the Outpost is completely surrounded by huge hills on nearly all sides. The first half of the film does well at drawing you into the characters and the action is enough to keep you interested as the plot unfolds. The second half is all out war watching the soldiers defending their Base against 100s of Taliban who have them surrounded. Remember to watch the end credits!
117,"At a two hour runtime, this film feels a lot longer - and that's not necessarily a good thing. The first hour is unbearably slow-moving and not very informative to the audience. The first few enemy encounters with random gunfire were a bit confusing for me because they really don't explain why in fact they are even at the Outpost. However, the biggest disappointment for me (other than the very lacklustre dialogue and sluggish pace) was the insufficiency in character development in that hour - and so unfortunately when the epic third act battle does finally arrive, you are not really invested in any of the characters. The last 45 minutes however, are non-stop, high energy action that I found well acted and shot. It's definitely not the best or the worst war film I've ever seen but if I had to describe it - it would be forgettable."
118,REALLY low-budget movie. A bunch of random talking and messing around with very brief scenes of shooting at an enemy that is barely even SHOWN! Orlando Bloom is pretty boring in the 30 minutes he is even in the movie. The rest of the actors are pretty horrible.
119,Great scenes with amazing camera work. All of the actors are great! This movie really gives you the feeling you are in the middle of the highly realistic fight. Definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
120,"The only reason I am writing this comment is because I tend to pay attention to the ratings movies get. So, obviously with an 8.7 rating and over a 100 reviews I expected a way over average experience. especially since the movie was apparently based on a true story. There wasn't any need for an understanding of the English language though. I have never ever heard the f word in so many forms and situations. This actually made the movie unwatchable for me as I do not believe this is the way soldiers would speak to each other 100% of the time. And since the dialogue is an important part of any movie it made watching this one impossible."
121,"This is a bad movie! Horribly made, total waste of good actors like Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood!Do waste your time, watch some other war movies instead!"
122,"Good movie and gives an insight to what our troops endure. Not accurate though, it combines a 3-4 year timeline to tell the story. Keating was already dead and 2 other Army groups had occupied the base before 3-61. They weren't there when he was. I understand wanting to try and tell the whole story of the place, but Keating's story could've been told or shown separate. It tells the story, but not chronologically. It leaves out the stories of Bostick and Yllescas that set up what happens there also. Read The Outpost and Red Platoon and you'll get the full story and true timeline"
123,"""The Outpost"" is based on a non-fiction book of the same name by Jake Tapper, which details the Battle of Kamdesh, one of the bloodiest battles for US forces in the Afghan region. But, with the B outfit 'Screen Media Films' handling distribution, ""The Outpost"" was doomed to a VOD release even before COVID-19 closed movie theaters indefinitely. And when you once see the movie, you understand why it is the case. Everything here feels familiar, while director rarely digs below the surface of the individuals fighting in it. You will like the movie, only if you are an American with strong military connections, because film fails to capitalize on any broader theme, while winds up feeling stuck and restless. Here, there is no broader message, while it didn't even documented at all how human (US Generals) errors led to the loss of life. Without that kind of overarching strategy, movie falls to pieces, much like the combat outpost it portrays.Rating: 5- (If you want really to enjoy modern Acton/War thrilling movie ""Lone Survivor"" is a much, much better option)"
124,"While some are losing their lives to protect our country and the american people,
some choose the internet and fight behind their computer keyboard to destroy our lives and our country.
This an amazing movie about what america is all about, relentless courage and determination in face of the enemy, BRAVO"
125,"Get your popcorn and something to support your jaw, coz it drops alot in this seat of your pants gripping war film.Feel lucky you live the comfortable life you do, because someone else does this stuff so you don't need to."
126,"The Outpost is a meticulously crafted telling of a story about fighting a counterinsurgency at Camp Keating, Afghanistan. The movie adaptation from Rod Lurie of sections of the book 'The Outpost' by Jake Tapper achieves two incredible feats. First, it honors the sacrifice and service of the Soldiers who served at Camp Keating and fought in the Battle of Kamdesh, by being gritty and authentic. Second, it translates and preserves the atmosphere, emotion, sacrifice and heroic events that occurred on that tiny patch of remote land for anyone who watches the film. The Outpost is a true work of art that gives the world a window into the authentic American Soldier and demonstrates the power of being willing to lay down your life for another."
127,"One of the best war action movie. I personally felt as if I was on the scene and could feel it happening in front of me. Definitely an 8 out of 10
For me it is in the likes of Black Hawk Down"
128,"This one was really intense. If you like war movies and battles with valorous men, this one is for you. Great effects and camera work, actors really deliver."
129,"In the beginning I actually liked this film. And then that one scene came up. It's at 31:43, where they speak with a soldier from Latvia.
I understand that Latvia was occupied by Russians. But you know we got our freedom back. And we have our own language as well.
So why the hell that soldier from ""Latvia'', has a Russian accent?? Like every movie or TV show. If there's a character from Latvia, and he speak English, he has a Russian accent... I know, I know. That's a small scene and whatever. But cmon. Is it so hard to open YouTube and check out how Latvians speak and how Russians speak?? When we speak English, we don't have Russian accent!"
130,"I guess you could say it's realistic but how is it possible to place the outpost on a location like that? Also, organization and preparation in the camp seemed to be surprizingly poor, compare to what you would expect from US forces. Probably, the real troops acted more professionally in a extremely difficult situation than the characters in the movie who seem to rely more on luck than training."
131,God/dess BLESS our MEN and WOMEN in UNIFORM. We owe them the deepest gratitude and this movie will remind you of that. Amazingly EPIC film. Fantastic acting... super realistic and beautifully done. Every American (and more) should see it.
132,"Super well directed, beautifully and skilfully photographed, the cast and acting first rate.
A new achievement in cinematic excellence. Thrilling and captivating! Congrats to all involved and the actual heroes of war."
133,"First of all, any rating less than 8 or 9 is just balderdash. Second of all Caleb Landry Jones deserves an Oscar nom at the very least for his work here. I think I got the shakes just from watching this. It'll affect you. It SHOULD affect you."
134,"I went into this movie not knowing the details about the true story. So, I can't speak to the accuracy of the events. I can tell you that, by the 50-minute mark, I found myself tuning out. The cast is huge, making it sometimes difficult to keep track of everyone. I also felt that, up until this point, the movie felt like nothing more than an overly macho band of bad-ass military guys. That's when things took off. From that point forward, it's a roller coaster until a highly emotional ending.
The cast is fantastic. I thought Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom were both solid. But IMO the stand out goes to Caleb Landry Jones. He put in a truly gut-wrenching performance as SPC Ty Carter.
Be sure to stay for the credits to see Jake Tapper's interviews with the real-life soldiers."
135,All Are Heroes in this very intense must see film. Thank You For Your Service.
136,Soooo much action and no love story this might be my favorite war movie 💪🏼
137,"My BIL's battle buddy took his last breath in Nishagam, not too far from Kamdesh and, while I didn't know this battle was similar and I don't know if I wanted to really know first-hand what it was like for him, I'm glad I saw the movie. I do feel like I have a pretty good idea of what it must have been like. In fact, I don't think they politicized this movie as much as they could have. The film pulled the viewer into the milieu immediately and we were gripped to our seats the entire time. The claustrophobia of the locale, the base, the tension was captured perfectly. Heroes all. Never forgotten. Thank you for your service."
138,"The acting is good, its well paced and the battle Sceans are f'n intence, it's like your immerced in it praying it will stop... 🔞
Irs all such a sad storey on a personal level.. I guess that's how was is done. But its hard not to notice the brutal waste of life & the stark futility of fighting for stratigic spots of land. That won't even matter a s#!t tomorrow..."
139,The unrelenting action and no nonsense directing and acting credit this movie. Scott Eastwood is a star actor.
140,This movie would be a 10 if they wouldn't do the shaky-camera-cinematography. I'm so sick of it! Please stop making movies with that horrible method it doesn't make it more thrilling; it just makes people sick.
141,"A straightforward tale of survival, Rod Lurie's 'The Outpost' isn't flashy or pretty but it's a riveting old-fashioned war movie at heart. Though there are action-movie moments in the movie, Lurie goes for authenticity as much as possible in the production. The persistent action is well-choreographed with long, uninterrupted takes that immerse the viewer in the carnage. Caleb Landry Jones gives a superb, outstanding performance."
142,"This film starts out slow with character intros but quickly gets under way telling the story of the tragically situated Combat Outpost Keating in Afghanistan. The final 45 minutes will surely have you on the edge of your seat, and you may find yourself, as I did, wiping tears from your eyes."
143,"One of the reasons I enjoyed the film The Hurt Locker so much was because of how realistic it seemed. When I watched that film, it almost had a documentary feel to it. And during some of the battle scenes, it felt as if the audience was right there, among the action. Another film that took place in a war zone and felt realistic and documentary-like, was Rescue Dawn, one of the most criminally underappreciated films I've ever seen. No doubt the director's (Werner Herzog) extensive experience making documentaries aided in portraying Dawn in such a realistic manner. And now, there's another war film that rivals both Locker and Dawn, and that war film is The Outpost. And it may be the best one yet, in my humble opinion. There are so many technical achievements in Outpost, that it would be worth watching for that reason alone. But, thankfully, the true story that surrounds this technically proficient film is absolutely gripping, so much so, that it will not easily let you out of its grasp, even days after watching it. I watched it with my dad on Saturday night (10-3-20), and it's still with me today. I cannot get over what these soldiers went through on that day...something I think most of them knew was inevitable. They were sitting ducks in one of the most poorly placed outposts in United States military history. And once the main battle begins, it does not let up for a considerable amount of time. Indeed, during that scene, the action was non-stop and graphic, and my dad and I both were on the edge of our seats. The Outpost is one of the best war films I've ever seen. The story, the writing, the direction, and the acting...all exceptional, and all worthy of recognition by the major awards associations, including the Academy Awards. I would not be surprised to see nominations for numerous technical awards and the individual ones as well, especially for the performance of Caleb Landry Jones. In fact, there's a scene near the conclusion of the film where his character is being counseled regarding the difficult things he saw and did during the battle. It's probably the most powerful scene in the film, and much of that has to do with Jones' portrayal of his character's interactions with the counselor. It's powerful, moving, and heartbreaking.Right now, with 11 or so weeks left to go in what has been a very long and unusual year, The Outpost sits atop the list of my five favorite films from 2020. Could that change before the end of the year? Maybe. Will it? I doubt it."
144,This is an incredible story if bravery and brotherhood and it happened in our generation. It's a story that must be told. These stories are reminders to be grateful for the brave men and women that fight for us.
145,"""Last Castle "" director Rod Lurie's harrowing tale of combat in Afghanistan ""The Outpost"" gives us a glimpse of a baptism by fire comparable to Brian Trenchard-Smith's ""The Siege at Firebase Gloria"" (1989) and Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). Based on a true incident, this heroic epic draws ostensibly on two published sources: CNN reporter Jake Tapper's ""The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor"" (2012) and Sergeant Clinton Romesha's memoir ""Red Platoon: A True Story Of American Valor"" (2016). Hyperbole aside, this adrenalin-laced, testosterone-fueled, high-octane depiction of fewer than 60 gallant American soldiers repulsing an onslaught of 300 Taliban insurgents is genuinely inspiring. Mind you, considering the disadvantages our guys faced, it is all the more gratifying because these fearless Americans triumphed over a relentless enemy that tried to annihilate them! Simultaneously, the sacrifices to life and limb here will evoke patriotic tears.During the slow-burn first hour of this two hour plus account, ""Finest Hours"" scenarists Paul Tamasy & Scott Johnson and Lurie acquaint us with far too many Americans to remember and then plunge us into a helter-skelter reenactment of the Battle of Kamdesh. Historically, this combat occurred in 2009, when Taliban troops launched a devastating attack on Combat Outpost Keating. According to director Rod Lurie, Millennium Media duplicated all of the violence in Bulgaria on a shoe-string budget rather than venture into rugged Afghanistan where all the blood was spilled. Nevertheless, the producers have commemorated the exploits of living and dead alike without resorting to maudlin sentiment. The end credits reveal this battle was singular because it boasted two living Medal of Honor recipients. Miraculously, only eight U.S. Army servicemen died. Sadly, some 22 personnel received wounds during this make-or-break attack.Initially, ""The Outpost"" presents strategy, facts, and opinions to keep in mind. ""In 2006, the U.S. Army established a series of outposts in Northern Afghanistan to promote counterinsurgency. The intent was to connect with the locals and to stop the flow of weapons and Taliban fighters from Pakistan. One of these was PRT Kamdesh. It was built in a remote valley completely surrounded by the Hindu-Kush Mountains. One analyst said it may as well be called 'Camp Custer.' His reasoning was simple and official. Everyone at the Outpost was going to die."" Basically, Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines 'counterinsurgency' as ""organized military activity designed to combat insurgency."" Meanwhile, 'insurgency' means ""a condition of revolt against a government that is less than an organized revolution and that is not recognized as belligerency."" This preface prepares audiences for a largely factual film designed to keep them on the edge of their seat.
""The Outpost"" unfolds in a series of chapters. Each chapter is named after the commander-in-charge at the time. The film opens with an American chopper landing under cover of darkness at Camp Kamdesh with replacements. Grim-faced Staff-Sergeant Clinton Romesha (Scott Eastwood of ""Fury"") rides strapped into the front seat of the whirlybird as it descends. Blessed with his father's chiseled, matinee idol looks, Eastwood portrays one of the two Medal of Honor winners. The younger Eastwood acquits himself competently as one of the few soldiers to survive combat without any serious wounds. After casing the suicidal camp he must defend, Romesha crawls into his bunk for some well-deserved sack time. He frowns at a phrase scrawled on the slants of the bed above him: ""It doesn't get any better."" The prevailing opinion among the occupants of Combat Outpost Keating was they felt like fish in a barrel waiting for the Taliban to shoot them. Without fail every day, these G.I.s are told the Taliban plans to storm their camp. After a while, our guys treat these ominous warnings with the same skepticism until the unbelievable happens and the Taliban attacks.Life for the commanders of Camp Kamdesh is no picnic. The first CO is CPT Ben Keating (Orlando Bloom of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy""), and he maintains friendly relations with the native Afghans, like a calvary commander in the Old West would have with reservation Indians. He dies trying to drive an oversized truck along a narrow switchback road on the side of a steep mountain. CPT Robert Yllescas (Milo Gibson of ""Hacksaw Ridge"") replaces Keating, but he doesn't last long either. Explosive would best describe his demise. Other officers follow, and one is replaced, leaving First Lieutenant Andrew Bundermann (Taylor John Smith of ""Martyrs"") in charge. Ironically, when everything goes sideways, Bundermann finds himself in his skivvies orchestrating resistance against the trigger-happy, towel-headed aggressors. One of the least valiant soldiers, SPC Ty Carter (Caleb Landry Jones of ""American Made""), has trouble differentiating ammo calibers for the camp machine-gunners. Later, Carter redeems himself in more ways than one when the Taliban invade Camp Kamdesh for the grand finale.""Ghosts of War"" lenser Lorenzo Senatore distinguishes himself when he hurls us into the thick of the fracas. Some of the aerial drone photography, especially during a bridge crossing over a serene river in the middle of nowhere, is utterly sensational. At times, you'll feel like you're caught in a hailstorm of lead and explosives that never seem to abate. Veterans as well as first-person, videogame, combat shooters will treat this experience as either exhilarating or petrifying. The sacrifices these Americans made against overwhelming odds is enough to prompt you to cower behind your furniture as you watch what looks like a massacre! Interestingly enough, the cast consists of either the sons of superstar actors/musicians or their grandchildren. Scott Eastwood, Milo Gibson, Mick's son James Jagger as well as Will Attenborough, the grandson of Oscar winning director Richard Attenborough, and Alan Alda's grandson Scott Alda Coffey, make up the tour-de-force cast. Orlando Bloom appears briefly as the first captain, and several veterans of Combat Outpost Keating actually reprised their real-life roles in this unforgettable opus. Anybody who enjoys war movies about charismatic American soldiers kicking ass will want to watch this combat classic more than once."
146,"First and for most I loved this movie because it felt real. I don't want to watch another fluff piece about war, I want to get a realistic depiction of what goes on in these hero's lives. I really loved the joking around, stirring crap, and dialogue. It felt like what people really need to see in a war film because it felt real. The story is fantastic because of the people and the actions in it.The fighting is always intense and you get the sense of what it must have been like to be there. It portrays the characters in a realistic light from what I can see and it's not afraid to ask some tough questions. For example no one in the movie really knows their true mission of the base, but they continue to follow orders and do what they're told because that's what soldiers really do. Many don't know the true purpose of their mission but they understand that a superior decided it. I feel like this was good and could have been pushed a little more of the issue.The filmmaking is fantastic in my opinion. The camera work had some really cool shots and did it's best to help you grasp what was happening. I feel it gets lost a little bit when the battle starts going but it's still pretty good. It's not afraid to show it's characters who won the medal of honor in a human light and show their flaws. The acting is on point from almost everyone except scott eastwood who sometimes in the first 2/3's of the movie seems uninterested and it kind of pulled me out of the movie for a period of time. I haven't yet seen a movie I think he's great all the way through but I do think this is his best performance. In terms of the visuals it was also very realistic and almost everything looked great except a couple of CGI shots throughout the film. I do love that they also show some of the consequences of war, such as PTSD and family problems at the end.Overall it's a great slow burn till it punches you in the face story about true heros of one of the more interesting untold stories in Iraq. It falls flat in a couple of spots but is solid and has incredible action scenes. Definitely worth the watch."
147,"Good action scenes. Realistic battles and tragedies.
Acting was not great and why all the children from legendary actors and singers? I'm sure there are alot more actors out there who could've done the job better. I personally find it hard to take Scott Eastwood seriously. Caleb Jones was standout.
Story wise I felt nothing when one of them died this surely is a failing of the script or director as there was WAY too many characters for significant development to be done prior to the battle scenes. Result we didn't care who died and who didn't. That and some of the actors hammy deliveries is why the review is what it is."
148,"This movie covers only one side of the story. Starts at the outpost and ends when troops go out and post gets destroyed. Story really misses to cover the opposition. Like it fails in covering how the other side is preparing, what war tactics the other side is using. First half just shows the environment in a military outpost, second half is about shooting. Overall average movie.."
149,Who was the one who decided this base should be build on that spot? That is the reason why these soldiers were killed. I'm just in 10 minutes of the movie but see where it is going. Giving it a 10 out of 10 because this should have never happened and hope by rating it high people will look at this film before they sacrifice there lives unnecessary. This is WW1 trench warfare.
150,"I can't believe there's actually people in this world who enjoyed this movie.
Watch it and see for yourself. This movie is boring AF."
151,"The plot is immaterial, and the story is basic.
What I liked in this movie is 2 things:
Caleb Landry Jones - what an actor! this guy is going to be a huge star in the coming years.
There are 2 sons of huge Hollywood legends in this movie - the son of Mel Gibson, and the son of Clint Eastwood, the first one has a small role, the second has a leading role, but you see the qualities and similarities to their fathers, especially their looks - like young versions of their dads.
The action scenes are very realistic, as well as everything else in the movie, nice to see a movie that doesn't try be ""nice"".
Go see this movie."
152,"I watch quite a lot of movies during a week, and I never expect each of them to be the best movie ever. I want to entertain myself with something that makes me forget any problems I might have that day and just enjoy a film peacefully with my wife.That said, this film did its job, for sure. It is a good movie, realistic enough to get you into their trench and suffer while you see (tons) of soldiers die. Remember that this battle was the bloodiest of all the Afghan War, so expect to see some bodies blown.Good acting in my opinion, without epic dialogues, but you are not expected to make those in a place like these, just kill and not be killed I guess.Anyways, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
153,"The outpost starts slowly. It makes you thing OH God, this is another heroic patriotic movie with lots of cursing, but gets better and at the end becomes really intresting."
154,Thank you for your service we appreciate you youre a hero.. yawny yawn yawn n please and next. get a clue and get a life dude. this movie sux
155,Some decent action scenes but lacks something. Acting is not great but perhaps that has something to do the lifeless script and fairly anonymous characters. Orlando gets no more than a cameo and the only other person who sticks in the mind is Scott Eastwood. Action is pretty well done with a definite hint of Zulu in terms of the story.
156,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rod Lurie's latest is not only based on a remarkable true story, it uses the real American soldier's names (and some real soldiers) and depicts the valiant efforts of those who were part of the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan on October 3, 2009. Mr. Lurie (THE CONTENDER, 2000) is a West Point graduate and Army veteran, and the film is based on the book by CNN correspondent Jake Tapper, with a screenplay from Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy.We first meet the new arrivals on their helicopter transport under the cover of darkness. They have been assigned to this combat outpost known as ""Camp Custer."" The nickname comes from the assumption that everyone there is going to die. Why is that? Well for some reason, this military outpost is positioned so as to be surrounded by the foothills of a mountain range - creating a natural shooting gallery of which the soldiers are sitting ducks. It's one of the most vulnerable military outposts ever created, and with it comes so many Taliban attacks that the soldiers can't even take seriously their local scout's constant warnings, ""The Taliban are coming!""There are 53 soldiers assigned to the camp, and the aura of impending doom hovers non-stop. To compensate, joking around and playing sports are utilized to pass the time between attacks. The men even debate whether calling home is a good thing or not. One of the bunk beds has ""It doesn't get better"" carved into the frame - that's a taste of the kind of inspiration floating around. ""Thank you for your service"" is pure parody amongst these soldiers, and it's easy to understand, given the tension they must feel - we are nervous merely watching from the safety of an armchair.The performances are solid and you'll recognize a few. Orlando Bloom is Lieutenant Keating, Scott Eastwood is Sergeant Cline Romesha, and Caleb Landry Jones is a standout as Carter, the ex-Marine outcast who is more complex than initial impressions lead us to believe. On an unusual note, the list of ""relateds"" is quite impressive: Eastwood is of course the son of Clint, Milo Gibson is the son of Mel, James Jagger is the son of Mick, Will Attenborough is the grandson of Sir Richard Attenborough, and Scott Alda Coffey is the grandson of Alan Alda.Director Lurie divides the film into chapters associated with officers, but the segment that most every viewer will find riveting is the near-40 minute attack on the outpost by hundreds of Taliban gunmen. It's relentless battle action at a level rarely seen in movies, and we feel like we are in the middle of it. This onslaught feels like hopelessness, followed by desperation, followed by survival mode. Never does it feel like an outright victory, but more a relief for those who survive. Cinematographer Lorenzo Senatore makes this a visceral experience - one we won't forget.Very little politics come into play here. Instead this is about the men in the line of fire - their courage - and their desperate attempts to live and hold the outpost. All of which is followed by a haunting breakdown that stuns. This battle resulted in 8 dead and 27 injured American soldiers, followed by many medals, including two Medal of Honors. The closing credits honor those killed in action, and we see photos of the actual soldiers next to the actor who played them."
157,Hero my azz.. without a doubt this is SO dumb and fake!
158,"The Outpost was a watchable war film and it is better from many others that we got in a recent years,but it still has some weaker parts in it,i failed to connect to any character in a film and because of that i wasnt able to care for our ""heroes""and will they survive,cast was in other hand interesting ,Orlando Bloom was able to surprise me in a way and Scott Eastwood give his best performance in lifetime and for one he wasnt stoic or lifeless,story was done in a solid way,i havent read the book so i cant compare it,but i believe that book did a better job in it,action was a good watch and it had intensity in it,Outpost was a watchable war film"
159,"In recent years, I've been very disappointed with war films because, with a few notable exceptions, I find that they betray realism far too much. Hollywood likes to make action movies out of tragic, real-life stories which I find both disrespectful and disappointing. The Outpost could not be more different. It doesn't feel the need to give in to cinematic norms in any way. It doesn't even follow the standard three-act structure as closely as we're used to. For that reason, I can see many viewers feeling uncomfortable with it, given it's strange format (it's hard to distinguish the first act from the second.)This movie does a great job of building atmosphere. The soldiers look rough, talk rough, and live rough. I felt like I could smell the base they were living at, and even more importantly, I could feel the danger they were in. The performances are all very good (particularly Caleb Landry Jones's) and the actors had great chemistry with one another.Finally, let's talk a bit about the combat sequences. Wow. I was shocked to learn that this movie was shot on a relatively low budget. The action is edited and directed extremely well with long, tracking shots giving me the feeling that I was truly there in the thick of things. The editing and cinematography gave me a feeling of overwhelming fear and geographical awareness.The Outpost can drag at times, sure. It's also a bit difficult to distinguish the characters from one another for a large portion of the film. But overall, this is a wonderfully-directed, very well-shot tribute to our troops overseas. In the cinematic wasteland of 2020, I highly recommend this film."
160,"PRT Kamdesh was built in a remote Afghan valley surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains. The American soldiers defend the badly situated camp against constant attacks from positions above. In 2006, 55 allied soldiers are attacked by an estimated 400 enemy force.It's a compelling story and a harrowing fight for survival. The battle is riveting. It's based on the true events. Scott Eastwood is probably the most recognizable face. He also has the John Wayne character. It is a real life story partly turned into a John Wayne movie. That's probably its weakest aspect where the enemy is always standing up right and taking a full load of bullets in the chest. For some reason, they are gathered up in a group always ready to be mowed down. The Rambo sensibility is its Archilles' heel. The battle is still top level action although the soldiers really need to dig underground tunnel access to the ammunition depot instead of playing cards, pumping iron, or jerking off to other people's wives. The other minor issue is the large number of characters. It's to be expected from this real life war story. In some ways, this may be better as a limited series on a streaming service. It deserves a six hour treatment. As it stands at two hours, it's a bit too long for a theatrical movie anyways. All in all, this is a compelling true story done relatively well."
161,"I've seen a few other reviewers say that this is an accurate depiction of the experiences of the men who saw action in these god forsaken environments. Nothing but the utmost of respect for these men and their ilk. If nothing else, it shows us civilians why military veterans deserve our respect and gratitude and it makes the disgraceful treatment of them when they get back to the nations that send them into the eighth circle of hell all the more offensive to society."
162,"Based on the book The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor by Jake Tapper, the film is set at Combat Outpost Keating a few years into the Afghanistan war. The titular outpost is incredibly vulnerable, surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains, and the atmosphere is thick with tedium and tension as daily life at the outpost is interrupted by grievances from the locals and occasional attacks by small groups of Taliban splinters. The film follows the events leading up to the battle of Kamdesh.The Outpost as a war film is almost documentary like in its take on warfare with the majority of the time in the first half of the movie dedicated to showing the cynicism, pessimism, and optimism felt by the various soldiers stationed at the titular outpost. Throughout the first half of the movie we're not only introduced to the layout of The Outpost itself, but also of just how hostile the surrounding area is with its bitter and mistrusting local population, the unusable roads that pose just as much threat as the insurgents, and the skirmishes with Taliban forces. The men at the outpost try to keep their spirits up, but the knowledge of the vulnerability of their position coupled with the fact there's no clear objective in the war begins to wear on them in one form or another.The movie is absolutely exhausting, from the tension and tedium in the first half to the unrelenting violence in the second half there's seldom a moments peace, and what humor or peace there is to be had will usually be undercut by a sudden and expected catastrophe in the next moment. If there is a criticism to be had, it's the fact that this is a very crowded movie. This is understandable, as the movie is based on real people it was clearly the producers intention to leave no one out to ensure justice was done not only to the events, but the honorable soldiers who gave their lives. There's nothing wrong with that, but it makes it very difficult to have emotional connection to them and the fact they're not allowed further development is likely why the filmmakers utilized subtitles to introduce the personnel on the base regardless of how much screen time they received.Despite minor criticisms, this is an effective war film that depicts modern warfare as well as everyday combat life accurately and honestly. While its large cast of real life individuals makes it difficult to remember who's who during the proceedings, the movie manages to respectably and accurately cover its depicted events and individuals."
163,"The Outpost is definitely the biggest surprise of the year. This movie won't top any of the best war movies of all time lists, but if we're talking about a most immersive war movie list, this movie is definitely up there along with 1917 and Dunkirk. The way the camera moves and follows the actors absolutely immerses you into the battle sequences. Beyond the technical aspects, this movie immerses you by portraying the soldiers and everyday army life realistically. We don't know any of the characters in any type of deep and meaningful way but how the characters interact with each other makes the setting feel real and lived in.This movie also has an incredible performance from Caleb Landry Jones and there is one scene in particular where his performance knocks you off your feet. Overall, this is a great film and definitely one that I'll revisit in the future."
164,I was waiting on this. I tuned in and was glued to my seat! I'm a combat veteran. 5 tours with one to a FOB. I was impressed with the dialogue and the experience retold in this film. I felt like I was back in the FOB. I felt like I was in the valley looking up. By the end I was crying. Not tears of joy. Not tears of sorrow. Just tears of remembrance.
165,"I don't usually do this, but I feel compelled to write a quick review. This is the second best non-fiction modern American combat film that I've ever seen by far (#1 obviously being Black Hawk Down). It's the only movie that I've ever felt compelled to re-watch immediately. By the end I was literally sobbing uncontrollably. This was unusual, and I'm not totally sure why it happened (hence the re-watch for clarity). Shout out to Caleb Landry Jones for his excellent performance. In a year where pickins are slim, don't be surprised if he gets an Oscar nod next April.This is a terrific war film. It's the best Netflix original movie that's ever been made. Please watch it and recommend it to your people."
166,Great acting. Great visuals. Feels like your there.
167,"Wow. One of the best war movies I've ever seen!
I've never previously experienced what it would be like to actually be in the middle of an actual nightmare like these brave heroes had to endure. I'm grateful I only had to experience it vicariously!
Much respect to them all; the ones that full out continued doing their jobs in spite of so much fear and the ones that took it on themselves to step up and lead above their rank when there was no one else to do it!
It will give you more significance and heart when saying ""Thank you for your service""!"
168,"""-I'm sorry, sir. I know now's not the time.
-It is the time."""
169,"(BoTS: based on true story) This was a decent dramatization of an actual US-Afghan battle for Camp Keating placed vulnerably in a valley surrounded by hostile forces. It's engaging on many fronts since you get to know about actual military battle culture, comraderie, heroism, foolishness, discipline and the lack thereof, etc - there's just so much to be aware of in watching such a film. Don't be surprised when you and those you watch with are full of ""why this?"" and ""why that?"" Some of which is answered with the epilogue. Make no mistake, it's stressful to watch this, especially the final Taliban assault on the post, but it's good to be aware of such events occurring out there, overseas on our behalf."
170,Afghanistan is the longest war in our history and so few Americans know anything about it. Watching what these brave young soldiers went through can be difficult but we owe it to them to get a sense of what they suffered and how foolish were the people who commanded them from afar.
171,Poor acting and low cost visual effects make the movie to just watchable one. You feel like fast forwarding the gun fights because they really miss the stunt
172,"Oh look another american propaganda film.
They attacked another country to get oil and then make movie
how it is other guys fault that they did not let american steal the oil
and then make movie to make more money."
173,"Normal movie, not interesting at all, not a cinema movie"
174,"If this film depicts real life then it depicts a leader who does not care, Firstly these troops were placed in a valley, when you dont have the high ground you lose.The troops spent half the movie acting like they were in a mall window browsing and secondly the old timer enemies visiting, were a dead give away that they were a sitting duck. It was clear they were being monitored and if this was a real time situation it could of been easily avoided."
175,"After reading the book (Also on Audible) I was excited for this movie. Unfortunately the script jumps around way too much. The audience never gets a chance to connect to the actual story or soldiers. This movie could of been sooo much better. My advise is to read the book or listen to it in audible, then watch this movie. Otherwise it's just far too confusing and average war movie at best."
176,"I enjoy watching a good war film if it is done properly. I have seen many war movies over the years and this one ranks low. I thought the script was poorly written and I didn't feel connected to the characters. The story was confusing, a mess to say the least. The foul language was constant throughout the movie and in every conversation by every soldier...really? As a female, I don't mind a few foul words every now and then in a war movie but this was too much, in so much I had to turn down the volume because I found it very distracting. I was very disappointed and was sorry that I rented this one. The only thing I found interesting was the ending credits of the interviews of the real soldiers and the photo line up."
177,This is probably the worst war movie I ever watched...
178,"He will never be Clint, especially when he just re-enacts scenes his father did. The movie is good and tells a story of the men in combat, but the acting is far from anything worthy of their counterparts. Bargain bin pick-up if nothing else is available."
179,"Heroes? Every last one of them.But completely let down by horrible tactics, leadership and logistics. How did they ever hope to defend the outpost? Watch the movie and scream incredulously along with me.Overall a boring movie for the first half and the unfortunate outcome in the second."
180,"Movie wise; acting was superb; great special effects.As for the story, I'm not sure if this what exactly happened. Stop showing Americans as the saviors of the world. Both parties were to blame.I just wish if they can make a war movie where there is an equal explanation from both parties!"
181,"Directed by journeyman filmmaker Rod Lurie, who has made a career out of delivering solid if unremarkable pictures with big stars attached, The Outpost would've likely came and disappeared rather quickly had it been business as usual for Hollywood in 2020 but due to circumstances the audience for this based on true events war film has opened up substantially.Becoming a massive VOD hit in America over the Memorial Day long weekend, The Outpost, which takes place in the dust-plagued surrounds of Afghanistan during the heat of the Middle Eastern war of the mid 2000's, is the type of American war film we've all seen countless times before, filled with some recognizable faces and characters we won't remember the names of once we hit the stop button, but that doesn't stop this well-made mid-budget effort from being an entertaining watch.Loaded with a whose who of mid-level Hollywood talent, with the likes of Scott Eastwood, Orlando Bloom and character actors such as Caleb Landry Jones all getting time in the spotlight, Laurie spends a significant amount of time investing the audience into the everyday mundane nature of a collection of American soldiers who find themselves guarding a seemingly indefensible outpost in the heart of enemy territory, in what appears to be a modern day Alamo waiting to happen.Those seeking bullets and gung-ho action from the get-go will be disappointed, with Laurie in no rush to get to the main event but once the bullets start to fly (along with a hearty dosage of expletives), The Outpost delivers the frenetic action goods that will keep fans of films like Black Hawk Down and Lone Survivor well and truly appeased.A long set piece that goes for well over 40 minutes, the siege of the films titular location is an impressive feat of in your face movie-making with Laurie and his DOP Lorenzo Senatore utilizing a Saving Private Ryan like technique of intense handhelds and innovative drone shots to throw the audience into the thick of the action.We might not know at all times who is being shot at or what they're trying to do, but much like a real battle, the chaos and carnage makes for devastating yet heart pounding viewing, making The Outpost feel like a step up from other straight to home release affairs of this nature.Final Say -Not attempting to break any new ground in the genre and filled with a bunch of characters that are the very definition of caricatures, The Outpost isn't grand movie-making but its a solid actioner that's main set-piece is a sight to behold.3 photographs out of 5"
182,"This battle is a story that needed to be told, and it is told pretty well.Undoubtedly the most impressive thing about this movie, is it features a number of soldiers that were actually there. They guaranteed their story, and the story of the fallen, is told right. Some were advisors, others played themselves. Because of this, the movie almost serves as a documentary.The combat scenes seem realistic and this movie does a good job of putting you in their boots."
183,"First half is tedious, aimless, poor dialogue, stereotypical....exactly like sitting in an outpost in the arse end of taliban held Afghanistan would be. Knowing that there's a battle to come gets you wishing it would happen earlier...but that's not how real warfare was/is.There were a couple of super cheesy lines and I'm sure it had a sprinkling of hollywood when there saving air support came but overall I felt immersed in the action. There's almost a parallel to the battle for Khe Sahn when at the end it's all really for nothing and the base is abandoned with no real mission being achieved.
Acting was solid, some highlights, but I preferred the overall feel of not knowing many of the actors, although they all have famous fathers it seems. Im going to watch it again tonight, BHD I watched again immediately, it's not quite that level of grandeur but it was the best of the genre I've seen in awhile."
184,The one issue I had with this was the American soldiers in the beginning of the movie when The war first broke out they look very untrained and almost look don't that was kind of really annoying
185,"It always takes the United States to create a war movie where the only views, the only glorification goes to one side and the other side is reduce to figures in the background.Going from soldier to soldier, what they were doing during the movie you soon realize that what you are seeing is a movie that kind of tells the story in reverse, that is the United States is not actually invading a country but the Taliban are trying to invade them.As always the word ""insurgent"" is used a lot to diminish the enemy, trying to take away the fact they have as much if not many times over more courage for fighting with the very basic gear and most of the time without nightvision and obviously with little to no intel and no air support and almost no heavy shelling support.Yes, they are scumbags, the Talibans are just scums that think women are worthless but... it is up to each and every country to decide on their own what is right and what wrong, not up to us. And yes, they are SOLDIERS not insurgents, they are fighting a foreign invaders and they are not backing down which makes them heroes for their countries and very much in all rights soldiers of a real army."
186,"A lot of awkward acting and clichés. The only one bringing anything real to this is Caleb Landry Jones. Otherwise a waste of time, which is a shame because it is definetively a true war story worth telling."
187,"Filmed in Bulgaria for $18,000,000, this movie has a definite low budget feel. There is little action on-screen other than cheap smoke effects. Cinematographer Lorenzo Senatore has been the head cameraman for literally about two dozen terrible SyFy movies, almost all shot in Bulgaria on a microbudget and this one isn't a big step up quality-wise. Eric Johnson's (the writer of The Fighter) screenplay is pretty solid but it still feels flat, the dialogue comes off as trite mainly due to, well, not great acting. There is a lot of run-of-the-mill, realistic army banter that needs a good actor's magic to come to life and it's dull without it. Caleb Landry Jones is great but Orlando Bloom adopts a bizarre fake southern accent he seems to have learned from 80s movies and Scott Eastwood comes off sounding too much like his dad. All in all not a terrible movie, but closer to Windtalkers than Saving Private Ryan. It has a good story but suffers from low production value."
188,"Too bad, since the Romesha's book is actually good. Not as good as Sean Parnell's ""Outlaw Platoon"" but still good.And if you read the book, like me, it is unbearable to see how badly the director and the military advisor did their work.Could be a nice 50 minutes episode of a National Geographic series about Afghanistan but a movie .... geeez. 6 stars is even too much."
189,"Somehow this is in the same category as great films such as 'restrepo'?
of course organizations in war are expected to be SNAFU, but the actions of individuals portrayed (if true) seem unrealistically irrational in the interest of self or fellow combatants. just to name a few:
insurgents returning to the same ridgeline where they repeatedly get blown up?an officer risking his own men to return a useless vehicle infamous for wasting lives on the way in?"
190,"As far as recent war movies go, this is up there in great cinematography, acting and authenticity. Although there are scenes when the enemies seem to be bullet proof or the US soldiers are bad shots, The big let down is the exaggeration and embellishing of the truth.
This movie is based on an actual event... I emphasize the word ""based"" as it ventures far from the actual event.
I could not for a moment imagine one of the actual veterans of that event watching the movie and say ""nailed it"". No way. Clearly obvious or at least obviously lacking are veterans themselves not in the credits as advisers.There are combat scenes that do not at all match the reality of that battle, but certainly make for a good war movie.why why why do US film makers keep making movies about the war in Afghanistan keep portraying Afghan (Taliban) as poor shots, badly trained and appearing dumb? That is/was never the case in reality.My opinion is that this is an entertaining movie of the war in Afghanistan but in regards to accuracy, it could be perhaps be compared to a Yogi Bear cartoon as a documentary about Grizzly Bears. Maybe that is a harsh description, but the film makers certainly have ventured far from the truth.I give it only 3 stars for saying it is an accurate depiction when it is not."
191,"What a waste of 2.5 hours. Zero story, zero character development, action sequences are chaotic and go no where. An absolute disaster of a film."
192,"Just another USA war movie that tries to show the viewrs the dificulties the army faced when fighting in afghanistan - the local tribes, the elders, the climate, the distance to homeland, the constant stress. Really poor in terms of plot and character depth. Cool action scenes."
193,"Well.. you get quite less information about almost anything. They have looked up an interesting topic and then thats it. In the beginning things are happening with almost no explanation and the rest of the movie is just shooting scenes. Why do you have to make a movie so bad? Lots of potential, but with bad implementation.
And us europeans use to say to films like that: This movie is very american. (means the movie is directed like it is good to fight and like its kind of great to do so)And just some questions:
Whats that truck about, they tell you about for like 15min and then its gone?
Why are they fighting there? Seems like noone in the movie really knows.
Whats that war all about?
No informations...."
194,"There's way too much green screen in this movie, it's jarring"
195,"It's got all the elements that make a film a great one. Cinematography, directing and acting at its finest. Added the story and the real events plot, it must not be missed by all the movie fans around. Enjoy!!!"
196,"Give it a miss.
Bad acting.
Historical inaccurate.Why the hell is the US in Afghanistan!"
197,Save your time and re-watch Black Hawk Down or Band of Brothers.
198,All the bad acting and all the stereotypical lines you could ever come up with make for a pretty forgettable movie
199,The Outpost (3 out of 5 stars).The Outpost is a fair war drama film that lacks the emotional depth with the characters. Not the best war movie. The plot is about a group of soldiers stationed at an outpost that makes them very vulnerable to the taliban. The films script lacks the emotional connections with the characters making them dull and forgettable. The action battle sequences was pretty intense in the climax.
200,Some of the stories are seen no logical and director had failed to grasp the attention. Its too exaggerated to show that they are angels and the locals are bad devils.
201,Not sure why folks that write these movies put an outpost in an area surrounded by high ground. Only an idiot would put one there.
202,I'd give a 0 if I could. This rating should be about a 3.0 at best. The horrific acting by Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones could not save this movie.
203,"As with most military movies, they have to fit a certain narrative. Mainly that some high ranking officers are bad and ill informed and have to be saved by some enlisted men or another lower ranking officer. You could make this argument about almost any US invasion or war started in the last 20 years.This movie is just more of the same story retold another way. Some people need saving and this is their battle, and hand our medals afterwards. Most of the actors are competent and the action is realistic and engaging and almost Call of Duty chaotic.What this movie indirectly exposes is that our military soldiers are expendable and of little worth. A fact that has been shown multiple times before yet we still people signing up for service. Lets not forget that these types of movies need the help of our military in order to film them, so it's no surprise that all movies have similar story lines.If there was a movie that held the superiors accountable for their poor decisions I think it would be an easy blockbuster. This story would have to be fiction as I can't think of an actual instance of this happening. Plus it would be impossible to make as the military brass wouldn't support it. But an interesting idea none the less."
204,"No subtitles. Poor audio level control & enunciation. Not respectful to elderly, hard of hearing or ESL viewers. But, as it turned out most of what was being said sounded like immature high school or college frat conversations, language & antics. A lot of pretend tough especially dumb as the juvenile talk & antics continued even when they were being heavily fired upon. Poorly defensely sited as camp was ringed by mountains to make it like shooting fish in a fishbowl. Wondering why they didn't put several three man teams w/rations for a week at a time into the hills above as protection & monitoring."
205,"The movie is not bad, you can watch. On the other hand, I'm sorry for the director of The Outpost, the filmmakers, but the Afghan war film called 9th Company can't be overwritten. Hollywood needs to train a little more."
206,"As soon as the shooting started, I noticed they used CGI for the muzzle flashes. Pathetic."
207,I will not promote this film to anyone.Please note - this is not entertainment and will leave you angry and disillusioned.Its uses the sacrifice these brave men made in effort to send a powerful message.However that message simply glorifies a very poor decision. One that was made in an effort to change the hearts and minds of those who have been taught to hate us for hundreds of years.That message should not be taught on the big screen. It should be taught to our officers in military school where it could have a serious impact. Dont we get enough of this crap online.
208,"I think this movie was very disappointing.1. There was a lack of character development.
They just had random interactions between the soldiers.
Nothing too compelling to get you to love the characters.2. There is a lack of action.
In a good movie, you have 2 minor fights, and then 1 big fight at the end.
The movie lacked that.3. Poor Quality Action Scenes.
In most movies, during an action scene, you show all of the different angles.
You show what is happening to the protagonist from their point of view, and you show what is happening to the antagonist from their point of view.This movie lacks the perspectives from the antagonists' point of view.
The scenes are always one sided.
You only see the US soldiers getting shot at, while they run around.
You don't see the Talibans. You don't see the Talibans from the soldiers' point of view.
You don't see how the Talibans are moving around to target the soldiers.
The directing is poor, so you only see one side of the story, the soldiers' side.Because of these issues, this movie was pretty disappointing."
209,"If anybody watches the movies like that, he/she will understand what the war is! Accordingly, they would vote next time."
210,"The only thing that this movie got right (although not clearly stated) is the treachery of the politicos against their own country and soldiers!
They destroyed the one and only aircraft capable of providing REAL ground support, the marvelous A-10 Warthog!
Add to this imbecile commanders, chosen politically instead o prowess and you have the recipe for disaster.
The idiot deciding the placement of that outpost, evidently NEVER heard of Dien Bien Phu!
And the ""action""... The super trained US soldiers popping in the open like in a game of Whack-a-mole. Really?
Yes, The ""Rambo"" saved the day but... MAN!
3* for all that ammo used. :D"
211,"I only watched 50 min and it was not good.
I requested a refund on iTunes.
I want my time back too but that's not gonna happen 😅
Perhaps the second half I am guessing had some intense action maybe. The first half was boring.
Orlando bloom was the only good character in the movie."
212,"There is no story here, and no characters worth empathizing with. Just one long battle that may or may not be realistic. How should I know? Totally pointless movie."
213,One of the most unrealistic army movies that I've ever watched !!
214,Was the entire dilemma of getting ammo the guns remediated since this battle occurred? I hope they started keeping ammo near the guns since.
215,"Well, I can only say that Scott Eastwood is doing a fairly good job. The rest is really, really bad."
216,"There is a LOT of Hollywood interpretation in this series. I spent time there just before the main assault by the Tali, the Soldiers were NOTHING like what is being portrayed. Nor was the circumstances. Do they use the lingo, sorta, do they dress like them, for the most part, are they trying to obtain the feeling of daily life, maybe. Was it a stupid location, yes the CO had a lot to do with that decision, and it it was a poor one, but the accusations that a GI died because of a gang land style assassination or that an NCO would snap kick a subordinate is incomprehensible. Even for asinine behavior. That is not the dynamic I saw in those Soldier, I did see fear and concern but that was expected based on the location and knowing they had Zero support from the chain of command and certainly from the Commander and Chief on down, the ROEwas so tilted to the tali that it was terrifying in it self and would make for a more realistic scare thriller. Watch it for entertainment but no historical accuracy. The Soldier were heroic, with out a doubt, was it terrifying, I can be certain it was, but this was not the true story of heroism and raw terror those Soldiers and civilians survived through. Don't fall for the Hollywood tripe. Read the history, and this story is not and will not be forgotten by those who were there, those who loved those that died and survived and the few that were privlaged to be in the present of some of America's finest!"
217,"I refused to watch yet another overly ""brutal"" but yet ""sensitive"", they are all so ""bro"" and the worlds best ""lovers"" movie portrayal of any national military. The military reality is everyone has a vocational certificate, is low paid, are mildly not happy, has a target to acheive then leave and scrape along well. I dislike this particular stylisation and state that the Fast and Furious does it the best whilst including some pretty females. I also strongly dislike the water carrying look of steroided males which many men aim for in the 2020s due to a lack of something, strength does build naturally. Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt is the most prime example of a fit male. I also dislike the Nationalism context or stylisation or the Political Inferences I think of in regard to these movies and feel they are a slur to armed forces. They are just not bibliographical enough and what they depict is never publically shown. I feel it is disrespectful. Good movie to watch intoxicated."
218,From start to finish I could not take my eyes off this film! Fantastically well made
219,Fantastic well acted war movie with well told story and good action scenes
220,"How you feel about this film is will depend on how you feel about the US's role in Afghanistan.Many nations down through history have tried to invade and hold this country but none no matter how militarily powerful, have succeeded. The US's role is, to date, following the same trajectory as everyone else. Swelling, at one point, to over 100,000 men plus more from NATO, its now down to a few thousand.Unlike the Soviets, the US were not invited, they invaded after the Sept 11 2001 attacks in the US. This is shown clearly in this film. The locals view the US presence unsurprisingly, as unwelcome. What's also obvious and this may or may not be this the intention of this action drama is the callousness of the US towards the locals.Aside from military menace from the occupying forces, pay offs are there for the taking for those who co-operate.
Its cynical stuff aimed at pacifying and buying out the local population who, again unsurprisingly, milk this for all its worth. They have not intention of selling out and who can blame them.Some of the characters in this film as really unlikable. The cold hearted officer, who shoots a dog out of what amounts to expediency, is one example. That said, he's hardly alone. Its quite alright when locals get killed (100,000 have been to date). When one of the US soldiers get taken down,by contrast, its a tragedy, with mournful music as an accompaniment and lots of soul searching.Acting wise this is solid if cliched fare. The soldiers are your classic US gun ho types, with lots of juvenile or cynical one liners to boot. Their counterparts are never really rounded out as people and are more an alien other.Action wise its on the money and gruesomely convincing.All in all, not a bad film but not one that makes the US's role in Afghanistan appear any less unsavoury.6/10"
221,"It really irritates the hell out of me when they hire non-American actors to play American characters and those actors can't convincingly mimic American English. Orlando Bloom's accent is bad enough to make Kevin Costner look good. If they can pull it off, then fine, what difference does it make where they come from...but if they SUCK at playing American...hire an American actor, for f*'s sake! - To be fair, they did ask him to mimic a southern (maybe LA?) accent, which made it a lot harder on Bloom...which brings up another rant: WHY would you bring on an actor who is not a native speaker of that language or dialekt...and then ask him to speak in a regional accent?"
222,"It's a B level war movie. Mostly bad acting, mostly bad one liners.Good action, can be touching it it weren't for the jarring title cards and expectation the viewer remembers all the names flashed across the screen.Orlando must be really desperate is all I can think.So either other reviewers have not seen good movies, or they feel like they have to rate the movie high due to it's story origin (based on true events).The most powerful moment comes during the credits when they actually give us those killed and the respective actor. If only the could give the rest of this movie the same respect."
223,It starts out ever so slow and really awful. I almost stopped watching. Bad typography with Bank font and some shocking acting. Then it kicks in. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones leading a fast paced epic movie. On par with Saving Private Ryan. And that's saying something. A must watch if you love a war movie.
224,"...that I wish had been better portrayed. Of course I wasn't there, I just hope this is not accurately represented.
Starting with the horrible strategy to build a camp in a shooting gallery. The ""greatest military in the world"" with decades of experience somehow thought this was a good idea? I remember when this happened and could not believe that they put our brave military through this.
Then, concerning the production, many things leaped out at me as being unrealistic. One soldier pleasuring himself to a photo of the wife of one of his superiors? Did this happen? And if not, who the heck wrote it into the script?
The warnings by their Afghan attache that went unheeded? If this is Hollywood trying to make this a meatier film, it just comes off as more American military incompetence.
The script. The camp gets hammered by Taliban in a high tension firefight and ten minute later they are calmly strumming folk songs. Not preparing for the next onslaught ""just in case"".
The age old standard in American film making of one American can kill 20 enemies in seconds while 100 enemies can only kill a half dozen Americans in a half hour even though they are at a position advantage. (Schwarzenegger? Stallone?)
The acting. Nobody should be lining up for any Oscars. Although it was watchable, there were no really great acting performances that bubbled to the surface. Near the end with the soldier talking with the psychologist there was a glimmer of actual acting prowess, but the unlikely questioning by the doctor just torpedoed the whole scene.
The reviewers. ""Finally a movie that is accurate"". I hope not. ""Give the whole cast Oscars"". Maybe whoever was in charge of the sound, that was very good (Music, sound effects etc). ""Possibly the best war movie I have ever seen"". Watch more movies. I mean Saving Private Ryan? Gallipoli? Full Metal Jacket? Jeez there are DOZENS of better war films. Not necessarily dozens of depictions of true events, but this is a review of the quality of actual film making.
I will have the military crowd non film buff folks railing against this review but the best I can say is that I was able to watch it from beginning to end without giving up half way through."
