0,"The movie is good (not great, though), specially because of the visual effects and Charlize Theron acting. She is great, beautiful, impressive, plays her role full of passion, as usual. Also I think there was no need for a 127 minutes picture. It could last less time, because in some moments I felt like they were just dragging it for no reason. I expected more, but all the problem is with Snow White choice. Kristen Stewart is like my refrigerator, no matter what I put in it (milk, soda, eggs, vegetables, meat), it is and it will always be a refrigerator. And so is she. She is always the same, no matter what role she is playing. If she can be an actress, so can my refrigerator. They are both cold and have no expression."
1,"Well I saw huntsman the opening night, midnight showing. I went into it expecting something amazing. It was...alright. Honestly the visuals were really good. I enjoyed the how well Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron portrayed their roles and drew me into the story. The little girl that played Snow White at the beginning had me entranced, and everything was going great - then she grew up.Kristen Stewart as the female lead really ruined the whole film for me. She was depressingly emotionless and despite everyone in the film's world wanting to save and protect a otherwise unlikable character due to the character's performance, left me neither identifying with nor liking the character. I felt for the little girl at the beginning, who was easily 5 times the actor Kristen Stewart was in this film. Everyone I went with felt the same. Throughout the film she is very quiet, and what lines she has aren't memorable at all (again, no emotion). Chris Hemsworth pours his heart out to her in one scene, and while she was asleep and ultimately it was his kiss that woke her...she goes on, cold and emotionless - feeling nothing for him. Very sad, as the first 10 minutes had me very excited for the rest of the film - but then it just fell apart when she failed time and time again to react or become a likable character. She acts the same in the Twilight movies, as far as I understand - so I'll continue to stay away from those as well. The rest of the movie was a good production, though it dragged a little at parts. To avoid the same problem in the future, I will simply abstain from anything Kristen Stewart is in. If you want to see this, but haven't seen say - Avengers, see that instead.I'd wait for Redbox on this one."
2,"As a huge fan of fantasy books and films, I had very high hopes for this one... Especially when people said ""oh, you liked Lord of the Rings? You'll love this!"" The verdict? I now know who *not* to listen to next time. If your tastes are similar to mine, you tend to read the books before watching the movies and you don't really follow particular actors. So, really, I had high expectations for this film - and that might've been the problem... Charlize Theron played the evil queen well but I would've loved it if the film had delved further into the queen's history as several ideas were started but never really explained (I have a decent imagination but I don't really think, as a viewer, I should be entirely responsible for thinking up ways to connect the dots). For instance, why is the Queen able to feel everything her brother feels? Why did her mother decide to give her the spell rather than both her and her brother or just her brother? And why, once we get into the meat (or the attempt at the meat) of the story, did the Queen spare Snow White's life when she didn't yet know Snow White was ""the fairest""? And if she did know, all the more reason! Why spare her?? The Huntsman was, I would argue, the best developed character - at least in comparison to the others. At the very least, you knew enough to explain his drinking problem and his bitterness... That said, his wasn't an overly complex character to portray. For exactly that reason, it seemed more than a little ridiculous that the Huntsman *alone* carried the romantic scenes between he and Snow White. For instance, at one point, as he leads Snow White through the forest, he takes a knife to her skirts (apparently he thought they were getting in the way). Snow White stares blankly at the Huntsman and it is only once he says ""don't flatter yourself"" that you realize the emotion Snow White was supposedly showing was chaste shock. Granted that, perhaps if I was more familiar with Kristen Stewart's acting, I might have recognized what she was portraying, but, on the other hand, I'm more of the mind that I shouldn't need to know your acting style in order to recognize so basic an emotion. This kind of jarring (not in a good way) and unbalanced acting was repeated at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned and the Huntsman enters the room. Looking at Snow White, one sees only a blank yet tearful smile, but when The camera turns to the Huntsman it dawns on you that there was supposed to be some sort of moment passing between them. All in all, the chemistry existed only on the side of the Huntsman, leaving much to be desired from Kristen Stewart's portrayal. And that, of course, brings us to Snow White. The character seems to borrow much from Joan of Arc to the point that one might wonder if she wondered into the wrong film. There is an attempt to develop the character but Ms Stewart seems to be little able to carry the development of what might have been a very strong female character. The only hint of real strength comes with Snow White's battle speech which would've been fantastic except for the utter lack of build up to this newfound strength of character. So, in spite of the best intentions, this moment came across as contrived. If only Kristen Stewart had managed to keep up that pace of energy throughout the rest of the film, it might have been more believable. So, unfortunately, though I had high hopes, I actually found myself rolling my eyes frequently and feeling a bit like I was watching someone show off all his ""super awesome"" visual effects - which *was* pretty cool... Just not enough to carry a story. In conclusion, if you count yourself as one who likes a good plot, great character development, and strong female leads... Either lower your expectations or skip this one entirely."
3,"Once upon a time, King Magnus (Noah Huntley) and his Queen have a beautiful daughter, Snow White, who is raised with her best friend William. When the Queen passes away, the King grieves her death but has to fight against a dark invader army. He rescues a beautiful prisoner, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), and on the next day he marries her. On the wedding night, Ravenna stabs King Magnus on the chest and brings the enemy army led by her brother Finn (Sam Spruell) that destroys the King's army. Ravenna imprisons Snow White on the Northern Tower of the castle while William, his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle.Years later, the kingdom is completely depleted and Queen Ravenna, who is an evil witch, keeps her beauty draining the youth of young ladies. When the Magic Mirror tells that Snow White would be the source of her immortality, she asks Finn to bring the princess to her. However, Snow White (Kristen Stewart) escapes and flees to the Dark Forest. Queen Ravenna brings a Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) that misses his wife and she promises to bring her back to life provided he catches Snow White to her. But when he captures Snow White, he discovers that the evil Queen lied to him and he becomes the protector of the princess. Meanwhile William (Sam Claflin) learns that Snow White is alive and he heads to join Finn's men to meet her. The Huntsman and Snow White meet the eight dwarfs that bring them to the magic Fairytale Land. When they are attacked by Finn and his men, William also finds them and the group heads to the Duke's castle with the intention of beginning an uprising against the Ravenna. But the evil Queen will try to get her aimed immortality.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a wonderful dark adaptation of the classic fairytale ""Snow White"" by the Brothers Grimm and adapted to the cinema and immortalized by Walt Disney. The story is excellent, despite minor flaws like for example Snow White running and swimming after years imprisoned in a dirty tower, and is supported by a great screenplay, magnificent cinematography and CGI and good acting. There are unbelievable negative reviews in IMDb and my only remark is that the talented Kristen Stewart has never been more beautiful (actually, he uses the word The Fairest) than the gorgeous Charlize Theron, despite their difference of ages: the Magic Mirror is wrong. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Branca de Neve e o Ca√ßador"" (""Snow White and the Huntsman"")"
4,"Everyone knows that Snow White is the fairest of all, that's why the Queen hates her so. In what alternate reality is Kristen Stewart prettier than Charlize Theron? That fact alone should have kept me from watching, not to mention that Kristen is one of the worst actresses ever. Chris and Charlize are the reason I decided to watch, even they couldn't save it. It is painful to watch her try to act."
5,"Based on the popular fairytale ''Snow White'' comes the originally titled ''Snow White....and The Huntsman'' ,an epic fantasy film starring teen favourites Kristen Stewart (of Twilight fame) and Chris Hemsworth (of Thor/Avengers fame). Now, detailing the plot shouldn't be too hard, as we all know the story from childhood- Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) with talking mirror is hell-bent on killing her 'pure' step-daughter (Stewart) and hires a Huntsman (Hemsworth) to do the job for her. The Huntsman takes pity on the girl when he finds her, and together they become fugitives, going on a journey that involves meeting Dwarfs. Seven of them to be precise. What follows is a major battle between good and evil to determine who will reign over the Kingdom, the evil Queen or our heroine Snow White?Now, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would, it reminded me a lot of Lord of The Rings, from the grand music to the mountain scenery, and it does feature a few spectacular fight scenes. Visually, this is an impressive film, however, the film focuses too much on visuals and not enough on characters, the Dwarfs are glossed over and never really given any time to engage with the audience, which is a shame, as the group contains excellent actors (Ray Winstone and Bob Hoskins, amongst others ). Kristen Stewart as Snow White seems to think she's still playing Bella from Twilight, (i.e no range of emotions, just a blank stare for the whole film), especially when opposite to her is Charlize Theron giving an amazingly dramatic performance as the Queen. To sum up, a good re-telling of a classic, but by no means as good as the Disney Classic which most of us remember.7/10"
6,"The trailers were great, they got me interested, had me excited to finally see Snow White And The Huntsman but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The movie starts off well showing you how the Queen came to power and did a good job of introducing her to the audience but it fell apart soon after that.The acting was very stiff throughout the film, I believe Kristen Stewart was miscast for the part of Snow White, she doesn't have the acting chops to play even a semi serious role like this one. She should stick to the Twilight series.The pacing of the film also just felt off. Their are a lot of anti climatic scenes such as the ending, it just leaves you wanting more or wondering what they could of done to make this a better movie.Dialogue throughout the movie was pretty bad as well, people in my theater only laughed once or twice and that was during a scene that wasn't even intended to be funny.Most critics praised Therons performance, but she really just whined the entire time and was over the top, she didn't really deliver, but she was the best part of the film.4/10"
7,"The few good things about this movie have all been done better in other movies.I went into this film with an open mind. The first thing I believed was that reviews had been too harsh on Kristen Stewart and I was willing to give her a chance. Bad call. Snow White's primary expression for most of the movie is a blank stare with her mouth hanging open. At one point when She is armored up she delivers what is supposed to be a rousing speech to the troops. Instead it was Kristen Stewart just shouting with no passion and certainly no inspiration. There is also no chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. In reality the only lead actor who shows any charisma and actual development is the evil queen. There is little to no development for any other characters, which manages to even drag down Chris Hemsworth's role as the Huntsman.While the movie did have decent special effects, they aren't enough to save the film and even they have been done better in other films. The ""action"" sequences are sparse and fairly generic. I was very disappointed with this film. It had potential, but a bad script and boring/non-existent acting on Stewart's part destroyed it. If you want an actual captivating fantasy film, you'd be far better off watching Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, or even the most recent version of Alice in Wonderland. The movies listed actually have a good script and good acting along with good fight sequences and excellent special effects. There is simply nothing memorable about this rendition of Snow White."
8,"Plot: Warrior princess Snow White takes on the wicked queen with a little help from people she barely knows. Drive-in Rating: Yield right of way. Just to get it out of the way, I don't understand the appeal of Kristen Stewart as an actress. She always has the look of a stuck up brat to me. There, done with the casting critique.The movie was visually stunning and Charlize Theron made for a truly wicked-good Queen. Chris Hemsworth was compelling (in a vacuum) and the dwarfs (casting controversy aside) were engaging. I love that the writers know their fairy tales enough to remember what properly lives under a bridge!...but I didn't find myself rooting for the entitled heroine or her comrades. The story idea was good enough but the writers tried to pack so many concepts into 127 minutes that they forgot a little character and conflict development. Even the most compelling scenes, the final kiss for example, left much to be desired (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you there's a kiss, it's a well-known plot point in the fairy tale). In addition, there were some unacceptable leaps in logic (for example, what compelled the Queen's brother to tell the Huntsman the truth about his wife?).And finally, is there an award for the least compelling title of the year? ""Fairest Blood"" immediately comes to mind as a reasonable alternative.If you pay to see this in the theater, make sure it's because you want to see the visuals on the big screen."
9,"What a load of nonsense. Those were 127 almost completely redundant minutes. It doesn't happen often but after about the first third I was considering leaving the cinema and only the ticket price kept me in my seat and the vague hope that something might change. It didn't.Where to start? There was no build-up, no climax (more of an anti-climax actually) and no development of any sort. There was a bunch of characters that fit together awkwardly at best: imagine Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Aragorn, Luke Skywalker and the guys from Hot Fuzz against the Wicked Witch and the Terminator - that about covers it. There was nothing that made you feel one way or the other about the characters since they all had their reasons for doing what they did and ... since it fit the plot it was fine anyway and they didn't need to change. The whole piece had a plot and general look and feel that couldn't make up its mind if it was going to be Chronicles of Narnia, Joan of Arc or ... Pan's Labyrinth? There were, however, a lot of pointless details that didn't matter to the plot but they were just there - take the queen's background, take the troll bridge, I could go on. There were a lot of over-acted emotions, like the queen screaming at people in slow motion for no apparent reason (both the screaming and the slow motion); and I cannot remember seeing Snow White in any shot in which she did not have tears in her eyes.I still wonder where they wanted to take this picture. Dark fantasy with sex-appeal and gritty violence might have been a good idea but it seems the writer and production designers were too busy being politically correct to go all the way. There are a few things that I liked, which is why I give the film a 3 but those are just details and would contain spoilers. Like this the film just seems to try and capture as many tastes as possible but delivers nothing really. And then suddenly it's over as if the producer had said: ""that's enough now."" Maybe that was actually a blessing in disguise. Reading the original fairytale is still more exciting."
10,"It's hard to find polite words to describe this movie, but I did start laughing about 2/3 through it, and that's not a good sign as it is not a comedy. With such memorable lines to call together an army as 'fire melts iron and it will writhe inside itself....' Wah?? Charlize Theron - who I had always respected - comes off as a grudgingly aging Real Housewives of Beverly Hills - wait, no - Orange County wearing bad eye makeup and screeching in reality-TV-caliber hissy-fit.... and I had always liked her. Kristin Stewart resembles her MAD cartoon parody. She's able to play the suffering goth waif, but when her character is supposed to play fired up or determined, she comes off more as a high school freshman that is determined to retrieve her math book from the library before the bell rings for class - not too powerful.... And when Chris Hemsworth gives a stand-out acting performance as the most believable character in this manufactured dark 'epic', well.... ya know you're in trouble.... I do admire the writers' ability, however, to cram every clich√© that has ever been imagined into this 14-hour, I mean 2-hour story. Please note that I am generous in calling it a story since it actually had no plot. The characters had no depth. I was hoping that they would have done more with the wicked queen as that could have been a juicy part, but she was about as deep as the aforementioned 'Housewives.' The musical score was magnificently inappropriate for the scenes and built up at the oddest times so that one would expect something was about to happen... instead we are presented with a magical deer that doesn't really do anything but has a white aura around it. However, the musical crescendo that accompanies this scene makes you think Something is going to happen (it doesn't). OK - last negative criticism - a fun game would be to take a shot every time one of the actors unexpectedly breaks into a Really bad and unexpected British accent. Just sayin. And now I'll say something nice: the costumes were pretty good - impressive really."
11,"Badly written, badly directed, badly acted (except Charlize)... the end product simply boring.
waste of time, waste of money...
Kristen Stewart should not be an actress. She cannot act."
12,"It's an interesting retelling of Snow White, and I rather enjoyed the idea of Snow White ending up with the Huntsman as opposed to the fairly personality-less prince.One gets the feeling with this film, though, that Snow White (portrayed by Kristen Stewart) deserves the prince with no personality, as she has very little personality herself. I cannot call this film completely awful, because casting Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman I believe was an excellent choice. He is full of animation and character, even a bit godlike (Thor-reference intended) and is the perfect hero for the film.You get sort of a Twilight feeling with this film, though, because Kristen Stewart makes what was supposed to be warrior-Snow White seem like she needs all the supporting cast to give her a personality and save her. She isn't her own person in this film or the Twilight films.Charlize Theron, being the excellent villain that she is, ends up overacting and makes her role seem extremely over-dramatic. Obviously, the evil queen is supposed to be desperate and, well, evil, but you get the feeling that Theron is actually over-acting to make up for Stewart's lack of it. Even when she's supposed to be happy, you get the feeling that nothing is going on in her head. Stewart's method of acting seems to be empty one's head of everything and say your lines. Toward the end, when she makes her speech to rally the troops, it is the most emotional we have ever seen her in the film and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, due to the writing, she essentially said nothing, and I feel like the passion of the troops was totally non sequitur to her speech. The only parts of the film that had characters I and others didn't hate were the bits with only the dwarfs and with the children at the beginning. Time was not kind to Snow White. She seemed to have lost not only her personality but her looks as well. Kristen Stewart's lack of acting seems to make everyone saying she's pure disingenuous, and even with Chris Hemsworth staring at her in love and admiration trying to convince you that she's worthy of it, as you watch her you get the feeling that perhaps he injured his head at some point previously. Even Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, the most likable characters for the majority of the film, make you hate them because of the writing of the film. Perhaps the director told Charlize Theron to overact, but both ended up seeming ridiculous because of the writing. The religious bit confused me too: at a point toward the beginning of the film, Snow White says an Our Father and acts pious, but not only was there no religion in the original Snow White, there are no other references to religion throughout the film. You'd think there were many points where she might pray, but did not, so I can't see why they felt the need to include it at the beginning. It certainly wasn't to make the film longer. It was too long already.Thus, I give this film a 3/10, and I can only hope that if they actually go through with Snow White and the Huntsman 2, they change the casting of Snow White to an actress more suited to the role. Dye Emma Watson's hair black and cast her (if she isn't tired of acting nowadays...)! I wouldn't mind it, honestly. Also, they might need to change writers...and director...and most things about the film...except the visual effects and Chris Hemsworth. I'd say don't change Theron, but her character died, so..."
13,"Spectacular special effects don't overcome an underwritten relationship between the title characters and a hopelessly miscast Kristen Stewart as Snow White. A scenery-chewing Charlize Theron and a late-in-the-game appearance by the seven dwarfs add some life to the tedium until Stewart - lacking the charm, innocence, and spirituality that the part cries out for - sucks it out again.The film recalls ""The Matrix"" in which an interesting premise is dealt a severe blow by a woefully uncharismatic actor portraying a character who the universe of the film needs to rally around in order to survive. But whereas ""The Matrix"" had enough going for it to overcome the vacuum that is Keanu Reeves, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" grinds to a plodding halt when Stewart weakly attempts a ""Henry V""-like oration to stir up the troops. And when the seven dwarfs (which offer some delightful cameos by actors like Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane) sagely proclaim that Snow White is The One who can save the kingdom, one looks at Stewart's blank gaze and wonders how they reached that conclusion.Chris Hemsworth provides a perfectly unobjectionable generic beefcake presence as the huntsman of the title, but the script fails to evolve the relationship between the two in any way and the end of the film depicts Hemsworth standing anonymously in the crowd as the crown is inevitably placed on Snow White's head. Then, we are treated to the sight of the new queen standing uncomfortably in front of her subjects in awkward silence, as though no one gave any thought to what might happen next. But the same thing could be said of the screenwriters after typing the words ""Act One, Scene One."""
14,"I must say, when I first heard the news that there was going to be a Snow White live-action film, I had a good laugh. When I heard that Kristen Stewart was going to play Snow White, I had an even bigger laugh. But when I saw the trailer, I stopped laughing. And then I watched the movie, and knew I had to write a review. This film is not going to win many(if any) awards, nor will it be a favorite this year, but it is entirely a good movie. Stunning visual effects, many great landscape shots, good acting, great action, and a believable storyline. This is not the Disney film you are used to, but a much grittier and more mature take on the original tale. You should not take your children to this film, nor should the intense nature of the film scare you off. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and I think many people will too."
15,"I have NEVER posted a review on IMDb before and I'm so sorry to inform you that this movie was so bad, I HAD say something! It might have been watchable but there was absolutely NO way that I could get past Charlize's horrible HORRIBLE British accent! Thank God for her beauty.Next, KRISTEN STEWART was just terrible! How she got the lead in this only God knows! Completely emotionless and a very laughable ""pumping up"" speech at the end. And WHY oh WHY does she always have her mouth open? Every time she was on camera, she had an absentminded look with her mouth hanging open showing off her horse teeth! Its NOT pretty! It was just too awful to watch this movie, all I could see were Kristen's teeth the whole time.And William? Take him out of the movie and it would have worked out the same! His character was pretty much useless in the movie."
16,"When I saw the previews for both of the upcoming ""Snow White"" adaptations, I was excited. The take with Julia felt wrong, though it looked pretty good. When I saw Charlize fulminating eyes in ""The Huntsman"" I knew it would hard to miss the target. This film delivers because it goes back what inspired the original source: haunted forests, dirty, hopeless villages, dark, imposing castles, and an electrifying and literally heart-stopping villain. This one got as far away from Disney as it is possible and works as a perfect bookend to 75 years of attempts to capture the spirit of the original tale.There are changes, and it is a very radical spin by making the heroine a stronger match to the diabolical queen, a bruised and bitter, yet majestic portrayal by the magical Theron, an actress who speaks volumes with a look, a quick glance, or a murderous stare. She is as impressive here as she was in ""Monster"". She wears the fabulous costumes by Atwood by an almost supernatural grace. She is worthy of every crown, every jewel, every outrageous outfit. She is great because her fantastical character feels almost real and is so powerful, that she is missed while she is not on the screen.In this picture, Snow White is not a meek and scared child. She must confront unexpected dangers and her evil stepmother, and she finds courage pretty much where her enemy does, deep inside her soul or heart. Both understand why each's demise is crucial and vital to the other. For most of the film, Theron is in a crusade to kill White by taking a hold of her heart. Theron also knows this young princess is the only who can destroy her, and that is enough motivation for some amazing trickery.There are plenty of breathtaking moments, from the powerful introduction of the duplicitous queen to the most fantastic display of magic on the screen involving fairies. This would inspire even Shakespeare to write a sequel to a couple of his comedies.It is gorgeous and wonderful scene that will have people talking for a while, and Spielberg must have inspired others to use a beautiful white stallion for maximum effect in a terrifying scene.Be prepared to be surprised and entertained by many actors doing top work, and this is very hard considering how Theron owns the screen. Stewart does very good work as Snow White, but the movie belongs to Theron. She is the dark force that lives in the heart of many classics, and it is hard to picture anyone else doing anything remotely close.A very good fairy tale, with plenty of heart."
17,"Very poor performance from Kristen Stewart. She keeps looking as if she is sitting on the toilet and doesn't convince nor captivate the audience in many scenes. At one point in the movie she gave the men a pep talk, one of the worst ever! Almost all her dialogues are poor and unconvincing. The only thing that kind of kept me in the audience were the funny dwarfs. Also the CGI was pretty nice. But the bottom line remains, acting is the most important and especially that of the leading role...Apart from Kristen, the other actors were OK, but unfortunately not enough to save the movie.All in all a big disappointment!"
18,"When I heard they were making this film, I was slightly anxious how this would turn out. After the disappointing re-imagining of Alice In Wonderland, I feared this would go the same way. I was wrong. Everything about this film was excellent. The level of design, the cinematography, the acting and the special effects all absolutely shone and brought this world to life, stepping effortlessly from serene and beautiful, to tough and gritty in a heart beat.So lets talk about the cast. Yes, I had my reservations when I heard the main three characters were all played by non-Brits (Stewart, Theron and Hemsworth) having said that, they all played their characters excellently. Stewart's portrayal of Snow White was a subtle and intelligent performance. Her accent (and this is coming from a Brit) was pretty good, in fact all three did very well in that department. Stewart has really progressed as an actress and found her feet in this film. She looked absolutely stunning with the help of incredible cinematography, but what impressed me most of all was her characters arc throughout the film. She has really provided young girls with an excellent role model. Turning from a damsel in distress to a woman who can really stand her ground and fight for what she believes in. Chris Hemsworth surprised me in this film. His accent did suffer slightly, however it did not detract from what I thought was a great performance. In particular the scene in which he talks about his dead wife to a lifeless Snow White was extremely heartfelt and showed a side to him that I've have not seen in his previous movies. Theron, Queen Ravenna, played the part expertly. Her character could have easily have become two dimensional, but Charlize added a quality which almost gained sympathy from the audience. Her struggle for undying beauty and immortally, may be a shallow one, however the way she played it with such commitment, energy and sometimes poignancy made us completely believe how deeply craved for it, therefore earning her right to be so deliciously wicked.I would liked to have seen more of the seven dwarfs and I feel they were slightly under used. Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and Toby Jones provided the comic relief the film needed in such darkness however also provided one of the most touching scenes which was acted brilliantly by all and shot stunningly. Adding to the beautiful camera work was the stirring, operatic score. Composed by James Newton Howard, it really lifted the film and stood out over the chaos of the battle scenes, created tension in all the right places, and moved me to the point where my hair on my arms and neck stood on end. Finally, I would whole heartedly recommend this film. This is the best blockbuster this year and has really given the kiss of life to the fairy tale genre, breathing new air into a this classic form of story telling. The director Rupert Sanders said in his speech before the film, that he wanted to create a film with heart, that he felt has been missing from some movies recently, and he really has delivered. It would have been easy for a new director to be overwhelmed by such a large budget, scale and special effects, but not once did he let it overshadow the story and the characters. Snow White says in the film :""You will not take me heart"" which is exactly was Sanders seems to have said to Hollywood Blockbusters, as he has created a film with so much heart, that not even a poison apple could put it to sleep."
19,"Still amazed that out of all the actors in the world, they couldn't cast dwarves as dwarves. Disappoints my son every time he sees the movie (he has dwarfism)."
20,"This is the second Snow White adaptation released this year except this one is designed as an action, adventure. Both are not quite outstanding but they gave some interesting twists to the story. Unfortunately, there is something gold about this but it cares too much to the visuals than anything else. There are also scenes that are taken from other fantasy, epic movies. It's good looking, but good looking is not always enough.The twist is pretty interesting. The Evil Queen's tragic past, more significance to The Huntsman, turning Snow White into a gritty protagonist. Though the dwarfs are the same in Tarsem Singh's version. These elements could have made this a memorable and fresh adaptation, but they just threw these things to the film lazily. The plotting is mediocre which made the second act a bit boring. The action is nothing but looking good. It looks fascinating but you'll rarely see a real fight.You already know what Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth will do but the audiences are more interested to Charlize Theron's performance. She sort of hammed it up when in rage but she does it pretty well in the rest. Another attraction to this is the visuals. Like I said, it's too pretty. It's never wrong for the visuals to be pretty especially to a film called Snow White. It's too pretty, they already careless about the plot. Decided to choose the generic way. Heroes meeting new friends, settle down, fight, settle down. Just waiting for the climax to come without any much development.I'm starting to think when I first saw it, it's like Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. It's an old tale with a charismatic protagonist turned into a gritty one, but this one is a bit different. It refuses to be gritty and wants to be pretty and generic. The real action is few, the effect of drama is limited. The visuals can be spellbinding but anything else is just empty. There is a good story in the film but it's told in a generic way with a generic plot and filled with stuff that is borrowed from other films. One might enjoy it by its looks but if you care for more than that then it will be unsatisfying. Snow White and the Huntsman can be part of those clich√©d modern fantasy movies like Clash of the Titans, Conan The Barbarian, and Immortals. But at least this film is the best of its kind. It's not bad nor good. It's just a waste of potential of a new good film."
21,"Ever since I saw the first photographs of Snow White and the Huntsman surface on IMDb about a year ago, I've been extremely excited to see this film. And over the past few weeks, that excitement only built up more and more to the point where almost no film can meet such high expectations. See, I have always loved the fairy tale of Snow White and the evil queen, but never before had anyone attempted to make it into what I believe it was always meant to be: a Gothic tale of fantasy and horror, rather than a sweet night time story. And now, with a much promising trailer, it appeared that Rupert Sanders had fulfilled my wish. And even though he has claimed quite some artistic license story wise, the end very much justifies the means. Snow White and the Huntsman is a film worth watching.Literally everything I ever imagined about this classic story is there. The Dark Forest is actually Dark. It's creepy and spooky in the best kind of nightmarish way. Funnily enough, throughout the film there were some analogies with the classic Disney film. For instance, in the Dark Forest, the tree branches move autonomously towards whoever dare enter their territory, grasping around like freakish clawing fingers. The mushrooms spew poisonous fumes when you touch them. And the hills literally have eyes... The Evil Queen's castle is every goth kids' dream house. And the dwarfs are rugged, mean little men. Graphically, there's simply nothing not to love.However, without the key elements perfectly worked out, the pretty pictures alone wouldn't have made this film work. Let me start with the leading lady. I don't know why Kristen Stewart is getting so much hate, honestly. Not only is she a very talented young actress, she is the perfect Snow White. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with this than her. She doesn't just have the right look (pretty face, pale skin and raven dark hair), she also has the right attitude to play Snow White the way her character was written: smart, daring and independent. This is no damsel in distress, this is a girl ready to kick some ass and get revenge. She just needs a little help from her friends. First and foremost friend on the list is Eric, the Huntsman. He is initially hired (or rather, commanded) by the Evil Queen, to hunt down Snow White. However, when he finds out that he has been deceived, he turns on the Queen and decides to help her instead. This character is played by Chris Hemsworth, and he is perfectly cast. He is all the Huntsman needs to be; rugged but charming, complete with a husky Scottish twang. Lastly, there is Snow White's childhood friend William, played by Sam Claflin, who sets out on his own personal mission to help her.Of course, the tale of Snow White would not have been complete without the notorious 7 (or 8, in this case) dwarfs. It seems the casting director pulled open a can of Britain's finest for this occasion. Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan, Ray Winstone, just to name a few. These characters are a delight to watch and also bring some much needed comic relief to the story, without actually turning it into a comedy (which is a good thing).And then there's the Evil Queen, Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron. Ms Theron is a great actress, and I was really looking forward to her playing this purely evil character. And as such, the Queen was everything I had hoped for; a heartless, sadistic beauty who relies on dark magic to remain forever young and beautiful, sacrificing whosoever crosses her path for this purpose. Though strangely, viewed solely as a performance, I caught Charlize doing something I had never expected from her: she overacted. Personally I feel that her performance would have actually been much more intense had she decided not to spend half her screen time screaming at the top of her lungs, but rather just some of it, carefully dosed. However, Ms Theron has garnered a more than sufficient amount of brownie points in my book, so I'll just chalk it up to excitement. It's obvious she had a lot of fun playing this character, so she's easily forgiven. Besides, physically she fit the role perfectly and I still really enjoyed watching her.Visually, Snow White and the Huntsman is truly stunning. The CGI is top-notch, especially the Mirror is quite awesome. It transforms into a human-shaped mass of liquid gold in order to speak, and it's one of the best visual surprises in the film. The Dark Forest is the closest thing I've ever experienced to an acid trip, and all the fantasy creatures are really cool (my favourite was the angry forest troll!).I don't need to tell you about the story, we all know how it goes (although I've never seen Snow White in a harness before...), so there's no really big surprise anywhere, and of course you get the happy ending (trust me, that's not a spoiler). Still, it's the way this story is told here, that makes it a very exciting ride. There's only one point of critique I have, and that's the pacing. They really could have kicked it up a notch here and there.I think, in the end, Snow White and the Huntsman actually did live up to my expectations, and that's quite an accomplishment, considering how high they were. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for Snow White: The Gothic Version. Beautiful, awesome, cool!"
22,"Mirror Mirror on the wall how was Snow White and the Huntsman after all? This is definitely a must see for the summer if you love fantasy type movies in the vain of Lord of the Rings and Legend. Great scenes incorporating stunning action sequences, comedy and what you know of the story from your youth but without running over that same old ground until it is mud. Many new fresh takes on the classic tale are here for sure to keep you entertained for it's 2 hour duration while allowing you to escape into it's magical world. Charlize Theron is amazing as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth does a bang up job as the Huntsman. The CG effects throughout the movie are very well done and add that little bit you need to a film like this. The PG 13 rating is also appropriate since the film has a very Dark overshadow and may not be the best for small children to view. With the 2012 Summer movie season already well on the way with blockbusters such as the Avengers and MIB III, Snow White and the Huntsman will fit in just fine and hold it's own for sure."
23,"When my friend called me up on the morning of 14th May telling me that she won tickets to the premiere of this movie and wanted me to come along, I couldn't believe it. I was half asleep when she called me and in my sleep state I was tempted to say no and hit the hay but THANK GOD I DIDN'T. This movie was absolutely breath taking from the very first scene and it's tremendous considering Rupert Sanders is a first time director. Not even the most experienced directors could have taken this where Rupert took it. The visual imagery was so raw and edgy, I could actually feel Queen Ravenna's lust for beauty and her hatred for Snow White and it's safe to say that Charlize Theron was the perfect actress for this role. Only she could make an evil queen seem vulnerable at the same time. Kristen Stewart was a pleasant surprise! After the Twilight movies, I had somewhat doubted her abilities as an actress but I'm glad and relieved to say that she proved me wrong. She brought such heart, passion and bravery to this role and yes, Snow White did kick some ass! K-Stew was all suited up in armour with her sword in hand ready to fight for her Kingdom unlike the airy fairy Lily Collins in ""Mirror, Mirror"". It's refreshing to see young blood bringing something new to cinema and not what has been done a thousand times before so thanks K-Stew, you're definitely one to watch! Chris Hemsworth was fantastic as the Huntsman! A ""brute with a heart"" he most certainly is! Chris Hemsworth brought such strength and vulnerability to the Huntsman. He may appear very rugged and unkempt in the movie but don't let that fool you...his character is soft at heart and is willing to do anything to be a good human being but he doesn't show it as most of us do. He chooses to prove his loyalty by giving his word to Snow White...I won't say anymore but prepare for an interesting twist there! The dwarfs were amazing and had such attitude, Toby Jones, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone gave delightful performances and were definitely one of the highlights of the movies.Overall, the movie is a solid 10/10 and I will definitely watch it again...YOU SHOULD TOO!"
24,"With all the hype for this movie and some really good actors (Ian McShane, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Bob Hoskins) it was a let down. The writers didn't give Stewart enough lines and lines they did give her were horrid. That speech? That was suppose to motivate people? What the hell? The girl didn't smile at all. And yes I know the movie was set in a dark time, and there is no happiness in the land. But she didn't smile when she was brought back to life nor at the end.Let's talk about the ending. The line Stewart has, ""You cannot have my heart."" That was it? Really? That's the big ending that you have? You have got to be kidding me. That in no shape or form should have been the last line of the movie.And the love triangle that they still left in tack at the end, it's not that much of a triangle. She doesn't appear interested in either of them. The two men are in love with her, and only one is true love. But you would have no idea that is the case, because there is no sign of emotion on her part.Don't pay to see this movie. Anyone who tells you that Stewart was amazing in this movie, has a very odd definition of, ""amazing."" She had about 15-20 lines, not including the speech. There wasn't much acting required on her part and it's so blatantly obvious that it seems intentional."
25,"Based on the German fairy tale Snow White, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is A Visual Masterstroke, that comes across a delight to the eyes. And even in terms of story-telling, this dark adaptation gets it right. 'Snow White and the Huntsman' Synopsis: In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen.'Snow White and the Huntsman' is gorgeous to look at. Each Frame looks magical thanks to the magnificent Cinematography by Greig Fraser & The Fantastic Graphics, that compliment the film. Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock & Hossein Amini's Screenplay gives a twist in the tale of Snow White, making it dark & violent, but that works on its advantage, as its refreshing. Rupert Sanders Directs this fantasy-adventure superbly. His execution, in terms of visuals, is ovation worthy. Costume & Art Design are flawless.Performance-Wise: Kristen Stewart as Snow White, delivers a sincere performance. Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna, is purely evil. Chris Hemsworth as Eric the Huntsman, is fantastic. Ian McShane as Beith, Bob Hoskins as Muir, Johnny Harris as Quert, Toby Jones as Coll, Eddie Marsan as Duir, Ray Winstone as Gort & Brian Gleeson as Gus, are lovable as The Dwarfs. On the whole, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a certainly a story worth watching."
26,"My wife wanted to see it. We saw ""John Carter"" because I was curious and neither of us really liked that movie. It was my turn. I had wriggled my way out of seeing the other Snow White movie but now I was going to have to bite the bullet. I was pleasantly surprised. The story and special effects, which are very good, are really all just one level of this movie. It's really about different aspects of feminine beauty.The Evil Queen (played perfectly by Charlize Theron) is very appropriately symbolized by a raven: a carrion bird that feeds off of death for its own benefit. Her beauty is objectified. Instead of allowing herself to be vulnerable she embraces the objectification and uses it to spread death and destruction for her own gain. She is particularly threatened by and benefits the most from the beauty of other women. She also obsesses about youth. Has anyone else met this woman before because I certainly have! Snow White is the flip side of the same coin. She is beautiful without being objectified. She has no symbol but is almost portrayed as Mother Nature incarnate. She inspires, nurtures and heals. Instead of feeling threatened by the beauty around her she reveals in it. She brings out the best in others. It is clear that she does not need anyone to tell her that she is beautiful in order for her to feel that way.Modern feminism is often laughable. Women can only be ""free"" and ""empowered"" if they act as libertine as the worst male philanderer without being criticized for it any more than their male counter parts. They must be objectified to be powerful. To them sex is power. They are symbolized by the Evil Queen in this movie.This Snow White is refreshing because she is not a sex toy defined by her beauty. Though she is aided by men she is certainly not defined by them or helpless without them. She is also aided by other women for that matter. She knows who she is and struggles to realize her potential as best she can, just like everyone does whether male or female. Her self-realization does not come at the cost of anyone else's, in fact, as she becomes freer so do all those who surround her. She does not need someone else to feel smaller for her to feel better. It's a wonderful message.No matter how much your little eight-year-old girl begs do not take her to this movie. There was a small child behind me and my wife who often became very frightened by the movie's violence. Take your sixteen-year-old instead. Maybe she will see that there is more for her to be than eye candy."
27,"When I was invited to see Snow White I thought ""no way I'm seeing this"". Then I saw the trailer, and read that Kristen Stewart was playing Snow White. I got curious and watched it.The plot had some minor holes and was rushed so that they could fit some scenes imagined by the writers into the original fairy tale.Everyone who I discussed the movie with agreed that Kristen Stewart lacked grace, beauty, and talent. She just doesn't fit the Snow White part, and apparently the mockery on her not being able to smile has some grounds. I didn't like the acting on Charlize Theron as Ravenna, but that's just me. The supporting actors were pretty good, I liked the acting on most dwarfs and some other characters.There were also some absurd scenes, like flaming arrows knocking down trees. There were some details I thought interesting, though, such as Snow White's nails being dirty. The scenarios were very (too much?) imaginative and nicely displayed.Overall, a 3 out of 10. And it's not just me, 10 out of 12 people who I watched the movie with thought it was a waste of time and money."
28,"I had no desire to see this film, but when I saw it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it, and was engrossed. Whilst a good film, it was far from original (and I'm not talking about it being an adaptation of the Grimm Fairy Tale), in that it was reminiscent of so many other films; swashbucklers like Robin Hood (especially the old Errol Flynn type versions), The Court Jester, Lord of the Rings, The Princess Bride and anything set in Narnia to name but a few. Whilst the comparison made for unoriginal watching and a feeling that I'd seen it all before, it didn't detract from the cinematographic event and time passing pleasantly in watching the film. The SFX were very good though nothing original (very LOTR), the acting was good and I disagree with other reviewers that say that Kristen Stewart was no good... I liked her performance, certainly better than Twilight, so she's not gregarious but I think she pitched the character well and she didn't write it! Chris Hemsworth was Thor-tastic, he's an incredible physical presence and I really liked his character and he was central to the modern take on the story. Of course Charlize Theron stole the show - she was sublime; beautiful, devious, broken, cunning, cruel, magnificently evil and absolutely barking mad, and the CGI surrounding her person and character were brilliant. The Dwarfs were played hobbit-style by various actors including the wonderful Nick Frost who had some good one-liners. The Dwarfs were a lot of the comedy of the story.There were gripping moments throughout the film, lots of humour and fantasy and a great deal of daring-do-type action and overall It was very watchable. Snow White (the Disney version) was the first film I ever saw at the cinema, and I apparently was very frightened by some of the more psychologically disturbing imagery, which I question for children even now. Whilst I wouldn't recommend this for children, especially as it's live action rather than animation, the mental images - the psychological impact - aren't that different. A good family film if the children are a little older and there's certainly something in it for everyone."
29,"Ugh, this movie was disappointing to me! I was waiting the whole time for something to really hit me, and nothing did. The Huntsman only ""taught"" Snow White one thing. The end was the worst. They never clarify anything. Who does she end up choosing in the end? It could be either dude. The Huntsman wasn't wearing fancy clothes at the end and it looked like he was going to leave, so does that mean she doesn't choose him? I was so confused at the end and mad that they didn't finish the plot. Also, the writers held the awkward scenes out too long and didn't hold important scenes out long enough. The end scene was way too long. I felt awkward sitting there staring at Snow White being queen for 20 minutes. Overall, I felt like it had so much potential, but it failed miserably."
30,"Out of all the actors in the world, why did they choose Kristen Stewart to play the main role? Just why?"
31,Kristen Stewards deserves an anti Oscar award. The birds in the movie had better emotions than her.
32,"All in all a very impressing take on this well known fairy tale. It's particular strong side is the visuals and the music. There are some stretches in the film where hardly anything is said, only images of the land and the haunting background music deliver the atmosphere and make everything seem very real. The FX match those of LoTR and Avatar, but they never get in the way of the experience, they only serve as a means to create the world the story plays in.The acting was hardly less impressive. Especially Charlize Theron makes this movie one to remember for a long time. Never ever have I seen a more frightening, more convincing evil queen. She managed to show a complete being, not just a clich√© from a fairy tale. She embodies the queen with all her desires, her motives, her strengths and her weaknesses. Theron even manages to make you care for her, because you can see her as just a human being with a *lot* of issues. Despite the fact that Theron made everyone else look a bit pale in comparison, they delivered their characters as good as the story allowed them too. Some were given too little time to develop, like the dwarfs and the huntsman. I think a very modern aspect of the movie is that it emphasized the two strong female characters, and generally made woman run the whole show. Men on the other hand were only there to follow the lead of either Snow White or the Evil Queen. Of course this is part of the original tale, but as the recent ""Mirror Mirror"" showed it is not mandatory that this aspect is shown as the main theme of the story.Another thing I like very much about this take on the story is that the characters motives are understandable. It's not just ""this happens and then that happens and then another thing"", as is the sad case with most Hollywood movies today. The story unfolds on its own, you can feel the driving force of the events, one thing actually leads to another and most of the time it makes sense why people do what the do or say what they say.The only weaknesses I can find in Snow White and the Huntsman is that despite its considerable length, it feels at times rushed and incomplete, while other scenes (especially the ""emotional speeches"") just feel stretched unnecessarily. The story could have easily filled two 2h-movies. Important characters are introduced and immediately play their part, without much development or getting-to-know-time. The ending left me (and my girlfriend) a bit unsatisfied. All the build-up ends rather quickly and left us wondering about many things. But this is criticizing on a high level. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It's amazing what good screen writing, a none-clich√©d music score and a few good actors can accomplish with a plot as well known as this one."
33,"Actors and acting was pretty good all the time.Atmosphere and CGI was good too. Nothing outstanding but very nice.Only the plot, the writing, the storyline was not good at all. The spark, which was present all the time, unfortunately did not become a flame. I don't think the directors is to blame here at all, much more the writers over-performed and ruined it somehow.Although I throw up when it comes to twilight, Kirsten Stewart was perfect for the role of Snow White. She did a very good acting and could have been just much more if the storyline was not that bad. She and the other actors did their best and saved 6 from 10 stars, otherwise it would have been not more than 5 stars.Actually the animation and the song (Florence And The Machine ""Breath of Life"") of the end title was the best part about the movie. Never saw it that nobody was leaving the theater through the end title."
34,"I vow to NEVER see another movie until it has been out a few weeks and the REAL reviews come on line from people other than those who have a vested interested in the film. That said, I read the NY Times review, which unless I was drunk when I read it I thought was pretty good and should have been reliable. That one I don't get. What a waste of time and money. Anyhow, poorly acted, seen it all before, boring, tired, uninspired. I can't afford the time, brain damage or money to see a Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. mash-up. I forgot it 5 minutes after walking out of the theatre (aside from writing this review). Too many scary bits for small kids for sure. Watched Diving Bell and Butterfly last night on DVD. Much better use of my time and I watched at home in my jammies.Not a good movie. Uck."
35,"There was one thing good about this film: the set/setting. All else was rubbish. The script left much to be desired, and because of this, the acting seemed sub par. Miss Stewart looked like she needed to take some anti-constipation medicine most of the time. Her fight speech near the end made me hope that there was better acting to come in the last 20 minutes or so...The final scene...I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. It was boring.I mist admit, after the troll scene, I fell asleep. I never sleep in films, or rather I haven't since All Dogs Go To Heaven 2."
36,"Never in our farthest imaginings did we envision Snow White to be an ass-kicking warrior princess who would lead an entire army into battle, but that's the reason why first-time feature film director Rupert Sanders' interpretation of one of the Brothers Grimm's most beloved fairy tales has been labelled revisionist. Inspired no doubt by the contemporary age of feminism, first-time writer Evan Daugherty has taken interesting liberties with both the titular character as well as the villainous Queen. The latter in particular is given an intriguing twist as a woman both liberated and trapped by her beauty, for it was her ravishing looks that first won her the attention of a king but which diminishing by age had left her heartbroken. Fuelled by contempt, Ravenna has over decades gone from kingdom to kingdom winning the hearts of kings and then taking their lives.Her latest conquest is that of a kind-hearted widowed King Magnus (Noah Huntley) and father of Snow White, whom she poisons then slaughters with a dagger on their wedding night. Of his young daughter Snow White she keeps imprisoned in a high tower, until a premonition by her golden mirror on the wall years later leaves her yearning for the come-of-age Snow White's heart to achieve true immortality. Alas Snow White seizes the opportunity to escape when Queen Ravenna's brother Finn (Sam Spruell) enters her cell to retrieve her for the Queen, fleeing the confines of her father's former castle for the enchanted Dark Forest.In turn, the Queen sends a grief-stricken drunk known only as the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) with knowledge of the woods in pursuit- though it doesn't take long before he switches sides and ends up protecting her against Finn and the rest of his army. As Snow White endeavours to get to the grounds of Duke Hammond, an ally of her father's, the Huntsman becomes as much her protector as well as her romantic interest. But as formula would dictate, there should be another corner to complete the love triangle- hence the obligatory presence of the Duke's son William (Sam Claflin), who has apparently had a soft spot for Snow White since he was young.What happened to the dwarfs you might be ask? Well, rest easy if you're a fan of the tale- the seven dwarfs are still around, though they only appear in the second half of the movie. And just to reassure you that they have not been sidelined, they do play a pivotal role in Snow White's mission to depose the Queen. As portrayed by a whole bevy of distinguished British character actors the likes of Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Toby Jones and Brian Gleeson, their rowdy presence is also a much welcomed one, bringing some sorely missing levity into the otherwise sombre proceedings.While the signature elements- poisoned apple, wall-hanging mirror, dwarfs and evil Queen- are no doubt drawn from the classic fairy tale, Daugherty and his co-screenwriters John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini adopt a cinematic tone and style taken from more contemporary fantasy adventures. In fact, the trio together with Sanders could be accused of leaning too heavily on some of these- Sanders' framing of Snow White's quest using sweeping shots against mountainous backdrops set to Celtic music is all too reminiscent of 'Lord of the Rings'; while a late plot twist that gives new meaning to Snow White's symbol as saviour to the people immediately invites comparisons with 'Narnia'.Chiefly, their version of Snow White isn't so much Snow White as we know of it, but a feminist version of Robin Hood, who not only stands up for the injustices of those around her but leads them to battle against the forces that prevail. In that regard, this Snow White isn't all that different from Tarsem's earlier 'Mirror, Mirror', whose protagonist was similarly independent-minded if less swash-buckling. The new-age notion of Snow White as war heroine is interesting, but one that is ultimately let down by Kristen Stewart's bland portrayal.Consequently, this Snow White functions less as a character in itself, than as an obligatory complement to the malevolent Evil Queen, played with icy menace by Charlize Theron. The Oscar winner steals every minute of the show she is in- hers a coolly calculated performance of pent-up fury waiting to unleash itself. Theron is also aided by some nifty CGI and designer Colleen Atwood's ravishing costumes, and we watch transfixed as she steps into a creamy milk bath or transforms back into human form from a flock of crows with her mantle and cloak a glistening black oil slick.Yes, Sanders, who hails from the world of commercials and Xbox games, has a keen eye for visuals, and it shows amply in the gorgeously crafted shots- especially the contrast between light and dark to represent scenes of hope and despair respectively. And despite borrowing slightly too heavily from genre material, Sanders' maiden attempt at a big-budget summer tentpole is as assured a debut as any- it is also to his credit that though the story does unfold at a very deliberate pace in the middle, it never turns out boring.With this version of Snow White, Hollywood continues its recent trend of revisiting classic fairy tales for a modern-day twist, a formula that proved successful for 'Alice in Wonderland' but less so for 'Red Riding Hood'. On account of its distinctive take on the evil Queen as well as its nightmarishly brutal tone, it belongs in the league of the former than the latter. And indeed, having seen both 'Snow White' films this year, we can firmly say that this is the one you should see. www.moviexclusive.com"
37,"Gonna be honest over here: 'Mirror Mirror' was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and by this, I was so unmotivated and so uninspired to see 'Snow White and the Huntsman', until my girlfriend forced me to do so, like she did for Twilight, thinking I was going to be bored to tears: I regret my thoughts. The movie is hugely brutal and a flat-out masterpiece by itself. 1. THE QUEEN: Charlize Theron really took out the limitless evil from Ravenna unlike any Queen portrayal. She, as always, was one of the best characters throughout the movie. She does know how to die melting :) 2. SNOW WHITE: I gotta say something I never thought I was gonna say in my life: Kristen Stewart really showed to the audience that she doesn't act like a depressive human in the middle of a vampiric/werewolf love. She acted like a brave, bold and valiant former princess that couldn't be better performed. 3. THE HUNTSMAN: Hemsworth was actually very cool. I'm a man, so I cannot put so much emphasis on this one, but his acting was fair.4. THE Dwarfs: They were actually good, but not WOW. 5. Prince William: I thought that the lead male roll in the movie was going to be him, but to be exact, he appears few times in the movie. The Huntsman was better, but yet, Claflin was good too. The movie over-all was astonishing and electrifying. Everyone should go see it and WORD OF ADVICE: IGNORE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF ABOVE, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RIGHT. My rating: 10.0/10!"
38,"I don't usually fall asleep during movies, actually I don't think I ever have, but I have fell asleep while watching this movie ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". It's that boring. Snow White Kristen Stewart continues her emotionless ""acting"" that puts me to sleep. The dwarfs mumbles so much I can't make out what they are saying. The huntsman was OK, but I can't help but see him as ... Thor with an axe, this is probably my fault as I have just recently seen Thor and Avenger.The only thing worth seeing in this movie, was Charlize Theron, she is perfect. Her face, her look and her acting, is so perfect, that I end up rooting for the Queen from the start."
39,"I'd read some negative reviews about this film, specifically about Kristen Stewart's acting letting the film down, and I hired it out a few nights ago, thinking it might at least go well with some popcorn. Well, I really enjoyed watching it. I had watched the recent 'Mirror, Mirror' film, and while liking the comic touch in that film, this film felt closer to the original story than 'Mirror, Mirror', in terms of being darker in content and felt like it had a more expansive world with more magic. I think Chris Hemsworth is a very good actor, who has not yet had the chance to truly show his full talent, and while Kristen Stewart isn't at the same level as Hemsworth in her acting, her performance fitted in well with the film and storyline. Charlize Theron made an excellent evil queen, and a slightly sympathetic one, when you see in a flashback scene a horrifying experience that she went through as a child. The special effects are very well done, and the scenery and atmosphere, including mythical creatures, convey an honest to goodness fairytale world come to life. I'd give this film 4 out of 5 stars for entertainment value, and will definitely watch this again."
40,"One of the worst films I have ever seen and believe me I have seen an awful lot of films. This was so bad I find it difficult to ascertain where to begin - the over the top acting by the bad guys - the interminable images of rolling countryside - the incredibly hapless script - the really laughable dwarfs - God it was all awful. Add to this the modern day trend of using countless cuts in the action scenes, the oh so cutesy interlude in the middle and the fact that the evil queen was lot hotter than our feisty heroine and you might see where I am coming from. Avoid like the plague and rent The Court Jester instead - at least that is intentionally funny."
41,"to begin with i had high hopes when i went to see the movie somehow i felt things were rushed (bad editing) and sometime bad acting notably by Kristen Stewart. Snow white seemed so fake to me. I really hated the speech she gave before the battle with the queen it was so lame and did not have much emotion. However the only good thing were the dwarfs who were funny and gave us a bit of a comic relief. Further after Thor i was a big fan of Chris and was looking forward for some good action, alas i fell asleep in the cinema.My advice wait for the DVD/Digital copy and then watch it."
42,"Well, the first thing I have to get off my mind is to say, ""Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, you need glasses."" Kristen Stewart is not close to being as beautiful as Charlize Theron. I'm not saying Stewart is some kind of ugly vampire or wolf creature, but geez...she's relatively average.Having said that, this film is pretty entertaining. And, in some places, rather foreboding (for example, some of the scenes in the dark forest!). And in other places very lovely. The CGI contributes to the story, rather than overshadowing the story, as is so often the case now-a-days (although I wasn't too keen on the ""black-shard-men"" toward the climax.The story doesn't quite follow the story-line we were all familiar with as kids. It's actually much better, although it is still the good against evil saga.The key here is the acting. The let-down here for me was Kristen Stewart as Snow White. I'm sorry, but I am no more impressed with her here than I was in the Twilight films. I'm just not buying into her as a leading actress. And it's not because I don't like the Twilight films...although I don't. But I am finding Robert Pattinson to be a relatively promising young actor, and even Taylor Lautner has some charisma.On the other hand, Charlize Theron seems to be the actress who pretty much do no wrong now. I've yet to see a bad performance by her, and here she is so good...though so evil. She's a stunning beauty, as well.Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman was okay here. I need to see him in something else before I can make any overall judgment of his acting ability. But, for the most part, he doesn't appear in my kind of films.On the dwarf side, rather interesting caricatures. Of course, Ian McShane is very good, as is Bob Hoskins. But I think the standout here is Toby Jones.I give this film a very solid ""7"", and recommend it."
43,"I don't know what to say, the story was a laugh, it makes no sense how she escapes from the castle so easily, no guards, a horse waiting for her in the shore. She started running in the horse like some kind of expert, where she never has ride a horse u__________u, she enters the forest she runs like about 10 mins in the film, you can imagine she is like a half a day in lead of her persecutors. But it doesn't take like 5 mins for the huntsmen to find her, and not even a day has passed or an hour and the gas that made her allucinations to be gone. The acting of kirsten steward was incredible bad, i thought that she only acted bad in Twilight, but i have to say that the fault is from the director, because she could not act better because the story was bad from the beginning... i really DON'T RECOMMEND TO GO WATCH IT... i want my money back! :("
44,"I kept expecting to get bored but it never happened -- you're either introduced to new characters or a new enchanted forest or some fantastic new creature that keeps you wanting the movie to go on and on.You'll take an interest in the characters, won't be disappointed by the plot's progression and be wowed by much of the cinematography.Part Lord of the Rings, part Robin Hood (with Russell Crow) with a touch of Avatar fantasy.I normally wait until the movie comes to DVD before watching, but this one is definitely worth seeing in the theater instead.Don't miss it!"
45,"I was REALLY looking forward to this film. SnowWhite and the Huntsman. So what is everyones first words?... ""oh no its Kristen Stuwart! cry cry cry"" In my opinion, i thought she has done really well in this film, although her English accent is slightly dodgy, but i really don't think she deserves half the crap she gets for being in twilight. Im a visual effects student, and for me, this film, was GORGEOUS. I really cannot fault the animations or the VFX, i thought it was so so nice especially the glass monsters and most of all, the crows. Also, the fairy sanctuary was particularly well done, and very pleasing to the eye.I couldn't help feeling that the trailer was more thrilling than the film, as good as the film was, i did think it was rather slow and i think the battle shouldn't have been contained in the courtyard and possibly made a bigger thing about it. The title sequence at the end.. fantastic, i really thought that was beautiful, on a visual note, i thought it was well constructed and the face-type used was perfect, and also the choice of song, Florence and the Machine - Breath of life, suited the film well, and has made me like Florence. SO overall a stunning visual movie which should be seen for its pure gorgeousness, and a generally good version of snow white, despite its slow speed."
46,"I just got back from seeing this movie. I was quite optimistic about it. It had a lot going for it in terms of budget and cast. I wasn't too excited about seeing Kristen Stewart as Snow White, but I was willing to give her a chance. I thought that Chris Hemsworth would be great as The Huntsman.Alas, this was not a good movie. It was a tough 127min to sit through. It started off reasonably, but just got more and more boring as the 2 hours went on. There was little to no character development in ANY of the characters. This results in my not really caring about the characters or their peril.There was little to no chemistry between any of them either. When a romantic theme developed, it felt so tacked on and awkward. The dwarfs should have been a rousing, entertaining lot...but even they fell flat. Again, you don't get the chance to know much or anything about them so it is hard to really get attached to them.Then we have Charlize Theron. An actress I have so much respect for. I think she is one of the top actresses in Hollywood right now. But not in this film. The blame HAS to be on the director. He has her SO over the top it seems like she is in a high school play.The editing had its issues as well, with jolting cuts that left me confused as to what just happened.The special effects go from really impressive to looking very dated. It is 2012 now...animated animals etc. need to look a lot better than they do here. They all stand out as being CLEARLY CGI and seeing them took me out of the movie.The climactic battles also just fell flat. We have seen it all before and done better. The shots seem to try and be showing us ""wow"" events of archers raining arrows down and trebuchets firing into columns of horses...but again...I have seen it done so often now that it no longer is all that interesting. This is especially true since I have no attachment to the characters.The ending was so lackluster. I wont spoil it here (not that is really anything to spoil) but it is such a dull climax. It tries for a Star Wars style ending, but again it felt awkward. Heck, even the characters in the movie looked like they were uncomfortable in the scene.Overall, I would have to give this a 4/10."
47,"I saw this movie in 2012 when it came out. The concept is great. The visuals are appealing. Charlize Theron is excellent. Chris Hemsworth and Sam Clafin did fine jobs. Although the people portraying the dwarves gave convincing performances, it bothered me that production didn't use actors who are actually dwarves. And now the elephant in the story. Kristin Stewart. She has the emotional range and facial expressions of a person both heavily medicated and seriously botoxed. The only time her performance was convincing was when she lay 'dead' at the Duke's castle. She has nothing going for her that would possibly explain the adoration of anyone or anything. I know the character of Snow White is the fairest of the fair. Kristin Stewart is not ugly. But is in no way the most beautiful person of any scene in this movie, and will never match Charlize Theron. She was woefully miscast. Honestly even after her resurrection and her inspiring speech, I wonder why anyone would follow such an insipid person.8 years between viewings, and still the same opinion. This movie would have been 1000% with a beautiful, charismatic actress whose face actually shows emotion in the title role. Still disappointed in that."
48,"Watch the trailer. The entire movie is just a series of set-ups for a beautiful scene without regard to plot. You saw almost all the good scenes in the trailer anyways, so save yourself $10.Since I need more lines for to submit a review. Here are a few more comments. 1. Stewart is predictably emotionless. It was hard to tell if this was from inability to act or the director telling her to keep her face smooth to keep up the aura of perfection. 2. You only glimpse Hemsworth's abs3. The evil queen is completely one-dimensional and boringGo have some fun and watch the Avengers."
49,"What do we think of Snow White before this film? We perceive Snow White as someone full of joy, care, kindness, humility, and love but also as a flawed and vulnerable person. Adaptations of this universal fairytale have been light-hearted & cheerful and depicted Snow White as having these attributes and that includes the 1937 Disney classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". This trend has continued even until last March's ""Mirror Mirror"". But no one envisioned this type of Snow White film, a dark and gloomy tale with a bad-ass Snow White.Based on the universal fairytale penned by the Brothers Grimm, we all know what happens in the story, and eventually how it ends. The Queen is envious of Snow White because her magical mirror states that Snow White would soon replace her to become the ""fairest of them all"". The Queen therefore attempts to kill Snow White. Even though we know how the story would end, we are given enthralling and spectacular scenes that take us on a breathtaking and heart-stopping ride.In ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" we see a much more mature Snow White played by Kristen Stewart. For countless years, she has been imprisoned in a cell located in Queen Ravenna's castle. The malicious and cruel queen gained power when she married Snow White's father after Snow White's biological mother died. The Queen killed the father and brought immeasurable suffering to the people. Snow White escapes due to a bit of luck and later on leads a revolution to kill the evil queen.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" takes the famous fairytale and converts it into a dark, gloomy and riveting tale. Much of the joy in watching this film is witnessing the breathtaking and spectacular scenes of visual effects. The visual effects and art direction of the film are amazing but none could rival the two locations: the Dark Forest and the enchanted fairyland which is the home of the fairies.The Dark Forest is a supremely dark and devoid of life. The trees, although move, are essentially lifeless. Despair lingers through the countless rows of harrowing trees. This is where Snow White escapes to and meets Eric the Huntsman who was originally sent to kill her but later on becomes her most helpful ally. The Dark Forest is harrowing, frightening, and intimidating and full of dangerous creatures. Even the Queen's supposed powerful soldiers don't dare to venture into the darkness, not until the Huntsman came.The duo (Snow White and the Huntsman) then escape the forest and meet eight (that's right) dwarfs, although one dies in the process and reduces the amount to the original seven. The dwarfs then lead them to the magical enchanted fairyland, home of the fairies, filled with a diverse amount of beautiful creatures. It's like the Wonderland Alice visits but much brighter and joyous. There are mushrooms with eyes, turtles covered in moss, magical fairies, lush vegetation, and a mighty white stag with majestic antlers. The scene here is one of the highlights of the film and demonstrates the power of visual effects and art direction.Another highlight of the visual effects is the magic mirror of the evil queen. Most films portray the magic mirror as a face residing within the reflecting object. This one is much more sophisticated. The mirror melts into golden liquid and takes a much more intimidating form, a hooded faceless figure. This reminds us of the liquid mechanical assassin in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", the T-1000.I also praise Charlize Theron's transformations as she shifts from young to old and young again. Her character, Queen Ravenna feeds on the youth and beauty of others to keep herself alive and beautiful. For her beauty is the essence of her life. Without beauty, she ages and dies. Without beauty, her powers weaken and make her vulnerable. Her powers are intimidating. Aside from being able to suck others' youth and beauty, she is able to transform into a flock of black crows, and create warriors made of shattered glass.The action sequences were very entertaining. While most scenes in the middle of the film boast the breathtaking visual effects, the climax of the film is powerful and mildly entertaining. The battle between Snow White's army and the glass warriors was very stylish. The glass warriors were amazing and the fight between the two forces was just splendid.The performances were very powerful and outstanding. Kristen Stewart embodies Snow White perfectly and delivers an astounding performance as the bad-ass Snow White. Chris Hemsworth also did hell of a job acting as the Huntsman. However, I admire Charlize Theron's portrayal of Queen Ravenna. She is the perfect person for the role. Her sly smiles hint that she is always up to something evil. She makes an imposing figure and even looks more frightening when she gets older due to the waning of her powers. The rest of the cast also did solid performances.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a satisfying epic film that delivers epic action sequences, wonderful sets, gorgeous visual effects, and solid performances. This is the darkest adaptation of the Snow White fairy tale I've ever experienced and one of the best. This is probably the only Snow White adaptation which features a kick-ass Snow White. Just having Snow White in the title doesn't mean the movie is only for females. In fact, there are many satisfying action sequences to impress males and wonderful visual effects to wow the audience. The uneven script may burden the overall film experience though but that won't hurt the film substantially.Rating: 8/10 Final Verdict: ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a dark take on the universal fairytale of Snow White and features solid performances, dynamic visual effects, and entertaining action sequences that will take viewers on a thrilling ride."
50,"The whole experience was completely ruined by lead actress who just is giving one look through 90 % of the movie. You can completely forget about the dialog quality and its delivery. Charlize is good but she doesn't have the necessary screen time to reprise the movie. Some special effects were pretty good but they felt a bit out of place at most times. Too slow, no drama or suspense, OK action. Its just a plain old sleep inducing movie. I went with a group of 18 people and all of us didn't like it.If visuals alone make a movie for you, you may like it. However, if you are looking for some depth, clever plot twists and adult dialogs, then you should give this a miss."
51,"I'm a bit saddened by the negative reviews of this film, which presents a wonderful opportunity to learn something about the shadow side of the Venus archetype. Many reviewers have failed to praise the striking revisions of the main characters in one of our most beloved fairy tales. This film is a groundbreaking step forward, as the female characters get to take a look at the shadow side of Venus, and face the classic hero's journey in a way that has previously been reserved mainly for male characters. Snow White undertakes this journey, facing her own darkness as well as her own strength, and emerges more powerful than any Snow White before her. Worth a watch, and worth a second watch for those who may have failed to appreciate these aspects of the film on first viewing."
52,"Long live the fantasy and those ones who know how to interpret them. It's a simple matter of taking the project seriously to a level of integrity and will to overwhelm, without committing the mistake of thinking that one stupid joke might save the day. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a serious fairy tale that, in spite of its original take, makes the whole adventure a pleasure to watch without hurting the classic we love so much. The fantastic music by James Newton Howard works as icing on a perfect cake. Everything works great, from beginning until the end, adopting that audacious look that transforms and entertains. The scenario is simply beautiful and Theron embodies the perfect evil Queen while Stewart, although less obvious, carries the character with grace and determination. I had a wonderful time living the adventure and if you're a big fan of fantasy, this one might work as a charm. It did for me."
53,"Loved Kristen in this! She's exciting, moving and tough. When the armor comes on, she reminded me of Milla Jovovitch as Joan of Arc from ""The Messenger."" You really sense the loss she feels in the village of scarred women and the dwarfs' home when she sees people suffering because of her.Chris Hemsworth is great, too. It took him what felt like a long time to show up, but once he is in, he rocked. The sequel is clearly going to be a love story with him and Snow White.Theron is great at the beginning and end, strangely missing in the middle. The movie has some kinda awkward cuts back to her as if realizing they forgot about her being in the story. The weirdest is after not seeing the Queen for like an hour, they cut to her remembering her childhood and then she just says ""Find her."" Middle part is kinda slow, dwarfs really sucked, could've used some jokes or something to lighten things up sometimes. But it wakes up again once Kristen picks up her sword. Battle between her and the Queen is badass. Loved it for Stewart and Hemsworth, wish the script was better. (7 outta 10)."
54,"First of all I cant understand why everyone is pouring your hatred concentrating on Kirsten Stewart in their reviews, She has done well, she has done what is expected. She is not the only character in the movie to talk about, the overall cast is perfect.. The visuals are stunning and the story is well set. All the fairy tales end with Happily ever after, and this movie from the start to end captures your senses. Especially the scene where the white stag is seen, the whole environment is amazingly done. The story touches different emotional levels in various scenes, and I like the moment when snow white calms down the troll. Snow white and the huntsman is like a fairy tale story came alive."
55,"For the first hour of ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" Rupert Sanders ‚Äî in his directorial debut ‚Äî sticks to the dark, gritty, violent, realistic fairy tale template laid down by Terry Gilliam (of the Monty Python troupe fame) in the excellent, but misunderstood ""The Brothers Grimm."" Then, two bad things happen: He allows the plot to drift off into an incoherent amalgam consisting of elements from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;"" and, worse, he allows his female co-lead, Kristen Stewart, to actually speak.Thus, a concept with wonderful potential to relate the twisted origin of these beloved children's stories to modern audiences veers out of control and, by the end, we just give up and walk out of the theater in total frustration for what could have been.That's not to say Snow White and the Huntsman is a total waste. The cinematography framed by Greig Fraser (""The Boys Are Back"") is appropriately dreary for the movie's medieval time-line. Colleen Atwood's costumes are wonderful and the special effects (animals, fairies, animated plants and other exotic creatures) are well done. Plus, the early action is driving and often exciting ‚Äî with battles, sieges, treachery, intrigue, assassinations and dark, foreboding magical forests.But when things go south, they really go south.For those familiar with the tale, Snow White (Stewart, ""Twilight"") has been imprisoned in a Gothic castle since the evil queen, Ravenna (Charlize Theron, ""Hancock""), killed her father, King Magnus (Noah Huntley, ""Your Highness""), and assumed the throne. As an aging monarch, Ravenna stays young and powerful with a bizarre botox regimen consisting of milk baths, crow feathers and sucking the life out of beautiful young virgins (gathered up by her sycophantic brother, Finn (Sam Spruell, ""The Hurt Locker""). But when Ravenna's magic mirror reveals that pristine Snow White (all grown now, going from a red-headed child to a raven-haired adult) will somehow cause her downfall, she orders her destruction. (Of course, a certain amount of audience suspension of disbelief is required to buy into the theme that Stewart is much ""fairer"" than Theron, but for the sake of this review, we will just go with that).Snow White is a wily one, however, and somehow manages to escape her cell, only to be chased through the creepy, monster-filled Dark Forest by several groups intent on getting her back to Ravenna, including a group of EIGHT dwarfs (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost, Ray Winstone, Johnny Harris, Eddie Marsan, Brian Gleeson and Toby Jones), who are obviously full-grown actors made into Hobbitt-like CGI creatures, and a widowed huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, ""Thor""), who has been promised by the queen to bring his late wife back to life.As the trailers spell out, Eric (the huntsman has a name), the dwarfs and Snow White's childhood love Duke William (Sam Claffin, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides""), a bland Robin Hood clone who now leads an army, band together to oppose the queen.At this point, the story (written by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini) begins to veer off course and Stewart, who also starred in the bird-heavy horror flick, ""The Messengers,"" is once again out-acted by a bunch of crows.To her credit though, when she is mostly silent ‚Äî looking frightened or horrified or bored or disheveled ‚Äî Stewart can hold her own; when there is more than one or two lines of dialogue for her to repeat, however, she is way over her head. Especially when she goes up against the Academy Award-winning Theron, who herself is ridiculously over the top, as she goes from ravishing beauty to Granny Clampett and back again in one jump cut.Hemsworth, it should be mentioned, is an acting black hole too. He swings a mean axe and can fight with the best of them, but when he begins to talk about his dead wife, the heavy melodrama was far too much for him to handle, and drew snickers from the preview audience.Also, look for the British accents of both Stewart and Hemsworth to go in and out like the tide. It like watching Dick Van Dyke's performance in ""Mary Poppins.""I had high hopes that Snow White and the Huntsman would continue summer entertainment's one-two punch started by ""The Avengers,"" but the intriguing revisionist tale can't overcome the scattergun acting, sequences that seem to never end or the second half devolution that makes the recent Snow White-themed comedic effort, ""Mirror, Mirror,"" seem far superior by comparison."
56,"This is not your typical ""fairy tale"" of Snow White. This is a much fabulous, darker version. I enjoyed watching Snow White's transformation; from being a frail and captivated young woman who evolves into a fearless warrior princess/queen! Kristen Stewart's seriousness and edgy charisma really comes through. No one else could have portrayed this Snow White any better, in my opinion. And, the computer graphics were totally amazing! I especially was drawn to the relationships between Snow White, the Huntsman and Prince William. Great twist! Fantastic, fascinating, funny, great for all audiences, romantic, dark, mysterious, edgy and charming."
57,"Snowhite and huntsman is decent movie with great costumes, amazing visual effect and very good acting. Charlize Theron is great evil queen. She is not just evil and this is first Snowhite movie that gives justice to evil queen.Kristen Stewart is very good as snowhite. Her accent and the way she turns her emotions from fear to firce, sad moments and cute moments with amazing dwarfs, she is very watchable. Chris as Huntsman did his job good but maybe a bit to relaxed.. his accent was a bit funny but he made also this movie more enjoyable. Costums are amazing and movie scenes are very beautiful. I think this movie is worth to be seen."
58,"It seems this movie, from first time director Rupert Sanders and co- writer John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Alamo) is made as a commercial assembly line product designed for as many demographics as possible. Kristen Stewart of *sigh* Twilight ""fame"" stars as the titular Snow White, pandering to the female audience, as well as ""feminists"" (yeah right, this movie would make Susan B. Anthony quake in her boots.) Chris Hemsworth stars as the titular Huntsman, giving only a slightly worse performance than is role in Thor, pandering to the teen-aged girls looking for eye candy. Charlize Therone stars as the best part of the movie as the evil queen. Her performance could be described as a female Satan doing an impersonation of Bruce Payne from Dungeans & Dragons. She is pandering to the guy crowd. Finally, we have the under utilized dwarfs who are given little screen time for people to properly recognize the actors in said roles. The story of Snow White is so well known that I should spare you the trouble of reading ANOTHER summary. Now, as a commercial product, it is not bad, per se, it's just more of an annoyance, watching things in a movie that have already been done so many times in other movies, let alone Snow White movies like the Disney film and Tarsem's Mirror, Mirror. For instance, this film comes to us, ""From the Producer of Alice in Wonderland,"" which has about as much meaning as advertising Transformers 3 as being ""From the producer of Letters to Iwo Jima."" This film tries to evoke imagery from Alice in Wonderland (2010), Robin Hood (2010), Pan's Labyrinth, Lord of the Rings, and, finally, *sinh* Twilight. I don't know about you, but when a movie has a $150 million budget, I expect them to take some creative chances. NOPE!!! Finally, time to talk about the director. Probably trying to copy from the book of Disney, Universal gave a director of TV commericals a budget that not even Michael Bay had with Bad Boys 2. Now, while this worked for Joseph Kosinki in Tron: Legacy, at least Kosinski knew how to tell a story with digital effects, as evident from his Halo 3 and Geasrs of War commercial. In this film, no such luck. I'm not going to say whether or not Rupert Sanders is a bad director for making one bad movie. However, I will say that if he continues making films like this, the inevitable decision is simple."
59,Loved this take of an old story. Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth were excellent in this great story of Snow White. Highly recommend
60,"Not bad....Pretty good re-imagining of classic tale. Main complaint:the lead actress with her forever wooden performance,really got on my nerves..."
61,"This movie is also based on Snow White(like Mirror Mirror).Sets and costumes look nice.I do not like Kristen Stewart as Snow White.She is too cold,unemotional and boring.The evil queen was amazingly scary-unlike the one in Mirror Mirror.The performance of Charlize Theron as the queen was the best in the movie.Slightly better than Mirror Mirror(mostly because of the evil queen),but not the best.5/10"
62,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a very average film. What's frustrating is that it could have been a very good one but for a few aspects that manage to balance out all the best parts. I wasn't expecting anything Oscar-worthy, but the film almost never met what I had hoped for, which was not all that much to begin with. The first things anyone will notice are the very, very good art direction and visual effects. As promised with the opening monologue, colors are rich and vivid, making the world look every inch the land where fairy tales are born. Blood is starkly crimson, and darkness is absolute. The lands Snow White's journey leads her to are marvels of design. The Dark Forest, with branches that turn to snakes and burnt-down, twisted aesthetic, brings to mind Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Surreal dangers lurk behind every tree and under every branch, creating suspense out of the desire to know what horror our heroine will confront next. The Enchanted Forest (I cannot recall the name used in the film) is the polar opposite. Fairies flutter in brilliant yellow comets, and mushrooms grow eyes to watch in awe as Snow White passes. These locales are the most memorable, but virtually every location looks pleasantly distinct. The latter is inhabited by the eight surviving dwarves (they are eventually reduced to the familiar seven, thanks to a well-placed arrow), who could have played a larger, more involved role. I get that this isn't Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but these guys are seriously lacking, and suffer the most from the poor script. Of them all, only the one portrayed by Nick Frost conjures anything more than a shadow of a chuckle. In hindsight, they seem to have been a rather unnecessary addition to the film, though they gain a point or two by lending an important hand in the final battle. Prince William, Snow White's friend from childhood, is never really given enough time to feel at all important, despite his skill with a bow and arrow that is comparable to Legolas. And you would never know that the Queen's brother was just that unless it was stated so many times. He is treated more like a willing servant than her one surviving family member. Which, finally, brings me to Snow White herself. Kristen Stewart does an adequate job, playing a stronger Snow White than is generally associated with the name. Relentlessly pursuing her is Queen Ravenna, whom Charlize Theron manages to craft into a superbly evil, beautiful villainess. The Queen commands an inventive supernatural arsenal, including the extremely well-done ability to summon clouds of sharpened black pieces of metal. She needs Snow White's beating heart in order to attain immortality, presumably so she can take over the world. She sends the Huntsman, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, to catch Snow White. Hemsworth works well with what he's given, but it's all too difficult to shake the image of Thor from one's mind when The Avengers is still going strong. So far, the film is doing quite nicely. However, in the latter half, the screenplay, which had managed to not intrude upon proceedings up to that point, suddenly begins to stumble. A love triangle is introduced (though, thankfully, not elaborated or acted upon), a limp speech is delivered, and a vapid clash between the Queen's army and its opposition is fought and won. Somehow, every main character, with the exception of the Queen, loses much of their respect and investment, delivering lines that are offensively cliched. The film ends with the emotionless, inevitable crowning of Snow White as Queen, any triumphant air sucked away by the foreknowledge of this conclusion. The film's ambition to subvert the image commonly associated with Snow White is admirable, and succeeds brilliantly at times. But the throwaway extra characters, predictable plot, and tremendously shallow screenplay manage to undermine that effort more than handily enough for me to come away disappointed."
63,"Big budget, big A-list stars and some fantastic special effects, especially the many creatures that inhabit this fairy tale world, but, after a promising start, I found this film to flatten out somewhat midway through. Then it builds to a predictable but satisfying end.
Too scary for young kids but not scary enough for big kids."
64,"When I watched the 1937 Disney ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" a few years ago, I was startled to see that the Evil Queen commanded the Huntsman to bring her back the heart of Snow White in a box. Thinking about that, and relating it to the present day requirement so many college students have of acquiring safe spaces to avoid such nasty information, I have to wonder if there will be a clamor to censor those old Walt Disney animated films along with tearing down statues of Confederate Generals. It shouldn't take long, keep your eyes and ears open for it.Well, there seems to be a preponderance of negative reviews for this film here in the IMDb viewer comments, probably running about ten to one against. Some of the critique is valid, but a lot of them simply parrot a standard line about Kristen Stewart's acting ability, lack of emotion, bad dialog, etc. Personally, I thought the cinematography and costuming brought the formerly animated tale to life in a credible and exciting manner. Charlize Theron's Evil Queen Ravenna was the picture of evil incarnate, while Chris Hemsworth delivered his character, The Huntsman, in a solidly conflicted manner. Of the three principals, I do concede that Snow White was the weakest, and Kristen Stewart would not have been my first choice for the role.The most intriguing part of the picture for me was that walk through the fairy Land in which the dwarfs accompanied Snow White and The Huntsman. The CGI involved in creating the animal and plant life looked quite extraordinary, and the white hart looked stunning. I didn't realize that the dwarfs themselves were shrunken down versions of established actors, though the resemblance of Beith to Ian McShane made me realize something was up. So that was an interesting element in the picture as well.I guess what I try to do is find something good to like in just about any picture and this one has it's pluses against all the minuses of the detractors. There's also something to be said about being a contrarian as well, and going against the grain. When I see that virtually everyone is piling on a movie, it suggests an element of group think to me, and I feel a lot of reviewers who might have found something good about the picture wound up going in reverse when it came time to write their comments."
65,"Wow ..my Wife and I where totally surprised with this movie. You know it's a fairytale and it ends well, but they filmed it so genius that it was a exciting journey until the end of the movie. We loved the special effects! The enchanted forest was really impressive and we where in love with every character on the set. Usually you can see if something looks fake, but they did a great job on making it real as possible. It was also very nice to see the response of other people in the cinema. They too where surprised because we heart them talking about it how amazing it was, while they did not expect it. We are glad to have seen this movie in the Cinema! The actors where doing a great job, It's been a while that I have seen acting of this level! This movies belongs to the top 10 movies of fantasy genre. Thank you so much for making such movie, we enjoyed it very much!"
66,"I really enjoyed this movie, I give it an 11 out of 10. It's not your typical fairy tale, it's defiantly not a Disney movie. It has a lot of action and dark parts to it. The fact that the princess falls for the alcoholic huntsman instead of the prince gives it a good twist. I think the graphics are amazing and the fact that the actors did almost all of their stunts makes it realistic. The best set was the fairy Forrest and the fairies were adorable. I think the main reason people are hating on this movies is because they don't like Kristen Stewart. Personally I like her I have liked her since Catch that kid and Zathura and the messengers. But most only know her from Twilight and hate that movie or the role she played. I think the acting in the movie was excellent Chris Hemsworth is amazing. I think this is the best snow white movie besides the Disney cartoon."
67,"I had to write a review... Personally, I thought this movie was good. Yes, it did contain scenes that reminded me of scenes to other fantasy films, but beyond that, I don't get the bad rep. I have to wonder how many of the negative reviewers here are biased? It seems to me, from personal experience, that anyone who thinks Kristen Stewart can't act, are those people that are fans of the Twilight books, and thus felt Kristen Stewart let down the *ahem* ""character"" of Bella(when in fact it is not that she couldn't act, it was the fact that she had no storyline to go off of but-you-didn't'-hear-that-from-me). Meanwhile, I, who have never read the books, and begrudgingly watched the first film, DO think she had emotion. She had presence, and though she might not have had as many lines as perhaps the audience would have liked(she grew up in a tower, people, by HERSELF - her character is bound to be a woman of little words, and reclusive by nature). I didn't recognize the other actors or actresses, but no complaints. I do agree that William probably would have been better left out, as his presence didn't mean much in the film."
68,"One of the worst ever seen. Poor plotting and casting: did not at all/enough portrait the emotional background of any character throughout; why the overly hysteric rage of the queen etc. And, casting a lifeless vampire as the innocent snow white, without portraying how innocent she is...? ¬†Something is very wrong there...Overly simple and expected storyline, with no unexpected joke, ¬†little, or no portrait of emotional life of characters throughout. ¬†Inferior for adult taste, but too violent for children.Whilst having that trademark Twilight feel that is supposed to win enough teenage female audiences' applause, comes with no sexy faces, muscle, or boobs to match - very vague targeted audience group. ¬†Queen's castle is not great/grand enough... That very narrow gate entrance that is only marginally wider than St Kilda Luna Park's, and it's dodgy ""gate- opener""... ¬†Not to mention that tiny open space just inside of the castle where they battled in. Special effects poorly integrated between reality and virtuality in times; more obvious between the size of fireball thrown out from castle and its effect on the beach... ¬†And, like above-mentioned, the huge disintegrity between the exterior size of the castle and the open space... And where's my bird-on-singing-snow-white's-finger scene? ¬†And that animals-help-snow- white-fight-the-queen scene? ¬†Where are they???Seems more like a cheap, low budget movie that could only afford the poor-acting Bella and the small castle interior set.It's the very first movie that gives me that wanna-leave-the-theater-half-way feel and point is given there: 2/10"
69,"Overacted by the entire cast. Kristen Stewart was still playing Bella Swan and her accent was all over the place. Not that Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth's accents weren't. Was there really no one with an actual English accent to play the three main characters? Disappointed.Charlize and Chris usually do a decent job. Not entirely sure why Kristen keeps getting hired. She has no depth to her personality and lacks any emotion in her face and eyes, except for the constant appearance of pain.Best part of this movie was the Icee and popcorn."
70,"I really, really wanted to like this movie. Given the majority of the cast and the darker cast to a classic tale, it had potential. Kristen Stewart ruined it, quite honestly.First and foremost, and I'm sorry, but she is not attractive. The other four lesser known actresses that were considered are all more fitted physically. Snow White is about a woman who is, among other things, driven by jealousy due to the beautiful princess, whose beauty is constantly remarked upon. Stewart is passing fair when her mouth is closed, but she has a tendency to just not fit the bill.When compared with Hemsworth, Theron, McShane, and others, her acting is just sub par. I will say that this is far above the Twilight stuff, but Snow White and the Huntsman could have soared a lot higher if Snow White had been played by someone more appropriate and on the same field as the other actors. Other than that, I did like the take on the story overall, though I think the romantic aspects could have been delivered better."
71,"i just got back from watching this movie after looking forward to it since the trailer first came out i was a little worried the trailer was 'all the best bits' like they so often are,but i was pleasantly surprised.Theron is amazingly menacing as the evil queen and is quite easily up there with my favorite villains of all time. i was also a little worried about stewarts acting being the same as it is in 'twilight' but she played an excellent snow white. the story is brilliant and the effects are fantastic my only whinge of the whole film is hoskins terribly wooden acting but he isn't in it enough to make a huge difference (thank god)all in all i was blown away by this film,a beautiful fantasy with plenty of action,and all but hoskins played a brilliant role.a must see"
72,"i couldn't wait for this movie to come out and i can tell you it was worth the wait. Snow White and the Huntsman was everything it was hyped to be. a great action movie, stunning visual effects, amazing sets, costumes - everything.Charlize Theron completely embodied the Evil Queen. Kristen Stewart broke away from Bella - she IS Snow White. Chris Hemsworth was amazing as the conflicted Huntsman. and the movie would not be complete without the Prince and the Seven Dwarfs.i enjoyed this movie from the second it started until the closing credits. i LOVED the scenery ... the castles and forests ... it took me to a world that i have always wanted to live in. i told my friend that i definitely was born in the wrong country and century.this will be a movie that i will purchase immediately upon release. as a matter of fact i will purchase two because i know i will wear the first one out."
73,"I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer and having seen a real couple of duds in the past few weeks (Gone, Dark Shadows and the dictator to name but a few) I had high hopes it would renew my love for films.The opening 15-20 minutes sets the scene of how things came to be with great locations and some tasty CGI we see How Queen Ravenna became queen and sole ruler of the Kingdom and what she did with Snow White. Having Reluctantly watched the twilight movies I can safely say that Kristen Stewart brings very Little to the Role of Snow White. This is meant to be a Character who isn't a depressing, one more sad song away from self harming, empty shell of a person. It may fit in to her situation in the 1st half hour of the film but as the story progresses she remains the same emotionless bore. Are we meant to believe that woodland animals and faeries would be drawn to such a person. It amazes me how she was deemed the right choice for this movie.The other Actors do a much better job, Charlize Theron is fantastic as the evil queen though a little over the top in places I think it helps convey how through time the effects of her magic have affected her mind. A scene where she is observed talking to the 'Man in the Mirror' brought me to this conclusion.Chris Hemsworth is convincing as the rugged, down on his luck huntsman who is tasked to bring Snow White back to the queen. His character has some inner demons which are mentioned but we never really get to see them explored or resolved.Other characters are introduced like Snow Whites child hood friend William who is pretty much an underused poor mans Legolas, with very little lines and little to no character development and the Dwarfs.The dwarfs were one of the highlights of this film. They brought some much needed albeit brief comic relief. Considering the great actors included in their little ensemble they get very little screen time and even a Great Like Bob Hoskins has very few lines, one of which is prob the best in the film. (If you have seen trailer you know it already).Snow White And The Huntsman is a decent movie not spectacular in any sense of the word. A few pacing problems in the middle. The locations do feel very grand and really help set the tone of the film. Some decent fight scenes, though the climatic battle is a little short, especially when you consider the size of the castle they are attacking. I would of liked to have had a little more Back story, How did Queen Raveena come to possess the Mirror? How did snow white pass time during her incarceration? How did the huntsman's wife die? (Again this is mentioned but we never get to see) and what did he do before she died? More action scenes were also needed. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good fantasy romp with monsters and sword battles, just don't expect an epic on par with The Lord of the Rings"
74,Just finished watching this movie with my wife... We were both stuck by the cinematography and special effects. Much better then most of the movies of this element.Loved the evil Queen in Charlize Theron.. She truly showed a side of herself not seen since Monster. A+ for her narcissism and her Hillary Clinton like quality in this movie.. She scared me to death. Don't let this woman in Obama's Cabinet.. The entire world would fold in a heartbeat. Kristen Stewart did a nice job as Snow White. She was believable and contrary to what some are saying on this board I thought both her an Hemsworth's accents were both inspiring.I will watch this movie again when it comes on the pay channels and I highly recommend it to anyone who like a good action flick with a love twist.I was rooting for Snow White the whole way and wanted that Bitch Queen and her brother both to get the Axe....Happy Viewing.
75,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a long film. It is made even longer by the fact that it is effectively a story about nothing, packed with poor performances, an average score and some truly terrible writing. The film has two saving graces though: a fiery performance by Charlize Theron and some amazing cinematography.Let's start with the story. An evil, un-named queen (in these types of stories names are unimportant), rises to power by seducing the King (off-screen, of course) and killing him in his bed. Her reasoning for killing the king and seizing power is that men are pigs and can not be trusted with power. She proceeds to throw the King's daughter, Snow White, by throwing her in jail for the rest of her life. But, as soon as she learns that Snow White's heart could bring her eternal youth and beauty, she sends her Brother (who also, does not have a name), to bring Snow White to her for some lunch time heart-harvesting. Naturally, the princess escapes and a long, dull chase into two mystical forests ensue.Here lies the film's two central problems. For one, if we were to care about the protagonist's fate, she should be a captivating, well-written and acted character, she is none of these things. Instead, she has almost no personality at all. Who is Snow White as a person? According to the story here, she is ""life itself"", ""pure"", and completely ""good"". Okay, but why? Does she do good deeds? What does it mean she is 'pure life? She just is. The writers didn't think it was important to SHOW these things, merely telling us that Snow White is a very good person should suffice. It doesn't. And if the writers assumed it did, they should be ashamed to be calling themselves storytellers.On the other hand, we have the evil Queen, who wants to stay young forever. But unlike the dull Snow White, she actually acts out her attributes. She kills the King because she believes he merely uses women, but does not respect them. She allows the kingdom to wither, because she believes it doesn't deserve happiness. She is evil, because she believes that people deserve nothing more than evil to come their way. In the end, I agreed. Wiping out these lifeless characters is exactly what they deserve, and then some.Unfortunately, the film concentrates almost completely on Snow White, played lifelessly and without emotion by Kristen Stewart, who has the incredible ability to find leading roles in big films without evidencing a shred of acting talent. Her co-star, Chris Hemsworth, does not help matters much, as he tries to carve some kind of a performance out of an under-written character, but there is only so much one can do with nothing.In the end, the film's script is so terrible that some of the film's virtues, such as beautiful cinematography, can not overcome how bad the overall film is. Which is, truly terrible. It manages to be shallow in every conceivable way from shallow characters to a shallow story. The film has no moral to its story, it shows nor teaches us anything. It just goes from one pointless scene to another until credits roll. And by that time, you'll wish Snow White had been hacked to pieces to be never seen again."
76,Snow White and the Hunsman is a must see movie for everyone if you are looking for a outstanding movie that you will say wow over than this is the movie for you than it is one of the coolest movies ever made i hope you enjoy this one of a kind movie that will blow you off your seat and you will never want it to end that is how good Snow White and the Hntsman is i never saw a movie this good since Madagascar 3 and Prometheus but they were still better but this one was still a good movie for the whole family i like it a lot and i hope you like it as much as i did it is a masterpiece i can not wait till it comes out on DVD hope you enjoy everyone i hope you say it was a must see movie i like4 it6 so8 much6
77,"I know that a lot of people will say that Kristen Stewart can't act, and that although the movie was suitably dark, it was uneven. Well, I completely disagree. The movie was brilliant from start to finish. The way in which the tired old fairytale of Snow White was re-imagined, was a stroke of genius. Having the huntsman and Snow White form such a meaningful bond, despite most people probably denying what I'm about to say next, did not enter into most people's mind's. Most people thought that like Mirror Mirror, SWATH was going to keep it simple and stick with Snow White being saved by the prince, despite the title's obvious implications.The film also showed why it had to be the huntsman, and not the prince, who saved Snow White, by displaying the difference in maturity between the two male leads. The huntsman is embittered by the loss of his wife, but is awakened by Snow White's innocence and spirit, essentially he and she come alive in the world together. The prince, although very talented with a bow and good at heart, has not suffered tragedy like the huntsman or Snow White, and his love for her is based on her beauty and their shared history, not a communion of souls and hearts like her and the huntsman's love. Continuing upon the strain of the huntsman and Snow White's love, Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth's chemistry was phenomenal. There was no awkwardness or hesitation in their acting out of the development of their emotional journey together. Every time he touched her, especially in the scene where he shows her how to kill someone with a knife, there was awesome electricity. Their kiss was lovely and gentle, and meaningful, which made her waking up because of it make more sense than if she had woken up from the prince's kiss. Charlize Theron is magnificent as the main villain of the film, and basically steals every scene she is in. Her performance is not stilted by what is expected in the traditional portrayal of the queen. She seems to take everything that the queen is expected to possess in the fairytale, and mix it in with the ambitions and fear of aging of a modern woman. She is every bit the deliciously wicked, wonderfully frightening sorceress that she should be. I can not say enough about this film, but I will stop myself from writing a book length review and say one last thing: GO AND SEE THIS FILM, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL."
78,"Snow White has been done and done again. Each time the story takes on something new. But this story of Snow White and the Huntsmen really, blows any other story or TV show out of the water. This is the best Snow White movie made and the best telling of the story. It was a perfect story of romance, fighting, story telling and character development. Snow White, Kristen Stuart, was very much like her Bella (Twilight) character, but somehow that was perfect for this film. It worked it's magic. I didn't think she would make a great Snow White, but the truth is she makes the best Snow White. Charlize Theron was down right scary and perfectly cast. The whole cast was a delight to watch, couldn't have been cast better.It was a well done movie, a gripping cinematic experience and a movie I would tell anyone to go see."
79,"In ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" the Evil Queen Ravenna played by Charlize Theron gazes into her aging beauty in the Magic Mirror, beside stands her loyal brother Finn played by unsettling Sam Spruell. Depleted Ravenna calmly says, ""My power fades¬Ö"" She must literally take the heart of Snow White played by Kristen Stewart, the fairest of all, to claim immortality and everlasting beauty. Theron in her pristine beauty is ferociously powerful as the Evil Queen, terrifying menace and strangely sorrowful. Her commanding voice and presence are amazing to behold. Seemingly in parallel, in the Dark Forest, Snow White asks the Hunstman, fierce and explosive Chris Hemsworth, whether he drinks out of sorrow or to forget his sorrow. Theron hints at the hurtful betrayal in her past, that has unleashed her limitless rage for the men, who use women‚Äîrather the men who have used her.This is the dark violent fairy tale world of first time Director Rupert Sanders's ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" which is stunningly beautiful and visually astounding. Cinematographer Greig Fraser creates spectacular images: Snow White befriending the magical beast in the Woods, the Huntsman striking the Queen's guards into black glass shards, and the captivating Theron emerging naked from the milk bath.Evan Daugherty along with John Lee Hancock and Hossien Amini wrote the screenplay which has a distinct feminist vibe with the brave warrior princess in Snow White played by Stewart. I have not read the original Brothers Grimm tale, but I am guessing that it did not have the village of self disfigured women and girls, who have done so to protect themselves from the Queen's wrath. Sanders and Daugherty's message that our obsession with superficial beauty can end in tragedy is warranted in this day and age.I am wondering in this revisionist ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" whether the Grimm fairy tale teetered on the balance of true love's kiss. The child Snow White wonderfully played by Raffey Cassidy is pure of heart and beauty. We learn that after her Mother's untimely death, her Father King Magnus (stalwart Noah Huntley) rashly takes Ravenna (Theron) as his new Queen. Ravenna murders Magnus, imprisons Snow White, and imposes the dark reign in the Kingdom. Then one day, the Mirror Man (eerily ominous Christopher Obi) informs Ravenna that she is no longer the ""fairest of them all"". Snow White (Stewart) valiantly escapes the castle into the Dark Forest, averting certain doom. At the dramatic narrative arc, Theron's Ravenna challenges Stewart, ""Come and avenge your father¬Ö"" For Sanders perhaps, it was never about the kiss, rather reclaiming one's power. And there may be a twist about that kiss. To that end Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart are powerful and the formidable force of good against Theron's Evil Queen.Hemsworth harnesses explosive power and sublime sadness as the Huntsman. He is a towering hero, handsome and chiseled. He has genuine screen presence. His innate physicality engages in the fight scenes. He convincingly stands his ground with the charismatic Theron, when she orders him to retrieve Snow White from the Dark Forest. Hemsworth displays poignancy as the drunken widower, who misses his beloved wife, agreeing to the Queen's offer: ""A life for a life¬Ö"" Hemsworth has a touching scene with Stewart saying, ""I am so sorry, I failed you."" He is evolving as a powerful leading man. Kristen Stewart is the surprise. She possesses a quiet beauty and fierce spirit that triumphs as Snow White in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". I think she may have been a victim of the source material in the ""Twilight"" movies. She brilliantly balances authentic courage and vulnerability when she pleads with Hemsworth, ""If you return without me, you're dead. If you leave me, I'm dead."" However, her Prince Charming, or in this story William played by solid Sam Claflin does not fare as well as the fairest Snow White. William (Claflin) had a childhood crush on Snow White, until the Evil Queen's reign. Claflin is also handsome and as William is a masterful archer. He is all very earnest and sincere, the polar opposite of Hemsworth's gruff rugged Huntsman. I don't know if Writer Daugherty miscalculates in the stacked deck.The other surprising quirk is the 7 Dwarfs. Actually, there are 8, and they are not the jovial singing little people we are used to in the Disney version. Using amazing CGI, great actors Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins lend amazing gravitas as Beith and Muir. In the magical forest scene Muir tells the Huntsman, ""She is the One!"" Stewart is the One in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". She along with Hemsworth and Theron are powerful in the cathartic battle of good and evil. The movie is a surprise on many levels. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is awesome."
80,"Snow White and the Huntsman is my favorite take on the Grimm's Brother classic. The atmosphere is perfectly brooding and the special effects are endearing. You'll know what I mean if you watch the film.Grown-up Snow White's (Kristen Stewart) introduction is very well done and Sam Spruell is amazing in his creepy role of Finn.Snow White's goodness emanates from her and her connection to nature and animals came across very well.Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is thoroughly mad and Theron portrays that well; but in my opinion, the screaming was a bit on the overacting side. Ravenna is a good take on the evil queen archetype. Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) has bluster and a sad back-story (all the characters do, really), but he's a good person despite his temporary status as a mercenary for the queen.The dwarfs feature an excellent cast (McShane, Hoskins, Frost, Harris, etc.) and they're a great addition to the film once they're introduced.Prince William (Sam Claflin) is perfectly earnest in his regret and longing for Snow White.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the wonderful costume designs of Colleen Atwood and the lovely songs ""Gone"" and ""Breath of Life."" Excellent.A few critiques I have of SWATH are the shaky cam for some of the battle scenes and the somewhat open ending. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and it's a great summer popcorn flick."
81,"It wasn't until I watched SWATH on DVD in the comforts of my home that I was able to truly appreciate it.Factoring in all disciplines involved with movie-making, SWATH is a winner on all counts.Many scenes reminded me of Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema's Victorian Age paintings, in both their composition and use of soft color hues.The 7 Dwarfs were a real treat.My favorite dialogue went as follows. Duir: six dwarfs against an army ? Coll: I like them odds. Only problem for me was there were only 5 dwarfs there! The Evil Queen Ravenna and her brother, Finn, have what appears to be a very peculiar relationship, that is, they behave almost like a married couple.Snow White and Eric The Huntsman develop a solid bond that's almost cosmic, i.e., always meant to be. This story is an allegory of how important it is to have a benevolent King or Queen. Which is why I really enjoyed seeing how all the characters on the side of good, grow to love one another."
82,"Snow White and the Huntsman is an awesome movie, but some people say that Kristen Stewart had no emotion in the movie, but that really is not true. Snow White and the Huntsman was a really an exceptional movie and the effects were incredible to, that was what brought the movie together. Also, the queen always attempted to kill Snow White but never did which was odd, she always had time to do it and then sending her brother to do all the work not fair. This is what will be put into this review.Additionally, Snow White and the Huntsman; was a good movie but the reviews could be better, Snow White (Kristen Stewart) was a great actor even though she showed no emotion she was good. But people say that was the downfall of the movie, but the director (Rupert Sanders) seemed to have no problem with how Kristen Stewart acted in the movie. For all we know she could have been told to act that way, so yes we can say that was the downfall but to the director that was a good movie and to lots of other people to. A quote from Kristen Stewart, ""It's weird, because I would be the last person in my school to be in plays, but I was forced to sing a song in a school thing. it wasn't in my upbringing, but it was one of those deals where everybody has to pick a song or participate somehow in the chorus. It wasn't the normal dreidel song; I can't really remember the words, but it was a more serious dreidel song. And that's how I met my agent, who was in the audience. I was eight."" Although Kristen Stewart could have at least put some or a little bit more emotion in the movie, but she did not. If she had then the movie would have been better and the director could have told her that and maybe he did but she did not listen. But if she wanted it to be a big hit she should have because every time the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) tried to open up to her she put him down, or she showed no emotion to him and that was sad. He pours out every thing to her and she acts as though she does not even care or anything she just stands there with a plain face and no emotion.Furthermore, the effects were extraordinary with how they made Ravenna went from her to William and back again and the same with the birds. Also, how the director had the hallucinations as if it was real instead of part of the characters imagination, for example how the queens brother thought his hands were melting and how Snow White saw demons and the trees coming after her. The most extraordinary effect was when Ravenna made that phantom army and then those creatures at the end that was made almost exactly alike from the first phantom army.Finally, the queen every time she had the chance to kill Snow White she did not and then she sent her brother to do all the work but when he did not do it right she got mad at him for it, if she wanted something done right she should have done it herself and the only time she did do it herself was after her brother died and William, the huntsman, the dwarfs, and Snow White were together. She did it then because she new she could act like William and then give Snow White that poison apple which was exquisitely smart. But this movie is the most extraordinary, incredible movie in the world so you should see it if you have not already."
83,"When going to this movie (my girlfriends choice) I was quite skeptical at first, but it turned out to be quite good. When reading all those bad reviews about the movie afterward I decided that I have to give some credit to it.When going to this movie the most important thing is to keep in mind that it is a fairy-tale. And the events should not always be down to every little detail of the plot. It's the story in general that matters. Else of course, you could complain - why was she kept alive?; how could she fight if she was imprisoned all her life? how the hell could she carry a heavy plate armor? But as I said, in this type of movie that is not the point. Furthermore the princess should look beautiful in a fairy-tail... so coming out of the sewers nice and pretty is totally O.KTalking about the actors. Yes. I think the greatest fuss is about Kristen Stewart. And honestly I had to keep reminding myself that this is another movie (not Twilight) and she is just an actress. And she really did her job well. Maybe she was not the perfect actor for the role, but that might be only my opinion. The rest of the actors also had their acting up, thus making this movie really enjoyable.Furthermore this movie has a really great special-effects and visual graphics so making it really nice to look at.So in general this can be a really enjoyable movie to watch on your free night if you can keep your mind open and can enjoy a good movie without trying to find every possible improbable thing in the script."
84,"It would have been so easy for this movie to be a bust. The scriptwriters could have rewritten the original fairy tale to be more Politically Correct. The director could have gone for low camp instead of high fantasy. The actors could have mailed it in. But instead, everyone involved takes the high road, and the result is one of the best sword and sorcery films since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.The basic story is of course the one we all grew up with¬Ömore or less. Snow White (Kristen Stewart), the young and pure princess, is imprisoned by her evil stepmother, the queen Ravenna (Charlize Thereon), a sorceress who maintains her unfading vitality and beauty by literally draining the life from other beautiful girls. But Snow White escapes, and flees into the haunted Dark Forest, where even Ravenna's soldiers fear to go. But the evil spirit that lives within Ravenna's enchanted mirror has promised her unfailing immortality if only she consumes Snow White's heart, and so the wicked queen brings in a disillusioned, shiftless Hunstman to track the princess down. But as he pursues his quarry, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) realizes there is something special about Snow White, and gradually rediscovers a purpose in a life he believed gone with the death of his beloved wife. But can even the brave Hunstman save Snow White from Ravenna's evil wrath? Naturally, the filmmakers had to fill in some of the blanks from the original and rather Spartan fairy tale, and so the film does take some dramatic liberties with the basic story. But fortunately, none of those liberties detract from the essential essence of what has made that story eternally appealing. The dwarfs are present and accounted for, albeit reincarnated as a motley band of forest outlaws who find themselves caught up in Snow White's cause almost despite themselves. And yes, there is a prince, a childhood friend of Snow White's who stands against Ravenna and is devoted to the young princess. The moral of the story remains unchanged: real beauty is more than skin deep, and even the most powerful evil is no match for true love.The movie looks absolutely amazing, from foreboding Gothic towers to lush, fairy-kissed forest glades or troll-haunted stone bridges. The film looks like a fairy tale come to life, and nothing intrudes upon the magical atmosphere. Director Rupert Sanders manages everything with a steady hand, and while the story is definitely fun it never loses touch with its inherently serious themes. The action scenes are spectacular, and even though the film is never gory there is a very high body count.And while this reviewer was a little skeptical of Twilight's Kristen Stewart taking on the role of Snow White, she nails it. Not only is she ethereally lovely, but Stewart plays the part with a gravity and bearing totally foreign to any other part I have seen her in. It is almost certainly the best performance of her career. Chris Hemsworth is a good choice for the brave and heroic Huntsman, and this is one of several recent hits for the young actor. But the standout performance is surely Charlize Thereon's evil queen. It's often said that actors love to play villains, and it certainly appears that Thereon is having a ball as the wicked, vain, and totally ruthless sorceress. She radiates evil so intensely the screen virtually burns every time she steps in front the camera. Thereon's Ravenna is definitely one of those villains you love to hate.Snow White and the Hunstman should make moviegoers across the board happy. Fans of fantasy will love it, as will those who grew up with Grimm's fairy tale and would love to see a generally faithful version for adults. Even graded solely as an action film, it gets high marks. If any of those categories appeal to you, don't hesitate to give Snow White and the Hunstman a try¬Öit will certainly cast a spell on you."
85,"Oh man. What can I say. When I first heard about this movie, I will not lie to you, I thought the same as most. I laughed it off and said,"" Wow Kristen Stewart as Snow White. This is going to be bad."" When I saw the first trailer I was like okay this movie might be worth seeing just because of Charlize Theron (and not only because she is gorgeous but because she is a great actress lets not forget her performance in Monster). She was my main appeal to this movie at first, and Chris Hemsworth is a bad ass all the time so he would be what he is supposed to be. Theses were the thoughts of a close minded man that thinks bad of actress because of one saga.To my surprise Stewart did a good job as the lead. Do not misunderstand me, by no means is she going to win any awards for her performance, but something about her just fit for this role. She looked beautiful as Snow White is supposed to and I do not know how else to put it she just fix into the character so well. As for the rest of the cast, the men that played the dwarfs did their jobs and gave some humor to the mostly dark story. The person that dominated the screen every time she appeared, as expected, was Theron. This role seemed to be made just for her. She was the fairest of them all. Every time she was on screen you could not take your eyes off of her because of not only her beauty but her acting talent was amazing. I wish she would win an award for this performance she played this role to the T but sadly she wont. Where this movie shines though is in its cinematography and musical score. Through the score you felt the weight of the situation and the sadness of the world. When you looked at the wondrous ""Sanctuary"" of the fairy's and heard the simple music you felt the pure beauty you saw on screen. One scene in particular will almost move you into tears as you watch the tremendous beauty. If this movie does not entertain you (which it will) you should still see the movie for the wondrous and beautiful world that was created on screen.I wanted to give this movie a 10 but cannot. I am giving it a 9 out of 10 because the acting was weak at a FEW PARTS not many but a few. The epic tale of Snow White and the Huntsman is worth every penny I spent to see it and I will most likely see it two or three more times to see the greatness of the scenery and the extraordinary acting from Theron and also see Kristen Stewart and how she is becoming a better actress. P.S. This movie almost gives me hope for Stewarts career as an average actress. Lol"
86,"I have been anticipating this movie for a long time and it did not disappoint!The visuals are simply stunning to look at. From the landscapes of the Dark Forest to the Enchanted Forest. The special effects are even more impressive. The creepiness of the Dark Forest alone is intense including the amazingly well done Troll! I do wish we had more of that Troll I loved it! The Enchanted Forest is equally as profound with all the magical elements of the fairy tale, as well as the mythical creatures and beautiful music.The performances are stellar! Charlize is the one and only Queen. She made you despise her and feel sorry for her at the same time. Her chilling performance is definitely one to remember. Does she scream a lot? Not as much as I thought she would. Chris Hemsworth, wow, he was just, amazing. I loved the accent and it didn't bother me at all. His scene with Snow towards the end, was just...pure emotion! His tears along with his impassioned speech just broke my heart. Now for Kristen Stewart, absolutely flawless! She IS Snow White. Every nuance of her performance just drew me in. Her fear during the Dark Forest, her amazement of the Enchanting Forest, the panic where she succumbs to the poison apple and her courageous speech before going to battle. Oh yes, her accent...perfection! Sam Claflin and the bevy of Talented Actors that play the Dwarfs were limited in this film but nonetheless a joy to watch. There were a couple of twists to this fairy tale which I loved! I won't spoil those as it is better to find them out when you watch it for yourself.I think Rupert did an excellent job for his directorial debut. If I had a criticism it would be some of the editing did seem too quick at times, and I would have preferred a few more moments between Snow White and The Huntsman, especially him training her.Other than that, I'm ready for a sequel!!I gave it 8/10 Stars."
87,"I quite liked this movie. I waited a while to rent, and when I did I was expecting to be disappointed. It looked so good and so often when it looks that good I expect too much. But I wasn't disappointed. I am not a big Kristen Stewart fan, but I think she did a really good job in this. I thought she was convincing as Snow White and what she was supposed to be. Charlize did a great evil queen. Interesting story behind her madness. Of course loved the dwarfs. You couldn't help but be smitten with Prince William and the Huntsman, (if you are female). The special effects were fantastic. I've seen it twice and would probably watch it again someday. I liked it. I didn't want to go down to a 7 out of 10 but I wished you could do halves, so I could give it a 7 1/2."
88,"We have two Snow White offerings this year but the two turn out to be as different as day and night. While ""Mirror Mirror"" is a comedy spoof aimed at families, ""Snow White and The Huntsman"" is a darker fantasy for young adults, sans the adult-type visuals and humor.Director Rupert Sanders, making his feature debut on a screenplay by Evan Daugherty and John Lee Hancock, maintains a murky and gritty narrative that stretches over more than two bottom-numbing hours. Yes, it's somewhat like taking the Grimm tale into ""Game Of Thrones"" territory, complete with lofty cliffs and expansive snowy locales.This alternate version set in medieval Europe has a witch named Ravenna (Charlize Theron) as the evil stepmother who kills the king on their wedding night, seizes the throne and imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in a tower dungeon. Somehow, Snow White manages to escape not to the woods but to the Dark Forest where the queen's magic has no effect.To get Snow White back, the queen and her beloved brother (Sam Spruell) 'hire' a nameless Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to track her down. Meanwhile, Snow White's former childhood playmate (Sam Clafin as William) is also looking for her, setting up the love triangle that Stewart of the ""Twilight Saga"" is now so famous for. What about the Dwarfs? you ask. Well, they come in rather late in the movie - and none are whistling while they work. They do sing, surprisingly.On the plus side, I like the breath-taking landscapes and fantasy sets that remind us of those in ""Lord Of The Rings"" and ""Princess Mononoke"". These help to ground the fantasy with a touch of credulity besides enhancing the movie's eye-candy value. Ditto that for the fabulous costumes by Colleen Atwood.I also like the way the dwarfs (eight here, not the usual seven) are being portrayed by top British stars the likes of Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Johnny Harris, Brian Gleeson and Toby Jones who are computer-digitized to look half their size. They provide comic relief and a touch of rough humor in an otherwise solemn and brooding film.As for the minuses, the most outstanding is Kristen Stewart whose range of expressions alternates between pouting petulance and silent rage. In other words, she is still playing Bella Swan here. Well, one can easily argue that her Snow White probably gets that attitude after being shut up in the dungeon for so many years. I am inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, having seen her play the audacious teen rocker Joan Jett in ""The Runaways"". I believe she can act better if directed to do so. Theron is good although she tends to overact, bursting into her evil rages ever so often; and Hemsworth provides the beefcake moments.My other gripe is the overstretched length of the film in which the film-makers try their utmost to provide character psycho-analyses for the evil Queen and even the Huntsman. This is quite unnecessary in a popular fairy tale and it just cramps the movie with too much baggage. All in all, it is a derivative but highly watchable fare.

89,"Reorganized:Plot holes abound, for example:Tracking people you can't see with no dogs and seemingly knowing where they are the whole time, with no explanationAn unexplained mythical deer showing up only to dub snow white ""the one"" merely confusing you as to what it had to do with thestory. The deer was unnecessary and confusing.Let's not forget, after how many years of imprisonment she finallylooks out of her cells only window to see a nail sticking out. Hmm when did that get there. Thank you bird. (>_<)Yawn:Unable to identify with snow white past the little girl. By the endof the movie I almost wished the queen had won.Speech, give us a speech... wait iron melts .. what.. How aboutSomething like, ""Evil has found purchase in this land long enough,my heart breaks for what has been done to you, but the time of itsreign is at an end... blah blah blah."" By the end of the speech Iwanted to punch someone for having herd it, and not because ofit's sway.True loves kiss wakes her up, and she acts like he helped herbring in some groceries. Oh thanks for that, now I'm gonna smileat you and maybe talk to you later. You might even get my numberif you keep this up. Thinking about this move makes me angry.Now my discussion of how I could be entertained by made on SyFy movies, and yet I almost fell asleep by the end of this move. Save your 5 dollars. Wait for the HBO or Redbox version if you must. If you liked Twilight, you will probably like this terrible movie. If you disliked or hated twilight, stay home or watch anything else."
90,"If you're like me, you've seen just about every version of this story as well as read many books. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, laughing & crying all in 2 hours. The acting was great. Kristen Stewart pulls it off. I was surprised. Chris Hemsworth is the definition of his character. Charlize Theron as the Queen, I couldn't have cast this better myself.The plot in this movie had twists that I didn't expect. It's a great version of the classic. I can't even begin to explain how gorgeous this film is. The landscape will take your breath away. I felt like I was physically there.If you're in the mood for adventure, this movie is it. Someone on here wrote a review that says it all: ""Lord of the Rings meets Legend"". I'll definitely be buying this on DVD when it comes out. Fantastic. Enjoy!"
91,"Negatives first: combat scenes too long. IMO EQ (evil queen) should have black hair (Disney version?). I thought Snow White was woken up by Prince Charming, not the huntsman's kiss.Positives (always outweigh the negatives, in my opinion): Beautiful costuming. Dwarfs very kind. Finn creepy; I did not know he existed -- but the actor did a good job. Huntsman very strong physically and emotionally; he did a lot of things to save Snow White. William a nice person.More comments: I could not wait to get home and see my TV DVR recording of Once Upon a Time, starring Snow White of course. I saw Huntsman at 2nd run theatre in October 2012, way after the initial run. I thought actress playing grownup Snow White did a wonderful job. She was subtle, then later she really reminded me of Joan of Arc in the combat scenes. She is a methodical, good actress.In the TV version, of course, Snow shares episodes with Red Riding Hood, Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket and other 'fairytale' characters. In Huntsman, Snow's story is the only one -- except maybe Mulan's (are there others?).In Huntsman, the scenery shots were amazing and wonderful. The jungle scenes were lush and beautiful. The beach scenes with all the soldiers on horseback were stunning and exciting. I realize that this scene was set up by a large crew of trucks, director, cinematographers, et al, but still the scene let us anticipate the coming final battle of good against evil. Yes, good wins the day. As Henry (grandson of Snow White in Once Upon a Time) says, ""Good will win"", and it does in Huntsman.If I sit through a whole movie, you know I like it. I have said this before. You also know that my favorite movies have singing and dancing, preferably the classic movies with tons of tap dancing. There is none of that here, but I still enjoyed Huntsman.As someone with black hair, I have always liked Snow White better than the blonde ""princesses"", ever since I fell in love with the Disney version oh, so long ago.10/10"
92,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is misleading. It should have been ""Snow White and Queen Ravenna"". Had the emphasis in the movie been switched just a little more, it would have been ""Queen Ravenna and Snow White"". Cheeky audience coming out of the cinema are heard commenting, ""Queen Ravenna must be seriously visually impaired ‚Äì how can she possibly believe what the Mirror says, that Snow White is fairer than her?"" (Kristen Stewart fans, be my guest, click ""not useful"", see if I care). A premier critic introduces the insightful idea that this re-imagined version of the familiar fairy tale is based on a different meaning of ""fairness"". Starting out not unlike the customary damsel in distress, our Snow White here evolves through the movie to become the kin spirit of Joan of Arc. If shown an unidentified clip of Kristen Stewart in shining armour on a horse back leading an army to storm a castle, you would believe that you are watching a movie about the iconic French heroine!But let's go to the evil queen first. It's no accident that in some posters, she appears in the centre, with Snow White and The Huntsman flanking on the two sides looking more like supports than leads. This movie is as much the story of the Queen as of Snow White. No longer a stereotyped villain, exquisite Charlize Theron gives a heart-breaking portrayal of the Queen as both victim and oppressor. This is achieved first by flashbacks of the Ravenna's childhood which is not unlike Snow White's. But, instead of resorting to heroism and battle, she was taught by her dying father to employ the alternative weapon ‚Äì feminine beauty. This set her onto the road of no return. Charlize Theron is simply wonderful in her multi-faceted, multi-layer performance ranging from supreme beauty to irrevocable ageing ‚Äì a performance that must be watched to appreciate.Kristen Stewart is not a ravishing beauty in a conventional way and she doesn't need to be. Just look at ""Breaking dawn ‚Äì Part 1"". Not many pretty young stars (that, she is) would allow herself to look so ghastly on screen but Stewart is at her best in that sequence covering Bella's pregnancy with a vampire offspring. In ""Snow White"", her charm is in her freshness and defiance, culminating in a fiery speech that roused the exiled army to her aid. Interesting that as she matures into her own, the gradual recognition is reflected through two strange beings ‚Äì first a menacing Troll that is somehow mesmerized by her, and later by a regal multi-horned stag that pays her tribute. Another departure from the classic fairy tale is that romance is only slightly hinted. The movie makers apparently simply substituted Chris Hemsworth's hammer with an axe. Well, maybe not entirely, as the Huntsman is someone older, and a widower. However, difference in background notwithstanding, the primary persona is still Hemsworth. There is another one, Sam Claflin playing William, son of a nobleman and a childhood playmate materializing after years of exile, to come to her aid again. If you think there is a nice little lovers' triangle here as in the ""Twilight Saga"", it's really like day and night. As to the dwarfs (rendered with camera tricks), a mere mention of some of the names in the cast is sufficient ‚Äì Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winston, Toby Jones¬Ö..among others.In sum, this is an intelligent, visually appealing re-imagining of familiar fairy tale. The richly varied, beautiful landscapes (real and staged), beautifully photographed, must be mentioned. And the most beautiful segment in this entire movie is one following the death of one of the dwarfs, where mesmerizing visuals and exquisite music (a lament sung by one of the dwarfs, VO) combine to create a mood that you will long remember after the movie."
93,"This is an ensemble cast although the leads are exemplary in their service of the story. Scenes are well timed and the landscapes, locations, framing and art direction are quite exceptional when compared the film-making shown in other, perhaps more generic, films released contemporaneously (and since).What the film does well is to marry the fantastical / allegorical content of the tale with a human / natural context. The locations provide suitable backdrop to the primary tone and emotion of particular scenes which should carry the viewer and the set design for close action and dialogue-driven parts are realistically executed, life-worn and substantial.Possibly what is less well achieved is the overall 'package' of the film. I watched this at home and was able to pause and return to the film. If I had been in the theatre my attention may have strayed or it may have been fatigued by the volume of the well written score.It seems unfair to haunt this film with criticism based upon the previous roles played by the cast. The optical impact, restrained visual effects, and story drive are to be most engaged with not the (unfortunately?) familiar starring actors."
94,"I'm disappointed with this film. If you are going to put a twist on a well known story, then wouldn't it make sense to have a strong script? Wouldn't you at least keep some of the main points in tact? For example, Snow White is born with no hair, then has light brown hair and faint freckles. Do they even realize how distracting that is? They've kept the lines of ruby lips, skin as white as snow, and hair black as ravens...it was distracting to the point of me breaking from the story and wondering if they couldn't afford hair dye due to the cost of visual effects. That being said the visual effects were very good, but without a strong story you are left unsatisfied. It's kind of like watching fireworks on television instead of seeing them in person. I will not berate the actors on this one because I don't blame them for a weak script. The writing is bad, weak, and thin, so much more could have been done with the dialogue, I mean really??? If you are going to twist a story, make it worthwhile. Even at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned queen, she looks as though she is about to say something poignant, but she says nothing, so then I'm wondering if the writers just couldn't think of anything to have her say so they kept her quiet. What a let down. Things happen in this film that have no explanation or relevance to anything else. Again, if you are going to change a story then you might want to explain it a little. I've had to force myself to fill in the blanks based on the original story. So annoying.The directing, I don't even know where to begin. It's bad. I feel as though he directed the Evil Queen overact to make her seem more dramatic. Fail. The director could have portrayed the Prince better, maybe give him kindness, sweetness, warmth, and a protective foundation for Snow White, maybe even a tiny bit possessive? Something, anything, for God's sake, he needed a personality. Fail. He made Snow White cold like snow, not full of life like she was described by almost every character in the film. Fail. I don't think the Huntsman was too badly directed however he could have been so much more. Medium Fail. I don't understand how you can have gold in your hands and turn it to tin?Since the focus was on the beauty of Snow White's heart and less on her physical beauty I wasn't bothered by the actress who plays her, however I think a lot of people missed the point of it being about her pure, innocent, and beautiful heart because of the strong feelings people have about the actress they chose to play her and because it was not ""in your face"" to counteract it.It had the potential for so much win, but instead it failed."
95,"Like many others, this version is not a tale for kiddies. It's a serious story including magic, love, politics, war. It's a little slow and long for my taste but still good. Lot of big names in the cast, I especially liked Charlize Theron who is as brilliant in this movie as ever.A few fun facts about the movie:The first thing we find out is that Charlize Theron is a wraith who suck the life out from people. She even has a device (i.e. the mirror) that's kinda like a stargate: it's a big round thing from which somebody emerges from time to time.Listen carefully to the dialog, because apparently Snow White is The One. I always thought Neo was The One but whatever.Thor can fight even without his hammer.It seems that there's still a little bit of James' venom left in Kristen Stewart's blood because she resurrected for no apparent reason.Kristen Stewart can handle vampires so why not a wicked witch."
96,"I am slowly beginning to trust USER REVIEWS...before I watched this movie I read some of them. Before I read them I was excited about buying this movie but after reading - I was discouraged!!! This movie is fantastic! My attention was captured the entire time!The movie was not predictable at all which kept me on the edge of my seat.Great acting! Great story! 8 out of 10 all day long!!!The movie was a mix of traditional ""Snow White"" principles with a dash of exciting new additives that made this movie better then I was truly expecting"
97,"When the original Battlestar Galactica came out it was well known that a lot of props and effects where borrowed from Star Wars. It's a lot cheaper to use existing props than to make your own I guess. I had the same feeling when I watched SW&THM this weekend. The setting is almost identical to Westeros and the evil queen (who by the way delivered the only memorable moments in the film) was a virtual copy of Cersei Lannister with a hint of Daenerys Targaryen thrown in. The whole movie had a low budget, recycled feeling. This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing as Battlestar Galactica proved but why, oh, why did they cast Kristen Steward as Snow White. I shudder to think what hideous creatures lurked in the hovels of the kingdom for Kristen to come out as the fairest of them all. The story itself is well known of course but the interesting twist that this version provided needed a lot more depth to make it an ""adult"" version. The charge of the castle was a huge blunder and an virtual copy of the fall of Winterfell. Why then did they not just sneak in the dwarfs during the night to open the gate instead of foolishly charging without any siege engines whatsoever? In short, this was an existing story, using (copies of) existing props leveraging on the popularity of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. At least it didn't have sparkling adolescent boys in it."
98,"The biggest crime of Snow White and the Huntsman is not its poor storytelling nor its bad casting (though I have to say it's mainly Kirsten Stewart who seem incapable to control her facial muscles throughout the movie) but its blatant plagiarising of ideas from others. An entire scene was shamelessly lifted from Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoeke (ie the magical deer with giant antlers in forest scene). And I have no idea why this scene was needed in the first place, it was strange and unnecessary and did not contribute to the overall plot nor any character development. This is not the first time Hollywood has borrowed ideas from elsewhere but many have been able to do it sophisticatedly and some even managed to produce brilliant ideas that surpassed the original which they were inspired by. This however is just plain stupid and bizarre. Also, can someone kindly remind the director that he is not the only one who watches Japanese animation?"
99,"First thing I would like to say is that Kristen Stewart really carries this movie and does a great job at it. Those of you who critique her based only on Twilight, you forget the handful of great films she has been in. The Joan Jett movie with Dakota Fanning, Adventureland, Panic Room...just to name a few. Twilight is a horrible depiction of any actor in those films because those stories are poorly written.... Snow White and the Huntsman was written to bring new life to a classic fairy tale we all know, and captivate us as an audience.I'm glad that all my expectations for this movie were met! I recommend people go see this movie if they have ANY interest in seeing this movie GO SEE IT!!! This is a great summer movie, very reminiscent of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones with the feel of the movie"
100,".... well some people wrote that it fits right in between Avengers and MIB3. Sadly i can't say this. Avengers was awesome and MIB3 was very ...lets say nice. But this.... this was boring,too long and not worth the time/money i have spent on it.Some other people also described nice action scenes, fights, battles what ever you want to call it..... none of that happens. Yes, they do fight, here and there.... but mostly they talk and when they are done talking....they talk some more.Yeah this is not a positive - , and i wouldn't even call it a - review... it's just my opinion about this unfortunate attempt to make a movie.Half of the cinema was asleep right up to the end... the other half was chatting with their friends/girlfriends. People were happy at the end, because they were allowed to leave at last.But hey, don't let me keep you from watching it. You might actually like it.Enjoy!"
101,"I don't see movies very often but tend to enjoy myself when I do. That much can't be said for this monstrosity of film-making.Kirsten Stewart was a terrible choice of actress. I ended up playing a game to count the number of times she showed emotion on her face, I was that bored.The story made little sense, it started to seem like random encounters and scenes were thrown in to give the film a ""twist"" that it lacked.Clich√© acting and dramatising. I felt dumber having watched it.My girlfriend who dragged me along to see this abomination agreed that it was a bad movie. I was squirming in my seat by the end and asking ""can we just leave?"". I signed up for this website just to warn people not to see it. Save your time and your sanity."
102,"I was looking very much forward to watching this movie, seeing as the trailer looked promising and the graphics looked amazing. It did, however, disappoint greatly. The graphics were incredible, especially the special effects. Absolutely breathtaking. The scenes in the Dark Forest stand out especially, together with Charlize Theron's scenes with the mirror on the wall, and her escape in shape of ravens. The special effects together with the scenic nature shots create a beautiful movie. If only the plot and characters could live up to all of this. On the outside, it all bodes well. With themes such as the fear of aging and the power of women, I find it very intriguing and fitting for today's society. But with a mixture of Lord of the Rings and Twilight, the movie merges every single clich√© in the book. The love triangle seems like something taken out of Twilight and just seems like a story retold badly only without the fangs. The seven dwarfs resemble the ones from the Lord of the Ring, discussing poop and drinking beer. And the bad British accents, coming only sporadically when actors remember to enforce it. (Stewart, just don't - Just. Don't.) Not to mention the various plot-holes throughout the story along with underdeveloped characters. (the brother and the queen's relationship, why did she feel it when he died?) The story comes to a close with something that doesn't even resemble an ending, Snow White standing between two guys and not deciding anything, her indecisiveness and lack of emotions quite defining for the entire movie. Charlize Theron does a great job as the wicked witch, if only she didn't have to scream every time she got mad (which happens about every 5 minutes or so). Her costumes and beauty are stunning, especially the moment of death in which she demonstrates a vulnerability that really moves you. The main problem seems to lie with Stewart, who once again is caught between two guys, while she with a blank face lets tears fall and bedazzles everyone with her beauty. The Huntsman can pour his heart out and yet he gets NOTHING in return. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two and frankly, it's quite depressing to watch. Add the other love; childhood sweetheart William, with whom she barely shares more than a two worded conversation with. The only thing that is even more comical/horrendous than the terrible romance, is the speech Stewart gives at the end of the movie to the people fighting against the queen before they head off to war. Not only is it unnecessary: the people have fled from the queen, seeking shelter, so everyone wants to stand up against her. But the speech should supposedly be the Point of no return where Stewart/Snow White has evolved and learned from her actions. But Snow White has not evolved. She is just as emotionless and shallow as before, and the speech - which should resemble somewhat the one held in Braveheart by Mel Gibson, is horrible and weak, free of passion and heart. I found myself laughing as Stewart tried to show enough emotion. Ironically enough, emotionless Stewart couldn't stop crying throughout the movie, contrasting greatly to the Joan D'arc-type of woman the movie seeks to portray. I'm not sure what they wish to say with this movie. That women cry all the time. Or that woman are strong, too. All in all, the characters were not nearly developed enough, leaving them shallow and two dimensional. Snow White was downright annoying, and the rest of them were just puzzling, save for the valiant childhood friend William, who was just anonymous. The only people I liked were the dwarfs which seemed to disappear towards the end. All in all, the movie was quite the let-down, and you should save yourself the trouble of watching this."
103,"I had definite reservations about this movie. However, I went to see it with some friends and had a really good time.Pros:Charlize Theron was brilliant as the psychotic queen. You can see the crazy leaping off the screen. And she was gorgeous in this movie.The costumes and visuals. Absolutely stunning. Especially any scene with Charlize Theron. It's worth it just for those.Chris Hemsworth. His rough and tumble huntsman was pretty great. The dead wife bit was okay - it's a little clich√©, but I think he pulled it off.The fight choreography (not necessarily the big battle, though). Incredibly sharp and really fun. I had a blast with it.Prince William. Did not expect to love him, but he was awesome and was a great counterpart to Chris Hemsworth's character.And I feel the need to mention that while I'm not a fan of Stuart, she did pretty well. She was believable as the princess who'd been locked away and wanted desperately to fix her kingdom. Not amazing, but a solid effort.Cons:The obligatory ""romance"" with Snow and the Huntsman. I think it would have fit better had he cared deeply for her in a platonic way (he is still broken with grief for his wife). And they had better friend chemistry, anyway. I did like Snow and William, though (again, unexpected). And I liked how Snow liked William and didn't really consider the Huntsman as a romantic option until a bit at the end. Very unique.Overall: Really fun, great costumes and fight scenes (wish there were a few more, though), Charlize is a BAMF, and it's a good dark movie with a tween twist (which I could have done without, but what can you do?). I'd recommend seeing it."
104,"Kristen Stewart is a pretty good actress, when she is not being annoyingly stoic, like she is in the Twilight films, she can pull a descent performance.The Evil Queen(Charlize Theron) who has the power to keep herself young, by sucking the youth out of young women, her mirror tells her that in order for her to be immortal, she has take Snow White(Kristen Stewart) heart. But Snow White escapes shortly after, The Queen hires a huntsman(Chris Hemsworth) to hunt her down and bring her back, but soon becomes her protector, and hopes to find an army to band against the queen, but will they succeed? Charlize Theron gave quite a frightening performance as the evil queen, she really has you scared out of your mind. Chris Hemsworth as good also,he looks like he just came off the set of The Avengers, but he was still good. The actors playing the dwarfs are also memorable. And Kristen Stewart was very strong has Snow White, I don't what the critics say, I think she played the part with a lot of conviction. It stays true to the material of the story of Snow White."
105,"I liked it. I liked the story. I think Mr. Sanders did a good job - definitely better than some established directors did with so many promising pictures! The world they created is a fantasy world I enjoy. Yes, there are blunt examples of what ""inspired"" them but I'd like to give a credit of a doubt and believe that they were inspirations not a rip offs.The characters: Snow White - Kristen was good and I enjoyed watching her. Yes, many peoples keep on about her open mouth and expressionless face! For crying out loud are you blind?! I've found plenty of emotion in her face, eyes etc.! Personally I think she is going to have a hard time to fight of the ""blessing"" or a ""curse"" of being a part Twilight saga as most of ""hatred"" against her evolved from there. That girl has a lot of fire in her and I hope a great future ahead of her!Queen Ravenna - Charlize gave a lot of heart to that role. It was very theatrical, dramatic - it wouldn't work in different gender movie but because it was fantasy - it worked perfect!Huntsman - Chris well he's an eye candy. An eye candy with fair share of acting talent. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy his performance!Oh, the accents! Guess what I DON'T CARE. Yes, they might have just skipped the whole bit together as it was not necessary but hey, what's done is done... From the technical side of things - good again!"
106,"Snow White & The Huntsman, one of the most anticipated movies of this summer falls flat shortly after starting and not once doesn't it get back up. The lesson I learned today after watching the film is that trailers aren't always what the movies will be like and that some or in fact better than the actual movie itself. That is the case for a darker twist on the Snow White fairy-tale we all knew as a child.Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth, and Charlize Theron are the big names in the film and I felt Charlize was the only great one. Stewart plays Snow White and honestly doesn't talk that much at all in the film (maybe this is because of her poor acting skills), Hemsworth plays the mighty Huntsman who has no character development and doesn't bring anything exciting to the film. Theron plays the Evil Queen and is by far the best thing about this whole film! She plays her role so beautifully and is so good at being bad that I couldn't help but smile every time she appeared on-screen. With that being said, however, I feel she could have been a bigger part of the movie and would actually rather have her be the main character (if that would even be possible).With the acting so-so Snow White & The Huntsman really suffered after about 30 minutes when the pacing went downhill with a good hour being super slow and boring. I feel that even though I usually like long films, this one was just way too long. My biggest disappointment was what was included in the amazing trailer that didn't make it on the big screen for some very odd reason. Not once did I hear the Queen laugh her evil laugh nor did I hear her say my favorite line ""Lips red as blood, hair black as night. Bring me your heart, my dear Snow White."" This could have easily been incorporated and it wasn't.While most of the film was negative I did see some light shine through. The cinematography and costumes were stunning which really helped me from completely falling asleep. The CGI and ""The Sanctuary"" scene were beautiful and were definitely fairy-tale like. I'd also like to give props to whoever put together the trailers because you successfully made a boring and lackluster movie look like an epic masterpiece.Bottom line is unless you are like me and went to see this film partly cause of Charlize then I recommend you wait for it to go to your nearest dollar theater or even DVD.Ryan Pearce www.vambient.com"
107,"Snow White & The Huntsman is one of those movies that you just might forget you went to see in a month or so. The problem with this movie is that it had several really good scenes, but the rest of it seemed to make you want to check your watch a few times before it was over.To make it easier on myself, I'm going to break this review up into sections this time.1. Story You know the story, it's the same classic fairy tale. Snow White (Kristen Stewart) is the fairest of them all, and the evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) wants to kill her so she can live forever. Then the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) comes in to rescue her and they start a war to take back the kingdom.I have to say though, there were several parts of the film that left me scratching my head. The magic displayed throughout, although cool in the graphics department, didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense and made me wonder on several occasions about how ""this"" and ""that"" worked. I know it's a fairytale, but in many instances, there seemed to be no logical explanation as to why certain things happened. For instance: why was the queen eating bird hearts? Why did kissing Snow White wake her up? Maybe I missed something, but I felt like the creators of the movie could have made it a little more believable.At 127 minutes, you begin to question yourself as to why you thought it was necessary to order a large drink at the concession stand, especially when the movie isn't gripping you like you hoped it would. I felt that way through the entire movie. I truly believe that the creators could have made it 30 minutes shorter and would not have missed a beat. It was simply too long for the story they told.2. Acting Actually I think the acting was very good. Charlize Theron seemed to outshine them all, while Chris Hemsworth seemed a little dry at times, but his character was decently deep. Kristen Stewart did well too, though she couldn't seem to decide if she wanted to stick with her American accent or go British. Personally, I think she should have just kept the American accent. There were so many different accents throughout the movie that I don't think it would have been noticed.3. Overall This movie wasn't a bad flick by any means, but it wasn't that good either. The costumes were terrific and the graphics where really well done. The fight scenes were intense though very short-lived. Often times I thought the camera-work was a little shaky, but I only noticed this a few times.If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, I'd wait and maybe rent it. I'm not too sure it's worth the full ticket price. It's an OK movie if you absolutely have nothing else to do.The McDandy Rating: Rent It Later"
108,"I really enjoyed the direction they went on with this film. This story was more of a female empowerment one not one focused on a romance just for the sake of having one. Also the romantic chemistry between Snow and The Huntsman does not feel forced, which I was glad to see.For some reason, while I was watching this film I kept being reminded of other films such as ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (which had a very dark tone for its time, but a great film none the less). DragonHeart(which is one of my favorites to this day.), and Willow which had a great original story and beautiful effects woven into its Tapestry.This particular Tapestry fits not only the Grimm Brother's tale, but it also stretches the boundaries and borders a bit. I really enjoyed the visual effects and loved how they served to enhance the story by engrossing you in that world. The actor's faces were not super clean, they were dirty and it felt much more gritty and realistic. This served the story well. I am really looking forward to seeing Rupert Saunders direct another period piece/fairy tale story.Charlize did a great over the top performance as the evil Queen. really well done and I loved all the visual effects that were used to illustrate her powers that she used throughout the film.The costumes, especially Charlize's, and Snow's costumes were really outstandingly beautiful! My one gripe with this film is was that it should have shown even more scenery and neat things in the Dark forest scenes. I really wanted to see more of it. There seemed like there were too many really great visuals that were not given enough time on screen to be properly seen. But overall a really neat, interesting and dark take on a classic, with room for a sequel...and possibly a full blooded romance to develop."
109,"Snow White And The Huntsman was brilliant. Honest. I was so impressed with the whole movie and cast. Mostly Kristen Stewart, because she really was outstanding in this role.Special Effects/art direction/cinematography: I have never in my life seen such stunning images, landscapes, mythical creatures and special effects look so real. They were outstandingly wonderful to look at. Or as Charlise Theron quoted, ""A feast for your eyes."" And oh it is, it certainly is. The cinematography was spectacular, going from dense and luxuriant to the vividly pandora-like sanctuary (home of the fairies and all things pure) so well. The art direction was impressive, it holds our attention so much that we don't blink afraid we will miss out, and the whole emotional effect goes with it so beautifully.Costumes And Design: The detailed costumes make us want to freeze the frame to look at them more closely. Yes, they are that good. A lot of work went into those fabrics and we so do appreciate them Colleen Atwood! Acting and storyline: The acting was top notch. Could not pick out one bad moment. Kristen Stewart proves to her haters how fantastic she really is by playing the titular Princess. She does her own action sequences, stunts, speaks very fluent British (and very well i might add)and fights like a true warrior. She was just remarkable. I really felt the loss she feels through out the movie, she brought such heart and passion to the role. Love it Kristen! Chris Hemsoworth was as usual, great, really nothing to pick on. His accent was superb, despite what critics thought. He showed so much emotion in this movie, mainly toward the end talking about his dead wife, many viewers were stifling cries. Sam Claflin as The Prince was excellent, nothing to pick out on either. Nice to see a fresh face on the big screen, he is one good looking chap, very well done to you sir. Charlise Theron, stunning as Ravenna, The Evil Queen/step mother. You really feel her pain and longing for immortality. At times you dislike her, but then you just change your emotions to pity. It just happens, you cannot help it, she really is a great actress like Kristen. She is also very scary during the movie, she can level you with an icy cold stare, her confident, yet menacing voice flawless. Creepy but yet beautiful, is The Evil Queen. The Dwarfs were hilarious! really made the movie humorous without going over the top, such an amazing and talented cast, well done to everyone who took part on this amazing journey! Overrall this movie did not disappoint. In fact, it flew over my expectations a dozen times. Considering Rupert Sanders is a first time director, this is a masterpiece. Thoroughly enjoyed it, wasn't at all what i expected, it is otherworldly and emotional, beautiful and barbaric in many great ways, but i have got to say that this movie belonged to Ms Stewart. 10/10"
110,"This is a tough one. I was dying to see this film based on the trailer. But after finally catching it at a screening, I gotta say... it is a perfectly watchable film, but wildly uneven.The good:Kirsten Stewart. She's actually really really good and gets better as the film goes along. Stewart has been catching a lot of undeserved hate because of the ""Twilight"" films and I think most people don't realize how good she can be given half a chance. Hopefully this role will make audiences see her potential.Sam Spruell. As Queen Ravenna's brother he is creepy and tragic at the same time.Costumes, sets, photography. All as good as you would expect from a big budget film.The fairies. They appear in one extended scene and are very-nature based; reminded me of Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke.""The so-so:Charlize Theron. Can't believe I'm saying this but she missed the mark. She rules the first twenty minutes... and then the film gives her a scene of screaming hysteria that just goes so far over the top as to damage all the good work that came before. Then the story completely drops her for an hour. By the time she shows up again for a strong closing, it's too little, too late.Chris Hemsworth. His character takes too long to appear (30 minutes), then is perfectly fine for an hour, then is given nothing to do in the last 30 minutes. And yes, his accent is a bit all over the place.Sam Claflin. He's... fine. Really. Not much to say.The bad:The dwarfs. Oh, lord, the dwarfs. Stunning that they are played by a gaggle of great actors - - yet I defy anyone to tell them apart. There are no real defining character traits for any of them, they all sound alike and their dialogue is spoken in a nearly indecipherable brogue. Had absolutely no clue what they were saying half of the time. Which might be a good thing given the film's dialogue. Which brings us to...The script. Screenplays are more than dialogue but the lines are usually what people remember. There are one or two decent lines: ""I will give the world the Queen it deserves"" and ""You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see"" stand out. The rest ranges from bland to howling. Unfortunately things just sorta happen in this film; no set up, no character motivation -- they just happen because if they didn't, there would be no story. The scene where the huntsman agrees to help Snow White is the worst. Could have been dramatic. Instead, it feels convenient. The script's biggest flaw though is its tone. Grim, grave, sooooo serious. Great epic storytelling is a balance of drama and humor -- look at the function Merry and Pippin serve in Lord of the Rings. SWATH has no humor. None. Nada. You might think I'm exaggerating. No. The film takes itself extremely seriously. This weakens the impact of the truly dramatic moments because they no longer stand out.Still, good moments are scattered around. A battle in a village and another in the fairy realm are exciting. Spruell's demise is almost moving if he wasn't a baddie. The first 20 minutes are hugely promising. Like I said at the beginning: totally watchable, but coulda been more."
111,"Great movie recommend it to everyone I think everyone in the film did a great job and the actors are all really good Kristen Stewart is very good at the English accent, and plays a very different role than she did in twilight with Bella. I loved both movies and they are very different from each other. In Twilight she is relying on everyone but in snow white and the huntsman she is the strong one and people rely on her. I found it very sad in some parts when one of the dwarfs dies and also when you think she has died before she wakes up. It is quite scary for younger children also because you see quite a lot of sword fighting but it needs to be there to make the film good and flow. The film is not that complicated but it could be if you are not very good at believing in the super natural."
112,"I watched this film at a cinema recently, the first film in a very long time that I have actually watched at a cinema instead of waiting for the DVD. I anticipated that the visual effects required a big screen to be savoured to the full - and I was right.As has been said here before, the visual aspects of the film (the costumes, the set design, the CGI, etc.) is absolutely breathtaking, and at no point do they seem overdone or gratuitous - they fit the style and the tone of the film perfectly.The acting of all the cast, especially those in leading roles, is superb, and Charlize Theron gives a terrifyingly good portrayal of the evil usurper. The reason I give this film only a rating of 7 out of 10 has mainly to do with the story itself:One problem is that this film is more or less exactly what you expect when someone tells you they want to turn Snow White into a fantasy film, with Snow White herself as the lead heroine. The story itself is just not daring or adventurous enough, for my taste, sticking too close to good old fantasy genre recipes.Another problem is that there are too many minor characters which are introduced but then only seen briefly; they thus slow down the pace of the story without adding any value to it.Biggest mistake in the script's most basic plot is the fact that we don't see Snow White for roughly 10 years and are then presented with Kirsten Stewart who then picks up the storyline and saves the world in a span of a couple of days. That robs the audience of witnessing any major character development in the heroine and thus reduces our interest in her. It has often been said recently that good TV series can offer you character development (and in result a connection with the characters) that movies cannot, because of their limited length. That certainly holds true for this film. The audience has far more connection with characters in Game of Thrones - or even the Lord of the Rings trilogy - than characters in Snow White and the Huntsman. And that is not the fault of the director or the actors - it is mainly a problem of time constraints. As I pointed out, I think the writers could have improved that situation somewhat by trying to give us some more ""access"" to Snow White growing up; but at the end of the day, probably only a brave and costly adventure - like turning this material into a two-parter or a trilogy - would have solved this problem"
113,"The tale of Snow White is perhaps best known through the classic Disney animation, but as a Grimm fairy tale, it hints at a darker and more primal origin. The notion of taking a classic tale like this and twisting it into a darker and more adult-themed high fantasy was previously attempted (with arguable results) in Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland."" I suspect that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" delivers the proper goods that ""Alice"" failed to. ""SWatH"" is dark through and through; it arms its characters with rough and tough steel, and pits them against all kinds of swords and sorcery. There are many visually fantastic moments in this film; some big highlights include some magnificent forest scenery (half of which is dark with lots of scary monsters, and the other half is light with a ""Princess Mononoke"" type of vibe), lots of black Gothic magic coming from the evil queen (which I loved), and a thrilling battle scene in the end. Admittedly, the film drags in a few spots, but overall it met my expectations.The story is familiar, as it hits up all the same plot points as the Disney film and fairy tale; it does do a fine job at mixing things around to match up with the new dark aesthetic, and to make it stand on its own as a medieval-themed epic. One could probably spend pages and pages comparing the film to its original source; the most notable and beneficial alterations include adding more back story to the events and the characters. The story does suffer a little for its predictability, its uneven pacing, and for having an underdeveloped romance. I was pretty happy with the character developments, however, and I grew to adore most of them by the film's end.The film looks stylish, with mostly-solid photography and quality visuals. Some scenes show some erratic camera shake, but it's rarely overbearing. Editing is not bad. The acting satisfied; I felt Charlize Theron was perfect as Ravenna; it's a little hard to regard Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth without comparing them to their previous roles in ""Twilight"" and ""Thor"" respectively, but to be fair, they did put on their most earnest effort and brought their characters to life pretty well. The dwarf characters are fun to watch. Writing is not bad. This production has excellent sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it's especially noteworthy for capturing the appropriate medieval setting to accentuate the film's dark aesthetic. Music is good; the score had some great moments, and I was enjoying the end credits theme song.Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"
114,"I strongly disagree with others who say the casting was poor. I think the casting made the film as good as it was. Chris Hemsworth played his part very well, it wasn't all that different from Thor in some ways. He plays a brute warrior. I also think that Kristen Stewart was the perfect choice for snow white simply because she is so naturally beautiful and she plays an innocent, gentle character exceptionally well.The battle scenes were pretty awesome, although could have lasted longer. I would like to have seen more of a relationship grown between snow white and the huntsmen towards the end. The ending seemed abit rushed and with that, lowered the overall experience for me. It left me thinking is that it? What about this... What about that... And not in a good way.The CGI was great, in particular the troll and fairy sanctuary, although the white stag didn't make a lot of sense to me, perhaps a more detailed explanation could have been given by the dwarfs.To conclude with it was a good film that had the potential to be a great film with the addition of a more detailed ending."
115,"Snow White and the Huntsman""Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all?"" Apparently not Charlize Theron. Snow White and the Huntsman is a re- imagination of the classic fairytale visualizing good vs. evil. This alternate version of Snow White keeps many of the same elements used in the original animated fantasy; it just complexes into a film that abruptly, actually works. Rupert Sanders' film debut is a visually stunning model, displaying cinematography capturing a depleted color of life, as well as the luminous beginning of it. This hindered story of Snow White is about a ruthless life-absorbing ancient know as Ravenna, (Charlize Theron) who strips the throne of the king (Snow Whites father). Once with full power, her magical mirror explains her fate. The queen now understands that her magic has a weakness, Snow White (Kristen Stewart). Snow White being able to escape the confines of Ravenna, wonders off in to the dark forest where a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), sent by the evil queen, will be sent to retrieve the young valuable innocent. This underrated dark fantasy filled with somewhat memorable medieval fight scenes is an acceptable version to the Snow White imagination. This film has some of the best cinematography I've seen this year, including acting that definitely passed my expectations. J M K of Yahoo stated in his article that "" Not only were the fairy tales constantly adapted to fit new audiences, they were also customized to fit our every changing society and to conform to the cultural standards and societal norms of the current group."" This is exactly what this film represents toward the audience of film in today's present day. Most audiences today are looking for action packed fight scenes with explosions and a whole jumble of other unnecessary (when needed) extras. In 1937, when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released, it was the first major feature animated film to be released by Walt Disney, and it was the start of his path of fairy tales. What I'm trying to get at is that audiences change as time progresses, and this film, Snow White and the Huntsman, is definitely for this generations viewers. Showing the action that's needed and the love triangle that throbs the typical young teenage girls heart.With that said, the cinematography in this film matches the type of genre this film falls in, fantasy. Turning from an angelic sheltered kingdom to an ominous haunting wasteland, the color tones of this altering landscape change from light to dark even back to light, resembling where the characters are in the film. The Queen's terrain is a dry unpleasant place to live, representing the season of Winter, symbolizing death. While a scene deep into the land, a recognizable scene with animals, expresses the pristine Snow White, and represents the Season of Spring, symbolizing rebirth and life. The landscape captures the beauty of this medieval glare with ease. Scenes throughout the film capture the characters in their personal emotions through the setting. Two examples are the sun illuminating the backdrop of Snow White on the beach and the muddy, disgusting, filthy ground that matches the Huntsman alcoholism comparing the two minimal standards. The most memorable setting is inside the dark forest and I will not spoil anything about it! This film is just simply beautiful and when I think of an actual Snow White, this film fits right in.The actors and actresses in the film did a splendid job. Kristen Stewart is not everyone's favorite actress, especially because of the Twilight movies, but I must admit that she did an amazing job portraying the innocent Snow White. From her first scene till the very end, Kristen Stewart's infamous bland face actually worked out well in this film, fitting in the very isolated life that Snow White had been living in all those years. Chris Hemsworth, one of the rising stars in Hollywood, alongside with his brother Liam, portrayed the Huntsman as a depressed drunk who needed a rebooting of life in him. We're able to see his character grow fairly quickly from a job, to attraction, to war. As all of these occurrences are taking place, Chris Hemsworth's acting abilities are really impressive to watch, especially at such a rapid pace. The thespian that stole the show was Charlize Theron, who I feel is making a comeback from some type of leave that I didn't even notice. Screening a week before Prometheus, Charlize Theron's character definitely helped her character in Prometheus because of how cold she is in Snow White. The yelling, crying, and whining for all things to go her way, persuaded me into her character and you can really feel the power that this evil queen actually possesses. Charlize Theron playing a villainous role fits her quite well because she has that innocently deceiving face that is hard to tell if she is trustworthy or not.I'd like to be the one to say that I've never been a fan of summer blockbusters. 2012 has really changed my mindset of this, especially starting with this film. Snow White and the Huntsman is a genre film that shouldn't get overlooked and should br watched because of its beautiful scenery and quite surprising good acting. The only problem I had with the film was the introduction of the dwarfs and their roles, but maybe I just missed it. This dark fantasy has enough action, love, sympathy, and magic that every respected dark fantasy should have. Lips as red as blood. Hair black as night. Bring your heart to theaters and enjoy Snow White. 3.5/5"
116,"At first I was annoyed that Hollywood was providing overkill yet again. We have Snow White in a weekly television show, and not one but two Snow White centered movies released around the same time. The first trailer I saw was for Mirror, Mirror and I immediately cringed afterward. Thinking I'd be seeing pretty much the same thing, I watched the trailer for SW&TH. Not being a huge Kristen Stewart fan, I was blown away by the trailer. Took the plunge and saw the movie. So glad that I did!!! Not only was it not a kiddie, watered down, live action Disney type wannabe film, but it was a movie that was well acted on all parts, had beautiful scenery, intense action, and eye candy (heellloooo Chris Hemsworth!) Charlize Theron NAILED IT as the evil queen! I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who doesn't want to see a snow white film where she's singing to birds and rocking a blue,red, and yellow Disney dress LOL."
117,"First of all,I don't know why people like this movie very much? Overrated?Snow White and the Huntsman is an okay film for me. Why? While watching the movie,I got bored with some scenes,really. For me,the movie lacks thrill and action. It can't get my attention from the start till the end. The climax is better than the last scenes. The Evil Queen's (Charlize Theron) death is lame and too fast for me. Kristen Stewart's acting has improved for me though. If they added more action,thrill,plot twists,I will enjoy more the movie. Red Riding Hood's remake is better than this for me. Anyway,this movie is still good to watch if you want Snow White and a light movie to enjoy. Ciao!"
118,"The film ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is well written, well acted, has great costumes and settings. I highly recommend seeing it. The only reason it didn't get a 10 is a few scenes of the film were slow. Otherwise, it held your interest throughout. You felt yourself transported into this world. The song ""Breath of Life"", sung by Florence and the Machine, is an excellent song that encompassed the tone and feel of the film. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this film. The trailers looked good, but I didn't expect that the film would be better than the trailers. It is an all around success for this genre of film!"
119,"Debut Movie for first time Director, Rupert Sanders, gives an interesting retelling of a classic fairytale gone madly wretched. Watching it felt like eating a sugar cookie that was dipped in acid, instead of one with colourful little friendly sprinkles of sugar. Kristen Stewart gives a remarkable performance playing a young girl who was caged up in a castle tower having just gone through her mother dying of illness, her father murdered brutally, and growing up alone banished from the world with only two dolls made of hay to keep her sane. Her character was stoic and fierce when needed, like the rose with a thorn in the beginning of the film, that was the only thing of beauty that can survive a horrible winter. Bare in mind that most of this movie was done in CG, where the actors often saw nothing around them, and had to imagine where they were and how they would react if in fact, they were in an enchanted forest or saw a fairies that looked terrible. Even the dwarfs in the film were actors made to appear smaller, so most everything was dependent on Kristen and the others, to react to things that were never really in front of them. If you think this is not an amazing feat, then you could watch Jack Johnson in his music video, ""Upside Down"" which proves that it's not easy at all to do and not everyone can do it. Kristen Stewart played her part very well and was very convincing specially when she bit into the apple that to us seemed to rot in her hand, but to her, probably stayed the same and it was her acting that made us believe that she was poisoned by it.Charlize Theron had one emotion in the movie, and it was of hate. I wish there was more to her character because it felt that she can do more than just be scary all the time. She is very talented and very pretty in the film, despite the fact that she had to play an evil queen.Chris Hemsworth did a good job playing the role of the huntsman. He gave the movie power and grittiness where it needed it.Sam Claflin did a very good job playing his part as well as William, close childhood friend of Snow White and future love interest. It almost felt though, that his character, together with Charlize's, could have made a greater impact in the film if they were given more meaningful scenes than what they were left to do.All in all, the movie suffered from a bad script that left the actors quiet most of time and left the scenes empty or lacking. The love story felt very forced, and some of the scenes just did not connect or even make sense. Sadly, there is more cinematography in the beginning of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" than in the entirety of this film. It would have been better to have shot the film in a bigger venue instead of relying too heavily on CG technology. The actors did very well for what they were asked to do, despite everything. If you want to watch something weird and have a bit of patience to spare, then this movie is something you should see."
120,"The only reason I'm giving it 9 out of 10 stars, is because I felt the ending could've been a bit stronger. But really that's it. The ending was good, but it could've had more of a BANG.First off, let me just say that anyone bad talking this movie is one or more of these things: 1) Obsessed with Robert Pattinson subsequently hating his girlfriend; 2) HATES Twilight and therefore walked into this movie already biased; and/or 3)Don't like movies of this genre. The movie was epic if you ask me.For a director that's been mostly, if not all, focused on commercials - he put one helluva movie together. The visuals and feel of the movie were highlights of the experience, no doubt. Imagine Chronicles of Narnia meets Wizard of Oz. It was awesome.Kristen Stewart/Snow White - I thought she was good. Again, she's got some growing up to do, but I think she was good. I can't imagine anyone, short of Natalie Portman, pulling this role off 100% correctly. Without a shadow of a doubt, she definitely had the look down though. She looked absolutely gorgeous, dirty and all, throughout the movie.Chris Hemsworth/The Huntsman - This guy is DEFINITELY coming into Hollywood with a vengeance. Yes, I know he's been around for a few years, but his career appears to have just taken off in the last year or so. He's determined to be the new Brad Pitt. Very talented and unbelievably hot. Give him ONE seriously good role. I'm telling you all he's going to soon show and prove. You heard it HERE first.Charlize Theron/Ravenna - HOLY ****! I've heard people describe her as playing this character in an ""annoying"" way. Uh, WHAT? She was a psychotic (she really believed her mirror was talking to her...and it wasn't), vain, envious, bitter nut job that dabbled in black magic. And she pulled it off PERFECTLY! But really, is that too much of a shocker for Charlize Theron? No. It is not.Sam Claflin/Prince William - I liked him...I guess. He was definitely the most pointless of characters in the film. I think he was just thrown in there for the sake of staying true to the story. Because it VERY obvious ::SPOILER:: Snow White was in love, and vice versa, with the Huntsman.Dwarfs: The BEST part! Basically, disregard the ridiculous reviews. Anyone hating on this movie is simply a HATER. The movie was absolutely, positively great."
121,"I was thrilled when the credits started to roll because it meant the movie was over. In most cases I had a hard time caring about any of the characters; I felt like I was watching a run through. It didn't feel like any of the characters were really talking to each other and sometimes even their reactions made no logical sense. I can't tell if this was an acting problem, a writing problem or both. Someday I may watch it again but with the volume off.I'm really disappointed. This movie had so much potential and it's visually stunning, but a movie needs a lot more than visuals. I don't want to turn this into Kristen Stewart bashing but I do wonder if the other actors would have performed better with another actress as Snow White."
122,"The movie had some fantastic leads. Charlize Theron as the witch was amazing, and Chris Hemsworth was expressive and stole the spotlight. Theron's portrayal showed the witch as desperate, alone, and slightly insane. Hemsworth's Huntsman was haunted and every time he was on camera you couldn't look away. Both characters came alive and made the story believable.However, Kristen Stewart as the lead was a mistake. She was clearly out of her league, and every line she had was a pull from the story as you realized it was just some actors walking around talking instead of a full immersion into the movie.To quote a friend, every time she was on screen, ""The illusion was shattered!"" There's a scene in the ""Sanctuary"" that is stolen, camera angles and all, from Princess Mononoke (the appearance of the Forest Spirit). There was no attempt to hide it, the spirit looked exactly the same, antlers and all.Why were the dwarfs full size actors? Were Bob Hoskins and Nick Frost more believable than ACTUAL little people acting? Really? There are so few acting jobs tailor-made for them, why take the role away? The ending: No spoilers, but the climax will leave you completely annoyed. You'll wish the was 30 seconds more of plot and it seemed rushed and forgotten until they tried to meet a deadline.I wish they'd hired someone else as Snow White, I wish the writers could come up with original plot points (there is nothing unique or new about this, even the Troll in it looked like the white gorillas from Congo). The action is good, and the pans of the landscape and castles were great, and the dark forest was absolutely terrifying. Worth a rental, but not seeing in the theater or owning."
123,"this review will contain spoilers. from the start this movie was OK, Chris Hemsworths Scottish narration through the 1st 10 Min's opening up the scenes for the evil queen to take over, but as my daughter said ""so the king met her and within 1 day married her, thats weird"" So the evil queen marries the king kills him and takes over, locking up young snow white. Raffey Cassidy played young snow white with a depth that made Kristin Stewarts performance look strained, and for all the 20 Min's she is in the movie she nearly gets as many lines. so after an unspecified number of years we meet the older snow white, stuck in a tower saying the lords prayer (not sure why or what a Christian prayer has to do with anything else in the movie) we then have an escape, with a nail to the queens creepy brothers face (found with the help of some magpies) down the sewers, a chase scene ripped directly from LOTR complete with dark riders, a drugged out trip in the dark forest and Chris Hemsworth being hired to hunt snow white down. then a change of heart an escape a fight with a troll ripped from fable III were we 1st learn the Snow white is not all she appears to be, a rescue by some scarred women who's village then get burned to the ground, and then the dwarfs... who were played quite well by the likes of Bob Hoskins, Ian Mcshane, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and others. but you are always aware that these are full sized adults playing 3 foot dwarfs by computer wizardry and as soon as I saw them i wondered how they did it and it took my attention from the movie. I actually agree with a statement from Warwick Davis that the producers should have found dwarf actors, there are plenty and some of them are fantastic actors. so we meet the dwarfs they argue about what to do then take SW and the huntsmen to a enchanted glade with fairy's, turtles, magic butterflies and a giant white deer, who lets everyone know that SN is special. Then an attack by the queens brother and henchmen who now include SW childhood companion who escaped when he was younger, and who is trying to make up for however many years of not doing anything. what follows is a death a reunion the apple the kiss and a speech from SW that made me and my daughter look at each other and say ""what"". then a full frontal assault on a castle that seems to keep changing location and is so well guarded and protected that guess what a load of soldiers die but when they do get through suddenly there are 100's more soldiers than there should have been. so SW take on the queen and wins gets crowned. but by the end you just don't care. Charlize Theron is great and as pretty as always, Chris Hemsworth can be forgiven his accent but he looks embarrassed every time he is with SW. the dwarfs are played well but by the wrong type of actors. BUT Kristin Stewart is terrible, she reminded me towards the end of the movie of an actor from the Brian blessed school of actors. 1 positive she plays a corpse brilliantly.the effects are mostly well done, the script is mostly OK, the acting is mostly OK, but the lead let this down badly and you are sat watching her pulling faces in close up and saying about 30 lines throughout the entire movie. if you want a snow white movie get the DVD of Mirror Mirror, if you want a movie with trolls, dwarfs, a script and good acting watch LOTR.if you want to wast 127minutes watch this movie."
124,"Charlize Theron = 9 stars; Visual experience = 10 stars; Dwarfs = 7 stars; Everything else = boring.Needs a better story line, a better Snow White, and a hero with a developed back story. The movie felt extremely long. The drawn out scenes of them walking through the kingdom was lack-luster. The scenes where there was acting was well produced and was visually stunning. The evil queen was well played by Charlize Theron, emotion was well conveyed, and the visual effects were well produced here as well.I would only recommend seeing it if you are a big fan of visual effects. Not much else to see here."
125,"Snow White and the Huntsman. It was good. Entertaining. Nice back story to Snow White and Queen Ravenna. Makes you feel sorry for Ravenna which was good, she used to be living on the streets in a medieval slum-like place where she and her family were treated badly, she wanted to rise up and become powerful. The power over-took her. Charlize Theron's performance was quite good, believable. Kirsten Stewart is actually quite good too. Puts on a good English accent and fits Snow White much more than Bella Swan. Her performance in the later part of the film is quite strong. Chris Hemsworth is practically playing Thor again, I assume that's the reason he was cast. His back-story was an obvious tear-jerker. The first part of the film was quite slow, but the second part as soon as the 'dwarfs' are introduced, the film becomes more fast-paced and exciting and humorous. The special effects are very good in all of the film, except two points where they are really bad, both involving the Queen. The clich√©s and predictability mainly kick in the last couple of scenes, but mostly because we all know the Snow White story before. The film felt like a cross between Lord Of The Rings and Princess Mononoke, with even a tiny bit of Braveheart. 7.5/10"
126,"Growing up I remember never quite liking Disney's ""Snow White"". Yes, the movie was sort of cute, but the heroine was way too sickly sweet in my opinion. Snow White had grace, beauty and kindness, but because of her complete lack of flaws she came across as boring. So I ended up rooting for the evil Queen instead.Universal Pictures' ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" was promoted as a movie where Snow White got to be independent, strong and brave. In the trailers you saw Snow White (Kristen Stewart) preparing an army for battle, fighting and yelling. They actually made it seem like they had made Snow White a two-dimensional character that was more than a pretty face. So why did I still end up rooting for the evil Queen?The main problem with the movie is the casting of Snow White. While they never implied that Snow White actually is fairer than the Queen (Charlize Theron) physically ‚Äì they emphasized more on her inner beauty and kind spirit ‚Äì they couldn't have meant to make Queen Ravenna more sympathetic too. Since Stewart is such a limited actress she has trouble making Snow White likable and relatable, mainly because of her mannerisms (eye-rolling, mouth-breathing, monotone voice). Theron however is a nuanced actress that conveys every single one of Ravenna's personality traits and feelings effortlessly. There have been criticisms of her over-acting, but I felt like the character was supposed to be dramatic and Theron's performance captured that perfectly. She makes Ravenna a tragic but heartbreaking portrait of a woman too obsessed with youth and beauty for her own good (there is a very sad back-story of how she came to be as obsessed with beauty as she is.)Story-wise the movie doesn't stray far from the classic fairytale. The story of how Snow White's mother dies and her father then remarries a beautiful but evil woman has remained intact. The part where the evil queen has a huntsman going after Snow White for her heart has been emphasized more with the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) now becoming an ally/love interest for Snow White. The poison apple, the dwarfs and the prince all make appearances too. But the ending is more of an actual battle (horses, swords et cetera) than in the classic fairytale, and it also needs to be said that the movie has an overall darker feel.Apart from Theron's performance, the movie's main strength lies in its visuals. The set decoration, locations and editing are all breathtaking ‚Äì but Colleen Atwood's costumes are the main draw. Never in my life have I seen such detailed and beautiful gowns as those Ravenna wears. They add an air of luxury and indulgence to the movie and are a shoe-in for a ""Best Costume""-nomination at next years' Oscars. The music score is fantastic too, and James Newton Howard proves just like he did in ""The Hunger Games"" what a great composer he is.Overall ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" could use a better lead actress and some cutting (the middle part of the movie feels dragged out) but remains an entertaining, adventurous film for fans of epic fantasy movies. And fans of Charlize Theron shouldn't miss it for the world ‚Äì she proves that she is not only the fairest of them all but one of the best actresses in contemporary Hollywood."
127,"To rate this movie with 1 and say is awful is to praise it beyond belief. I thought Mirror, Mirror was horrible (with flaccid over-lifted and overstretched face of Julia Roberts, weird eyebrows of Lily Collins that simply take over every scene she's in, leaving you speechless - has she ever heard of plucking or waxing? - and everything else that was wrong and bad with that movie, namely: everything), but after seeing this butchery of this beautiful, classic tale, I can only say I pity every person that sits through this cascade of boredom, bad lines and even worse acting. I have seldom in my life seen such a horrid film, and I generally like to laugh at bad movies. This, however, is so dull, one can only stare in horror and disbelief of how low the quality of the main stream movies has sunk in recent years. Compared to this crap, even the dumbest 80's movie is a finest piece of art and highlight of human imagination. Seriously, why would anyone make this kind of unbearably boring and stupid movie unless they are completely sadistic and misanthropic with no regards nor respect towards their audience? And the acting, if that kind of under-performance can be called that, was even worse then one in the cheapest low-budget/no-budget trash movies. With this kind of script with clich√© lines and altogether lack of any kind of literacy, bad directing with shamelessly rip-off moments from movies like The Legend and The Lord of the Rings, one can not wholly blame just the actors. That is, with the exception of Kristen Stewart, who, although a very bad and mediocre actress in general, here managed to give her worst performance yet! It's almost mesmerizing the way she completely and utterly can not act. She keeps one blank cow-like facial expression throughout entire film, that makes her look constipated and in pain. I've set in a chairs that could act better then she can! Besides being one of the ugliest people on the screen today (even Dumbo would envy those ears and that chin makes Sarah Jessica Parker a normal non-horse face person), she is absolutely the worst living actress of our time, a true sign how Hollywood has no more standards of any kind. Chris Hemsworth at least looked like he tried to get into the role, but none can blame him for failing with her as a partner. Bob Hoskins already embarrassed himself in Mrs Henderson Presents by scarring us with his nude figure, but this time he apparently decided to degrade himself even more and scared us with a really lousy acting. As for Charlize Theron, once a synonym for a good film and a masterful performance, I can just say that this is one embarrassment I have never expected to see. How can such a brilliant actress engage herself into such a bad movie and she herself give such a bad performance as well, it's beyond me. I just hope her next project return her carrier on a right path and make her another Johnny Depp, with declining role choices and tiring same acting. You can do better, much better, Ms Theron!If you still haven't seen this movie, my advice to you is: DON'T!!! Avoid it forever and never ever take even one glance at it, cause it will be a horrible waste of your time, time that no one will ever give back to you. So, better watch something else (even watching grass growing is more interesting then this film) or go outside and take a walk, at least that way you'll do something good for yourself."
128,"So one day, I'm sitting with a friend in a bar and she tells me that the snow white movie isn't as bad as it could be with Kristen Stewart in the lead. I thought in my head that the trailer looked great until her expressionless face appeared. It made me not want to see the movie ever. Against my better judgment, I saw the movie with my wife, and here's the synopsis:Before I go bashing KS, I want to say that I don't hate her nor am I prejudiced against her. I think she's a terrible actress and is a big part of this movie being so terrible. If she ever acts well in a movie, I'll be sure to give her a good review.*spoiler alert* So how does KS ruin this movie? Lets face it, she tried. She's twice as good here as she was in Twilight...which makes her still terrible. The first half of the movie she spent with the same old emotionless expression on her face. I don't understand why, but she always looks like she's out of breath. This is fine for scenes like running in the woods away from the queen's men, but the second half of the movie really got me with most painful scene I have ever seen in any movie. In the scene where Snow White rallies the troops, she looks as if she's yelling at a crowd of people. The camera pans to a top-view where you can see that she carries herself like an upset 10 year old girl...her back isn't even straight. By the time she was done with her speech, I was really expecting her troops to just walk away. Later on she leads a charge against a castle riding through the sandy beach. Her body is turned to the side on the horse for some reason, which makes her look like she's scared of the water splashing up on her. It's like watching James Bond wear flotation devices to swim.So as the main protagonist, her lack of ability to act takes away from any kind of more intricate story this movie could have offered. The plot is very simple with no twists. The rest is just action sequences and scenes that build nether story nor character. The romance consists of 3 kisses and leaves you hanging. There is no drama because KS always looks emotionless. There's no comedy because it's not a funny movie."
129,"I was a little weary of paying to see this given some of the less than flattering reviews it has been receiving. But, I decided to make up my own mind and I am very glad I did. This movie was great. The story was a very original take on an old classic and the way they twisted in the darkness of it was beautiful both visually and conceptually. It stayed with a fast enough pace that you were never bored but not so fast that you were rushing through the story. As far as performances go I had no complaints there either. Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart, though not in many scenes together, contrasted each other wonderfully. Chris Hemsworth did a great job pulling you into his character even without a lot of material. Im not exactly sure why so many people are giving Kristen such a hard time. She was very convincing in her portrayal of this Snow White. Basically, I would suggest anyone who is unsure whether to pay to see this or not just do it. Forget the criticism being thrown at this movie and see for yourself. Im fairly certain you wont find it as bad as it is being described as, just give it a chance."
130,"I am pleasantly surprised by Snow White and the Huntsman. Kristen was my biggest surprise, her acting is certainly exceeds my expectations. The cinematography is stunning, set locations are amazing and feels right extensions to the story. The story is well told, it is a grim, dark version but still one can connect to the story and characters emotionally, that itself I think one of the success of this movie. For me, it did not feel like a another modern interpretation of a fairytale from a far far away land. It is not a stale tale but one with darkness, fear, vanity, hope, beauty and love. If you are up for a well thought, beautifully crafted and serenely told fairytale, don't miss this one."
131,"I personally would give this movie a 10! I love all the supernatural and special effects that are in the movie. Most of all the fact that there are some scenes which you can flash back to that animated version we once saw when we were younger. Th movie has one waiting to see what action will be next and what twisted turn the evil queen will take. This movie brings to life the seven dwarfs as seven true jolly warriors who fight to save their queen, ""snow white"" and as well all the forest animals who bow to Snow White by showing submission to her and no fear to her person. I do not recommend this movie fr kids under seven who may not understand that some of these animated monsters are not real."
132,"I was initially disgusted when I heard that Snow White was going to be re-imagined as some sort of Lord of the Rings-esque action epic. I mean, it's Snow White, the gentlest of them all. And when I heard Kristen Stewart was playing Snow White, I almost threw up. I'm not really a fan of Twilight.But my sister convinced me to go see it. So I went and was pleasantly surprised. I liked it. No, SWatH isn't going to win any awards, and maybe Kristen Stewart isn't an incredible actress. But she did just fine. I know KStew is the biggest problem most people have with this movie, but honestly, I don't know what they expected from this character. It's supposedly a more realistic adaptation of the fairytale. Considering that Snow's been imprisoned all her life, I don't think she'd be all jokes and smiles; she probably wouldn't even be accustomed to carrying on long conversations. Isolation will do that to you. She's had a grim and scarring past, and KStew plays a serious, scarred young woman who only occasionally shows off her more unguarded side. And KStew does it just fine. I was less impressed with Theron's acting and her poor accent. I felt like she overplayed her character. Hemsworth's and Claflin's acting, however, was spot-on.The plot is sort of meandering. Personally, it didn't bother me. I guess that's because I've read so many fairy tales and fantasy stories that do meander. A lot of the time it comes with the territory. It will bother some people though. It's just a matter of taste.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. It is one of the prettiest movies I've seen. Yes, the style borrows heavily from LotR. But it puts its own twist on it, and it's so pretty I have to forgive it. The LotR influence carries over to music, to much the same effect. Again, it's well done enough that it doesn't bother me. ""Gone"" sung by Ionna Gika is chillingly beautiful and used tastefully in the context of the movie.Overall, it is not a good adaptation of Snow White. It barely has the elements of the Snow White fairytale. It's not intellectual movie-making, and it won't stand the test of time. But if you watch it for what it is (an entertaining and visually stunning film), you may just find that you enjoy it."
133,"To a certain degree, we're all familiar with the story of Snow White. Fairest of them all, poisoned apple, true love's kiss, you know how it goes. But this movie makes a good job at answering the question ""What if Snow White were real?""The movie's three leads are incredible and they honor their reputation as actors.Let's start with Snow White herself, Kristen Stewart. I admit that I felt contempt for her role in the Twilight movies. She even admits she dislikes Twilight. But after seeing her in the trailer, I completely fell in love with her. After all the work she has done, Kristen definitely breaks away from Bella Swan in this movie. She was sweet and awesome.Now, the Huntsman, Chris Hemsworth. Thor and the Avengers definitely were good points to his career. It's a good thing he got the role during his rise to fame, otherwise, people might start typecasting him. Then again, the Huntsman can be seen as a darker version of Thor without superpowers. But he is still a plus in this movie.Charlize Theron was impressive as Queen Ravenna. I admit some of her evil speeches were more hilarious than terrifying, but she definitely delivers a right performance.As for the supporting characters, Sam Claflin was a nice choice for the Prince. He doesn't exactly resemble the Prince from the Disney story, or even the original story, but given the atmosphere of the movie, this can be justified. The Dwarfs are still here, being played by well- established actors are a bonus. They are strong points in the movie as well.I admit some of the parts of the movie felt rushed and predictable, but this movie is definitely worth watching."
134,"I hate going to theaters, but I should have gone to see this one ... the visual effects are wonderful, as are the very artistic scenes, which means that I totally disagree with the one review I read from Mek Torres ... whom I find to be quite unfair in his appraisal of this film.I purchased the DVD at Wal-Mart ... and I have watched it, and only it, for the past three days. Why? Because of its depths, and because of its many messages.There are a few things I found less artistic, as well as less realistic (as in to their world). The brother's scarred face was a huge mistake. If the Queen was so powerful, then why wasn't her brother as beautiful, and without scars ... afteral, she did heal the gash Snow White gave to his face. So, that ruined the fantasy a bit.Charlize Theron's over the top acting, in many scenes, is quite typical of the personality of the Queen in the story of Snow White. Royalty often appears overly dramatic ... almost godly ... and definitely eccentric, if not mad! As for Kristen Stewart ... her acting was top-notch ... but she just doesn't measure-up in the beauty department. Don't get me wrong, she is very attractive ... but Snow White was definitely a Marilyn Monroe type character, with a very pale complexion ... the part of Snow White should have gone to Charlize as well. That is the only way the Queen would have deserved second billing to Snow White ... common sense! And the picture would have been worthy of a nod from The Academy.The scenery was exquisite, as were the costumes ... and there is a lot to be taken in with this movie. Most of the casting was spot-on ... especially when it comes to the dwarfs! Oh, three cheers for the creators of the fairies! All in all ... a very pleasant experience that could have been better, but, still, will be a movie I will enjoy in future years."
135,"I loved everything about this movie. The acting, the effects, the story; it was a magical ride. I was saddened to hear that this movie was panned when I found it quite entertaining. I think some people get too caught up in original stories and can't let interpretations happen. I liked how they tied the original story into this new adaptation. The huntsman, the apple, the dwarfs are all there; this just creates a different angle.Kristen Stewart stars in the title role of Snow White. A fan of hers since Twilight, I was eager to see her in a completely different role. While she did display some of her classic deer-in-the-headlights look, she did also show emotion and empathy throughout the film. Some would say she is unattractive, but I find her to be. I thought she was quite beautiful in this, most especially when she wore her white dress.Chris Hemsworth is the Huntsman. I have only recently discovered this man, having seen The Avengers, and am in love. He is not only attractive; he is a good actor too. As the Huntsman, he does not get to portray a wide variety of emotions, but the ones he does portray were realistic. The Huntsman is angry that his wife has died and wants to join her. He provokes fights because he doesn't care about anyone or anything. He is sent on the mission to bring Snow White to the queen and along the way he begins to warm up to her. His intentions change along with his feelings and Hemsworth shows this. By the end, you are convinced that he is in love with her. Hemsworth does this beautifully.Charlize Theron is Queen Ravenna and is brilliant in the part. Although I wanted to see SWATH for the budding romance, I was instantly drawn to the queen. I couldn't help smiling when she was on screen as she is the quintessential villain. Theron plays her evilly, yet with empathy. You actually understand why she is the way she is, and in a way, you want her to win. She is perfect when yelling orders (which she does quite frequently) and her scene where she felt her brother's pain was excellent. It is easy to see why this Oscar-winning actress was desired for this role. She emulates the queen perfectly. If someone did not like Stewart or Hemsworth, that person should see this movie for Theron alone. It would be interesting to see a prequel regarding the queen's life prior to Snow White.Bob Hoskins is almost unrecognizable as Muir, one of the dwarfs. I had no idea it was him until the end credits. His line ""you have eyes, Huntsman, but you do not see"" wraps up the then-budding relationship of Snow White and the Huntsman. He knew that she was the king's daughter, but he was unaware just how powerful she would be. I believe this is one of the reasons why he fell in love with her. Hoskins' character, of course, already knew it, even though he could not physically see it.Sam Claflin shines as William. I was not a fan of the love triangle that was emerging in the story; I solely wanted Snow White with the Huntsman. But then I started thinking of how much fun that could be. The two of them could battle for her affections and cause some very comedic moments. In this story, the romance with both of them is pretty subtle; you would miss it if you weren't looking. The only real indication is that William kisses Snow White when he thinks she's dead.The biggest stars of this movie are the special effects. I was quite blown away by the way they made the queen get to Snow White and how they portrayed the mirror. The music complements nicely and I want to add the soundtrack to my collection. For the most part, it is all instrumental, but the songs that aren't fit perfectly.In the original story, Snow White's spell is broken by the kiss from a handsome prince. In Snow White and the Huntsman, the spell is broken another way. I loved this because I was rooting for the Huntsman and this gesture proved that HE was her one true love.My only complaint with this movie regards the white horse that Snow White rides. When he drops into the mud and not able to go on, we are not shown what happened to the horse in the Dark Forest. Perhaps we are to think that he is magic and disappeared right after Snow White ran away. After all, he was just sitting on the beach waiting patiently for her after she escaped the castle. But we don't know that for a fact. I would have liked the horse to have appeared in a scene later, showing the audience that he was okay and letting Snow White know she was the one to ""heal the land."" Snow White and the Huntsman is not the best movie of all time, but it is a good time. I enjoyed it and will recommend it to people. It is a new twist on a classic tale and one that can be taken into interesting territory if played right. The end of the movie hints at a sequel and I am excited to see what that will bring. No doubt there will be more depth to the budding relationship between the two leads. Regardless of where they go, they have a franchise on their hands. Snow White and the Huntsman is a fun ride."
136,"""An Amazing Movie Experience! It has the full-scale charm of many other epic fantasies like the Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia even if it mimics them too deeply...""I've always wanted to see a different version of Snow White. I've seen Disney' version countless times already and for the most part, I'd admired the artwork and the sing-a-long songs that made that experience so 'lively.' However, I knew the Grimm' had a different perspective, one of darker and meaningful aspects...more lets just say 'grim.' When I watched in my childhood, I never looked into it really. All I really cared about was of that red-looking apple whom was eaten by Snow White and it made me really hungry for an apple. However, as I look back on it now; the Snow White legend really came off as a creepy and cautionary tale just like that of the Little Red Riding Hood. We each have our own interpretation which is undeniable but we all can agree that the story of Snow White isn't always the most jolly out of all the other Grimm stories that our 'mother' (oddly enough) used to read to us. In fact, the Little Red Riding Hood was meant to scare little children. I mean come on! A little girl with a red coat walking straight through the dark forest is kind of creepy in itself just like that of a little white girl swinging on the swings at the hours of midnight. Its even more scary when she meets a talking wolf who then eats her grandmother and dresses up to be like her....that to me is very strange. Anyways, the storyline for this movie is still the same. However, it felt like the characters were just trying to find a way which is entirely understandable and it made the experience feel human, so it wasn't so predictable in that sense. The performances were memorable and I really loved that each actor went deep into their roles even though sometimes that's not always the case for the many other films they played in. Charlize Theron' Ravenna is now one of my favorite villains. In the film, she has a good back story; its touching, sad and tragic so it does explain why she's the way she is. I felt a little sympathetic because not only is she the many Kings tool (not to mentioned curse), she's just like any other human. She fears death and growing older. She also feels (like I mentioned) used and replaced. However, I can't sympathize with her too long because sooner or later her cold eyes pop out and her character turns like the prophetic Evil Queen. This movie was meant to be played by Kristen Stewart. Although many complain that she isn't the fairest of them all, let alone Charlize Theron. Just to put it out there; I think Kristen Stewart is one of Hollywood's most unique actresses because she is shy and she does want to keep her personal life to herself. I have to say too is that she is gorgeous-attractive even hot when she wants to be and many others will agree (her fans mostly). Snow White has been imprisoned in her room for 10 years so her voice is raspy and she is 'shy.' However, (when you're watching this film) her character has this sort of drive-determination and power especially when she's in the Dark Forest; always pushing and moving forward...I mean I would though if my life depended on it but that's not the case here, she even says the Lords Prayer: 'forgive the sins of others.' She even goes to battle with shining armor and faces (in the end) the Queen. I mean doesn't Snow White sound at all familiar to Kristen Stewart' publicity and their hate campaign. Kristen Stewart conveys a lot of emotions in this one and in many of the scenes, lets out a couple of tears. Chris Hemsworth is completely watchable as the drunken huntsman. When he's battling it with Finn, couple times I wanted to shout out 'COME ON WHERE'S YOUR HAMMER!?!!' Overall, he's noticeable and has a good screen presence. The Dwarfs are what made the movie experience more lighter and happy (?). They took off the heavy load of the first hour and brought us to the Sanctuary. One of my favorite scenes. The visuals are impressive as can be. I mean clearly you can see it through the trailers and clips. The cinematography balances out, changing from dark to light. The camera-work is also impressive and less shakier than that of The Hunger Games (loved that film btw). I'd also liked the many battle scenes and the grand scale of it all. It was truly a unique experience. The visuals and the script made most of the scenes memorable. The disappointing factor is sort of the end. They build so much tension in the first hour and a half that the second half is a let down. I loved every scene until the last 5 minutes. The most dramatic and emotional scene came from the two main actresses and the showdown. The music was what made it so compelling and I have to give props to Mr. James Newton Howard because he really does capture that epic fairy-tale action. So a sold 5 on his part. The ending sort of left the audiences hanging like does so and so go with so and so (sorry no spoiling the movie). It was wise later on to hear why the director left out the romance, Kristen Stewart would've been playing the same movie just without the werewolves and vampires. Overall, Snow White & the Huntsman is a must see on the big screen! It has a heart as much as it does action. One of the best movies of the summer so far. 4.3/5 *Must own on BLU-RAY for its magnificent special effects."
137,"Okay, I wasn't expecting to be wowed, and there were parts of this movie that had me going 'what, really?' but there were other parts that were so unexpected, gross, delightful, beautiful and funny that I give the movie an 8 out of 10 overall.The depiction of the black magic that the Queen uses was great. I loved the dwarf characters and they were done incredibly well effects-wise also. SPOILERS: both forests, the Dark Forest and the Fairy Forest took me by surprise. At first I was like pfft! Dark Forest is a Swamp of Sadness rip off, but no, they had an interesting twist there. And the Fairy Forest! The fairies! The cute furry animals hopping about! When was the last time a director was brave enough to put something so uncynically pretty and mythological in a movie? Ridley Scott and Legend come to mind but that was 27 years ago! So does Willow, a 23 year old film. Fans of those movies might also like this one.The two male possible love interests were great also. The things that I didn't like about it were, first and foremost, that Snow White hadn't definitely picked one of the two handsome men who had fallen for her by the end of the movie, when she seemed to like both of them. So, after that build up of romantic tension, there was no resolution on that front. It made for a bit of a dud ending. Also, Snow White at times seemed to lack motivation. Her big stirring speech, although well delivered, came out of nowhere. Also, no-one seemed terribly surprised when she came back from the dead, post apple poisoning. Plus, the usual femme in battle scene clich√©s irked me - the girl wears no helmet, presumably so we can see her pretty face at all times, and while everyone's getting hit by arrows and pitch all round, she remains miraculously unscathed despite appearing not to make any moves to evade injury.Still overall good movie, although I was confused about what audience they were going for. If it was girls then they dropped the ball on the romantic resolution. If it was guys then the Fairy Forest is going to turn them right off."
138,"Well, firstly, I have to say that Kristen Stewart really has come a long way since the monotone acting we saw in Twilight. Although she did still seem to have problems with speaking with an open mouth we can now clearly see plenty of emotions from her. The other actors were either just as good or better. Charlize Theron showed some outstanding acting, just really WOW. Her ability to portray emotion was simply the best I've seen for a long time in actresses. The dwarfs were very funny and it was nice seeing Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane in the film. Also, Chris Hemsworth was an amazing edition to an already spectacular cast. Great seeing him as Thor but also incredible seeing him in such a different role.The effects were also superb. The battle scenes left me in awe and the queens palace was also a stunning place where the magic effects were (excuse the pun) spellbinding. The setting was also superb. The atmosphere also kept the paranoid yet disturbing feel of the book. The shortcomings are, however, in Kristen Stewarts occasionally bland acting. She still needs more confidence in her roles especially when they are this emotionally demanding, although she did do an OK job in the emotion scenes.So overall, A great cast, stunning effects and a gripping plot-line which stays close to the dark nature of the book. The only problems were in Kristen Stewart's acting. 8/10."
139,"I was SO jazzed to see this after the trailers came out. We had not been to the theater since ""Sideways"" and ""Master and Commander"". I can say the only redeeming thing about it is that we only paid $2.50 each to see it. Terrible acting, terrible dialog, terrible editing and even worse directing. What a lost opportunity. But, what else should one expect from an English director? They have no sense of building tension, developing characters, telling a story in an even fashion and their editing skills SUCK. All of the best effects were shown in the previews, so there was nothing new to be seen in the movie itself, save a few moments in the enchanted garden. The Huntsman character was boring, the Snow White character was boring, the Queen was not convincing, her brother was pathetic and the dwarfs were out of context. DO NOT waste your time on this dog."
140,"I was afraid this might happen. The guy from Thor meets the girl from that "" fantastic "" vampire trilogy called Twilight. Add to that a terrible adaptation of the original Snow white story. You end up with this mess of a movie.Okay to be fair, i loved the witch. Who doesn't love Charlize? And i even liked the Huntsman. But the story is not scary enough to be scary. Sure i know it's an adaptation, i didn't expect to see a Disney version on the screen. But i can't help but feel that the director tried to make this a mainstream movie and payed a price. It's supposed to be a romantic film. But he also wanted to give it a dark twist. The result is a poorly made scary film. Or a not that good romantic film. It goes neither here nor there. Just a couple of pretty faces in a poorly made film, at least script wise."
141,"Here I go checking the IMDb rating for a movie I truly admire and I'm forced to give either the movie or IMDb a negative bump and once again the IMDb crowd loses.There were some shots in Snow White that were so remarkable I was left speechless. For example, I have never seen a movie depict body armor with as much authenticity as this film. I could taste the metal and feel its weight from my stadium seat. Ditto the arrows which for once seemed real compared to the utterly fake arrows most movies settle for. In fact the battle scenes which were all too sparse for my taste were exquisitely shot and choreographed in a manner I've never seen before.In short, the direction by Rupert Sanders was so good I was completely floored. This guy has an eye to rival James Cameron or Ridley Scott, maybe better. He's goes way beyond the solid base supplied by his well chosen stars, Stewart, Theron, and Hemsworth. I might see one or two miraculous scenes in a movie that I immediately think, it must have taken multiple attempts to get that scene right. But this film is full of them, almost as if this guy is lucky beyond belief.To mention the actors, I'd never seen Stewart in a movie before but I must say, this woman is truly a pleasure to watch in almost every way. I kept thinking, what did we ever do to deserve her deigning to grace our entertainments? I look around and I've seldom seen anyone as well suited to or as deserving of movie stardom. And as if this weren't enough the dwarfs are all fine character actors who immediately become real people to the audience. I was delighted and amazed.About the only quibble I might reluctantly dredge up is that the screenplay makes no effort to explain some of Snow's skills which you would think would be minimal given her long term imprisonment. But this is a fairy tale, not some realistic romance, and I found myself more than willing to forgive the movie its one small flaw."
142,"I went to watch this movie with a couple of friends; and by the end of first half hour, I was ruing the moment we made the decision to watch it. The main reasons are: 1. Kristen Stewart: Even though I'd read that she has plastic face which is incapable of expressing any emotions except maybe a crooked smile, I'd never thought the situation was so bad. Yesterday was the first time I realized that expression of emotions / acting can actually make a difference. She really sucks! I was just not able to connect with the movie as the main character seemed so artificial! 2. The movie itself: The new take on Snow White tale was good, but poorly brought together as a film. The dialogues and their delivery seemed corny. The characters, most of them, seemed to be forced into their roles. The acting was so bad that it was evident no one put their heart into their roles.I normally like most movies; rare are those which I despise. And this was one of those. I'd seriously advise readers to save your money for any movie, but this!"
143,"We liked Fake Heath Ledger(The huntsman) but there seems to be a serious lack of similarity b/w this and any of the snow white story versions. Whatever moron in casting thought kristen stewart was better looking than Charlize Theron or even remotely good looking for that matter, needs to find a new line of work and a stronger prescription of either eyeglasses or drugs. Prince charming is more like Prince douche. she's locked in the tower for like 10+ years, yet she she finally discovers this loose railroad spike outside her window, has way more strength and speed than any lil girl in the middle ages, and the queen hates her, so who is making her clothes to wear all this time? what's up with the tight leather pants? A. women didn't wear pants back then, much less tight leather pants, and in the middle ages, skinny girls weren't thought of as attractive. Both royalty and 'attractive' people were heavy set back then, b/c your size was a sign of your stature(heavy set were well fed b/c they were rich, skinny was malnourished b/c they couldn't afford food. I could sit here all night pointing out mistakes and irregularities but let me simply end with, anything kristen stewart is in is total crap(see gay sparkly vampires) and this movie is total garbage."
144,"There has been a recent trend in re-envisioning classic fairy tales as the darker psychological tales they were originally meant to be rather than the safe Disney fare: laudable, yet the results have been disappointing at best. ""Alice in Wonderland"" was one of Burton's worst films; ""Red Riding Hood"" was a cheaply made Twilight knock off, while this year's ""Mirror, Mirror"" (telling almost the exact same story as SWATH) dipped its elbow in edgy darkness, only to pull it out immediately because the water was too hot. So now we have ""Snow White and the Huntsman"".The poster and the trailer promised much, but could it deliver? Well it seems the answer is ""yes"".SWATH is a solid sword and sorcery tale that, like this years ""John Carter"", harks back to the 80's fantasy boom, with movies like ""Legend"" ""Ladyhawke"" ""Krull"" ""Excalibur"" and ""The Dark Crystal"" in its DNA. It sticks quite closely to the outline of the original story, but introduces the idea of Snow White as a warrior, a focal point for resistance to a cruel and unjust tyrant, as well as a symbol of feminine power (also done, poorly, in ""Mirror, Mirror"") There is plenty of darkness, both literal (this is a gloomy land, at least under Ravenna's reign) and psychological. Like its 80's progenitors, it has a lot of horror elements and nasty brutality, and it is quite surprising to see it get away with a 12a (UK) rather than a 15 certificate. It would very suitable for older children and teenagers, but definitely not one for smaller children. Charlize Theron, who is little more than stunt casting in ""Prometheus"", here delivers the goods as the ""wicked queen"" Ravenna. In keeping with modern sensibilities (and Shakespearian tradition) she is not evil per Se, but nurses deep wounds and hurts, and reacts to life's cruelties by becoming cruel herself, continuing the wheel of destruction rather than trying to stop it. It is not vanity that drives her but the survival instinct. She has learnt that a woman's looks are the key to power in a Man's world, and uses her magic to keep her eternally young so she can be eternally powerful, a lesson that is sadly all too relevant today. Ravenna is a cruel villain and one who must be stopped, yet she also evokes pity and pathos. One the other side, Kristen Stewart excels as Snow White. Endlessly ridiculed and parodied for her waxwork dummy non-acting in the ""Twilight"" series, Stewart uses the chance here to create a truly strong character, one who can be both the ""messiah"" to her desperate people, and a credible heroine whose strength is ""inner beauty"" rather than the outer kind, and it is in large part down to her that the film works so smoothly. Chris Hemsworth brings something of ""Thor"" to his Huntsman, but also gives him a very human side, becoming the ""Han Solo"" scoundrel to Stewart's feisty Princess, growing slowly to love her. The seven dwarfs (8 to begin with) are, like those in ""Mirror,Mirror"", bandits who become freedom fighters, but here they are all played by famous British character actors digitally ""resized"" in an incredibly seamless way. They are tough and course, but are also capable of goodness when called for, and though they are not a major factor in the film, they make a mark. The special effects are also excellent, not just the aforementioned dwarfs, but also the various mythical creatures, both the trolls and demons of the ""Dark Forest"" and the magical creatures of the Enchanted forest, including a majestic multi-horned white hart straight from Celtic and Norse mythology. The ""sorcery"" is good, as is the ""sword"", with plenty of well-staged battles that feel painful and suffocating as arrows and sword blows rain down from every direction, and death could be just around the corner. It all leads to a final showdown in the Queen's chamber that sees both Sword and Sorcery employed, with the predictable conclusion reached in a tense and emotionally satisfying way. Though Snow White has two suitors here, The Huntsman and a noble childhood friend who grows up to become a leader of the anti-Ravenna movement, and although there are romantic feelings around, they never come to the surface. There are after all more important things to worry about than meeting cute and making out, and the love stuff is left to happen off screen at some later date, making it yet another entry into the ""abstinence"" genreAll in all, SWATH is a thrilling, exciting, well-acted, well-made, solid piece of old school 80s style Sword and Sorcery fantasy that doesn't ignore the original tale but builds upon it, adding horror, drama, pathos and emotional heft for good measure! It may not be everybody's ""cup of tea"", and certainly not one for smaller children or the squeamish, but if you like fantasy and action, and want to see one great star and two rising new stars in action, surrounded by the best of British character talent, then this is definitely the summer film for you!!"
145,"For such a spectacular production, it is a surprise that Snow White was not IMAX or even digital 3D. The scenery is absolutely stunning, drawing heavily on Lord of The Rings type visuals. The CGI is also very powerful and draws you in rather than being grossly over the top.The film is a little over 2 hours and the first 15 mins or so are spent laying out the history of Snow White and her legacy to the kingdom, thus setting the stage for the reign of the Evil Queen Ravenna who is played by Charlize Theron. Theron does a phenomenal job as an evil character and delivers a truly seamless performance.The story centers around Ravenna plotting and taking over kingdoms in order to fuel her need for eternal youth by taking the life from young and attractive women. As her power begins to wane she eventually begins consuming even those around her in order to stay beautiful and maintain her power.Snow White holds the key to Ravenna's potential immortality and, when she escapes her imprisonment, Ravenna sends Chris Helmsworth aka The Huntsman off to retrieve Show White. In the process The Huntsman realizes that Snow White is the princess and her life is in danger. As he struggles to protect her, he eventually falls in love with her and it is his ""love's first kiss"" that awakens Snow White from the spell cast upon her by Ravenna and the poisoned apple.Snow White is played by Kristen Stewart and Bruno Wang feels that Stewart is getting unduly panned by the lame-ass movie critics. Stewart did a very convincing job as Snow White and it is sad that the critics cannot seem to see past her roles in the Twilight films. She deviated strongly for this role and totally held her own. Take Bruno's word for it here folks, the critics are wrong---as usual!The movie is filled with some excellent fight scenes and very reminiscent of LOTR. On top of being just a solid production of an authentic take on a childhood ""fairy tale,"" the film has rich and highly developed characters and some deeply emotional story line. There are equally as many genuine emotion-packed moments as there are action and adventure.Bruno Wang gives this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars for a superb cast performance, excellent production value and exciting action sequences. Even though you cannot see it in digital 3D, it is well worth the ticket price. Go see it and enjoy! Bruno out."
146,"Honestly, I don't know what others expected but I had a low opinion of this concept before viewing the film. Maybe lower expectations matter because I found this effort to be an entertaining blend of the Snow White fable and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To be clear, it's not an epic like LOTR but it really gives off the same flavor (fighting dwarfs, hypnotic scenery, great effects as well as textured fantasy heroes). Some will roll their eyes at comparing the two (an Oscar winning film series versus a Kristen Stewart movie?) but is the overall concept sillier than a long needless trek to throw a magic ring in to a volcano? I also thought that two-thirds of the lead performances were superb. I've never even seen a Twilight movie so I judge Stewart based on her work here only. She delivers a soulful performance and there was real sadness behind her eyes. Hemsworth was great. It's Charlize Theron that really hurts this film. She really is Razzie Award bad as the over-the-top cheesy evil queen. EVERY scene she chews up made me cringe. Every damn one. The plot isn't grand or even smart and there are character shortcuts but I enjoyed this film quite a bit more than I was expecting."
147,"Most everyone is familiar with fairy tales especially Disney's version of fairy tales. There is usually a beautiful princess who is a damsel in distress, and is waiting for her Prince to rescue her. Snow White and The Huntsmans director Rupert Sanders took a beloved fairytale and made it into an epic, magical blockbuster. The casting for Snow White and The Huntsman was a brilliant move on Rupert's part. I would have never imagined Charlize, Chris, and Kristen sharing the big screen together. They did not disappoint. Kristen Stewart portrays the beautiful princess Snow White, Charlize Theron portrays the truly demented Evil Queen, Chris Hemsworth portrays the handsome Huntsman, and the handsome Prince is portrayed by Sam Claflin.The visuals in Snow White and The Huntsman are nothing short of spectacular. The dark forest is scary, and the enchanted forest is a wonderful blend of color and beauty. Most impressive was the acting. Kristen Stewart brought Snow White to life. She was able to capture the innocence of Snow White and did one better by giving us a Snow White who was brave, resourceful, and a true heroine. The chemistry between her and Chris Hemsworth on-screen was wonderful. Charlize was the perfect Evil Queen and she portrayed the Evil Queen's jealousy and vanity to perfection. Chris did a wonderful job of showing the Huntsman as an emotionally damaged man who has all but given up on life. Sam was the perfect Prince.The dwarfs are an interesting bunch, and they have some cute and funny scenes. The movie has the perfect balance of being an action movie, with some subtle romance. The fighting scenes were spot on, and the final showdown with Snow White and The Evil Queen was the cherry on top. My only complaint is I would have loved to see the movie explore the attraction between Snow White and The Huntsman a little more. Hopefully the sequel will address a possible romance between them.This movie is a must see, and trust me it will not disappoint."
148,"Evil sorceress Ravenna(sexy Charlize Theron, who's equal parts cold and shouty(her and her brother both enjoy yelling ""get out"" to underlings), and while it does get close to scenery-chewing, I can't claim that she wasn't always intimidating like you wouldn't believe when she raised her voice) marries the king and kills him, and with her evil, she perverts everything(we get the Dark Forest which is one of the creepiest things in this and in recent movies... animal rot, bugs, all very nasty... and in one of the several contrasts in this, we also get gorgeous, vivid nature elsewhere). She imprisons Snow White(Kristen Stewart, not playing Bella again, finally... she not only smiles and laughs here, she *acts*! Man, I'm glad she didn't forget how with all the Twilight crap... some of us still remember that she could do so) until she turns 18, for... some reason(when she finds that she needs to consume her heart(as it is a truly good one, she has inner beauty, a theme that really works) to get unlimited power... and just tell me you didn't read that in Palpatine's voice)... and the latter hopes to get in touch with a Duke loyal to her father, who has an army that they have not defeated because... you know, I'm unclear on that, as well, but to be honest, those two are the only unanswered questions or wonky motivations. This is a great Summer blockbuster. It adds well-choreographed, fast action(including one or two grand battles(and you can tell who's winning! It's not too close or far away)... in general, this is epic in scope, and visually, it's stunning(the cinematography is fantastic), with phenomenal FX that you can't tell apart from the physical reality... the dwarfs, for example, are now realized as well-cast as the rest of this, with the heads put on little people performers(I guess), and you can't tell how they did it) in addition to modernizing the fairy tale some, and this is a bleak and adult take on the genre. The small amount of slo-mo in this is hit and miss. This goes for the entire spectrum of emotion, and it tends to hit the mark. You really get into it, and while there is one or two slow parts, on the whole, this is a thoroughly enjoyable two hours. While it's got the Hollywood clich√©s, it's a really good entry in that style. The Huntsman is a very different character from Thor for Chris Hemsworth, and he plays it very ably. There's a bitter edge to him, and he's very self-destructive, as he's a widower. He doesn't break into emo, thankfully. This balances stuff like that well. One thing that this isn't, however, is romantic. The love story is sedated, not to say nonexistent. There is some disturbing content and non-graphic sexuality and female nudity(from the back and sides) in this. I recommend this to any fan of those involved and of this approach to the tale. 7/10"
149,So I saw this movie last night and I went in expecting some cheap and corny version of snow white. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this one! It was very visually attracting and the characters were well made. Although Kristen Stewart isn't the best actress she pulled it off without horrible acting! And Charlize Theron was amazing for Ravenna she was the perfect cast. And not only her but Chris hemsworth was also very good. I think this movie had certain flaws but it was not trash or so to speak I walked out surprised and I enjoyed this movie a lot! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy. It was so dark and mysterious that it really did pull of a twist to the fairy tale!
150,"'Snow White and the Huntsman' did have potential. The trailers looked decent, and Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and all the actors playing the dwarfs have been responsible for great work in their careers.However, although she has given good performances outside of 'Twilight', this reviewer doesn't care hugely for Kristen Stewart (though she is not a detractor either) and cares even less for the 'Twilight Saga'. So expectations prior to seeing the film, a live-action re-imagining of the classic fairy tale, were mixed.Watching it finally at a film night with friends, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' wasn't as bad as feared and does have a good amount going for it, but it should have been much better than it was.First and foremost, starting with the good assets, the best things about 'Snow White and the Huntsman' are the production values and Charlize Theron. The film is very beautiful to look at, with luscious but also atmospheric photography, Gothic but also elegant and rustic set and scenery design and lavish costumes (Ravenna's are a knockout). The special effects are mostly fine too. Ravenna is the one character that 'Snow White and the Huntsman' properly tries to develop (and it does so reasonably, but there are parts that could have been elaborated upon more), and Theron positively sinks her teeth into the character, giving a very enjoyably hammy (sometimes), sinister and also tragic interpretation.James Newton Howard's score complements very well, it's beautifully orchestrated, rousing, elegiac, atmosphere-enhancing and very involving. Hemsworth is appropriately stone-faced and brooding as the Huntsman, displaying charisma and emotion. Sam Claflin does well too, though with an underwritten character.Was mixed however on the dwarfs and Rupert Sanders' direction. The dwarfs are very enjoyably characterised, with all of them displaying much needed character, humour and charm, more so than their material deserved. Ian McShane is particularly noteworthy. However, they are written in a very glossed over and bland fashion, almost like they were written as an afterthought. The decision to scale down the actors may not work for some people, those who feel that casting real-life dwarfs would have fared better, personally enjoyed the performances but felt it would have been better if Warwick Davis played all of them. Sanders' direction exudes confidence visually, but in the chemistry between actors, direction of some of the actors and direction of the drama he seemed ill at ease.The biggest problem with 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is Stewart (an opinion this reviewer well before reading the reviews for the film, so this is own opinion talking), she gives a very wooden, expressionless and one-note (constant surprise and ""sucking on lemon""-like) performance that makes identifying and sympathising with Snow White incredibly difficult. A shame because her younger child counterpart was very believable. The story has moments (mainly with Theron), but flounders from a lack of chemistry in the pivotal relationship between Stewart and Hemsworth, a particularly dull middle act and stuff brought up but barely explored giving an incomplete and jumpy feel to the storytelling.Action is episodic and lacking in tension and excitement generally, while the script clunks badly and the characters are bland with the exception of Ravenna. They do start trying to develop the Huntsman but the development is forgotten about once he becomes protector and lover.Overall, looks great but fails to engage narratively. Not awful, not great, wildly uneven more like. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
151,"If you're a movie buff, I recommend you see ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". It's a familiar tale told in a new way. All the elements of the original story are there. The pace is slower than most modern movies, which gives the viewer time to appreciate the strong images, the symbolism and the character arcs.Many of the stunning images are of Ravenna, the evil queen. She's a tortured character. Her features change from young and beautiful to tired and old and back again from scene to scene. In one image she is stuck in a pit of oil trying to get out, in another she stands in the middle of a fire. In another scene, we see her naked back, covered with it's white skin and protruding bones. Flashbacks show the audience the day she was taken, as a very young girl, by a local King from her mother's arms and the spell her mother wove to protect her. We've already heard her tell Snow White's father that she was once ravaged by a king. From that moment on, we know Ravenna is ruled by fear and the need for revenge. In her own mind she's fully justified in what she does. She's convinced the power she's gained over the long years will save her. Snow White has suffered too, some of the images associated with her character reflect that; the beetles crawling all over her and the snakes she thinks are real. But in the end she chooses the light. As she does, the images associated with her change. She's a very different Snow White than the Disney version. Throughout most of the movie, her face, hands and clothes are dirty. Slowly she awakens to her inner strength, and with the help of the Huntsman, she learns how to defend herself. As she comes to understand her authentic power, those around her are healed. The Huntsman is what I call the catalyst character. He's the character who stands between Snow White and Ravenna. He's also the character who changes the most. Having lost his wife, he's drowning himself in drink. Ravenna orders him to help find Snow White and bring her back to her. Having lost himself, he fully intends to follow his orders until he meets Snow White in the dark forest. She's strong, compassionate and she sees something in him he thought was gone forever. Because of Snow White, his self-hatred turns into purpose.The outstanding symbols of the movie are the three drops of blood which appear in three different scenes. Salvation is another strong symbol. The Magic Mirror tells Ravenna that Snow White is her salvation, others say she's the salvation of the kingdom. Snow White dies and rises again. In the end, Snow White stands with her reflection in the Magic Mirror, but by then she knows who she is and she doesn't need to ask the mirror for reassurance.So much more could be said about the movie. I suggest you watch it and see what you get out of it."
152,"To start off, this movie has the potential to reach a broad audience base. When a director decides to remake a fairy tale or timeless story, they have to include certain aspects of the story line that are critical. This film does that very well. It also supplies a cast that nails there roles and the vision of director. I really enjoyed the film because I saw the other take on Snow White that came out this past year and this film is quite simply ""better"". The action sequences were enjoyable and well shot. The characters really give you the invitation to fall in to their world. The journey this story takes you on leaves little to the imagination as the writers have stayed true the plot. After watching the trailer I thought this film would be overdone with CGI. I was pleasantly surprised that while it did have its moments in the film, it certainly was used only when necessary. The only thing to ruin this franchise film is to make a sequel. It can only go down from here and while it might be profitable for the studios, the second installment will certainly fall short."
153,"It's a modern take on Snow White. I have seen many bad reviews about this movie however I knew it was because of Kristen Stewart. I actually thought that she was alright in this movie. Chris Hemsworth was good. However, the person who stole the show was Charlize Theron, she was fantastic as the Evil Queen. It has more of a serious tone to it than 'Mirror Mirror'. People say it's very grim but I think it was suppose to be grim. I don't think I would watch this again because it will not contain the same amount of suspense and it would be boring. If you have not seen this then it is definitely something you should watch. The effects they did was also very good. I must admit that the start was amazing however in the middle it was quite slow. I recommend it for a one time watch, you won't be disappointed."
154,"A swath is the space cut by the stroke of a scythe, or the piece so cut.A bit ironic, then, that Snow White and the Hunstman has become known as SWATH across the Twittersphere, as it takes a noticeable chunk from many films that came before. The story, or at least the foundation of it, is well known through storybooks and the 1937 animated Disney classic: innocence is personified in a young girl with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as a raven. In this, Rupert Sanders' vision, the girl is orphaned young when her mother passes away and her (literally) wicked step-mother kills her father on their wedding night. The new queen, whose youth, fairness and power is sustained by the beauty and heart of others, for some reason decides not to imbibe the girl, but to keep her locked in a tower for eight years or so‚Äîuntil the magic mirror warns the queen that the princess has come of age and how has the power to overthrow her.Luckily, two black and white birds assist Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in escaping from the castle, leading her to a white horse waiting by the sea. They then go on a ride through at least two Lord of the Rings films, into Wonderland and a bit of The Nightmare Before Christmas.Enter The Huntsman: a drunken, fighting, snarky Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) a la Legends of the Fall, who is sent into the Dark Wood to retrieve the fair maiden¬Ö and her heart. During the next hour and a half or so there is further a sprinkling of Last of the Mohicans and a dollop of Joan of Arc but, while all these references are registered, they are not overly bothersome‚Äîthe reason being the beauty of the film.The settings, cinematography, the costuming, the acting: all are beautiful. Charlize Theron is fantastic as Ravenna, the evil queen, and Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Twilight and Twilight) does a solid job of acting meek and terrified, but also manages to be reasonably confident when the time comes.Snow White is reunited with her childhood friend William, a character in which Sam Claflin shows flashes of Heath Ledger. The dwarfs, keeping to the image of motley miners who occasionally break into song, are filled with recognizable faces such as Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Paul), Ian McShane (Deadwood) and Toby Jones (The Hunger Games, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). The star power is solid, and they all actually deliver.It is also refreshing to see a movie that is impressive in vision and scope without relying heavily on CGI. Despite the soul-sucking and faeries, this version of the story does feel more tangible than the storybooks. It may not all be new, but perhaps it shouldn't be. The mix of fresh interpretation and familiarity works to make a well-known tale newly interesting and yet not treasonous.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

155,"An exciting new twist on the tale. The directorial debut of Rupert Sanders promises much for the future and I, for one, wish him well in that and will look out for more of the same from him. The cgi was ably put into a supporting role here(with a few notable exceptions of course!)and was not allowed to swamp the character driven theme of the story. Mercifully we had absolutely no ninja-style antics from anyone and the fight scenes were raw and realistic. Clich√©s were avoided by and large. Snow White was, and remained, an independent character throughout the story and the ending seemed to suggest that there were even greater choices for her to make in the future. Perhaps the studio will want to run with this again and invent a whole new sequel.The temptation to inject humour into this movie was mercifully avoided. Just the odd line here and there, but almost unnoticed in the general flow of the story towards its climax. That gets 2 out of my 8 from 10 as I have seen too many dark plots spoiled by throwing in Tom and Jerry antics.All the cast were good to excellent and I liked Sam Spruell as Finn particularly"
156,"I can't say I'm a big fan of fairy tales. I have no sympathy for the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter kind of stuff. So, the reason I went to see this movie was only because there wasn't anything more attractive offered last evening. And I really enjoyed it. Artwork, music, acting and story line were all a pleasant experience, which flew by unnoticeably, even though the movie is almost two and a half hours long.I liked that the evil was shown in perspective, there was a depth to it - you could see psychological reason behind a beautiful woman turning into a witch. I also liked that the love story stayed unfinished, leaving us guessing, which of the two guys will get the cream. Maybe both? However, I must say that the last scene wasn't triumphant enough to my taste. But the artwork that appeared in titles and the beautiful, unusual score was compensating. Very neat production with gorgeous graphics, interesting characters and fluid story... I'd see this movie again, it was pure pleasure to watch."
157,"Earlier this year, we had Mirror Mirror, the lighter kiddy version of Snow White that no one shows up to. It's June now, and we now have Snow White and The Huntsman, the far darker and seemingly more interesting one. I did not see Mirror Mirror, but SWATH seemed like more of my kind of thing.After being locked up for mainly her whole life, Snow White(Kristen Stewart) breaks out of her tower and goes on the run. Queen Ravena(the over the top Charlize Theron), who killed Snow's father and took over the kingdom, has evil powers, and after her trusted mirror tells her that Snow is the fairest of them all, Ravena hires a stranger(Chris Hemsworth) to bring her back so then she can take her youth.There are a couple of holes in the story, and some scenes are uneven. Also, it goes on for way too long, and the ending is kind of lame. But SWATH is a dazzler. Sure some of the visual effects look as if they were picked off of the set of The Lord of the Rings, but the visuals are terrific.Theron's performance is over the top, and that's okay, that's what she's going for. you can't take your eyes off of her, whether it's her character, or if it's just her(she is one of the sexiest women on the planet). Out of all of the women in this movie, she is the fairest of them all. Stewart and Hemsworth keep the film afloat.SWATH is worth seeing, despite its flaws. It goes on for a little too long, and the final sequence is kind of silly, but it has terrific special effects, well chosen actors and it's just a lot of fun. Overall, it's a good movie, but there are better movies out there. I say see it, it's a lot better than it sounds.B"
158,"Snow White and the Huntsman ‚Äì CATCH IT (B+) First things first, ""This is not as Bad as critics say it is"". I think the expectation for the movie were so high that when it didn't live up to the expectations critics started to call it one of the worst snow white movie ever, Hello, I think they missed ""Mirror Mirror"" Snow white dancing on Indian tune now that's Trashy. Anyways, I found Snow white and the Huntsman very interesting and mesmerizing. Filled with three drops of blood on the snow, fair skin, dark hair, a wicked witch, a magic mirror, dwarfs and a poisoned apple. Kudoz to Mr. sanders, for its dark haunting attire and locations. The locations and graphics in the movie are top notch. It takes into the middle of the true fairy tales for the adults. It's scarier and dangerous, where you can believe that Evil Queen might win the War after all. Charlize Theron is like the Evil Queen, we have never seen before. Her screams was stuck in my head long after the movie was finished. Charlize Theron creeps under skin, just like Tilda Swinton's in Narnia. Kirsten Stewart is great as Snow White, she is dark and naturally beautiful. She doesn't need lots of make up or air brushing to look pretty. Her performance as frighten and later warrior Princess is admirable. Chris Hemsworth is the Man, whether its Thor or now Huntsman, no one can hate this man. He has the charm, charisma and voice of a true man. Sam Claflin is charming but doesn't have significant role. For surprise he is not even Snow White's True Love Kiss¬Ö I think the only thing bad about the movie is not giving much romantic development between Snow White and the Huntsman, so, in the end it defiantly seems surprising. Besides I don't find dwarfs really appealing. I think there scenes were the most boring in the movie. On the whole, Snow White and the Huntsman is not perfect but it defiantly not as bad as most of the critics claim it too be. I'm excited about the sequel and I hope they proceed with it."
159,"This movie had all the amazing effects, and it had Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen !!! I wish it was made in 3D, because it had some great effects of magic and action, and it would have been amazing in 3D. But the story is made new. It is much better than the old children fairy tale, this is Snow White for 13 years old and up. It is a great story, a times very frightening, and it shows the love Snow White is known for in all the stories about her.This story is a new remake. It has much more action than any other remakes of Snow White. And in this remake the huntsman becomes one of the main characters, and his love for Snow White. It isn't a love story...it is a story of fighting Evil and believing in that good will destroy evil at any time. And even a story that says even if a person is evil, it is always a reason why that person becomes that way. You even get to feel a little sorry for the Evil Queen.I recommend it for everyone. Worth every penny!"
160,"The movie is rich in landscape, the characters are developed well, although not necessarily in linear order. The surprises are worth the time and money. For those already steeped in myth and magic this will give you a sideways view into a landscape that is often to much like a cartoon. The special effects are well done and worth the admission. The female leads carry the story and do it well. Note the beautiful costume work, the magic creatures and magic landscape. The presentation of the mirror is unique and leads one to consider, will there be a prequel? I would go see it! The male characters never really lead the story, and as such, it lakes the half of the love plot it needs. Other than that I would have given it a 10 for what it is trying to accomplish. The bad queen is really bad, and snow white is really struggling to come of age, whilst missing some important life events. Perhaps a bit extensive in that regard, as you will see. This has too much to see to wait until the DVD, theater first, then Blu-Ray next year!"
161,"My review is riddled with SPOILERS, so you are warned now. I have seen Snow White and the Huntsman three times and found myself enjoying it more and more each time. In fact, I'll probably watch it a couple more times before I finally wait till the Blueray hits the stores.The acting is solid, and most especially from Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth. If you truly understand their characters, and their own individual plight and what they've already gone through, then you will find that their teaming was a match made in heaven. In fact, although subtle, their characters had real chemistry.Top Three Powerful Scenes:1) The Huntsman's goodbye to Snow White was extremely powerful and very believable. Those tears were real my friends, and did you notice when he leaned down to kiss Snow White that one of his tear fell onto her cheek, and then dripped slowly down Snow White's beautiful face¬Ö and but a second later, a tear formed at the corner of Snow White's eyes, and then another followed the same trail the huntsman's tear took. That scene was executed perfectly. 2) The delivery of Snow White's speech was perfect; coming from a girl that was stuck inside a prison all her life. Anything more powerful would not have been believable, for Snowy truly struck the right chord.3) Snow White's final scene with the Queen when she said, ""You can't have my heart."" Those words, said with tears, meant so much. Charlize was awesome in this scene as well.The Pros: The special effects that turned those legendary English actors into dwarfs blew me away; the Cinematography; the performances; and climactic ending. The Con: I'm pretty sure the Queen had more to say in this film than Snow White, the Huntsman, and the duke's son put together. I didn't see this taking away from the film per say, but in hindsight, I did see some scenes where they could have thrown some dialog in.All and all, Snow White and the Huntsman is a great film. I give it a 9 out of 10 and the only reason it doesn't get a perfect score is because I felt the film should have spent more time in that ""Sanctuary"" setting. I understand Snow White represented life itself, but they could have explained a bit more and plus it would have meant Kristen being in that magical setting for a longer period time... and let's face it, Kristen Stewart epitomizes the beauty she was surrounded with."
162,this movie was amazing i loved how they chose the huntsman over the dukes son....it was a bit creepy when she kissed the duke who was actually her step mom.....i loved and adored the dwarfs.....Chris hemsworth made it all the better he is just really hot....Kristen Stewart is so lucky...........i loved the kiss and the speech between the huntsman and Snow White........i didn't like the ending i was hoping for another kiss more dramatic or a fast forward of a wedding but no it ended just like princess diaries 2(just there was no passionate kiss)...overall a really good movie...and if you haven't watched it go and watch it because its really good.....i did have a problem with those hallucinations they were really gross....but it was all good...it looked like game of thrones a bit
163,"Too bad there was no 0 in the scale to rate it. this is a total fail from all the levels. Here some of the all the fails in this movie. 1) a story that is very well known and repeated will take too much more effort to pass. 2) choosing Kristen Stewart and letting the mirror say she is more pretty than Charlize Theron is a huge fail. dude, she is a dull! 3) Kristen Stewart giving an inspirational speech??!! WTF??? she almost died saying the words. 4) the makeup was really funny. 5) the effects when Sam Claflin transformed to Charlize Theron were really funny, god, this must be Bollywood! 6) same as above for the part were she transformed to and from the bats. seriously it does not worth even downloading it"
164,"Seriously.How does this kind of crap get released?How much do people get to write this kind of pap? Watching this left me feeling hollow inside.The OK bits included the fairy forest and an awesome looking troll, and maybe some of the huntsman scenes.This was just another piece of fluff that I felt I HAD to finish, just so I would NEVER have to watch it again to see the ending. I feel like I've been used...Prognosis: avoid at all costs!"
165,"This is Snow White's year, I'm not sure why, but we've had two theatrical movies released about the classic tale: Mirror Mirror(which was considered a bomb) and Snow White and the Huntsman. Snow White and the Huntsman obviously got the better advertisement, looking much darker and having a more popular cast. I didn't see Mirror Mirror, but I have to admit that when I saw the trailer for Snow White, I really did want to see it. Charlize Theron is a wonderful actress and pulled in one of cinema's best performances of all time playing serial killer Aileen Wuornos. When I saw her in this movie, I was taken back, she looks breath taking gorgeous still and who the heck would ever be considered ""more fair"" than Charlize Theron¬ÖKristen Stewart? Now I think it's silly the way people are reacting to her staring role because of their hate for Twilight, I by no means hate Kristen, I'm not a fan of the Twilight series, but these people are still actors who have potential and are not given the best material to work with. I want to give Kristen a chance because she seems like she wants to spread her wings and really enjoys acting, but alas, the girl needs to find a different job or talent. Snow White wasn't exactly what it could've been, it could've been a great retelling of the classic fairy tale.Snow White is the daughter of King Magnus. After his wife's death, King Magnus falls in love with beautiful Ravenna after rescuing her from the Dark Army. The two are married but Ravenna - who is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master - kills Magnus on their wedding night. As Ravenna seizes control of the kingdom, Magnus' most trusted knight attempts to help Snow White escape the Castle but fails when she is captured by Ravenna's brother. Snow White is then locked away in the dungeons while Ravenna uses her Magic Mirror, who promises to help her become ""the fairest of them all"". Fifteen years later, Ravenna learns from the Mirror that a now-grown up Snow White is destined to surpass her and that she must consume the young girl's heart in order to become immortal. She orders Finn to bring her Snow White but the princess escapes. Now with the help of a huntsman, Snow White meets some friends along the way to help restore the kingdom to what it once was and destroy the evil queen.The thing about Snow White that I think a lot of people were thinking as well was that Charlize was going to be the one to steal the movie, but instead while she has a chilling presence about her, she must have taken an acting tip from John Travolta in Battlefield Earth on how to act because her performance was so over the top. When she gets crazy and starts screaming, most people in the audience were giggling and I found myself smiling too just because it was too over the top and if I were a character next to her, I would ask ""umm, do you need some Midol and a nap?"", her screaming just couldn't be taken seriously. Then we are given some attempt at a great back story for her as the evil queen, how she came across the spell because of her family¬Öthat's it, they leave the story at that. Well, how did she become evil? How did she take over other kingdoms? Was she stalking Snow White's family to take over their kingdom? Nothing is ever answered. Kristen Stewart's performance is very under acted and again, why can't this girl close her mouth?! Her expressions are the same in every scene and you can't take her seriously when she shouts her inspirational speech to her people and keeps stuttering.Stories are presented and never explained or brought up again: the love story between Snow White and the Huntsman is brought up but never expanded to more than one kiss when Snow White dies. Prince William, why wasn't he the one Snow White was destined for? Then I feel awful for dwarf actors, we have average size actors shrunk down. Not to say I don't love Bob Hoskins or Nick Frost, but Warwick Davis owns an agency dedicated to short actors, why not just hire real dwarfs? The CGI and cinematography are very beautiful but the CGI is used way too much and seems like someone just wanted to be like ""look what I can do with a computer!"". The plot holes: why can't the queen shut up and kill Snow White when she has 15 opportunities instead of talking about it? If she's so powerful, why can't she make herself appear in front of Snow White and kill her? Why couldn't she go to Snow White's chamber herself and kill her? I guess we wouldn't have a movie then. I just would recommend this as a rental, it wasn't anything special and over all very disappointing because of our lead actresses. It could've been better, but I'll stick to my animated Disney version for now.5/10"
166,"For over 75 years, we have heard the classic story of a young girl who lived with dwarfs, ate a poison apple, was kissed with the life of a young handsome prince. Now we come to the modern age, where that same classic fairy tale becomes a dark-jaded movie about a young girl (played by the girl who brought us Bella Swan ‚Äì Kristen Stewart) who is fighting her evil step-mother (played evilly beautiful Oscar Award Winner Charlize Theron) to overthrow her and reclaim her rightful post as the heir to the throne. This movie is not like the one you see on TV re-done with a sharper, edge on ABC's Once Upon A Time, this movie, and I say this literally, is not for the faint-hearted. Be prepared to gaze into the mirror of time and ask that all-time famous question: MIRROR, MIRROR, WHO IS THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL? The scenery, the special-effects, the story, everything was done to perfection. It kept us, me included on the edge of our seats wanting more. And at the end, the princess is in her rightful place as the Queen who brings peace and tranquility to the land ‚Äì and they all lived happily ever after."
167,"Do not watch 'Snow white and the Huntsman' unless you want to laugh till you cry.¬†Whilst Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are very very good, Kristin Stewart continues to suck the life out of everything surrounding her¬†Her attempts to 'be tough' actually made me cry with laughter, and drove the man sitting next to me to exclaim ""I can't take this anymore""Chris Hemsworth CAN act, and tries his hardest to salvage some credibility from this fiasco- thankfully he is not required to romance the dark hole, only to show some vague interest in her.¬†My only hope is that the wonderful actors starring in this movie were adequately, nay handsomely recompensed for having to share a screen with the talentless (though pretty) Ms Stewart."
168,"This turned out to be one of my favourite films of all time. Charlize Theron was menacing and superb as Ravenna and Kristen Stewart perfect as Snow White. The dialogue was brilliant due to an intelligent script and the acting throughout was flawless. The film was never boring even for one second and there was a nice mixture of action and tender moments that added to the overall effect of the film. I loved the character of Snow White -so much different from the sassy violent heroines of other films- very refreshing. I must admit that the title was a little off putting but it did not disappoint and anyone with a little magic in their hearts will be able to watch this film several times. I can't really understand some of the negative reviews, but it takes all sorts to make a world as they say."
169,"After looking at the reviews we nearly didn't bother watching this but wow are we glad we did, visually its amazing, the storyline is close to the original but also original in its own right so its still an unknown journey to some extent. The characters are well defined and believable with quite a lot of depth. If your into lord of the rings or any films with a bit of magic and swords and horses then get on this film its bloody amazing EPIC and is close to the original Lord of The Rings films.One of my favourite scenes is in the pixie forest where the animals and nature are entwined in a acid like visual representation of connected beauty, The colour and cinematography are top class and its clear that the cgi had some very talented editors, this is helped by the amazing costume and set design as a whole film i struggle to find anything i didn't enjoy and i'm usually very picky. IGNORE THE IMDb RATING AND SEE A BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED EPIC !!"
170,"This is my first review on IMDb but i needed to right the wrongs :D This film is a dark version of the fairytale and in doing so is great! Except of Kristen Stewart who is performing as if she cant feel the character... now, that i think about it i'm pretty sure she cant feel anything so maybe that is the reason :) Th effects are very good and Charlize Theron is simply VERY COOL as the evil queen. Chris Hemsworth is not that beautiful as in Thor but still he is who he is... :)) The dwarfs are with a little but not annoying part so this is a plus. I just cant understand why there are so many negative reviews, if you don't expect something lifechanging you should watch this movie, its enjoyable :) Bye!"
171,"Once again, I'm a little surprised at the low rating a movie gets on IMDb.com. I'm beginning to think there's something wrong with the IMDb rating system. It's a pretty good film, much better than I thought it would be.Yes, it's loosely based on the Snow White fairy tale. However, if you can get over that, you'll find it's a pretty good movie. The first part has a vaguely medieval setting. I can't get enough of movies with realistic medieval settings. The few unrealistic elements during this part can all be explained by natural or psychological factors. But then at one point (the appearance of the troll), the movie transforms into a Lord-of-the-Rings style fantasy. We find ourselves in a different film.I'm not really a LOTR fan, although I've seen them all. As with LOTR, there are too many fight and chase scenes to my liking. Too many grizzled warriors, pint-sized and otherwise. The special effects were well done, but there was a bit too much of characters bursting into shards of stones or birds. Way too much of that. However, there are also some interesting fantasy twists. The women's water village, for example. I was really impressed by the faerie paradise. For me, that was movie magic.I felt the movie was competently carried by Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth. Theron's range and skills are apparently endless, although she is clearly being cast lately as vulnerable ice-queen characters. Hemsworth is just...sizzling. For now, it doesn't matter that his range seems to be limited because I can't get enough of what he does. Both of their characters have tantalising back stories, but I wish this had been developed more. The scene where the Hunstman meets Ravenna is perhaps the most charged scene in the movie. Two worthy opponents. The evil brother (well played by Sam Spruell) is an interesting character.This is an entertaining movie but, no, it's not a perfect movie. It's not really an adult movie, to be honest. Lots of goreless violence, but little sex and psychology, despite the fertile ground. A little too black and white. It has a few other issues. But it's not a waste of money and it's better than the IMDb scores would lead you to believe. I'm starting to think that IMDb is being inundated by negative posters who are here mostly to trash every movie they go to that isn't a superhero flick."
172,"SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN (2012) *** 1/2 Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris, Brian Gleeson, Vincent Regan, Noah Huntley, Liberty Ross, Christopher Obi, Lily Cole. Excellent revisionistic take on the childhood classic about the virtuous princess Snow White remained as a warrior-in-the-making with Stewart as the imperiled royal whose evil stepmother queen Theron (in a hiss worthy turn of pure blackhearted nefarity) wants her purity to remain eternally young at any means necessary including the enlisting of noble Hemsworth as the mournful huntsman to procure her heart! Grimm story indeed! A great looking piece of filmmaking by relative newcomer Rupert Sanders who deftly allows the fairy tale to become a Tolkein infused revenge/quest action set call to arms notably in the band of dwarfs (a gaggle of Britain's best digitally added to the bodies of smaller stand- ins ala LORD OF THE RINGS). Handsomely shot by Greig Fraser and a truly gorgeous production design by Dominc Watkins truly puts you in another realm (the jaw-dropping Enchanted Forest is a masterpiece of filmmaking altogether)."
173,"This film could have been so much more and I think an opportunity was missed to open this up to a broader audience. Instead we get something between 'Twilight' and 'Lord of the Rings' with a measure of 'Princess Mononoke' thrown into the mix. Not exciting or frightening for the boys, a confused love triangle for the girls, and certainly not enough Dwarf action. They liven up the film when they finally arrive, but they have precious few lines to divide between them.Overall a fair attempt at a fairy-tale, and certainly bolder than 'Mirror, Mirror'. But I fear the studio may have hampered Rupert Sanders in trying more interesting and daring flourishes. Strictly one for teenage girls."
174,"Snow White And The Huntsman (U/A)-----------------------Rating: 5/5It is an adventurous thriller flick..... Visual effects and background music was great... cast and crew was awesome... More frightening scenes which thrills us more...... Locations were superb and makes u feel cool in this summer ... In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen. Now here is a fairy tale that is indeed being retold and that too in not just a different 'avtar' but with a far darker tone to it. This is what makes 'Snow White and the Huntsman' interesting because it doesn't even attempt to bring on a feel-good world but instead keeps its characters in a danger-zone for most part of it.Charlize Theron is convincing as the evil queen who wants to be ever-so- young and the most beautiful of them all. She keeps the best of the lot imprisoned and then sucks out their lives, well literally so, as she steals their youth. In this wrongful endeavour of hers, she is well supported by her brother who is pretty much a partner-in-crime and also acts as her henchman. While together they are successful in keeping the rightful princess (Kristen Stewart) as a hostage, they unleash a vagabond (Chris Hemsworth) when she manages to escape. However with this very vagabond falling for Snow White, there is a twist in the tale.The plot is set right at the very beginning when Charlize's intentions are made clear. In fact her very interaction with a mirror that takes shape of a molten form and shows her the 'real truth', it becomes quite apparent that 'Snow White and the Huntsman' doesn't have any intentions to get into the Walt Disney mode. If at there are any parallels to be drawn, it would be with the world created in 'Lord of the Rings' which had a similar texture and colour tone to it. Nevertheless, the similarities just end with the visuals as the story of Snow White is kept basic.This means that debutant director Rupert Sanders builds a good relationship between Kristen and Chris though one does feel that the chemistry between them isn't explored to the fullest. Yes, one can see a special something in the offering here but since the story is more about the conflict between the queen and the princess, the Huntsman angle is kept in the background. Now that's a pity because the star of films like 'Thor' and 'The Avengers' definitely deserved better."
175,"I should first say that mythology is my hobby so it really struck a chord for me. The twists in the traditional story line were clever and delightful to watch, always relating back to the original tale, but with a much more adult and believable take. The use of mythical symbols, archetypes and story motifs was terrific fun. The evocation of mythical themes goes far beyond the Snow White story to include themes from the Quest for the Holy Grail and other European myths. The enchanted lands depicted in the move were surreal and truly magical and full of enticing details. The story itself is not fast paced, but always engaging, with sufficient back story on most of the main characters to reveal their flaws and motivations. Yes, sometimes the acting was a little uninspired, but most of the time it was great. In San Francisco, where I saw the move, the audience spontaneously applauded at the end.How could you not love this movie?"
176,"The more I found out about this movie the more that I wanted to see it because, like Alice in Wonderland, the producers had taken what was originally a fairy tale and turned it into a full blown fantasy movie. Personally it has been a very long time since I read these fairy tales so I am unsure of how the story itself goes, but it seems that everything is in here, and the production was quite well done. In fact after Snow White had fled into the forest I was actually hoping the dwarfs did not turn up thinking that having a group with names like 'Happy' and 'Grumpy' would not work. However when the dwarfs did appear I was presently surprised.I suspect we all know the story of Snow White so I won't go to deep into it, but rather look at the characters as a whole. The movie starts off with Snow White, who is a princess of the realm, being prophesied as becoming a beautiful woman. However her mother dies and in the midst of his grief her father goes off to war, defeats a phantom army and rescues a beautiful prisoner. It turns out that the prisoner is actually the wicked witch and the who battle was a part of her plan to take control of the kingdom.It is the character of the wicked witch that stood out the most because she was very insecure. He past is explored a little, but it is clear that from birth she was raised as a witch and despite being kidnapped she is able to grow in power. She suggests that her actions against the king are in reparation for something that happened to her before, but most importantly, it is her beauty that drives her, almost to the point of madness. We suspect that she is mad because it turns out that she is the only one who is able to see and speak to the mirror, however because she is powerful and rules through fear, nobody is willing to confront her.In the end though, the story runs like a typical fantasy story where you have a young helpless person overcoming numerous obstacles, defeating the bad guy/girl, and then becoming king/queen. It is pretty much the case with almost every fantasy movie, and in fact every movie, that we encounter. I guess then that is the nature of our literary output these days."
177,"This is a sumptuous retelling of the Grimm fairytale well worth a second, or even a third viewing. It is a more than competent effort from debut director Rupert Sanders and I, for one, am looking forward to the sequel. The three leads acquitted themselves well; perhaps Kristen Stewart was a little emotionless at times, and Chris Hemsworth's accent wandered somewhat, but these are minor criticisms. Charlize Theron was superb as Ravenna, revealing the possible motivation behind her character's search for immortality and stealing every scene. She was born to play this role.Hemsworth proved he can act with a moving soliloquy later in the movie, and there was good support from Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Vince Regan and a selection of British ""hardcase"" actors chosen to play some of the Dwarfs. The Dwarfs provided the light relief for the movie and delivered on that score also, although my favourite was Brian Gleeson's Gus. I enjoyed the scene in the castle when a helpful horse provided cover for them!The film conveyed a dark, ""dirt under the fingernails"" atmosphere, particularly with the impoverished peasantry during Ravenna's reign of terror, and also moments of sweeping grandeur. My two favourite shots were of the King's cavalry early in the movie riding out to fight the Dark Army ‚Äì all silver and gold, and red and blue, and also of the Duke's cavalry riding along the shoreline with Ravenna's castle an ominous presence in the background ‚Äì two beautifully shot scenes.I liked the Sanctuary Forest, and the way the woodland creatures looked at Snow White, but didn't quite understand the scene with the stag, and I didn't like the Fairies, who looked like aliens. Again, these are minor criticisms.I also thought the film was about 30 seconds too short, but as a sequel has been announced I can understand why Snow White didn't get to say what she should have said to round the movie off nicely.A super movie, and well worth the admission - see it if you can."
178,"I think Theron is remarkable in this role as she has herself a diva-queen- like nature but I should give credit to young Steward who has not got such an acting experience and yet she has done an excellent performance,so convincing,so true,so fairy-like and divine.She is a natural talent with a great future in Hollywood,according to me,and she has many profound roles to play ahead.Charlise is a true beauty for sure but as if her great performance is no wonder,it comes naturally along with experience and age.So to me Chirsten is the true star in the movie being so young and yet brilliant in her part.She is mild,sensitive,extremely convincing and giving,so I adore her."
179,"This is the second time this year when we have a re-telling of the classic Snow White tale. Now, first-time director Rupert Sanders gives the story a more dark and graphic treatment in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", and I'm glad to report that this is a better and more faithful version to the story than ""Mirror Mirror"". ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a more dark, graphic, and adult version of the classic tale, while ""Mirror Mirror"" was a more of a kid-friendly cartoon version. This is easily one of the best movies of the whole summer! This is a well-made, totally entertaining, and undeniably masterful motion picture that's worth the price of admission. Charlize Theron delivers the stand-out ""scene stealer"" performance as the Evil Queen, and delivers a more evil take on the character than Julia Roberts. Stealing every scene she's in, Charlize Theron gives us a perfect example on how a villain should be. Her character is a self-obsessed monster, hoping to gain more beauty, by gaining life after life. She will literally cause death everywhere she goes, and walk away with complete pride, or self-pride. Call me crazy, but this is a performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. She delivers one of the most powerful villains ever put on film. In every scene, she is absolutely mesmerizing. Taking a break from the Twilight universe, Kristen Stewart, although still needs work on her facial expressions, delivers a surprisingly interesting take on the Snow White character. I was really impressed on how well she took on the role. She actually delivers great performances, when outside of the Twilight universe. So, I think I ought to give her credit. Chris Hemsworth, better known as Thor, plays the Huntsman, who is recruited by the Queen to track down Snow White, until he starts to have a change of heart. Hemsworth was pretty good in the character, but honestly didn't really stand out and shine, but at least he was pretty good. As for the seven dwarfs, they have to be the most interesting gang of seven ever put to film. A few of them are portrayed by Ray Winstone, Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, and Nick Frost, and they portray a more serious take on these characters. I was completely entertained, from beginning to end, with this perfectly well-made movie. This movie had some of the best action scenes ever put on film. I was sitting through the movie, and I was just glued to the screen, watching all these really cool fight scenes. This kept me entertained, and that's all I want in a movie. The visual effects totally blew me away, and it's totally worthy of an Oscar nomination. The glorious costumes, the beautiful art direction, and the mind-blowing make-up effects got me so hooked. I couldn't have asked for more. But now, here are some of the problems with this movie. There's this character in the movie named William, whom apparently was a childhood friend to Snow White, and they may start a romance. I felt that the character was too unnecessary, and it kind of didn't impress me. I really didn't buy the whole ""childhood friend"" addition to the story. I understand this is a re-telling of Snow White, but I honestly felt the movie would have been better off without this plot-hole. Also, it runs a little long, and you easily start to notice it, around the middle act of the film. But the rest of this movie is such a visual wonder. This movie is given a perfect tone and style, delivering a much better treatment to this story. This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year, and I got really hooked on this movie. The jaw-dropping visual effects, the great acting from the young cast, the scene-stealing performance by Charlize Theron, and the incredible art direction and costumes. I was easily enjoyed by this movie, and it's a better re-telling of the story than that ""Mirror Mirror"" nonsense! This is one of the most entertaining and surprising movies of the year. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", in my review, ""surprisingly impressive, a piece of well-made entertainment""."
180,"For those who like the genre: This is a genre I enjoy, even when it's just about great visuals. So I went to see Snow White & the Huntsman expecting to be visually entertained but little else. My expectations needn't have been so low. Not content to give us fabulous costumes, ""it"" actors, and a great score, the film makers went above and beyond. The movie was rich, with enough back stories and character development to get you involved (and therein lies the fun of fantasy film). I heard some moviegoers compare it to Lord of the Rings and I'd agree, there was a moment in which the scenery and the music reminded me of that film series (quite impressive). My only criticism, if you could even call it that, is: We got a lot of Snow White--her character is pleasingly multifaceted. And that's great. But when she meets and gets to know the dwarfs, and we begin to see the different facets...well that all went a bit quickly for me. In this case, less wasn't more. More would have helped viewers really see why Snow White is special, and really believe what happens next.The length: I balk at long movies (anything over 1.5 hours)...but this one never got tedious. It was just the right amount of time for you to sink into a fantasy world that wasn't over-the-top but rather subtle and compelling...drawing you in before revealing its magic. This is one you can go back and watch over and over again.Characters/actors: Charlize Theron stole the show, worth seeing this film just to catch her performance. Chris Hemsworth makes a delightful rogue. It was so fun spotting veteran actors like Eddie Marsan, made you go ""wow!""...just when you thought the casting couldn't get any better. Sam Spruell was wonderfully creepy, by the way. And to be fair, Kristen Stewart had some good acting moments. She has come a long way from her first portrayal of Bella for the Twilight series. The writers gave her the best possible Snow White--a far, far cry from the one-dimensional Snow White we all know from the 1937 animated version. Anyone with daughters will love this film...great that so many modern films are giving us strong female characters. I was reminded of the latest Alice in Wonderland (played by Mia Wasikowska)...and the upcoming Breaking Dawn Part 2 will give us more of the same if it sticks to the books as closely as the other Twilight films. Bottom line: Two hours of pure entertainment. BTW: Parents should know, the fairy tales of yore were much darker than their modern incarnations, and this film pays homage to the macabre. I thought it was probably a bit too scary for some of the kids/tiny tots in the theater. Their parents possibly went to the movies expecting something much more like a Disney cartoon. You might want to watch it without the kids first, then decide."
181,"This movie was intensely great, emphasis on intense. The mature dark tone around this whole movie was what made it unique and a beautiful visual experience. I was quite surprised at how well each actor portrayed their role in this classic tale with a dark twist. Kristen Stewart surprised me with an excellent performance along with the absolutely stunning Charlize Theron nailing her role as expected. Although this is a very dark movie and isn't for the faint of heart, there were many good parallels for those of faith to take from this movie. The visual artists completely outdid themselves by providing incredible creative effects to emerge you into the fairy tale world of Snow White. Overall a really impressive movie, but not one to take the children too, despite the familiar childhood characters."
182,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has been released on the heels of Tarsem Singh's ""Mirror Mirror,"" the light-hearted, family-friendly, comedic take on the Snow White legend as told by the Brothers Grimm. Although they draw inspiration from the same source, you would be doing both films a disservice by trying to compare them. Let them stand on their own, and you may find that both have something to offer. Having said that, my reaction to this new film was particularly strong. Here is a beautifully dark, visually sumptuous, thematically rich film, one that certainly knows its fairytale origins but doesn't feel obligated to adhere to them so strictly. I'm not being critical when I say that. Despite what the purists say, a little deviation never hurt anyone.The effectiveness of the film depends not on the overall story, which has by now become quite well known, but on the smaller details that set it apart. A prologue sequence tells of a queen (Liberty Ross) that wandered through a garden in the dead of winter and noticed a single red rose that continued to thrive. Upon pricking her finger on one of its thorns and spilling three drops of blood on the frost-blanketed soil, she made a wish; to have a daughter with skin white as snow, lips red as blood, hair black as a raven, and the strength of that defiant rose. Lo and behold, she and King Magnus (Noah Huntley) soon would have a beautiful baby girl and name her Snow White. The first years of her childhood were happy. But then her mother would fall ill and die, leaving her father heartbroken.Not long after, Magnus rescued and instantaneously fell in love with a beautiful prisoner of war named Ravenna (Charlize Theron). She appeared to have been kidnapped by a battalion of magical glass soldiers called the Dark Army, which had already conquered and enslaved several neighboring kingdoms. Magnus and Ravenna wedded the next day, only for Ravenna to reveal herself as a powerful sorceress and the vengeful leader of the Dark Army. She murdered Magnus on their wedding night, claiming that men like him only exploit women like her for their youth before discarding them. She seized control of the kingdom, locked Snow White in the north tower of the castle, and used her dark powers to drain women of their youth in a desperate struggle to remain the fairest of them all. The villagers fell into despair while the land was ravaged by her misuse of magic.And so begins the story proper. Ravenna learns from her magic mirror that Snow White, now a teenager (Kristen Stewart), is the key to her salvation; by consuming Snow White's heart, Ravenna will achieve immortality and perpetual youth. But the mirror warns that Snow White can also be her undoing, as only she has the power to destroy her. Before Ravenna has the chance to murder the young maiden, Snow White escapes from the tower dungeon and disappears into the Dark Forest, a thicket of dead, gnarled trees where your deepest fears are brought to life via a hallucinogenic puff of powder. Ravenna calls on someone who knows the Forest to track her down. Here enters the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), a disillusioned drunk who hasn't gotten over the death of his beloved wife.The rest of the film involves Snow White and the Huntsman rallying against Ravenna's tyranny, which culminates with an army riding towards the castle on horseback. Along the way, they will meet Ravenna's wicked brother Finn (Sam Spruell), Snow White's childhood sweetheart, Prince William (Sam Claflin), and a village of women who not only lost their men to the war but were also forced to scar themselves to avoid being captured by Ravenna and drained of their youth. They will also, of course, meet several short-statured bandits (Ian McShane, Johnny Harris, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, Brian Gleeson, Ray Winstone, and Nick Frost) who come to revere Snow White for being the daughter of a king they respected. They lead her and the Huntsman into a secluded area of the forest uncorrupted by Ravenna. It's a green, sunny, magical spot where pixies zoom through the air, mushrooms have eyes, and butterflies look like leaves. This is some of the best fairytale imagery I've seen since Ridley Scott's ""Legend.""Other elements, including the poisoned apple and the power of true love's kiss, all work their way into the story at one point or another, albeit in ways unique to this version. That could be the reason I responded to them so well. The Snow White character benefits the most from a somewhat more modern approach; while still pure of heart, she's no longer na√Øve and childlike. She has instead been transformed into a strong, able-bodied young woman, capable of selflessness but also of defending herself if the situation calls for it. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" owes much to the fairytale that inspired it. At the same time, it owes a great deal to present-day sensibilities, which prevent it from becoming stale and repetitive. This movie is terrific entertainment.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
183,"From time to time Hollywood will have this one big idea that everyone wants a piece of the pie of. From asteroids to fairy tale remakes, this year sees two completely different takes on the classical Snow White story, with Mirror Mirror firing the first salvo under director Tarsem's powerful but kitschy imagery and Julia Roberts hamming it up as the one-liner spouting evil Queen, and Snow White and the Huntsman under director Rupert Sanders offering a more grounded, grittier version of the girl blessed to be the fairest of them all.Really, do we need more than two hours to tell the story of Snow White once upon a time? Unless one is deprived of fairy tales when growing up, the story is probably amongst the most well known, and Disney's version would have permeated the subconscious of many, and everyone has their preferred interpretation. Unfortunately both movies take on extremes in their approach, when I felt a middle ground will probably provide for a more even narrative for the modern audience. With Mirror Mirror, Tarsem loaded it up with plenty of nice looking visuals, and you can label his Lily Collins as cute, coming complete with a singing voice put to good use at the end of the film. Julia Roberts on the other hand fell short and was woeful as the Queen whose second career as a stand up comedian tanked hard.Here, it became the opposite, with the wicked witch being a more compelling watch than Snow White. Charlize Theron, as the icy Queen whose magical prowess depended on the number of beautiful maidens she sucks the life out of, simply mesmerizes, and makes it all the more believable that a King in bereavement would be enchanted to take her as a Queen and become Snow White's stepmother, only to spell his downfall. The story by Evan Daugherty gave her character of Queen Ravenna plenty of back story, from her origins and reasons to be hell bent on chewing up kingdoms, in what would be soul devouring hate begetting hate. She hisses and gets her body all twisted, hell bent on completing the final piece of advice given by the mirror on the wall to devour the heart of Snow White in her quest for immortality. Even her bad apple ploy was more ingenious as compared to the half-baked one designed by Mirror Mirror's Queen.Kristen Stewart doesn't look at all like Snow White, and I suppose being better known as Bella from Twilight just made her snow pale skin here reminiscent of the other more (in)famous character she plays. There's no nice looking costumes and dresses for Snow White, and the acting range here by Stewart is limited. To portray Snow White as some kind of warrior queen, on Stewart's lithe shoulders, was a bit of a stretch as well. She doesn't have the charismatic presence of, nor the innocence of traditional Snow White, since her version harbours desire for revenge and to retake her kingdom, having escaped from the clutches of Ravenna, and having the reluctant titular Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) assist her in getting past scenario after scenario, village after village, to one of her father's loyal servant Duke Hammond (Vincent Regan) and his son and one time playmate Wiliam (Sam Claflin). Action sequences involving the Huntsman were pretty much standard, with no surprises thrown up, with a secret hope that he would be wielding a hammer at some point.It is this flight from the dark that played out with its handbrake on, tedious in execution with the same run-fight-hide routine taking place so frequently you'd wonder just how long it is to finally complete her journey in one direction, then having to take the reverse direction all the way back again to Queen Ravenna. Given it's no Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Dwarfs themselves got pretty much sidelined for the most parts save for two specially designed action sequences, and in many ways distanced the bond formed between Snow White and the Dwarfs. What more, this version had the likes of Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Toby Jones et al who play these characters, so a little camera trickery got employed to shrink them to the right perspective. And I really wonder why the big names for the roles that turned out to be less than 5 minutes for each actor, and are more grouchy without personality as seen by those portrayed in Mirror Mirror.And as if having a Snow White that's no longer that damsel in distress but possessing a steely willpower isn't enough, this version also made her very much like a Christ figure, in a strange amalgamation of having swords and sorcery mixed with Biblical references, including having the Lord's Prayer being recited. One cannot deny, given plot developments, how the writers found opportunity to include death and resurrection efforts, and from the latter, fast-tracking the faith amongst the downtrodden to follow her into battle against the devil as personified by the evil Queen. But listening to what's supposed to be a rousing anthem to rise up against oppression, it actually fell very flat and uninspiring to say the least.Sure the fairest of them all can command plenty of animals and fairies into a loving frenzy in a strange, trippy scene. but I reckon a better Snow White film would see Charlize Theron's Queen pitted against Lily Collins' Snow White. Now that I would pay money to watch another round of story revolving around the same themes and narrative structure."
184,"It's lucky that my friend had vouchers to see this film, because I would be demanding my money back. I genuinely wanted to walk out of the cinema 20 minutes in. This movie had no flow, poor dialogue, horrendous acting, a poor ending, and one of the worst plot holes in history. In what universe is Kristen Stewart considered fairer than Charlize Theron?They're planning a sequel of this atrocity! Why? I honestly cannot think of one good reason why this train wreck deserves any more. Spend money on decent franchises instead, or get some new talent in. I can only hope that this does not become a franchise in itself. Nuke all copies of this film from orbit!!!!"
185,"Let's start with the main character, Snow White. Kristen Stewart had somehow managed to gather my sympathies with all the barrage of jokes abuzz over her inability to facially express any discernible emotion. Well people, thou were wrong. She did manage to get the depressed emotion right. Ha-ha, Okay. However the main problem began once she opened her mouth. Thus came a time when Snow White had to instigate people and stir 'em up and fire 'em up for an epic battle with the Queen and her cohorts. You can imagine how much a burden this would be on the vampire babe. Needless to say she not only fails, but embarrasses (you can tell when you face palm in a dark hall). For most part she keeps running, tripping, tumbling and toppling. She also cuts a very sorry figure when riding a horse. That begs the question: where'd she learn to ride one anyway? I guess that's not a concern since she's Snow White eh? She might as well know the Relativity Theory the director might argue, so I'd better steer clear. Acting aside, looks also matter A LOT when one is talking Snow White. And what exactly did the producers have in mind when they picked Stewart for this role? Picture this- Tomboyish looks, the two larger than life front teeth and a tired face with dreary eyes begging for sleep. Well let's just say : Hurrah for the makeup man! Coming back to acting one could positively see how relieved she looked in 3-4 shots of the movie where she just had to lie down while the others made a fuss about her. She actually looked asleep. Great acting I must say! Hear hear. Enough of Miss Runny Nose already. Let's move on to¬ÖCharlize Theron as the Queen! One can't stop raving about this woman. She sucks not just souls of pretty women, but also the acting abilities of people around her. I guess no one was willing to take a chance as Snow White with Theron as the mainstay in the movie and thus Stewart was lured in the lion's den with the pretext of giving her the crown in the movie. Is there no end to your reign Charlize? Tell you what, she should have played Snow White also. Hell I say she should have been the Huntsman ...and the dwarfs too!Coming to the huntsman, the one reason I disliked Chris Hemsworth playing the role: Thor. I'm just so used to seeing him as Thor, I can't fathom him playing second fiddle to the likes of Kristen Stewart wading through dark jungles, through muddles and through puddles. No way, no how. And wow. Ian McShane? Black Beard?? They dared give him such a minor role. Pity, really. To sum up, one can't really sum up. Avoid, but if Charlize Theron lures you to the movie hall, well...can't blame you mate! Ratings! One for Charlize. Second for Chris (just for being there in the movie, so I'd have someone to keep my eyes away from you know who) Third one for Charlize."
186,"I gave this movie a six for one reason. It would have been great (8 or 9) except for one thing. Kristen Stewart. The girl can't act. She has the same expression for everything. Scared (breathe hard and stare blankly), Sad (breathe hard and stare blankly), Nervous (breathe hard), Might be in love (Stare Blankly), you get the idea...Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron (wasn't a fan until this movie, but she was awesomely creepy and evil!) and the dwarfs were all great! But KS just held the whole thing back from being really good; in fact she pretty much ruined it. and ***SPOILER*** Where the heck was my Happily Ever After!"
187,"Originally I was super jazzed for the movie. I love fairy tales, Kristen Stewart is one of the most honest personalities in Hollywood (completely unvarnished and without pretension), Charlize Theron is a goddess, and Chris Hemsworth is smokin' hot! And then I found out Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane were dwarfs - sold! But I got nervous when I started reading reviews where critics talked about how beautiful the cinematography was but how flat the performances were. They must have been trying to earn their paychecks, because they were totally wrong! Kristen's British accent wasn't flawless, but it wasn't too bad and definitely didn't pull me out of the movie. Charlize Theron's performance got a little pitchy at times, but evil queens are supposed to be screechy and crazy. I was slightly disappointed (spoiler alert!) that there was no romantic ending. But I was absolutely over the moon that Huntsman's kiss was the one that woke her up, not the one from (the rather bland and boring) William. Plus I can appreciate that it wasn't the point of the story - and it was more than enough that the Huntsman was the one that broke the spell! I also love how absolutely fierce Snow White was. Too many female heroines are mushy and boring. The speech she gave to rally the troops gave me a chill! All in all I absolutely loved it and am very glad I paid the big bucks to see it on the big screen!"
188,"I was very surprised about how much I actually enjoyed this movie. I was one of many that was turned down by the idea how watching a movie starring Kirsten Stewart, and felt she was only cast because of her popularity with the teen demographic, so I avoided to watch this movie at release.I caught Snow White and the Huntsman on Amazon and decided to give it a watch. What followed was two hours of me actually enjoying this movie. Do not get me wrong, this movie has plenty of problem, but not enough to warrant so many bad reviews.The story was a nice twist on the version of the fairytale that's been told countless times, and making the universe more 'high fantasy' in feel made things very interesting.Chris Hemsworth seem to clearly enjoy playing the role of the Huntsman, but I kept wondering what kind of accent he was trying to pull of since it goes back and forth between generic English and Scottish.Kirsten Stewart was surprisingly good in her role as Snow White. She definitely starts of slow, but gradually starts flexing her acting muscles. Which she desperately needed to do after being stuck in vampire movies for years.No mistake that Charlize Theron completely stole the show as the evil step-mother Ravenna. Plenty of scenes where she completely hams it up, but she made the character believable in a way that Ravenna wasn't portrayed as a bland villain who laughs manically, but who has an actual back story.The bad side of the movie is still there though. The dwarfs seems almost like a afterthought, the way they just stumble into the plot and takes little to follow Snow White like a group of disciples. It was also a bit off-putting to see these well- known actors CGI'd as dwarfs, when they could more easily have hired seven actual little people to act these roles.The factions involved in the plot is also poorly explained, since I had little to no idea who was fighting for who at the start, and where the rest of Raveena's kingdom was situated in all of this. I knew he King Magnus was, but didn't know either how big his kingdom was, and why people we're so loyal to him.In short, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and I recommend people giving it a shot if you come across it."
189,"It's weird how everyone who hates this movie just trashes Kristen Stewart. Actually I thought she gave a really strong performance, and the romance between Snow White and the Huntsman was probably the best and most convincing thing about this updated version of the fairy tale.What really sinks this film is not bad acting by the two stars, but sloppy direction by a confused first-time director. It's really obvious that Rupert can't decide what kind of movie he wants to make -- so he tries to make three or four different movies at once. He throws in Tim Burton style creepiness by giving the Evil Queen an incestuous relationship with her goofy-looking brother. (The two of them actually come across as comic relief, like the brother-sister team of figure skaters in BLADES OF GLORY.) And then he puts in tons of scenes of Monty Python style medieval squalor, with streets so dirty and filthy that you expect the Python boys to come by chanting, ""bring out your dead!"" But then in a jarring shift he suddenly takes our heroine into a cheesy AVATAR styled wonderland, complete with cute mushrooms and giant stags. Throw everything you can think of on the screen, and surely the movie will be a hit. Right? Right? Oh, and for the finale let's just film BRAVEHEART all over again. Everyone likes a battle scene, right? In closing I do want to say that poor Charlize Theron really didn't deserve the humiliation of having to be in this picture. Her character is so badly written, too. The poor woman keeps having screaming tantrums every five minutes -- just to remind us that she's evil."
190,"My wife and I loved this version of Snow White. The story was very cool, the visuals great and Charlize Theron was amazing. I'd like to see a follow up to this, hope they do it. Just as good or better then many of the ""super hero"" movies that dominate the theaters now a days. I'm not sure what I thought of Kristen Stewart. She's an OK actress and good looking, but perhaps not quite the right look for ""Snow White."" Charlize Theron o the other hand was perfect. Beautiful and evil. A little younger (and nicer) she would have made a great SNow White herself. Anyway, this was a fun, dark, live action take on the Disney Classic"
191,"There are a lot of haters on this movie out there. There are a lot of haters out there period. The internet seems to attract them. Please don't listen to them.This movie was very enjoyable. The different angle of the story was refreshing and interesting. The acting was fine, don't listen to people saying it was awful.One thing for sure, and this is probably why I was able to enjoy this movie so much, this is more of a medieval fantasy movie than a fairy tale.One of my favorite genres is medieval fantasy. I've seen most of this genre's movies and read a lot of the genre's books. If you're a fan of the medieval fantasy genre, whether that be D&D or Tolkien or any of the myriad of great books out there, this movie delivers.It was not very predictable for the most part which was fresh. Hemsworth did a great job as well as most of the others (of course Charlize did a fantastic job). But really, it was the heavy transformation from a Disney fairy tale to a dark medieval fantasy that really made this movie for me.If you're looking for Shakespeare, then maybe don't watch this movie. If you're looking for a refreshing, medieval fantasy twist on this classic tale though, give this movie a try. It's definitely not a waste of time.9 (Really it's an 8, but I gave it a 9 just because it was a lot better than I thought it would be. So, 1 point for the nice surprise. : P )"
192,"A feature film by an advert director. It shows. There are a lot of nice shots, great imagery and brilliant CGI but it all feels thrown together without any real uniform idea. Think Lord of the Rings merged with, well, Snow White (1937). It feels very much like they were just ticking the boxes: a beautiful princes for the girls? Check. A rugged warrior for the boys? Check. Loads and loads of fight scenes for no apparent reason (don't get me started on the troll), again for boys? Check. Some fairies for the girls? Check. They couldn't decide which target audience to go for and so just went for both and failed miserably.And then we come to the acting. Charlize Theron's evil Queen Revanna just throws a tantrum every now and then. She shouts a lot but you never really feel she's actually angry.Her brother is pretty mush the same just a little creepier.Kristin Stewart just does classic Kristin Stewart and drifts through the film without any real character except being slightly upset about what's going on.Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman is probably the best of a bad lot but even his accent changes from Yorkshire to Scottish to American in a single sentence sometimes.I blame the director for this as the cast is full of good actors but Sanders seems content at letting them give simple performances.The writing is the worst. It's corny and makes no real sense. How it took so long to find that nail I will never know. How a man can be in love with a memory of an eight year old girl is just creepy and don't get me started on the troll. There are also some brilliantly awful lines (e.g. Huntsman: ""You're trouble you are""). The only character development is done with the Huntsman but it's done so rapidly and swings between such extremes it borderlines on ridiculous.Essentially, is enjoyable for the ride but ultimately forgettable as it has no substance."
193,"I just have to say that the trailer for the movie does it no justice. The second ""Snow White"" movie released in 2012, it had a trailer featuring a screaming Thor (using an axe this time) as the huntsman, an hysterical Charlize Theron as the evil queen and a chain mailed Snow White amidst a flurry of special effects. It was that bad that I was not planning to see the movie, instead watching the other one, which proved to be a complete dud.In actuality, the film is gritty, well acted and visually stunning. The story doesn't quite make sense, but it doesn't have to; after all, this is a movie based on a fairy tale. Charlize Theron does a brilliant evil queen, so great in fact that, with small tweaks to the story, I could have rooted for her. She is clearly insane, but also thoroughly sad, driven by revenge against all men and the world itself. Really up there on the crazy/hot scale :) Chris Hemsworth also does a good huntsman, even if his main role is to speak deeply in a sort of Scottish accent and kill people.Of course, not everything is perfect. Some of the things are just borrowed, others are clearly without any merit and some make no sense. The great deer forest spirit with arborescent horns is something taken from Japanese myth, while the thieving band of dwarfs is turning into a clich√© and is the same as the other 2012 Snow movie. The battles make no sense and the character of the queen's brother is quite pointless. Snow White's character is the most inconsistent of them all, though.Bottom line: Kristen Stewart is one of the few women that can look and be both virginal and predatory. The films director (and poor vampire guy) probably found that out during the filming of this film. She does a good Snow White, given the material. Charlize Theron was just amazing. The visual and special effects were cool, but not overstated. All in all, the best Snow White movie I've seen so far and one I enjoyed watching."
194,"At first the movie was moving along with a 7 or 8 rating with nothing of interest really happening on screen; the dwarfs came on. It was immediately noticeable that the roles of the major characters were not being played by LP's (Little People) but by actors of normal build through the ""black"" magic of cinema. Before you put off this criticism as over the top, consider the uproar if a movie had four or five major parts that should be African-American was being played by Whites in black-face! This movie does not meet even minimal standards of respectfulness. Don't see this slap to the face of people who are still fighting for complete acceptance in society. The only reason I gave it a 1, is there is no way to give it a 0."
195,"what the hell! seriously why are people hating on such a great actress! Yeah don't get me wrong Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are amazing with their roles but so is Kristen... 'No emotion'?? what the hell, I mean come on she pours her heart out to all the men after she awakens from, may I add, CRYING because of what the Huntsman says to her, oh and the kiss...and gets hated for not showing emotion; what a load of rubbish! Kristen cant help that she apparently comes across as 'emotionless' maybe thats the way she is, most people just cant hack it that she's better and much more beautiful than they are; in all honesty the one thing that has ruined my film experience here is all the ridiculous haters that hate on no one BUT Kristen Stewart... seriously just leave the poor girl alone! She's trying her best, and its a lot better than some actors out there 'nuff said"
196,"Rupert Sanders's Snow White and The Huntsman is possibly the best fairy tale movie ever adapted from the Brothers Grimm Legends. It is by far Kristen Stewart's most impressive performance of her young career. Chris Hemsworth follows up the Avengers very well in his role as Eric, the Huntsman. Sam Claflin is great as Prince William. But now to the one character that will blow your breath away. Charlize Theron is legendary as Queen Ravenna. This is perhaps her best performance to date. She is not only evil, but threatening at the same time. Near the final climatic battle of the film, learning that her brother Finn has been killed, Ravenna decides to kill Snow White herself. She disguises herself as William gives Snow White an apple. Of course Snow White takes it believing it is William, when Snow White bites it, it quickly turns fuzzy then bursts into black pieces. As Snow White collapses in the Snow, The Queen reveals herself, as her head (still disguised as William) twitches then her collar comes out of her neck and forms into her as Snow White looks on in horror. The Queen and Snow White are dark reflections of one another, they are everything the other is not. absolutely breathtaking This Film is wonderfully done in its SFX, Music, and mostly the acting. THIS IS A MUST NOT MISS FILM GO SEE IT!!!!!!"
197,"You've seen the commercials and the trailers with the dazzling special effects, sinister stares, and frenzied fighting. Snow White and the Huntsman looks like a masterpiece from the outside, but looking carefully into the mirror on the wall reveals that there is more to this movie and it is not pretty. My scrutiny actually resulted in 7 reasons for you not to bother with this year's second twist on the classic fairy tale (see my review of Mirror Mirror). I'll spare you the synopsis.1- The cinematography is visually arresting and even breathtaking, but often for no reason at all. Why do the mushrooms have eyes? It is quite Tim Burton-esque, but not in a fun way. Why is the Queen (a fierce Charlize Theron) taking a bath in stuff that resembles milk of magnesium? She does look just like a chess piece when she re-emerges from the goo ad that is kind of neat, but what was the purpose of the scene? Aside from the Dark Army soldiers that are made of what appears to be metal pieces manipulated by magnets, most elements seem to be in the film purely for show. Director Rupert Sanders focuses too much on making the visual effects the star without ensuring that the final product is cohesive. And honestly, I didn't see many special effects in this movie that weren't in the music videos for Madonna's ""Power of Goodbye"" and Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance.""2- The seven dwarfs bring a little joy to the proceedings, but not much. And except for the oldest one with his Yoda-like proverbs and advice, it was impossible to distinguish between them. 3- Lackluster does not even begin to describe the depths to which Kristen Stewart's performance sinks. She pulls a Beyonc√© and manages to chip away at any credibility or quality present in majority of her scenes. From her constipated ""Edward?"" stare to her incessant bosom-heaving (there are literally 30-second stretches of time where all she does is breathe heavily), all the little quirks that have made her acting in the Twilight series seem like a colossal joke show up in Snow White. Her failures to capture the gravitas of Snow White's predicament range from infuriating to laugh-out-loud hilarious.4- Of course, Bella¬ÖI mean, Kristen Stewart is not completely to blame for her terrible performance, which brings us to reason #4. The dialogue is choppy and cheesy and is even more problematic since the film is so sleek and modern. The writing should be above the typical pitfalls of fairy tale remakes and keep up with the art direction, but it falls flat and makes what should be a thrilling experience a boring mess. 5- It's not only what you say ‚Äì it's how you say it. The accents are ridiculous. Are they in Scotland? Ireland? England? It depends on which actor is speaking. 6- Chris Hemsworth as The Huntsman was just Thor with an axe instead of a hammer. I am all for spending money to see either Hemsworth run around and be extraordinary and masculine, but there is no point in seeing Snow White when you can just watch Chris run around in less clothing in The Avengers. I was much more impressed by William (Sam Claflin), an archer who could make Katniss Everdeen nervous. 7- The ending is completely anti-climactic. Before I get complaints about spoilers, every person who has heard of Snow White knows that the Evil Queen does not triumph, and this film takes the same tack. After over an hour of mind-blowing effects and being convinced that no other evil stepmother is as insanely gifted in badassery than the Queen, Snow White overcomes her with a disappointing and almost silent victory. The Dark Army returns briefly to keep the supporting cast from joining in on the final fight, but their reappearance seemed desperate somehow. It was as if the art directors jumped in and shouted, ""Hey! We're still doing cool things!"" Unfortunately, it was too little, too late. I sincerely hope that after this debacle, Hollywood will leave this fairy tale in the Disney vault for a while.Review courtesy of The Rogers Revue"
198,Absolutely terrible worthless rip off of a peace of cinema. Only identical to every movie I have ever seen based in Midevil times. The preview Wrote a check with the special effects and story that the actual experience could not even hope to cash. I can only pray to get that horrid 2 hours I lost watching that terrible film back. And hope I will be assaulted with a deadly weapon in that replaced time because that would be a tremendous step up from that crap fest they call a movie on that screen!!!!!!!!I refuse to Waste one more second reviewing this movie so I'm using this to fill the extra space
199,"When I came to the cinema there was a poster on the door of the screening room from universal stating that they where monitoring it for anti piracy theft. Shame they went to all the trouble of distributing these for a film that nobody would even torrent. This film was awful and dumb, it is pretty clear that this film does not even try to be good but purely exist to lure people into seeing it..chi ching. I wanted to walk out of the cinema, in fact some people did. Everyone else kept looking at their phone and sulking, a group of teenage girls laughed, I think they where high and not exactly laughing with the film. I don't even know what to say, just don't waste our time with this intellectually insulting film!"
200,"this was terrible movie, too long and boring. especially Kirsten, that girl just can't act! stop casting her Hollywood!! idea was not bad actually, but execution of it was horrible! i watched it recently and i'm really sorry i gave money for this.only plus is environment and cgi, but thats not too hard to achieve with todays technology.Charlize and Chris did their part very well, but thats not enough to save this movie from too long boring dialogs, too much scenery shots and too much Kirsten's open mouth!This was horrible experience and i recommend forget about it, skip it, bury it."
201,"It's a pity. I was looking forward to seeing this film. I really love the old fairy tales and was looking forward to a powerful take on the Snow White tale. I was disappointed. Charlize Theron certainly gave a new look into the Wicked Queen, and Chris Hemsworth was dashing enough as the Huntsman. Even if his accent wobbled all over. The Dwarfs were good value. The weak link was Kristen Stewart. She delivered a very one note performance, the highlight of which was when she was playing the comatose Snow White. As a corpse her deficits as an actress were not so noticeable. The biggest problem with this film is that the director couldn't make up his mind. Themes, creatures, back-stories were introduced and then forgotten about. One minute we were in a river-land the next a mountain. I found myself wondering where the heck we would find ourselves next. The film meandered and that was fatal. It didn't have the courage to fully explore a new side to Snow White and it didn't have the courage to tell the old side of Snow White. It meandered between the two and told neither of them well."
202,"I liked this flick a lot. I was impressed with what the director did with this old tale that has enchanted so many people for so many generations.The special effects and way the movie played out was enough to keep me interested throughout the whole movie. I did not have a moment where I thought that this flick was going no where.The only disheartening fact is that they took a made for family movie and put a dark twist on it and in doing so, made a outstanding movie suitable for viewing by older viewers and not so suitable for the younger members of the family. But then in today's world, who am I to say how old one should be when watching a dark tale? My Rating Is 8 of 10"
203,"I give this movie an 8 out of ten. The re-telling of an old tale is always an easy way to make a buck, yet is a set up to be panned by critics, but for me this one came out pretty solid. I know, I know, everybody is questioning the choice of Kristen Stewart as Snow White, although I don't wanna jump on the band wagon, I gotta say the criticism is warranted. We all know why she was chosen, unless you have been in a coma, the producers were definitely counting on the tween twilight fans to pour their money into the ticket stand even if the movie flopped. I also believe that casting was told that Kristen Stewart would play Snow white even before the script was written. She was handled pretty smartly. The first half of this movie really relegates her to more of a plot device than a real character. This very much disguised her poor acting skills because unlike the Twilight series, Stewart had real actors to hold up to. Hemsworth as the Huntsman was fine, and probably a good choice. Coming off his role as Thor, he really didn't have to change a thing, well except he had to trade his hammer in for other weapons, otherwise it was pretty much the same old character.The twist in this adaptation were novel, I won't get into them, you can watch it yourself. The real star here was Charlize Theron, and the visuals of the movie. Casting Charlize Theron was a great move and other than over doing it a few times, she is pretty strong in her role. The visuals/sets were definitely the biggest star. It is a pretty clean, sanitized setting but impressive no less. Some people were actually disappointed with the sanitized, stylized visuals but not me, let's face it, this is a Fairy tale, and therefore it should be a stylized/ idolized environment, by the sheer definition of a fairy tale. I do think it could have been a little more colorful ala Red Riding Hood, but then again this set was a little grittier which I believe was a nice touch.All-in-all, a good adaptation, stunning visuals, and a few twists on a story everyone already knows, it turns out to be a pretty good movie worth watching."
204,"Oh look, it's another Snow White film, the third this year after the little-seen Grimm's Snow White and turgid missed-opportunity that was Tarsem's Mirror Mirror. In a nice twist of irony, out of the two 'big' ones, it was Tarsem's I originally found myself anticipating. Before you recoil, let me explain, I am a huge fan of The Fall (no, not Mark E. Smith one), and when he was announced as director about two years ago, I immediately thought he would be perfect. He was, yes, but the film ended up having 'Studio Tampering' written all overall it, making it into utter balderdash. So, as a result I turned to SWATH, to see how that would turn out. I thought that this Grimm Brothers adaptation had plenty of visual flair (similar to Tarsem's) and a great cast (even down to the dwarfs). Yet, that turned out to be all it really had going for it.I liked Stewart in Adventureland, yes, she wasn't as good as the other Kristen in it, but she proved a good counterpart to Jesse Eisenberg, so I was curious to see how she would perform as Snow White. However, she proves to be less-than-praiseworthy. Not that she's inherently bad, it's just that, well, she has an unfortunate habit of lapsing back into those Bella Swan tics, where she bits her lip uncomfortably and smiles like it hurts her. I'd rather she didn't spend the entire film looking she she had taken a bite from the poisonous apple. Raffey Cassidy, on the other hand, wasn't all that bad as her younger self.Charlize Theron went slightly overboard at times - not that I don't mind OTT performances, (I loved Nic Cage in Herzog's Bad Lieutenant or Gary Oldman in Leon) - yet even when she screamed defiantly/hysterically ,she held her icy performance together and it (just about) worked,convincingly conveying her as a queen who is truly evil; which was a nice change from Julia Roberts' mind-numbingly unfunny queen in Mirror Mirror. I liked Hemsworth in it worth, even if his accent wavered at times, I've always thought he had an affirming screen presence since his performance as George Kirk made me shed a tear. The Terry Gilliam-esque casting of the dwarfs was genuinely great, Eddie Marsan,Toby Jones, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, etc. However it was a shame they were wasted and given lines like ""All we get is poo!"" or the infuriatingly clich√©d ""She is the one.""The script was flawed, flat and flaccid; making some scenes feel deathly dull. It was clich√©d, as illustrated by the stilted dialogue, but then again would you really expect the rug to be pulled from under your feet by Snow White? No, not really. Throughout, this damp script tussles with an impressive visual style: it was what really helped the film, along with Theron and another enjoyable score by James Newton Howard. The visuals were quite a joy to witness, from the Castle, to the troll's design, to the juxtaposition of the Dwarfs' home-place, (however that scene's overuse of CGI was something I wasn't keen on). The climatic beach battle was far too reminiscent of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, which is another case of the film wearing its apparent influences on its sleeve - Terry Gilliam, Guillermo Del Toro, Peter Jackson and Mr. Scott - yet it is understandable being Rupert Sanders directorial debut, which despite being flawed, is promising.I've many reviews of this, some of which have described it as being a feminist metaphor, well, it isn't. It is nothing deep or thought- provoking, it is an ambitious retelling of the Grimm tale, nothing more, nothing less and in spite of a weak script, consistent visual flourishes, an occasionally rousing score and Theron's absorbing performance as Ravenna are what save the film in the end."
205,"I walked into the theater with average expectations for this movie. I didn't expect it to be anything extraordinary, but I thought it would at least be good. I was wrong.Having seen many of Kristen Stewart's movies, and liked a fair few, I immediately thought that the casting was a bit off. She does great as a geeky, awkward teen..but that's about it. The acting was horrible on her part. I had to take cues from other actors to figure out what expression she was trying to portray. There was one part where Snow White was supposed to be giving a pep talk to a group of soldiers/fighters, and it was so forced that I had to fight the urge to cover my face and wait for it to be over.I felt no emotional connection to Snow White at all. I actually found myself rooting for the evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron)...you know it's bad when you feel the story would end better if the protagonist dies and an evil tyrant continues her reign.This movie had great potential, but it was ultimately killed by bad casting. I only stayed for the whole movie because someone else purchased my ticket."
206,"Honestly, the whole Snow White story revolves around Snow White being more beautiful and likable than the Evil Queen.If I was Charlize Theron and went up to my mirror and said ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" and my mirror came back with ""Actually my Queen, it's this girl called Snow White now"", I'd say show her to me, see Kristen Stewart's face, laugh uproariously, slap my mirror upside the head and go back to the business of being evil with a spring in my step.Kristen Stewart is neither more beautiful than Charlize Theron, nor is she more likable. Even if she managed to pull off that feat (mostly by Charlize making herself not likable as opposed to any 'acting' that Kristen might attempt) there is still the issue of beauty, which is what the story is centred on, as it gives rise to the jealousy of the Queen that sets everything else in motion.Seriously, when is anyone going to realise how crap Kristen is.Incidentally, if you look on the DVD cover, there is a picture of her in a coma with the poison apple lying next to her. Literally the only difference between that picture and the picture of her on the front is that her eyes are open. It's like her cosmetician slipped 400 times with the botox needle and managed to get every single muscle in her face."
207,"I'm really not one of those people who gives hateful bad reviews to movies ever.. but this one deserves a bad review.. the cast was good in the exception of Kristen Stewart.. she really fails at giving character to the role she plays. she's just a very bad actress and i really don't understand how she can be chosen as a lead for any movie, let alone a character like Snow White.. the best part about the movie is that some of the graphics were very good. but overall, this movie was lame, boring, not as dark as it promised to be, and simply bad. rent it at home, because that will give you the option of just stopping it once you're bored.. unfortunately for me, i was with my girlfriend at the theatre who seemed to be enjoying it, so i sat there and laughed in my own head about the terrible ever so awful Kristen Stewart."
208,"But rather a Huntsman of the hairy human variety. It's the 'untold' story of how the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) plays a larger role in the life of Snow White (Kristen Stewart). I really wanted to like this movie, as I'm a fan of Hemsworth and unlike a lot of people, I don't mind Kristen Stewart. The trailers did promise a darker interpretation of the tale than we're used to, but the trade-off of things being grim for the most part was that they were also not very enjoyable to watch. The story has a rather sluggish start, despite the effects on display, and just never really gets going. Things pick up a bit when we venture to the splendidly realised home of the fairies - this is where the real sense of wonder lies, as the creatures there are quite brilliant in their design, from the fairies themselves (that communicate via a sort of humming sound) to the stunning White Hart. It's just a shame the movie couldn't have stuck with this truly magical feeling.The story is more or less what you'd expect: evil queen, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), comes into young Snow White's life after Snow's mother has died and her father ""rescues"" the witch being transported by soldiers who shatter into black glassy shards when they're hit. Whilst Ravenna seems decent enough towards Snow in the beginning, she quickly becomes jealous over the attention she gets. It doesn't take long for Queen Bitch to resort to King-murdering and trapping Snow in a tower. After Ravenna's liquid gold mirror (that looks like a big-arse cymbal that oozes out a cloaked figure) tells her Snow will soon surpass her in beauty, and to stop this she must have Snow's heart, Snow makes a break for it. The Queen enlists the help of the Huntsman to bring her Snow's heart, as he is the only one who's not afraid to go into the Dark Forest. Really, Ravenna should have known the Huntsman wasn't the right guy for the job when he started asking questions. Anyway, the promise of bringing his deceased wife back/threat of death is enough to make him seek Snow out. Of course then he decides he's WITH Snow rather than *against* her, and the two of them team up. They later get aid from eight dwarfs (who get trimmed down to the expected seven eventually). They're not of the 'Heigh-Ho' variety, but rather tough little fighters played by familiar British character actors. There's really very few surprises in the film, other than the slight twists of who the Queen disguises herself as to poison Snow and who it is that wakes Snow from her poisoned apple-induced coma. Much has been said about Stewart vs. Theron (both looks and acting-wise), but I personally felt Stewart was quite good in the role of Snow White. She makes the character different to that certain other someone everyone knows her as playing. Snow has an innocence and inner (as well as outer) beauty about her, but she can also be fierce and lead armies (whilst looking fetching in chain mail). I actually felt Theron was the one guilty of questionable acting in the film. She often overdoes it, yelling a lot even when the occasion doesn't call for it (although quite a few people yell in this movie for no apparent reason). Theron's portrayal of her shallow and petty character is pretty cartoonish, it's almost laughable. I hope we weren't meant to feel sympathy for her character, as I sure as hell didn't. Hemsworth's Huntsman winds up being the best of the three. He proved his ability to give 'macho' characters depth with Thor, and here he does it again - despite being given not that much to work with. The Huntsman character is interesting (as is his accent)...which is more than can be said for Snow's other admirer, William (Sam Claflin). He's not an offensively *bad* fellow, but he doesn't make much of an impression either. Ravenna's brother, Finn (and his goofy haircut), meanwhile, is as embarrassing/ineffective as his sister is. Somebody should have torched him, starting with his hair. The dwarfs are an okay bunch (except for their mumbling, which almost required subtitles on occasion), and the film goes to lengths to make sure we care about them so that when one of them is offed, it has impact. Sadly, I felt the film lacked much impact at all. It's depressing to watch Snow bring death with her wherever she goes. She's kind of the 'Typhoid Mary' of the fairytale world. Wherever she went, death followed (like when the white steed - who just happened to be waiting for her when she escaped via the sewers - presumably drowned in mud...I was having The Neverending Story flashbacks). Characters who help her out die frequently, and then there's the bit where the beautiful White Hart gets shot with an arrow. White steed, village, White Hart, and one dead dwarf...she was death on legs. Not by choice, obviously, the Queen's the one to blame. Thankfully, Ravenna, her brother and the guy who shot the White Hart all get theirs in the end.It goes without saying that the scenery, effects and creatures (like a bridge troll) on display are quite wondrous to look at. But all the soldier shattering, milk baths, black goo and clouds of ravens cannot distract from what is largely a pretty unfulfilling movie experience. It's very nice to look at, but not much else. I'm glad they left things open to interpretation in regards to who Snow ultimately ended up with - the Huntsman or William. Would have felt a bit forced to have her suddenly end up with one of them at the end. While this recent retelling of a famous fairytale is certainly loads better than the dreadful Red Riding Hood, it still makes one think ""Liquid mirror, liquid mirror, on the wall...this is not the best Snow White film of them all""."
209,"I'll admit, when I saw the first trailer for Snow White and the Huntsman, I marked the date on my calendar and was excited for its release. It looked like a creative take on the traditional story, with good action and a simple but action-based premise. I just saw it last night, and needless to say I was a little disappointed for a few reasons. 1. The plot was like a Burger King patty: barely any meat, mostly filling. For every 5 minutes of plot-relevant development or action, there was 10 minutes of seemingly boring and irrelevant filler. Some scenes felt like they were only there to show off mediocre visual effects, that in a few cases left the audience laughing anyway. 2. The writers tried SO HARD to develop the characters, and make the audience care for them, but they failed miserably. There were so many scenes that made no sense to an audience due to the awful attempts at character development. Without spoiling anything, in one scene a recently introduced character dies and for some reason they dedicate a 10 minute long scene to his funeral, while Snow White cried her eyes out. After she (and the audience) just met him?! Really? 3. The villain's ""henchman"" looked laughable and was incredibly unoriginal. 4. Kristen Stewart was horribly miscast. I think she's attractive, but she does not exude ""innocence and beauty"" like Snow White supposedly does to all the characters on screen. Many scenes where her ""innocence"" saves the day left me scratching my head. 5. The love story was underdeveloped, and unfulfilled. In fact, a critical scene in the Snow White story makes no sense to the viewer because of this unresolved sub-plot. 6. I was just bored by the end of the movie, and just wanted to leave. Mind you, I love slow moving movies too... this one was just slow moving AND silly/pointless in most scenes. 7. Chris Hemsworth's character's Irish accent was distracting and made it hard to take him seriously... a small quibble, but you'll know what I mean after you see it.It gets a 5 because it's not theatre worthy, but I wouldn't discourage viewers from renting it when it releases to video. Overall it's disappointing from a fan who was excited for an adult take on the old children's story. A complete lack of effective (and attempted) character development, a slow moving and distracted plot, miscasting/misusing the actors, and a series of predictable clich√©s ruined what could have been a good movie.Liam"
210,"This movie is a twist on a classic fairy tale and contains some of the key ingredients, however a true and well done plot is missing. There isn't much dialouge and the story never goes very far unless it does so in a blunt way, which kind of ruins the ability of the film to derive any emotion out of you. The graphics are great but everything else is mediocre, the fighting and dramatic scenes are lame. I personally didn't find any of the casts' acting bad especially when they are working on a dull movie that if you are walking in with high expectations are not will come out probably not remembering much. If you like movies with good stories, you may want to skip out."
211,"As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie months ago I was pumped to see it. It looked exciting, dark and with Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron it had to be good right? Well I was a bit off with my prediction. First I'm going to say that its wasn't the acting. I'm not a huge fan of Kristen Stewart and will admit I was upset at her being cast but honestly she was... as good as the character could get I suppose. Each actor cast did the best they could with their roles and it was a good effort but the dialogue and story line itself was bland. I was bored because it seemed that nothing actually happened. There wasn't any growing love interests or anything which would be fine except that none of the ""friendships"" developed much either! Mostly because there wasn't much talking between them. Most of the movie was just travelling. The scenery was beautiful and so were the effects of the dark forest, the sanctuary and the queen's evil black glass-like soldiers. Basically this movie was a bit boring because of the story itself, not much happens. All actors and actresses did well, even Kristen Stewart to those who doubted her. If you want to see an adrenaline inducing movie this is NOT it, just wait for it to be released and rent it if you want to watch it."
212,"I'm just going to list the things i liked and the things i didn't like below:+ nice costumes and setup + the music usually matches that what is going on on screen and delivers the mood very well (the composer was Harry Gregson-Williams, who also did the score for ""Antz"" (1998) and the Shrek-movies) + the credits are well done, as other reviewers have already pointed outthe story is VERY shallow and boring; i know you shouldn't expect complex story telling from a snow white movie, but this one is only about snow white running away from the queen, encountering some good guys, encountering some bad guys and finally coming back to get even with the queen; i think that might just not be enough to make a decent movie out of it; at least not without any interesting (!) subplots there is barely any character development going on; they all fail to reveal any character traits or motivations whatsoever, which makes it hard to sympathize with any of the characters, especially the dwarfs there didn't seem to be any chemistry between the cast members; i know it's a really imprecise point of criticism, but this movie really reeked of that feeling the dialogs are boring; not stupid or ridiculous, just ...boring! the action sequences are dull; they sometimes even feel outdated (even i can tell it's bad cgi in some scenes, and i really don't care about those things); it's all been done before, and most of it has been done better (-) the German dub is just plain ridiculous (they use the English word ""huntsman"" for instance, which makes it sound like a new superhero name ""hans-man""); can't really hold that against the movie itself, thoughMy final thoughts on the movie: It's pretty bad. Had i seen it on TV, i would have turned it off about half an hour in. This movie tries to impress as a fantasy-action-epic-piece-of-art that is supposed to entertain everybody. the result is very sub-average popcorn-cinema. i hope it doesn't break even on the box office and encourages Hollywood to sling even more crap like this at the movie-goers."
213,"This film deserves to be seen, if for nothing else, but for the wonderful, spectacular, visual tapestry it weaves. From the pristine snow clad garden of the opening frame, to the splendid redness of the rose & the drops of blood amidst the white. The army rushing to meet the dark force, who await with red pennants fluttering in the wind. The famed mirror which transforms into a molten, golden creature. The Queen, sheathed in milk during her search for eternal youth. Or shrouded by ravens as she seeks her enemy. The fort, standing tall and grey against the frothy waves. The lake, enveloped in a mist, with the fishing village by its side. And the two sides of the coin, the Dark Forest, guarded by a troll, grim, leafless, where your worst fears take shape. Offset by the Sanctuary, mythical, wondrous, inhabited by fairies, a moss covered tortoise and white butterflies. And I liked the story too¬ÖIt follows the broad outline of the fairy tale but has enough newness, turns and twists to keep you hooked. The Queen, played with evil ease by a stony faced Charlize Theron. Chris Hemsworth as the rough hewn Hunstman. The motley rag tag band of dwarfs (Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone among others). Sam Claflin as William, who regrets having left Snow White behind. And, Kristen Stewart, who, to my surprise, does justice to this tale of a princess who discovers whether she has enough mettle in her to become queen.The end credits are worth waiting for as well, with again some stunning visuals and a pulsating song to boot. There is a strange, creatively fulfilling delight I feel as I watch old favourites come alive in new forms. Mirror Mirror was a quirky, funny retelling of the story of Snow White. This one is grim, grey, full of blood, war and fights. Yet has the charm, the magic and the purity of the original. It can cast a spell, but only if you still believe in fairy tales.

214,"Why does this movie suck?1. The acting: Yes, Kristen is indeed wooden. She spends most of the movie with her mouth hanging open. I kept on wanting a hand to appear at the bottom of the screen and close her mouth for her and say ""That's better."" Charlize overacts like crazy. She knows this movie sucks and doesn't even try.Chris Hemsworth is okay as Thor. But here, all he does is scream and squint his eyes. Complete with a bad Scottish accent.Hey look, Ray Winstone's playing a hard man. Like he always does.2. Some scenes are not appropriate for a fairy tale:We have the brother-sister incest between the Evil Queen and her brother. YUCK! This is Snow White. I don't care if your sister is Charlize Theron.Also the scene where the dwarfs are beating up Snow White and Erik. That's too much. Sure, I'd love to spank Kristen Stewart as much as the guy.3. Snow White's father is shallow:He takes one look at the Evil Queen and the narrator says ""And he fell in love with her immediately."" I know people in movies fall in love at first sight, but damn. Also, his wife just died and he completely forgets about her.4. Snow White escapes from the castle only to come back to it at the end.5. The ""This first guy isn't your true love, this other guy is"" clich√©.6. The scene where the Evil Queen disguises herself as Snow's boyfriend and tricks her into eating a poison apple, why didn't she kill her in the first place? She kept her in prison for over a decade and didn't kill her.7. The poor romance between Snow and Erik. Why? Bad acting from the two leads.8. When Snow White is ready to fight the Evil Queen. The Queen has her back to her and what does Snow do? Gives a battle cry so that the Queen can turn around and stop her. What an idiot.9. The Queen's mirror. That's not a mirror, that's a big golden plate and the T-1000 comes out of it.10. The Queen claims to be unstoppable. What kills her? A simple dagger to the chest. So bad, it's like a joke in a comedy movie.So, is there anything I DO like?Well, the fact that this is a PG-13 version of the fairy tale is not a bad idea. Kristen is indeed pretty and would have potential if she take more acting lessons. Don't worry folks, I bet she'll do a performance so great, we'll regret making fun of her. Her English accent is good, where as most Americans suck at an English accent.The scene where the windows break and the pieces form themselves together into glass men is very creative. The battle scenes are great.The song in the credits is just awesome. I could listen to it over and over.This film could've worked if it didn't have the problems mentioned above. Also, I think this film has many flaws because this is the director's first feature.And not once did I mention Kristen's affair with the director................. oops. I just did."
215,"I loved this film! This is the first film of one of the Grimm's collections that matched my understanding of their originals. When I was little, I had a friend whose family were Polish nobility who had fled the iron curtain. He often translated Brothers Grimm stories from an ancient, German, leather-bound volume that he loved. I sometimes wondered if he was embellishing them, as the stories were so gruesome - not anything American parents would expose their children to. He relished my horror at the violence and explicit cruelty.This film is true to that dark spirit, despite its amazing embrace of the most modern use of naturalistic, character-driven story telling. The eroticism Theron brought to Queen Ravenna, the wounded self-doubt Hemsworth brought to The Huntsman, and the innocence and soft hearted wonder Stewart managed to believably arc into a righteous fury was stunning and moving. Despite the inexperience of the writers and director, they managed this counterintuitive fusion with aplomb.Also, I was excited when I first saw Bekmambetov's dreadful Night Watch and its use of CGI as part of the cinematic construct and not just animated character and set extensions, and I was looking forward to these techniques that I had seen used in the trailers for Snow White. Similar techniques were indeed used in this film, however submerged they were in more the hackneyed liquid-metal and drooling-beast usage, the enchanting fairyland notwithstanding.I was most surprised by this excellent film's low ratings here on IMDb, as I put great store in IMDb ratings, which reflect the wisdom of an enlightened crowd. I tend to judge a film as excellent, regardless of what I have heard, if it is rated above 8 with over 1000 votes, a formula that has never failed me. Since the metacritic scores have been added, I have found the ratings even more useful, but looking at the 57 metacritic score and the 6.9 viewer score, I decided that this film was not going to meet the high expectations I had gotten from watching the trailer. Well, it proved my reliance on these scores as flawed, as this was one of the best films I have seen this year."
216,"The first big surprise of the 2012 summer movie season is here as Snow White And The Huntsman proves to be a really entertaining and visual stunning version of the classic fairy tale. As the story is a retelling of Snow White, there is no reason to go over the details except to say it is a dark re-telling and there are scenes played almost like a horror film and that was fine with me. First time feature director Rupert Sanders has a sumptuous visual style that aids the movie in every way. The dark scenes are bathed in spooky imagery and the lighter scenes, especially those in ""Sanctuary"" are absolutely beautiful. Ridely Scott would be proud as I would be surprised if he's not an influence. Sanders' pace is a more moderate one, as compared to the fast paced blockbusters of the season, he takes his time setting up and telling the story from Evan Daugherty's script and there is a lot of story told in the 2 hrs plus. I was never bored and there is plenty of well-staged action mixed throughout this tale to entertain and I actually feel the film benefits from not rushing, as we come to like characters, even those like the dwarfs, who only enter a about half way through. The SPFX are flawless with the before mentioned visuals and a large number of CGI created characters which carry weight and have a nice realism. Some of the Sanctuary characters are breathtaking to behold. What helps make all this blend together and work so well, is the cast. Charlize Theron is dripping with sensual malice as evil queen, Ravenna. She knows exactly when to show restraint and exactly when to go over the top a bit and she can be downright scary one minute and sexy the next. She even gives us glimpses of vulnerability and inner sadness to the villainous queen. Bravo! Chris Hemsworth is charming and noble as The Huntsman, a former soldier who's lost someone he loves and finds a new purpose in life when he crosses paths with the fugitive princess, Snow White. Hemsworth brings heart and depth to the character as he did in Thor and proves he's a star in the making. And as for Snow White, Kristen Stewart was the biggest surprise of all. I'm not a fan of her disassociated acting style and was surprised at how lively her performance was, especially when she needs to rally her subjects to fight. Yes, there are still some of the Stewart mannerisms but, the big difference was how much emotion she carried in her usually vacant eyes. She conveyed a lot of feeling when she had no dialog and gave the character some heart and soul. Best thing I've ever seen her do so far and I've seen all the current Twilight films, The Runaways and Adventureland. And rounding out the cast were some very familiar faces amongst the dwarfs and since I'm not sure how well their presence is known, I won't mention names except to say they do a great job making these guys lovable with a limited screen time. All in all, a really good fantasy adventure and a nice surprise for those ready for something different till the next superhero flick arrives."
217,"They should have chosen some feminine, more beautiful and charming actress to the leading role, such as Keira Knightley, Natalie Portman Megan Fox, Lily Collins,...Kristen's ""no emotions face"" is boring and she is not even close to beautiful Charlize. I am dissapointed."
218,"In the hands of great writers and skillful directors even Peppa The Pig can become the Terminator we all deserve, so I was eager to see how a famous story for children like Snow White could be reforged into a steel-plated warrior epic.In fact, it was masterfully made into a rusty dagger that stabs you in the heart inflicting maximum pain. Once again, we witness how an awesome cast can be tricked into deep stinking muds of bad decisions. Literally every performance, with a few exceptions, was extremely exaggerated (yes it was a fairy tale at some point, thanks for the reminder) and dark tones or serious moments were ruined by it.The plot? Honestly, the amount of tricks pulled out of the hat could shock David Copperfield. I would even agree for 15-minute training montage, but no, everyone is simply born ready in this universe. The finale is so lousy that I might have find a screenshot of it under ""Lousy"" in the dictionary.The only fine thing I found here is Chris Hemsworth. That Australian devil is created for action, but even a legendary axe swing cannot cut through layers of horrifying stupidity.It could have been such a gem, but if you give an uncut diamond to a monkey there is a high risk of simply destroying it."
219,"Snow White and the Huntsman is another adaptation of the tale of the Brothers Grimm , the film is directed by Rupert Sanders , the cast is very interesting , Kristen Stewart does not compromise the film, she is acceptable , Chris Hemsworth does a reasonable performance , Charlize Theron is the better film, makes good performance , you actually see that it is evil, it is a lot of significant , there has in the cast, Sam Claflin , Sam Spruell , Ian McShane and others, the picture of the film is good , the somber tone works , especially in the scene in the forest, the script is a bit confusing , it is well paced , the action scenes are good , the soundtrack is average , the costume is very good, the edition is good, and the pace of the film is acceptable , Snow White and the Huntsman is a cool movie , has good scenes , a good cast , even with a bit dragged screenplay , and some good performances affected . Note 6.7"
220,"Snow White and the Huntsman is actually a pretty good movie. When I first saw the trailer, I was intrigued by the darker spin of the classic story of Snow White. It was interesting to see the character of Snow White not as the helpless, damsel in distress, but as a strong warrior.Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna, the evil queen, is spine chilling. Her costumes were simply amazing! Chris Hemsworth is cast perfectly as the Huntsman. Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Snow White is not her best, she could have done better. The Dwarfs have their own twist from the original miners and are entertaining to watch.All in all, Snow White and the Huntsman is entertaining. Though this version is more for teens and adults than for small children, as the scene in the Dark Forest may be a bit too scary."
221,"One of two re-tellings of the ""Snow White"" fairy tale to come out this year ""Snow White and the Hunstman"" is a dark, interesting take on the classic story. Instead of portraying Snow White as a damsel in distress, here she is held as a prisoner by the queen and escapes and then must fight back to take a hold of her kingdom. Snow White is played by Kristin Stewart, who is bearable and even, dare I say it, watchable. She isn't given much to say, and at times is still gaping like she does in the ""Twilight"" films, but for the most part, she is fine in the role. Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") is the huntsman, and is also good. There are dwarfs in this one too, of course, and they are light comic relief. The real draw here is Charlize Theron as the wicked queen Ravenna. Theron has never looked more beautiful on screen and turns in a fantastic performance. She is the first star in the film, the other is the cinematography. This is a beautifully shot, very expensive looking film, but it's a great film to look at. The story is compelling, but the lead characters, save for Ravenna, are fairly underdeveloped. This is why this is mostly Theron's movie. It's nice to see a flawed antagonist, as well as an empowered female protagonist. All do their best with the material they are given, and for a directorial debut, Rupert Sanders is an impressive talent. The film is darker than expected, but all in all a very entertaining experience."
222,"The story of Snow White initially introduced by The Brothers Grimm is a classic. And although taking a story and changing some of the key points doesn't always sit well with viewers, but the story of Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) isn't all too bad. Being director Rupert Sanders' first theatrical film, I'll give him credit for making a fairly strong attempt at re-imagining the story of Snow White.There are a lot of great parts to this movie. First of main importance is the acting. From the top to the supporting actors, all have their characters down pat. Chris Hemsworth plays the Huntsman with a rare Scottish accent that is yet to be found in a lot of films. Making him even more enjoyable to listen to is partially due to his deadpan acting, which comes off with sarcastic comments. Kristen Stewart's acting was entertaining as well. Her English accent was performed straightforward with no problems and the look of her on screen is actually quite alluring to say the least. It's also pleasant to see her in a more front-line role where she ""mans"" up and fights for good.As for the queen's role, Charlize Theron was perfectly cast. From the make-up to the costume design, Theron matches the arrangement of that of the queen from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Not to mention, that she's also quite sinister looking. And last but not least are the Dwarfs, the miners who dig for gold. The best thing about these guys is that they provide the audience with comic relief. Sure they don't look as cute as the Disney version but all the same, they were created to please and they do just that.Another great part of this film is the screenplay, kudos to Evan Daugherty as the storywriter. Daugherty not only included the ""apple eating scene"" but also expanded the backgrounds of the huntsman and the queen. This allows the audience to relate more to the characters. Plus, to show how pure Snow White was as a character, they even made her care for the queen. Finally the action and special effects were dazzling. To see an army charge a castle just like in the medieval times was a different way of seeing warfare. How many times does the audience see laser/gun fire or explosions on screen? I'd say more than one would see catapults shooting deathballs of fire and barrages of arrows. It's different and it should be fun to experience every now and then. Not to mention, there is also swordplay, Chris Hemsworth still flinging weapons thinking he was still the mighty Thor and even the Dwarfs take part in some intense action. Those guys can fight! Some of Theron's transformation scenes are also cool to watch. Seeing her change from human form to a flock of crows has to be done with a way that makes it elegant even though she's evil and it's done rather well. And don't forget the Dark Forest scenes! Instead of just having the trees being creepy it actually acts like a hallucinogenic where it's only imaginary but all the same it can be frightening. For music, James Newton Howard composed the soundtrack and it was bold on notes. It sounded nice but I can't recall a main theme. One would think for a movie to be memorable, he'd make a theme.Now, onto the problems. The Plot. It dragged. Many know the story of Snow White, so why did it take so long for it to get going? I'm not sure but that's how it went. Then there was inconsistency. The queen's brother is chasing Snow White and somehow no matter where Snow White seems to go, even after losing him, he finds her within what seems 24 hours! How is this possible? There are no tracking beacons in the time this story takes place! And lastly, is the love interest. It's great to see all these actors in action and playing their parts really well but how did the love interest get left out? Don't we want Snow White to find love? I did and I was hoping one of the characters would've become Snow White's husband but it never occurred. That's frustrating.Evan Daugherty's pacing is weird but his version of Snow White has the action, actors that portray the roles accurately, unique character development and adventurous music."
223,"The movie that went up against Tarsem Singh's Mirror Mirror, challenged the cinematic juggernauts of June, and was the beginning of the current controversy surrounding star Kristen Stewart. Snow White and the Huntsman may be more of an exercise in style over substance, but as a simple action fantasy adventure, it's not bad.The latest adaptation of the fairy tale features Stewart as Snow White, kept prisoner in a tower for years after the uprising of her manipulative stepmother, the queen (Charlize Theron). Snow White manages to escape into the dark forest, and a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is ordered to hunt her down and bring her back to the queen. He instead defies her, training the young Snow White, until the two lead a rebellion against the queen's empire.Look, we have all seen this story a hundred times before, told in many different ways, to the point that we know every turn the plot will take. With all of that in mind, Snow White and the Huntsman still finds this unique darkness in the material. The movie presents itself in a straightforward fashion, not necessarily a bad way to go, it all just depends on execution, and the cast succeed plenty well at that. Kristen Stewart's Snow White finds the right mixture of ferocity and grace. Chris Hemsworth, trading in Thor's hammer for an Axe, gives a surprisingly thoughtful performance, one that mixes well with Stewart.However, it's all really Charlize Theron's show. Her performance as Queen Ravenna is the classic example of an enjoyable, old-school movie villain. She's such an intimidating delight, chewing the scenery and having a blast doing it. And is it just me, or did she seem to channel her Oscar snubbed role in Young Adult a bit? Lastly, the movie is pure eye candy. Rupert Sanders has a keen visual eye, and his sets, costumes, makeup, effects, and photography are all masterful. The sound design is top notch, and composer James Newton Howard finds a seamless balance between bombastic action and restrained elegance.As always, take my opinion with a grain of salt. Not everyone would share it.**** / *****"
224,"The movie is true to the original tales, it looks awesome and is action packed. Bonus; you can watch this with your girlfriend. All in all; a good movie. It has it's holes and mistakes, but if you are able to overlook these, than you will enjoy this movie. The movie is very easy on the eyes, it just looks amazing and magical. The cgi is flawless. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are perfect, and i would like to believe that i wouldn't mind Kristen Stewart playing snow white if i didn't know about twilight. She is pretty, so just rock with it. She plays well, and that's what matters. I believe the negative reviews and votes are just because of her; Kristen Stewart. 50% of the votes come from people who just like to bash on the movie because of her, so for the first time ever, I feel safe to say that you should look past the IMDb rating. Conclusion: Watch this movie on a big screen with good surround, forget the actors previous roles, and enjoy the spectacular tale of Snow White and the Huntsman!"
225,"This movie completely rewrites the snow white story, but retains several key objects, like an evil queen, a mirror on the wall, snow white, seven dwarfs, poison apple, ...Plot wise, plot holes are all over the place. So, if you can't stand movies with plot holes, you don't want to see this. To enjoy this movie, you just have to put your common sense on hold.What the movie does well is the special effects. The most interesting, and perhaps the first, is to shrink seven actors into dwarf sizes. They are the best and most naturally looking movie dwarfs.I think Charlize Theron would look better as snow white. They should reverse the roles of the two main actresses. The age issue can be easily fixed with computer graphics. This would create even more controversy and therefore more publicity.Most of the movies are fairly interesting, except one or two scenes where people talk on and on. Those can be easily skipped.The most disappointing part is there is no ""making of the dwarfs"" on the DVD. I really want to know how it's done.Overall it is an enjoyable movie. Now make another fairy tale like this!"
226,"Earlier this year, Mirror Mirror was released as the comedic twist on the classic fairy tale, meant more for children. It wasn't very good. Then a few months back was released Snow White and the Huntsman, a more dark twist on the classic fairy tale. This was a lot better.It does have its flaws though. What really annoyed me in the movie was that the movie seemed to rip off several parts of other films. Some of the battle scenes are similar to Lord of the Rings, I called the queen's castle Hogwarts, the faries looked like the aliens from Galaxy Quest, and I swear to God, there were Dementors in this movie. Also the movie has quite a few dumb moments. I saw this movie with some friends, and we were riffing at quite a bit of the movie. Also the action scenes aren't that interesting, they keep my attention, but I was actually more interested in the story than the action, which I didn't think I would say.But it looks nice, the CG is good and the cinematography is very well done. It's a very nice movie to look at. The acting is...good. Kristen Stewert and Liam Hemsworth do their jobs, but the one who stole the show was Charlece Therone as the Evil Queen, she is so over the top that it's hard not to enjoy how evil she is. It can be funny at times, I actually laughed more at the dwarfs in this movie than Mirror Mirror. And I really like the dark way they made this fairy tale. Snow White isn't a damsel in distress, she's a tough ass worrior.Snow White and the Huntsman was good, not amazing. It has it's share of stupid moments, and it rips off several other movies, sometimes blatantly. But the story is cool and it has a very over the top villain, so I say it's worth a watch."
227,"So tired of wicked movies of the latest movie productions. No directorial talents, too much wickedness, evil. Actresses overplay, or underplay, too much ugliness, complete waste of money and time. No humor, no talent story telling, no good acting.."
228,"I can't for the life of me figure out what this movie wanted with its main characters. Hemsworth's huntsman and Theron's queen are reasonably fleshed out and interesting, but the others, including Snow White and William, are given virtually no character development, and as a result fail to engage at all.
If some of the frankly ridiculously huge amount of screen time given to the (admittedly good) special effects had been spent on character interactions, this might have been worthwhile.
As it is, at the end, you're left wondering what the point of it all was, and vaguely wishing you could have the time spent watching this massively unsatisfactory movie returned to you."
229,"Without such an insipid and sour lead, this would have really been a great movie. Truly standout performances by Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth as well as pretty much ever other actor. Actually, then can all act, except for the lead. And I guess we all know why she was cast. WIth perhaps two facial expressions and an awful speaking voice, it's such a shame that she ruined a pretty good movie. Suffering through her speech to the army on the eve of battle made us all realise she has no vocal range, no voice, no tone, no facial expressions at all. If only they could have done this film without her."
230,"Kristen Stewart is just awful from start to finish, her acting is so blund and has no impact on your emotions or anything. The last 20 minutes are just boring and you feel like not watching furture, beginning with the horrible speech scene. Kristen Stewart just walks out while she was presumed to be dead, and gives the worst i have ever seen, it is uninspiring and cringy. The evil queen however has great motives and is overall well balanced as a character. But as a story itself this movie is forgettable and blund."
231,"Would have given this more stars but Kristen Stewart is a horrible actress! everything else about this film was great, its just too bad she had to be in it. i dont know why anyone cast her in films, but please STOP!!!!!$"
232,"As with the maleficent, the attempt to transform the innocent fairytale into a dark form, with all sorts of old foibles and even the poisonous apple copied from the original, is inevitably dull. Adaptation of fairy tales that people have long known is a thankless task, loyal to the original rather fall into the cliche, bold changes will destroy the preconceived impression of childhood, so the major directors and screenwriters or better, don't overextend themselves to their own shame."
233,"This is not too bad, the first time I saw it I was a bit underwhelmed, and did not think it that good, maybe I was expecting more ? But after a second viewing I liked it more. Possibly the true statement is somewhere between the two. It was good but should have been better.The action scenes were great, but most other things were a bit average, with these types of movie you need a bit up and down, like a rollercoaster, but this was more of a tram ride, going along at almost the same level throughout. Not to dreary and not too exciting. Modern film-makers seem to have lost some of the techniques that the older ones used to have.The acting was ok, nothing special though, Charlize Theron lent her incredible beauty to the evil role and played it rather well, Kristen Stewart was good as Snow White, but not great, she is a young actress so has not developed the skills to be a great yet but she is on her way. Chris Hemsworth plays well to his limited abilities as the meathead, and the supporting cast do ok, no worse than the stars anyway. The cameos played by British actors as the Dwarves are good, Bob Hoskins in his last film whilst he had Parkinson's Disease, Ian McShane, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and Eddie Marsan all lend a touch of class.The Director seems to be playing it safe though, too safe, not taking many risks and relying on CGI, it still looks good, the photography is excellent, but the screenplay is not great so leaving the end result a little bland.I have seen the sequel, and I think that is a little better than this. However it is worth watching just to see Charlize Theron and the Brit Actors."
234,Why did the makers of the film think to have Chris Hemsworth to have such a terrible Scottish accent. He has a fantastic voice so they should have stayed with that. I could not watch the whole of the movie because of that
235,"Pretty horrible. One of those movies I finished watching only to see if some major plot twist was bound to happen.
Great cast but the overall acting was poorly done and part of the story was left unexplained.I do not recommend this to anyone except you do not have any more movies to watch in the history of cinema"
236,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we follow the fairytale of Snow White but from a different perspective. Snow White is going be killed into the woods by the Huntsman but everything changes as he is becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to win once and for all the Evil Queen.I didn't like so much this movie because it had a boring plot and the direction wasn't the best. Despite the very good cast, I believe that the actors didn't reach their potential and they could do better than this. The direction which was made by Rupert Sanders was average with not many things to show. The interpretations of Kristen Stewart who played as Snow White, Chris Hemsworth who played as the Huntsman and Charlize Theron who played as the Evil Queen Ravenna weren't as good as I was expecting from all these actors.Finally, I have to say that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" isn't the worst movie to watch just not the best. It has some good scenes but don't expect much from it because you are going to be let down by it and after watching it you will think that you wasted two hours from your lives."
237,"Anyone expecting King Lear or Hamlet performances in a film like this, have come to the wrong shop. That said, there could have been a bit more life ... or identifiable emotion or some sort ... in about half the closeups we get of Kristen Stewart. Regardless of what she was supposed to be looking at, an evil queen, a dwarf, a mudsplattered huntsman, a monster troll, a magical elk-dear thing that looked like Harry Potter's patronus, she had the same expression: nothing. OK, true, with a CGI drowned fairy tale adventure/cliffhanger movie, you can't expect much. But it might have been fun if Snow White had possessed something onscreen that would have had some sass, intelligence, or pizzazz. Script wise, there are some head scratchers and inconsistencies. Maybe this was a result of editing? Having to make room for long action sequences (a thundering calvalry charge which seemed so enless and seemed to keep starting back at the same point, made me think of something similar in, I think, some Monty Python bit ... maybe in MP and the Holy Grail ... or am I just confusing it with some other endless thing with a knight running with a cocoanut clicking sidekick?). And one big, huge, absolute fail: how it was only upon learning he'd been tricked, did the Huntsman suddenly go from drunken, sullen, would-be murderer to brave, focused hero protector. Huh??? That's quite a sea change, even for a script where logic and continuity takes second place. Character development isn't in this film. But ... should it be? Maybe not. Maybe it's just a fun, popcorn chomper. Yet ... might have been more of a pure entertainment, without the acting and plot leaps, leaping out from time to time. The cinematic magic on this one just barely works."
238,"The main problem with this film is the sound editing (it's either too quiet or too loud) and the length of it. The director didn't do a great job at controlling the editing of this film, there are unnecessarily long scenes from every perspective possible, it would have been much better if they didn't want to make it this long and edited around 30 or 40 minutes out of the film.I wasn't very pleased with Charlize Theron's acting (funny everyone's bashing Kristen Stewart when Theron was basically a screeching harpy the whole time instead of properly doing her job, her character was also unformed and bad instead of being sophisticated and badass - what she should have been).The cinematography is nice and the music is okay. I think the screenplay wasn't bad, either. I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would, but it was awfully long. I'll give it a 7."
239,"I have really enjoyed most of the movie. The story line is interesting. Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin etc. really did their parts great. The CGI is pretty good, and I would totally recommend the movie to anyone if there wasn't just one thing...Kirsten Stewart. Like really? Is that really the best person they could pick for the movie? She completely ruined it for me. Her emotions are never right in the scene, it looks like she's still playing Bella from Twilight. I didn't believe any word she said in the movie. I just keep wondering if anyone ever told her at least to take some acting classes, if not to quit acting because she literally has no clue about what she is doing.I look forward to the next part though, Kirsten is out, so it should be what this movie had potential to be."
240,"I actually liked this movie and thought it had a good story, well acted for the most part and amazingly good special effects. However a few things spoil it and stop it being the great film it could have been. Firstly casting. When Charlize Theron asks 'Mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest etc' the mirror is never going to say Snow White as she is just not beautiful enough. Sorry Kristen Stewart is OK, she IS attractive in a way but not stunning. Ellen Paige would have been a better choice and I agree what others say about Kristen Stewart's two front teeth being off putting and I wouldn't normally criticise anyone's looks but she is supposed to be stunning, that is the whole point of Snow White after all. However Raffey Cassidy did a good job as the young Snow White.The other problem is the Dwarfs, some were clearly not only full size actors, but pretty famous one's at that and that was off putting as I couldn't get past the 'how are they making Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone look small. I agree with Warwick Davis that they could have and should have used small actors for those roles.The film a mix of adult fairy tale and Vampire type movie, the Queen based on Erszebet Bathory, a 17th-century Hungarian potentate who allegedly consumed and bathed in the blood of murdered young girls in an attempt to rejuvenate herself. It is dark and not a film for young children but I will say it is watchable and not as bad as some have said it is. (In my opinion)I also think that the ending could have been better."
241,"I had my doubts about this movie (only based on my view of Kristen's acting); however, I was pleasantly surprised. Why so? Well, Kristen actually had very few lines so I the accent she would need to adopt to pull this off and the enhancement in acting skills she would also need didn't need to be so prominent and it worked. Her most lengthy speech happened as she rallied the people to invade the castle with her after her slumber. Also, I cringed at the thought of Kristen taking on an 'action' role; however, she didn't do lots of fighting and, the fighting she did do, they did not make it extraordinary. Most times, she was getting her ass dusted which is much more realistic than seeing her suddenly become a femme fatale. I do think there could have been more 'in between' certain scenes but the effects were great and the movie was good. It also, to me, didn't truly finalize in the end somewhat hinting to a love triangle if you will which I always hate (the opening endings, I mean)."
242,"In the end, the task of this live-action retelling of the Disney animated classic improving on the original proved too much for this ambitious but flawed production. Instead of the tuneful, fun-filled fluffy-lightness of Miss White and her seven dwarfs, this time our heroine is garbed like Joan Of Arc and labours against the dark forces of her Wicked Stepmother, who barely five minutes into the story has bedded, wedded and dead-ed her dad the King, taken over his kingdom and locked her up well out of sight. However it's not too long before she resourcefully frees herself by tricking the Evil Queen's villainous brother and is uniting with familiar characters from the old story, namely the huntsman of the title and the title-usurped dwarfs to revenge her dad, win the trust of her people and of course at the climax challenge her nemesis in a classic good versus evil match-up.It's all very far removed from old Walt's sentimental vision so much so that at times you forget the source story until assorted reminders flit across the screen, most notably the mirror on the wall, the poisoned apple and of course the seven or is that eight dwarfs who take a long time to turn up. More obviously aimed at gaming teenagers and adults than young children, there's no ""Hey-Ho-ing here, and the dwarfs even get different names to boot, although I did like the brief off-hand but humorous way this link was dispatched by one of their number.The effects are probably the best thing about the film especially the various and varied metamorphoses which occur. Charleze Theron is very good as the vainglorious queen, but at no time in the movie, in my opinion, did Kristen Stewart look fairer than her, a case of the mirror needing glasses I'd say. Chris Hemsworth reels off a strange part Scottish, part Middle Earth accent and for my money works better with a hammer in his hand rather than a sword.Shot in muted greyish tones to point up the muddy, bloody realism, the film has good crowd scenes and action sequences but otherwise the direction for me lacks the epic sweep of a Peter Jackson to fully reinvent this age-old story. In the end, the film tries hard but just Disney convince as it should."
243,"Snow White and the Huntsman (2012): Dir: Rupert Sanders / Cast: Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin, Lily Cole: Here is the year's second Snow White adaptation and this is far more exciting than the cutesy misfire Mirror Mirror. This one regards the alliance between Snow White and the Huntsman sent to track her down. She was born of purity but when her mother fell ill and died, another entered the King's life but she had black magic and murder on the mind. The kingdom was conquered and Princess Snow White was made a prisoner until we see her again as a teenager locked in a cell. The evil Queen desires her heart for immortality but cannot simply kill her. Directional debut for Rupert Sanders who is backed with exquisite visual wonders of giant castles, the creepy ominous dark forest, the enchanted forest filled with pixies, fairies and ultimately seven dwarfs. Kristen Stewart plays a bold Snow White who makes a daring escape into the dark forest but her triumph in the climax is botched due to the Huntsman training her, and ultimately informing viewers how she will defeat the Queen. The seven dwarfs aren't even recognizable given their lack of reference to the original dwarfs of the 1937 classic animation. Charlize Theron plays a menacing Queen who drains virgins of their youth in order to retain her own. Other roles are not so lucky and are given in for the special effects. Sam Claflin as archer William is given background but no payoff. While ending lacks satisfaction this is still a thrilling and enchanting visual adaptation. Score: 7 ¬Ω / 10"
244,"i will be shortKristen Stewart is a terrible ""Actress"". i don't even think you can call her flat non emotional ""performace"" acting!the Effects was good, the bad witch was actually performing amazingly, but for God's name Do not pay a ticket for this one!the Director or the Writer must have serious problems they didn't do anything prototype, they messed up with the fairy tale, they had useless dialogs, and scenes SO boring that absolutely nothing was going on!the is the Worst mix i have ever seen in my entire life for a Hollywood movie: a bad mix of: Joan D' Arc Lord Of the Rings Alice in Wonderland Original SnowWhite King Arthour or Excalibur.i lost 2 hours of my life.if you are a boy and your GF or Wife force you to go an see that, i strongly warn you, you will think its interesting in the begging but after 30min, you will want to kill your self!"
245,"Saw it at a free preview last night in a packed house in DC. The film's a bit hokey in places (people laughed in supposedly serious moments), had really bad camera work (herky-jerky style, and action scenes shot way too close up), and had a fairly slow-moving plot (lots of cell phone checking for time/texts at around the 35 and 90 minute marks) from my view in the back.The special effects are very cool, but are somewhat ruined by the bad camera work--there was so much going on, too close up, that it was hard to focus on anything.Theron vamps and camps it up plenty, and Hemsworth kept losing track of which accent to use. Though he's definitely hot...scruffy and yummy! The dwarfs were the best parts--hilarious looking and great lines. Great to see these famous British actors being these tough, but hilarious-looking dwarfs.Some fun twists on the Disney story, but overall just so-so. Glad I didn't pay for it."
246,"I had a hard time staying awake for this movie... The writing was terrible and so was the acting... I think they did a good job having Kristen Stewart not open her mouth a lot but this had straight to DVD written all over it, other than some early 2000 special effects that were pretty decent. This is honestly the first review I'm writing because it doesn't deserve to have 4 stars let alone 6 ... If the director wasn't so busy cheating on his wife, he could have made a better movie and now I'm seeing that it's rumored for sequel, I rather watch another Tyler Perry movie than this garbage... I'm rambling on cause you want 10 lines on a garbage movie that I can't really describe because everything is wrong with it... Surprisingly Thor didn't do so bad but everyone else was just dreadful even Charlize Theron which I think is a decent actress..."
247,"The movie takes every good memory you have of the snow white fairy tale and kills it. Kristen Stewart as expected isn't very good in the movie. Her best acting scenes are when she is breathing really hard, which happens to be every other moment: when she is being crowned, when she is fighting, meeting the large reindeer thingy, etc etcThe evil queen is extremely boring and has no other importance to the movie apart from just being evil.The plot of the movie is also pathetic. Its just a sequence of scenes that are held loosely by our own memory of the snow white story rather than anything that is happening in the movie. And after Twilight ( I didn't watch the movie but I have a general idea)does Kirsten Stewart always have to do movies where is confused between two guys"
248,"Mirror mirror, which is the worst movie in 2012? Definitely ""Snowhite and the huntsman"". First of all, it longs about two hours. The story of the movie doesn't encourages you to keep watching, in fact, I went to the bathroom a few times because I didn't want to watch that awful movie. It's the typical story of snowhite, but with an addition of drama. Or what they think it's drama. The movie tells a sad story about snow white, but it wasn't sad at all. It also tries to add funny parts, but they don't make anybody laugh. 175,000,000 dollars for this? The movie was a great mistake. I recommend you NOT to watch it, unless you are a teen girl and love fantasy stories."
249,"I knew this wasn't going to be a great movie considering how Kristen Stewart was starring in the film, but I had hoped that Hemsworth and Theron would have been able to salvage whatever Stewart ruined. Unfortunately, I hadn't banked on the fact that the director was going to be the worse copycat of epic directors ever found in existence. Oh, the screenplay probably didn't help either.The movie attempted to cram every good aspect of great epic films into one 2 hour storyline. In trying to achieve this, the movie lost all sense of continuity - both between scenes and within individual story lines. No single aspect of the film received enough attention and development. That was flaw #1. Flaw #2 was the overuse of technology and special effects to wreck havoc on my senses. The sound was amplified in all the wrong moments, especially in scenes in the dark forest where the flora and fauna were introduced by having everything lurch out at us. Combined with the increased volume, those scenes were enough to give me several heart attacks. The music was also too loud and rarely conveyed the right emotions for the scenes it was reinforcing. In addition, the camera work during all the action scenes were horrid. I couldn't ever follow what was happening because the camera jumped frantically from person to person flying through movements too quickly for me to comprehend what had occurred before moving on to the next action sequence.And let's not forget the lead actress's acting (or lack of) abilities. Stewart's inability to produce more than two facial expressions pained my eyes - I had to look away from the screen more than once to prevent myself from screaming in frustration inside the theater. And just as she possesses only two expressions, Stewart similarly only possesses two volumes - at least in speech. When not speaking, Stewart filled the silence with constant grunting and heavy breathing. To be honest, I don't know if it was worse watching her in ""silent"" scenes or in speaking ones. She completely blundered her epic motivational scene at the end by emphasizing (with one of her two volumes) the wrong words. Of course, the writing certainly didn't help with it's completely nonsensical string of what seemed, at first glance, to be real life sentences until further investigation realized the illogical formation of words for what they were.The only reason this movie has more than 1 star is because of Theron's brilliant acting as the evil queen. The concept of this movie had great potential, but unfortunately, was put in the wrong hands to be produced. What a shame."
250,"Snow White and the Huntsman is the second film this year to retell the circumstances surrounding the conflict between Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and her evil queen step-mother Ravenna (Charlize Theron), who was portrayed frighteningly. I'll get back to her in a moment. This was a much smarter and sleeker take on the fairy tale than Mirror Mirror, and it was absolutely not a Charming story. Actually, it just didn't seem as if there was a, to die for love happening with Snow and the Prince (Sam Clafin) and the poison apple curse breaking kiss had an unexpected twist. This is the first time I can recall of the queen having any relatives, so I was surprised to find that she has a creepy brother. The dwarfs had exotic names like Duir (Eddie Marsan), Beith (Ian Mcshane) and Muir (Bob Hoskins), there were no Sleepy, Dopey or Doc and I was amazed at how full sized men ( Mr. Hoskins is slightly diminutive) all appeared as dwarfs. Which brings me to the stellar special effects, the landscapes were beautiful and had a feel of The Lord of the Rings films, the magic mirror melted into form much like what is seen in Terminator 2, and the Troll well you get the point. There were some cool special effects, unfortunately they were all shown in the trailer and in other films. Not that borrowing from good special effects is a bad thing because it's not. So now back to Ravenna and my original comparison of this film with Mirror Mirror. That queen was a bit naughty, here the queen is downright malevolent. Ms. Theron is truly a gifted actress and she was definitely the queen of mean. The effects used for her appearance were amazingly transformative. I did find it a bit curious that the opening scenes of the film were covered by a narrator, when there was really no reason for the narration. The narration did help in understanding the amount of time that passed prior to King Magnus (Noah Huntley) making Ravenna his bride and gives insight into the benefit of a long engagement. All the scenes stood on their own so I suppose that is why the final scenes had no narration, although I thought if you begin with a narrator you should end with one. There were some flaws, but I will watch anything with Chris Hemsworth (Huntsman) in it. I give it a dark forest green light."
251,"In one day I watched both Mirror Mirror and this adaption of Snow White. Both interesting movies. Both had very good effects but one left me bored!This in no means is a bad movie, just a very sluggish, drawn out, sleep inducing epic. I think the story telling in part was spot on and very close to the original story, it had an interesting twist to the old fairy tale which I grew up with.One of the main things I did like about this movie was the hidden romance, it was not too much in your face and so you did not have to face endless kissing etc - Just focus on the story ahead....but.....it just dragged on, this was just so not working for me, it made me lose interest fast as it seemed to lose traction in parts and even worse was the unexplained speed of how people seemed to find Snow White, this is after a long drawn out chase which seemed to be hours but magically they went away and found here in just what seemed to be a matter of minutes in a way.Charlize Theron plays an amazing villain and plays the part amazingly well, I give extra points just for her performance, top class acting. The twist of her taking the form of her childhood sweetheart was again top class effects and made for a great twist to the story for me.The 7 dwarfs were a bit of a let down, really but that is just me picking at bits, prefer the Mirror Mirror version in regards to the dwarfs - esp Wolf (wow!!!)Anyway, that is my 2 pennies...."
252,"Kristen Stewart need to take some acting classes. If her movies didn't revolve around sexy guys she'd been out of work. First this movie left a lot to be desired a lot left unsaid and undid.The ending wasn't wrapped up to tight. She just can't act to me, and even if she did know how to act the directors left loose ends. She reunited with her childhood friend and just was like OK. What happen at the end with the huntsman, did she even know who woke her out the sleep. whatever. I want my money back. The queen was very original. she rarely showed any emotions. And when she did it did'not come out right.I really felt cheated."
253,This review may contain spoilersso i have been wanting to see this for a couple months being the fairy tail lover that i am but had to wait to see it wasn't as bad as everyone is saying but its not a top pick movie in my book.so it starts off with a narrator telling the basic story line of snow white i had a feeling they would do that as in most fairy tail movies they start off that way. i liked the first 10 minutes but the rest of the movie was just a bore for me. i really was hoping that the huntsman and snow would fall in love but i saw no connections between the two or the prince they throw in (the movie would have been the same with out him) and it may have been because of the actresses / actors I'm not one to bash people or their skills but it was hard to even get a feel of the characters they played but i cant just put it all on them the story line was just a flat line its hard to get a feel of any character if the the plot is lacking. it seemed like they were just taking parts from other movies and trying to make it work like the stag scene i mean come on has any one seen princess mononoke and the battle speech i have seen it in so many movies and it wasn't even a good one .... and the ending was ... i was hoping that maybe just maybe they could try to show some form of a love connection with snow and the huntsman when they showed her looking around the room i think she was supposed to be looking for huntsman and they would tell there love but all i saw was a girl who looked like she was lost and didn't want to be there so all in all i wont be watching it again but if your just looking for a movie to watch and have no real expectation about it then maybe you will like it
254,"Snow White and the Huntsman is director Rupert Sanders' first feature film, and the second take on classic fairy tale Snow White this year, following family friendly Mirror Mirror in March. Its cast include Kristen Stewart, famous for her FANTASTIC performances in the Twilight saga (not very subtle sarcasm there), as titular female heroine Snow White, Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers, The Cabin in the Woods) as ""The Huntsman"" and Charlize Theron (Monster, North Country, Prometheus) as the Evil Queen. It also stars Sam Claflin and Sam Spruell (Pirates of the Caribbean 4 and The Hurt Locker respectively) in human roles as Snow's second love interest William and The Queen's brother Finn. The dwarfs are played by a host of well-known and talented actors including Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Nick Frost, Ray Winstone and real-life dwarf Toby Jones. The dark tone is very different from other Snow White tales.Based rather on the Brothers Grimm German 1812 fairy tale 'Snow White' rather than Disney's 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Snow White and the Huntsman follows child Snow White who witnesses stepmother Ravenna lead an evil army into her father's castle and kill her father. She is then locked in a tower for years until she escapes into the Dark Forest where she encounters many strange things. Finn and Ravenna recruit Eric, a drunken widower who has survived the Dark Forest, to retrieve Snow White. However they join forces and start a rebellion against The Queen.I was very excited for this film when I saw the announcement trailer, and then even more pumped when I saw the second full trailer. Kristen Stewart was limited to only a few words, Chris Hemsworth was carrying on proving what a good actor he was, Charlize Theron looked awesome as an evil villain and the whole thing looked dark and full of action. However, not all of these came true in the actual movie. Kristen Stewart was barely better than she was in Twilight, however at least she didn't have the annoying Bella characteristics such as um, you know, uh, like *fiddles with hair* uh *makes pained expression* um, like, JACOB! Anyway, Chris Hemsworth was awesome, sharing almost as much screen time as Stewart and taking away some of her dialogue and non-existent expressions. Charlize Theron was also very dark, proving to be an imposing and great villain. However, the action scenes were VERY limited, with only one even exciting one-at the climax! The rest were quick, limited and Shaki-Cam'd to death. The majority of scenes in the second act, after Eric doesn't capture Snow White, were boring, often soppy and CGI'd to death. There was an abundance of CGI here, from the pointless 15-second troll scene to the miniature Gollum fairies. The dwarf scenes were all quite boring and I am proud to say that Sam Clafin should never do an acting job again. Seriously, this guy is up there with Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson. Overall, the main second act felt too Twilight- ish, a couple of performances were too Twilight-ish, the action scenes before the climactic one were too Twilight-ish, the CGI was too Twilight-ish and even the script was sometimes a bit Twilight-ish. However, Theron and Hemsworth were great, it normally felt suitably dark and James Newton Howard's score was good also."
255,"Don't be fooled by the nifty trailer like I was! I usually pick good movies to watch, this time however, I picked a really - really - bad one in Snow white and the Huntsman.I am at a loss for words, it is that bad. Halfway through the movie, my friends turned to me, hissing that I wasn't allowed to pick a movie again for the rest of the year as punishment for choosing this.Kirsten is delivering the same facial expression during the whole movie, with the exception for one smile (I think it was a smile, could also be a need for the bathroom) and I really did look. She's not a convincing actress at all, but hey, Charlize Theron on the other hand is not bad at all, and Hemsworth is actually pretty damn good.But dear heavens, the movie is utter crap. Believe me, you do not want to see this one. To compare it to LOTR like some have done, is close to blasphemy, and if your significant other wants you to come see this? Don't.Stand your ground. You won't even feel up for kissing afterwards, the only thing you'll do is cry over how bad the movie was. So no win."
256,"Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)** (out of 4) 2012 will be the year of Snow White as here comes the fourth version of the classic tale behind MIRROR MIRROR as well as two direct-to-DVD releases. This one here features Kristen Stewart playing Snow White who gets thrown from her kingdom by the wicked Queen (Charlize Theron) who is in need of her youth. Soon a Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is called upon to capture Snow White but when he understands what is going on he decides to join forces with her. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is a pretty looking film but there's really no meat on its bones and in the end we're left with a rather lifeless production that has some good stuff but in the end the film is just downright dull. There are quite a few problems with the picture but we can start with the casting. Stewart has proved herself to be a good actress and her work in stuff like THE RUNAWAYS have proved this but sadly she's miscast here. That dark, laid back approach works perfectly in TWILIGHT but here is just boring and it's quite obvious that this Snow White couldn't lead an ant colony let alone a kingdom. Not for a second did I believe Stewart in the role and the lack of a personality here really went against everything the character was. Theron isn't much better as the Queen. It's really hard to believe the type of performance she gives here because she goes so over-the-top that it reaches a level of where you just want to scream with how annoying the performance is. I'm not sure why Theron decided to scream so much but it really didn't do anything. Hemsworth is the one saving grace here and he actually delivers a good performance and makes much more of his role than what was on the pages. Sam Claflin isn't too bad as William but he shares no chemistry with Stewart. The CGI effects are actually pretty good here and especially the stuff dealing with the mirror as well as another scene where we see the Queen crawl out of some black tar. I also thought the scenery was quite great including the black forest and the beautiful green lands. The images here are much better than any bit of the story and that's a real shame. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is pretty to look at but sadly there's just no emotional connection to any of the characters. Worse of all is the fact that the film really drags in spots and for an action movie it's one of the most boring I've seen in a while."
257,"Because I could do so much better. They always have so much potential and then go downhill. The love story? Made no sense to me... How did he love her as much as he loved his dead wife... after 2 days and the, I don't know, 5 things they said to each other. Kristen Stewart made me so uncomfortable... people would talk to her and she would just stare at them, say absolutely nothing. It was so awkward. And her lines... consisted of, oh wait, she didn't have lines, she just breathed heavily. I hate her. The evil queen was the only good part about the movie, oh and I liked the dwarfs and one of the songs a dwarf sang. Anyway, point is... I want to re-write this movie cause it could have been so good, and it wasn't."
258,"OK, not everything was terrible, the beginning of the film was pretty good, it had me hooked.Charlize Theron was amazing, and she gets more beautiful every time I see her again, her performance was flawless and realistic and all in all the best aspect of the film.Chris Hemsworth was pretty good too, I could totally believe his character and while it's true his character was not meant to be very deep he managed to bring some life to it.That is all the praise this film gets from me... the story had a lot of potential, but it fails to deliver.Stewart is AWFUL! I know she was obviously cast to bring the Twilight audience with her, but she is just so bad it hurts. She looks like a recovering drug addict all the time, there's no emotion other than depression from her and seems like Bella just changed costumes...The movie is filled with clich√©s, it seems like they made a list of all the obvious elements the movie had to have and just filled in the blanks with whatever popped into their heads at the moment.I was truly p****d off by the time she delivered her ""speech"" to rally the troops...I mean CMON! Braveheart had the perfect speech, but other than that no other movie has ever managed to pull it off without coming off as a knock off...(well.. except Gladiator i think) and the fact that the speech was delivered by an ""emo"" Snow White certainly didn't help.A waste of a great idea...P.S. damn...I didn't know Snow White was a catholic..."
259,"So I hit the theaters on Friday to watch this film which I had been dying to see. But it pains me to say that it promised too much yet delivered too little. I had seen the posters and the trailer, and was struck with awe. It was time for a different take on Disneyland fairy tales. Gone are the days where the damsel in distress had to be saved by the prince in shining armor. The moment I saw Snow White in armor and charging into battle on a horse, I realized I had found the ideal woman. She is the epitome and the culmination of grace, beauty, wisdom and courage. She is the heroine princess ‚Äì the Joan of Arc of Disney.What are really my frustrations about the movie? To begin with, I felt that the movie, which ran for a little over two hours, felt dragging at times. Halfway through the movie, I heard someone say, ""It's taking too long..."" And that's just what I felt throughout the entire movie. I felt like I was always waiting for something to happen but which never does. For example, near the end of the movie, when Snow White and her band of armies were going to battle, it made you feel like some epic war was waiting to unfold - a battle filled with the sound of steel on steel and the sight of blood and tears. Everything seemed to be all set for the climax, only to slowly and painfully fade away like a deflated balloon. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was pretentious. The trailers, sneak peeks and posters made you feel like you were going to watch Peter Jackson's version of Snow White. It had too many similarities to ""The Lord of the Rings"" to the point that it becomes clich√©d.I felt as if Rupert Sanders, the man at the helm of this movie, was trying too hard to combine all the good elements of the Lord of the Rings, Robin Hood and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. What he achieves instead is a mishmash-ed pastiche of what could have been a really great movie. Here are some examples of ""cut and paste"" scenes from other movies:1.) William, the son of the Duke of Hammond, wields a bow and arrow like Robin of Locksley. 2.) When Snow White was running away from the evil Queen's brother and his minions in the Dark Forest, it reminded me of Arwen running away from the Nazgul to protect the poisoned Frodo. 3.) The armors looked like they were going into battle with Aragorn against Sauron and his allies. 4.) The scenes where Snow White, the Huntsman, William and the dwarfs were journeying through the mountains on their way to the Duke of Hammond's fortress are reminiscent of the Fellowship's journey to Mordor. 5.) The evil Queen at her tower surrounded by circling crows reminds us of Saruman in his high tower. 6.) The symbol on Snow White's shield looks like the White Tree of Gondor. 7.) A tree troll, but a nastier version of an Ent. Its appearance made us feel like it was going to crop up later in the movie, perhaps to fight alongside Snow White. But it never did. The tree troll was going to kill the Huntsman in their encounter in the Dark Forest. But Snow White's take on Gandalf's ""Thou shall not pass"" halts the troll. They face off. The troll grunts angrily, then cowers his head after a few seconds and storms off frustrated, leaving the audience even more frustrated of not knowing exactly what Snow White did to that poor thing. And just as soon as Snow White breathes a sigh of relief, the Huntsman reprimands her and says, ""I told you to run away."" To which Snow White replies, ""If I did, you would have been dead."" This takes us to another of my criticisms about this movie. The horrible script is dull and lacked the necessary punch. For example, Snow White's words right after she kills the evil Queen are, ""You can never take my heart,"" referring to the fact that the evil Queen wanted to take her pure heart to gain immortality. Such script is both UNNECESSARY and WEAK.There is so much lacking in the movie. There was not enough romance, drama, action and comedy. A few positive points about the movie though:1.) Eye candy. Chris Hemsworth. Enough said. For the boys, Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. 2.) Satisfactory CG effects ‚Äì fairies, troll, mysterious white stag (I know not where he fits exactly in the story), flora and fauna at the ""Sanctuary"", and just the right dose of fantasy. (A side note here: When Snow White wakes up in the forest and follows the fairies, one of the dwarfs says, ""He's here."" Now this reminded me a little bit of the Chronicles of Narnia. And sure enough, that scene where she encounters the stag feels like we are meeting Aslan again. And perhaps a little bit of Harry Potter, too. The stag was, after all, the Patronus that saved Harry when he was surrounded by the Dementors in the forest.) 3.) The performance of the cast. God knows they put in their best effort for this film. But what more can they do with such a boring script and lackluster direction? Because even the good points could not compensate for all the bad.I won't be surprised if the movie doesn't perform well in terms of revenues, but hopefully not for the sake of the cast and crew."
260,"This movie had all the elements to be great, but had little to offer in the way of depth, like the actors, save for Charlize Theron, were just going through the motions. The pace seemed off, the story bordered on a parody. Even during the action scenes, I was bored.Kristen Stewart played again the only character she has in her repertoire, but I am not sure had a different actress played Snow White, if it would have been enough to save the film. The best part of the film was the faerie scenes.Seems Hollywood has yet to get right a live-action version of Snow White. The best one still is Snow White: A Tale of Terror."
261,"Snow White and the Huntsman is Alice in Wonderland all over again. The effects, the music, the sets, and the whole concept in fact are amazing, wonderful, astonishing! If that's good enough for you, then you'll enjoy the movie, just like I did.Now, in order to be a great movie, a classic-never-forgetting one, it has to have that spark that makes you want that the good ones win; that spark is the responsible of the hold-on-tight moments of actions and ""epic"" moments. Well, guess what? No spark! I never really felt like I knew or liked the characters. I'm going to be honest with myself, I only liked the Huntsman because it was Chris Hemsworth. Charlize Theron is amazing as the Queen and I kinda just wanted her to win because at least she knew who she was. Kristen was flat the whole movie, no expressions, felt like she was uncomfortable the whole time.The story could have been a great adaptation if only they knew how to connect the scenes. There were sometimes where I just asked myself when did something happened or why? So many useless scenes, also. So, overall: something watchable if you got nothing else to do; no deep in characters, no great-amazing story, just pure astonishing cinematography."
262,"I'm so glad I went to see this movie, was such an incredible, breath- taking, brilliant film, which is definitely a must watch film! I definitely recommend this film, I loved it from the first minute. The movie had such a great storyline, with a brilliant set up and cast, I'm defs gonna buy this when it is in stores. I would've rated it a 10 stars but my only negative comment, I guess you could say that, is it when for around 2 and half to 3 hours. Other than that, it was a great film, it is definitely a must watch film, and I'm going to watch it again! it is worth the time, and the day off work, school or on the weekend. :)"
263,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film! The key is to understand that this is an INTERPRETATION of Snow White. Princesses are not supposed to be sing-song la-dee-dah perfect. This movie portrays a princess that is strong, compassionate, and realistic. I think Kristen Stewart played the role well. It did not bother me that she was untrusting or somewhat dull--you would be too if you saw your parents murdered and was locked up in a dungeon your whole life. Chris was unbearably hot. The cinematography was EXCELLENT. Some scenes were reminiscent of my favourite film, Pan's Labyrinth (watch for the cutest tortoise you will EVER see). I enjoyed the subtle symbolisms and hidden metaphors. This is a beautiful piece of artwork and should only be reviewed by those who understand that cinema is not just about acting and storyline. One of the main reasons why I did not give this a 10/10 is because of the lack of character development. This film would have been twice as strong if more was learnt about the evil Queen, the Huntsman, and William. The evil Queen was by far the most interesting character in the film, and was portrayed/costumed brilliantly."
264,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a good movie if you adore Kristen Stewart. She was the driving force for the entire movie. If you're a fan of her work and love the puzzled, troubled, sexy, deep thinking, alluring effect of her acting, then I recommend this movie to you, because you will very much enjoy it. Things that would have made the movie better aesthetically would have been a grander wardrobe, because everyone in this movie looked poor, even the evil queen who is supposedly a monarch, had no royal effect. William, the son of the Duke, did not have significantly better armour or raiments compared to the huntsman who was a retired soldier with no noble blood. Another unusual thing was when the huntsman tore Snow White's dress. That scene lead to nothing for the cloth he tore was not used for any purpose, and he had slighted her for no reason. And if it were so that, she did not trip while walking, it still made the scene unnecessary. There was not enough character build-up for the huntsman and not enough of an explanation or a moment where there was no doubt he loved Snow White. The reason he gave near the end made it seem that he really just misses his wife. The love story was just lost in the film. It almost felt like at the end of the movie, she was better off marrying one of the nobler dwarfs who vowed to die for her or none at all."
265,"Would I have liked another actress to play Snow White instead of Kristen Stewart? Yes, she had no emotion and her accent was not very good, but honestly, she wasn't as bad of an actor as she was in Twilight. In this movie she smiled I think twice, and was depressed and emotionless the rest of the movie. She wasn't as bad of an actor because the queen was trying to rip Snow White's heart out, so of course Snow White is supposed to be depressed 90% of the movie, but in Twilight she is supposed to show way more emotion than she does. So honestly she was a better actor in this movie than I thought she would be because she was supposed to be depressed most of the movie. I LOVED the story line, it was supposed to be a new Snow White for young adults to enjoy, where they could show all of the violence and make it more interesting for young adults. The original Snow White and Mirror Mirror both are more for children because they didn't have all of the violence that young adults would like to see. I do think they could have cut out 10-20 minutes of the violence (and I love action movies). Overall you should definitely see it if you haven't! If your not a big fan of action movies, then I probably wouldn't watch it, unless you can handle it if you like the story line. There is a twist to the story we all know and love, but it is a good kind of twist, and you will be very surprised!"
266,"Hollywood has been cranking out cinematic adaptations of Snow White since the silent 1916 version. In 1933, vampy cartoon heroine Betty Boop even impersonated the raven-haired princess in a 7-minute, surrealistic, black and white cartoon from Max Fleischer's Studios before Disney immortalized our fair maiden. Recently, ""Immortals"" director Tarsem Singh helmed his adaptation ""Mirror, Mirror"" with Julia Roberts cast as the sinful stepmom. Now, rookie British director Rupert Sanders and freshman scenarist Evan Daugherty, along with ""The Blind Side"" scribe John Lee Hancock and ""Drive's"" Hossein Amini, have reimagined this chick flick as much darker. They've made it palatable not only for girls but also guys. Imagine ""Joan of Arc"" meets ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and you've got a good idea about what to expect. As the second take on the venerable Brothers Grimm fairy tale this year, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" departs considerably the 1937 Walt Disney classic. The protagonist here isn't the comely maiden who cooks and cleans for a clan of cuddly dwarfs. After escaping from her depraved stepmother and stumbling through a supernatural forest with all kinds of creepy critters, ""Twilight's"" Kristen Stewart makes herself over into an armor-plated, sword-wielding Amazon who saddles up with an army of troops to ride back and reclaim her father's castle and throne. Good adventure movies require stalwart heroines who don't necessarily play second fiddle to the heroes. A bearded, drunken Chris Hemsworth who has little in common with his Marvel Comics alter-ego ""Thor"" brandishes both a hatchet and an attitude, but he doesn't push our heroine around for long before she whistles a different tune. Mind you, good adventures must also boast diabolical villains. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron steals the show as the malicious stepmother and qualifies as the most fascist femme that you will ever see. She is a succubus rolled up into a sorceress. Aside from her brother, this despicable villainess abhors men with a passion and loves literally to stick it to them‚Äîright in the gizzard with a sharp blade.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" follows the Grimm brothers' story at the outset when a queen pricks her finger on a blooming rose in the dead of winter and watches three drops of blood splatter crimson red in the snow. She bears a child but then dies not long afterward. Snow White's grieving father rides into battle against a mysterious enemy that his army hacks into heaps of obsidian shards before they discover a poor damsel chained up in a wagon on the battlefield. This unfortunate woman, Ravenna (Charlize Theron of ""Monster""), seduces King Magnus (Noah Huntley of ""Your Highness"") and later they marry. During their wedding night, Ravenna straddles the king in bed and stabs him to death in the chest with a large knife. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" skirts blood and gore as much as possible. Nevertheless, the inventive Sanders shows some flair by having a pitcher of wine spill at least a quart of its dark red contents on the floor for metaphorical purposes.Ravenna wastes no time with the king's daughter and locks young Snow White up in a tower. No sooner has this incident transpired than she has her servants hang a mirror so she can admire her beauty. Of course, this mirror is no ordinary mirror. Everybody knows that the wicked stepmother-turned-queen engages in conversations with it. The difference is that before the mirror replies to her, it behaves like the Robert Patrick terminator in ""Terminator 2."" It oozes out onto the floor into a pool and morphs into the shape of a figure draped in a cloak. This ingenious touch and the many others that ensue make ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" into an exciting, above-average yarn with surprises galore. After Snow White has grown up, Ravenna realizes that she has a problem. She is beginning to age. She sends her equally wicked brother her Finn (Sam Spruell of ""Defiance"") off to fetch fresh flesh. Finn brings her a young maiden, and Ravenna literally sucks the beauty of her mouth without touching her lips. Indeed, Ravenna imitates the infamous Countess B√°thory who slashed up young women and bathed in their blood. Eventually, Ravenna learns that she must dine on Snow White's heart and sends Finn off to get her. A couple of birds fly up to Snow White's window in the tower and she finds a loose nail. Later, when Finn tries to dally with our heroine, she cuts him up and escapes from the castle. The furious Ravenna enlists the aid of a drunken lout, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth of ""The Cabin in the Woods"") and he sets out to find Snow White. Sensing something amiss, the Huntsman alters his allegiance and helps Snow White elude Finn and his henchmen. About an hour into the action, our hero and heroine encounter eight dwarfs who are thieves.Future filmmakers will have to struggle to surpass what Sanders and his scribes have done both with the nefarious stepmother and the other elements. The troll that our hero and heroine encounter looks like something out of a ""Lord of the Rings"" epic as the haunted forest slithers with some interesting reptiles that can change into tree branches. If some of those dwarfs that associate with Snow White look familiar, they are. Sanders and company haven't cast genuine dwarfs. Instead, they have pasted the heads of notable real-life actors, including Nick Frost of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" Ian McShane of HBO's ""Deadwood,"" and Ray Winstone of ""The Departed,"" onto the bodies of these little people. Sanders displays a knack for staging scenes, and the horsemen charging through the surf to a castle constructed on the reef is awesome. The scenery, the sets, the wardrobe, and the computer-generated-special effects all heighten the heroics. Unfortunately, the romantic chemistry between Kristen Stewart and her two suitors, Chris Hemsworth as the eponymous Huntsman and her childhood friend and archer extradinaree Sam Claflin, frizzles rather than sizzles."
267,"Cannot understand ROTTEN TOMATOES or the critics it relies on. RT will assign a review as a ""rotten vote"" even if the reviewer finds just a few faults in a movie. Snow White and the Huntsman got a 43% rating, though it was a far superior work then most of the crap appearing on our screens today. SW/H was well-paced; i.e., for 127 minutes most of the scenes moved and/or enhanced the story without; e.g., cheesecake, fight/pursuit filler, cheap humor or unnecessary sub-plots. SW/H is an imaginative take on an old fable without substantial deviation from the basic story (who said Walt Disney had/has the final say?). The props were great and yes, the acting too! The dialog was effective and never full of boring speeches, bad accents or over the top exaltations. I've never seen Kristen Stewart in anything except a movie called THE CAKE EATERS in which she did a fine job. Low key was the way to play THIS Snow White and that's just what Kristen did. You want bad acting? Try Zooey Deschanell. Charlize Theron takes over where Jessica Lange and Michelle Phieffer left off. And the Dwarfs, a virtual line-up of established Englishman, could've easily been played for comic relief, pratfalls, etc., but were used economically. Contrast THE AVENGERS, a comic book we are asked to take seriously and with zero originality, devices, etc. Is anyone actually giving any thought to what they're seeing on screen?"
268,"It absolutely baffles me how so many people (Mostly women) hate on Kristen Stewart, and yet they go see every single Twilight Movie several times in Theaters. She is a bad actor when it comes to the Twilight movies, because lets face it, the dialogue is painfully awful in those movies!!! If you are forced to work with a garbage script, you can't expect it to turn out good. I enjoyed Snow White and the Huntsman very much, and I thought the entire cast was spectacular, (yes, Even Kristen was good!!). And for everyone who thinks she isn't nearly attractive enough to play Snow White, you have missed the entire point of the story. Charlize plays a beautiful tall blond goddess of a woman, but is cruel, empathy lacking, and sadistic. Snow White is the embodiment of life itself, has an affinity for nature, animals, and clearly has it within herself to care for other people. With a great disdain for sounding clich√©, that is what true beauty is. And I don't know about the rest of you, but I find Kristen Stewart very attractive. She looks like someone that would grow up in your neighbourhood and has that certain something that makes her stand out above all the cheer-leading bimbos at your school, because she doesn't conform to the Hollywood standard of beauty (pouty duck face lips, long Barbie doll legs, anorexic-thin mid section, over-sized fake breasts, and an IQ that matches her waist size).I give SW&THM an 8/10 for a great dark story, beautiful direction and cinematography, a top notch cast, and for not forgetting to include the dwarfs!!"
269,"It's an obvious trend to take a well known fairy tale and take a modern twist on it, or is being a very free interpretation of it all. I'm not particularly a big fan of this, not in the least also because it very rarely results in a good movie Besides, it just too often comes across as a cheap way to cash in on an already established name and franchise. However I feel that this movie worked out surprisingly well! No, it's far from a great movie but it at all times remains a perfectly watchable one, that besides is being pretty entertaining and spectacular in parts.It's definitely being a very loose take on the Snow White story but they did a pretty good job with coming up with something good and original for its story, that worked out well. You can just simply see this movie as an action adventure, that just happens to feature the Snow White character and some of the other familiar characters, from the brothers Grimm's fairy tale.Now, the story works out well but it still has some issues to it. First of all, it is true that the movie its first half was being way better too watch than its second. The second half of the movie felt somewhat disjointed and got messy in parts when the movie suddenly started to throw in way too much stuff, while still at the same time managing to make the second half also much slower and less interesting to watch than its first.Perhaps the first half of the movie also worked out better because it focused more in the evil queen, played by Charlize Theron. And man, is she evil! Charlize Theron really did a great job with her role! The second half is almost entirely focused upon Snow White, played by Kristen Stewart, who is just less interesting as a character. So in a way this movie feels like two completely different movies, that were focusing on two different characters and both of the halves never came together well and naturally enough.It's a really good looking movie, with a mostly dark atmosphere to it. The movie makes a great use of its special effects, costumes and makeup, which also makes this quite a visual treat.But because that the movie is not always in balance with its story, most of the other stuff in it feels somewhat disjointed as well. There is not really one style to the movie and the one moment its is being like a typical fairy tale, with a fairy tale look to it, while at the other it's being a dark and bleach movie. Same goes for the comedy. It's just sporadically present and overall the movie its tone perhaps feels a bit too serious at times.But really, as a whole the movie is being a pretty maintaining experience, that never bores and is being a good and interesting enough different take on the Snow White story!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
270,"A great film, ignore the nonsense surrounding this film and the rating. this is good well paced, fantasy!### Spoiler ###The beginning starts with a huge war set up by the queen (to lose!) in order to weave a tragic betrayal, in which she kills her newly wed husband (snow white's father and King)Under darkness the queen then proceeds to open the castle gates to let in her actual army, who of course slaughter the people. During this Snow White is a child and is captured by the Queen's army whilst her friend William, manages to escape with the remains of the people's army. The queen takes control after this and the world is consumed by a hopelessness and everything becomes grey, murky and bleak. Snow white becomes a prisoner along with many others and it seems the Queen is unstoppable. However, becoming more powerful is no longer enough for the wicked queen, who despite all her power and success is struggling to retain her youthfulness.During a moment with her mirror on the wall she comes to learn that a purer beauty than she has come of age, and that her name is Snow White! and only by killing Snow White will she become truly immortal. ...and there we go, this is the essential premise of the film and what a good premise it is! This film has your classic hero (or in this case - heroin) and nemesis character traits at heart of the story. Good vs Evil, revenge, war, betrayal, sacrifice etc. If you prefer more subtle character development then this film is probably not for you, but I think most people will agree that when good vs evil is done well it is a great ride.The queen's performance is very over the top, but needed I think. It's one of the better examples of a truly deranged character in fantasy film that I have come across. it is tragic to see how mad she is and that her aspirations are so unhealthy. In contrast, Snow white's character is very thin in development but as the film's momentum is already quite busy, this doesn't matter a great deal.A great film with enough additional story tweaking to make this a worthy interpretation of a classic."
271,"Fantastic! This is, at least for me, THE BEST SNOW WHITE VERSION EVER! I even watched it twice within a week! Through this reminding-us-of-LotR movie, Kristen Stewart deserves to be called as one of next big things in Hollywood. Her acting has gone further until even every detail of her expressions and her gestures, suit her role and fulfill her scenes well.Charlize Therone through the movie remarkably delivers a great performance! She's the best in this epic movie. I support her to be nominated as Best Actress at Golden Globe and Oscar in 2013! After watching this version, now we can understand why the evil queen becomes evil. The movie also teaches us about one precious value of life, the fact that we all have a choice: to learn from all hard times we've been through, keep focusing on the positif sides, and become better people; or we just let anger, disappointment, and sadness lead us become bad, so that we become ""the victims"" of hard times we've experienced.Besides, I think this is the first version in which we see Snow White prays The Lord's Prayer. It's kind of interesting for me..."
272,"In a twist to the classic Grimm Brothers fairy tale, the Huntsman who is ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor as he trains her to become a warrior capable of overthrowing the Evil Queen. Starring Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and brief sensuality, you will find people stabbed with swords and axes but there is no blood and guts shown. One of our youth film critics, 10-year-old Anthony Aranda watched it earlier this week and this is what he had to report.Snow White and the Huntsman Reviewed by Anthony Aranda (age 10) Video review here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlgea-Rw3JcI thought this movie was great because it has lots of action and a little romance. This move is all about Snow White who had a happy life until her mother died and then the king found a new wife who turned out to be an evil Queen. She locked Snow White away and the kingdom was very unhappy.The main characters are Snow White, the seven dwarfs, the Huntsman, the king and the evil queen. My favorite characters are Snow White and the Huntsman because Snow White does not want to be killed so she stands up for herself and the Huntsman tries to save her. My favorite part in the movie is when Snow White and the Huntsman are in the village and he leaves and a little while later there are flaming arrows that come at the wood buildings so the houses started to burn down. This scene has a lot of action and suspense.I recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because I'm 10 and I loved this movie. I think that younger children might not like it because it is kind of violent and would scare them."
273,"I was so excited for this movie, and the trailer really sold it as an exciting version of one my favorite fairy tales---but trailers can be deceiving.This movie was full of too much action and obnoxious CGI effects. Obviously they wanted to draw in a male audience with all the fight scenes (which is understandable since they casted Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame as Snow White, so they had their work cut out for them as most men LOATHE Twilight), so the action and fight scenes are understandable but they over did it. Too many chase scenes, too many fight scenes, just UGH. The scenes spent on Snow White being chased by the Queen's annoying creeper brother and his army could've been used to introduce the dwarfs earlier on and develop relationships between Snow White, the Huntsman, and the dwarfs. Were we really supposed to buy how heart broken Snow White was when the red haired dwarf died? How could she be that sad when she only knew him for like...a day? And what of this relationship with the Huntsman? They spent so much time running and fighting off Ravenna's army that it's hard to believe that the Huntsman has fallen in love with Snow White. They needed more intimate moments, to bond and get to know each other, why did they wait till Snow White was 'dead' to have the Huntsman pour his heart out to her? How stupid.CGI was good but if they put half as much effort into the story and character development as they did with the CGI then this movie would've been great. That's the problem with Hollywood films like this today---they are too focused on showing off all the CGI crap and forget that they are supposed to be telling a story.As for the actors, Charlize has moments of being great and then over the top and melodramatic. She has a very intimidating presence and is quite beautiful, almost so much that it's a bit unrealistic that we're meant to believe Kristen Stewart is supposed to be 'fairer' than Charlize. But Charlize has a lot of over the top moments that bugged me. Kristen Stewart, well I've never seen the Twilight movies but I decided to give this girl a chance. Her portrayal both bothered me and satisfied me. KStew is known for being blank and emotionless in a lot of her roles, she rarely smiles or laughs and comes off as far too serious----but that KIND of works for her in this particular role, when you think about the character of Snow White and what she's had to endure at the hands of her wicked step mother, Ravenna. Chris Hemsworth did FANTASTIC as the Huntsman, great actor and really shinned in this movie...when he wasn't battling or fighting someone at least. The Prince was cute, sexy, and was cast well but kind became just third wheel towards the end of the movie.What I liked about this movie was fantasy creatures, the scenery and location shots, the end credits, and the magic 'mirror' man---BEST version of the magic mirror I've seen so far.I give this movie a 6/10, it had dark elements to it but too much action. Like I said in the title above, if you want a REAL dark Snow White movie, then go watch Snow White: A Tale of Terror on Netflix, it has it's flaws and is rather dated but it did so much better at telling this story in a way that people looking for a dark, Gothic tale can appreciate."
274,"I'm sure everyone knows the story by now. The only reason I gave it a 7 and not a 9 or 10 was because I am a Game Of Thrones fan and they make 60 minutes feel as epic as Snow White felt. It probably isn't fair because Game Of Thrones is the best television available today, but I could't help feeling like Snow White should have topped it. With that out of the way, I did not like Kristen Stewart's performance in the Twilight series, which I credit mostly to the poorly written scripts. In Show White she actually has a good script, and she completely shocked me. She didn't simply have that blank look she always has in Twilight, she was believable in every single moment. Theron was perfectly over the top. The rest of the cast is good. I completely forgot that they shrunk actors into the dwarf roles with CGI. It was perfectly done. I could't tell if they were setting up for a equal, but I'd definitely see it if they were.Overall it's well worth it."
275,"I think overall the movie was good. But not that great. The acting of all the characters was impressive but the story line could have been better. Some parts were good while some were rushed. Charlize Theron was a perfect choice for the evil queen. She did a great job. Literally, her parts gave me goosebumps.On the other hand, Kristen Stewart did a good part on snow white. People say that she can't act, but her feelings were well portrayed in the film. Chris as the huntsman was great. I will say that if people like these kinds of movies or they are a huge fan of any of the actors, then they should go for it.I am sure they will love it. As for others i say that he movie is worth a one time watch. Its an average movie."
276,"I find it curiously ironic that critics who vocalize frustration with 're-makes', now critique SW & H as being 'completely adrift from the original story'. Shouldn't THAT be the criteria for making a re-make? First of all ‚Äì what 'original' are they comparing this movie to? If they are comparing it to the original story, then THIS movie, more than any seen, is closer to the original. The original story of Snow White can be very disturbing and tremendously violent. That tends to happen when converting books to movies, especially children stories (i.e. the book The Wizard of Oz tells a much different story from the popular 1939 movie version). In this instance, if the critics are comparing SW & H to the Disney animation ‚Äì then quit complaining because SW & H gives us a different twist and makes the notion of the re-make entirely acceptable.So much of this movie is truly spectacular. The scenery, the characters, the special effects and the best part ¬Ö not everything is explained from A-Z! Thank you for that. I don't need to know which hero Snow White will or won't end up with, or if she even picks one or the other ‚Äì romance isn't the focus of this version. I don't need to know exactly how her step mother received or elects when to utilize her powers. I don't care how an enchanted forest and a dark forest manage to flourish side by side. Let us not forget that this is a fairytale. It's all make-believe. It's all magic. It doesn't HAVE to be explained. Just watch it and enjoy the story ‚Äì SW & H delivers perfectly on that end. And can we please stop with all the realism comparisons or faults that are found with these fantasy movies ¬Ö 'How can a girl run around in a full suit of armor and fight?' Ummmm, a fairytale princess can! I enjoyed this movie ‚Äì more than I expected. I would caution that this in NOT a movie for kids under 9. It will be too violent and not at all what they are expecting. For older kids and adults this movie is fast moving, keeps your attention and despite some whining from those who wanted to see more of the 'prince-charming' version ‚Äì this one stands on its own. I think what most are failing to accept with this version, is that Snow White is set on killing her step mother just as passionately as her step mother is out to kill her. Revenge and greed is the focus on this movie, so keep that in mind and don't try and force this movie into being the prince/princess mushy love story. Let your own imagination fill in the blanks, answer the questions and determine the ultimate conclusion to this movie!"
277,"I saw the trailer and the visuals were so dark and at the same time so beautiful that I was convinced to see it. Plus the idea of a classic fairy tale with a twist is intriguing.I was not let down. The visuals are stunning, the twist to the classic is a welcomed decision because it makes the characters more believable, the story is not sugared down and it brings it closer to the original tales which were far more violent and raw than Disney versions. But the thing I liked the most was the Evil Queen. Her performance is flawless, her expressions transmit so much, Charlize is so beautiful that she could have stolen everyone's beauty *for real*, and the dresses she wears are perfectly fit to her beauty and evil. Charlize makes this evil Queen so very believably human.Chris H. is probably the best looking man in the world, even when he is filthy and drunk, and he plays his part nicely. Stewart doesn't steal the movie but she is not so bad as other reviews said, she is just OK. The dwarfs are great, nothing like the hi-ho dwarfs we remember so well, these are real people.Overall, I like it and recommend it."
278,"Hope all might be aware whose choice she was to act in this movie and what were the intentions to it, but for me, I see it as very loved classic spoiled to the core.The plot is really good. Direction is good. Visuals good. Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron did awesome. Ultimately Kristen Stewart made the whole movie a disaster. Wrong choice of casts especially for the lead roles could harm everything that is good about the movie. Hope Rupert Sanders had a great time directing the movie with Kristen Stewart in lead role.Anyway this can be considered as a lesson learned for me and everyone to think before spending your money for a movie with Kristen Stewart in important role. After watching this movie I really wished it was Scarlett Johansson instead in the lead role."
279,"Not enough Charlize.Too much chick flick.In the NOT SO epic action-adventure Snow White and the Huntsman, Snow White (badly cast as Kristen Stewart) is the only person in the land fairer (she's fair if you're into that 'always high' look) than the evil queen out to destroy her. But what the wicked ruler never imagined is that the young woman threatening her reign has been training in the art of war with a huntsman dispatched to kill her.The previews that sold the show.....sold the show. It's not much more than what you saw on your commercial breaks.I had hoped Kristen Stewart would step up out of her vampire bad acting. Nope.fail."
280,"Kristin Stewart completely ruined this movie. First of all, she can't act -- AT ALL! This is common knowledge in both Hollywood AND the real world so why is she getting parts like this? I was 100% unable to get past her awful ""acting"" if you can even call it that, and so therefore the movie was absolutely terrible. The rest of the cast did the best they could, and as usual, seemed as if they tried their hardest to make up for where Snow White was lacking but it just didn't work. Don't waste your money. Go see ""Mirror Mirror"" instead, at least the acting is worthwhile and it'll give you a few chuckles."
281,"**Not really spoiler**I came with a with a big hope that please please please don't you be so crap Kristen Stewart. I'm hoping this movie gonna do her good. But all that was just a dream. She single handily ruined the show. The 1st 10 minutes is the only time i enjoyed the movie. Even Charlize Theron awesomeness cant save the show, it was just disappointing. The scene where she suppose to inspire people is not inspiring at all. Why so angry? I feel like wanna slap her. Are you sad? Happy? Your heart so pure? I got my solid reason not to watch a show now, if she's in it, don't spend money to watch in theater.**If that is the snow white, then evil queen can rule me anytime."
282,"When the film needed it's most powerful character to motivate the people to take down the evil queen, all we get is Kristen Stewart's pathetic attempt at motivation. I don't blame any of the supporting characters they did all of their scenes well. It was Kristen who failed to convey the proper emotions for scene after scene. All of her acting skills seem to emanate from ""the panic room"" where she plays a diabetic little girl. In that movie, her hard breathing as she is close to death plays well. she carries this same breathing into the ""Twilight"" series to convey love torn emotions which are a bit over the top. Now, when that same breathing is used to convey fear, anger or the courage of a character, she fails miserably. It looks like she's having an asthma attack rather than bringing the dramatic emotional portrayal of someone who's been betrayed, imprisoned, life threatened, and now wants to retake her kingdom. I realize that ""1"" is very low score for this movie and probably would have been an ""8"" without Stewart. Could have been a classic had the right snow white been cast. My apologies to the rest of the cast and crew for this low score."
283,"A lot of people are judging this movie based on the story, the production design, the acting. That's all well and good, but ultimately, that's not what I saw as the true value of this movie. When I went to see it, I decided to give it a shot as a story, and I'll be honest, while not exactly generic, the plot itself didn't really grip me. It all came off as a bit arbitrary. But, I then decided to take the whole thing in as a dream, and then I was rewarded with one of the most brilliantly psychedelic trips I've ever seen. If the idea of a faerie forest being something as creepy and weird as it is beautiful and peaceful, and the idea of tripping on psychedelics is something you think belongs in more than The Wizard of Oz, then this might actually be a movie you'll appreciate. Despite the crazy imagery and weird symbolism, the military action is actually pretty realistic to the time. The biggest problem with the movie is that it continued to take itself a bit too seriously, and fell into some overly familiar territory, along the lines of Twilight and The Hunger Games. Had the film instead ended with Mario jumping in and blasting fireballs while a tyrannosaurus rex raided the room and shot lasers out of its eyes, I think the movie would have felt more enjoyable, and not because it fits with the story, but rather because it fits with the overall feeling I got when I watched it. In the words of one of the characters, ""it must have been the mushrooms""."
284,"It was exciting, nice surprise, roles well played, excellent photo and a nice twist to the snow white story. What I found very surprising were all the similarities with another ""story"" Im very familiar with, and have read, The book is named the Bible. In my opinion it looks a lot like the second coming of Christ to re-settle his kingdom after a time of tribulation. The phrase in the movie ""I will give this wretched world the queen it deserves!"" Very familiar too. The scene with the white deer. The battle between the king's daughter with the evil kingdom that was established in the world. Rings any bells?? It does for me, analyze it yourself and think about it."
285,"The visuals on this movie were truly breathtaking and coupled with the music created a very engaging experience. the contrasts of the world affected by Ravenna's thirst for power with the world as it could and should be, the Sanctuary, the Dark Forest. the script itself tried to tell too many backstories and had very little space to expand the mythologies properly, though they made a valiant effort. we got to know at least a bit of background on all main characters and it helped but I wouldn't mind to get to know the characters better. The relationships were only touched upon as well, though, surprisingly, I didn't mind the lack of proper romantic line much.I loved Kristen in this, she had very little dialog (and to be honest, her war speech made me cringe something awful), but she conveyed the innocence and purity and the pure wonder at the world and the amount of love for everything and everyone beautifully.Charlize, just wow. she was evil and imposing but also broken and scared. I liked the juxtaposition of outer beauty destroying everything in the effort to preserving itself versus inner beauty bringing life to everything around. I really liked the Prince Charming they created for this story. he genuinely cared for SW and did so for very long despite thinking her dead. and I liked that he was more than a pretty face. Sam was awesome in the roleI'm not sure what to think of the relationship of SW and Hunstamn, I hoped for more of a father/daughter type of thing, him being her mentor not a potential suitor, therefore the way she came back to life after eating the apple baffled and saddened me a bit. but Chris was truly amazing in the role. he was a tough man with a broken heart who lost all purpose and then found it in a wisp of a girl with wonder in her eyesand I like the dwarfs. they were a lovely bunchI had rather high expectations for the movie and was only mildly thrown by some little things such as the out-of-nowhere prayer, the battle speech or the above mentioned awakening of Snow White. but other than that I enjoyed myself tremendously and cannot but recommend the movie"
286,"I did not go into this movie having read any reviews -- all I had seen was the preview. That said, I knew the movie would be a dark and unusual take on Snow White. It was much more interesting and well-done than I had expected!First of all, the story took itself seriously--and when has a fairy tale movie done that lately? The last one I saw in theaters was the Red Riding Hood film with Amanda Seyfried, and that had a WAY different feel (an excuse to make a sexy teenage horror movie under the guise of a classic fairy tale) than this movie. Snow White was very well acted, with a very interesting, unique story that somehow managed to stay very true to the original tale, while also being very creative and surprising. Without trying, I thought of a lot of other movies/stories while watching, from Ever After to the Chronicles of Narnia, to LOTR, to Joan of Arc, to Hanna. Beautiful music, interesting lack of romance, beautiful scenery, dark and enchanting.I thought Snow White was almost a mix of St. Francis, the Virgin Mary and Joan of Arc...very cool!I recommend this movie if you are looking for a grown-up fairy tale that takes itself seriously and is interesting and well-acted! It also made me think (SPOILER ALERT)...why did the Huntsman's kiss wake her, and not William's? Why was Snow White gifted with such purity and goodness? Was this a late medieval alternate-universe- British-Isles, rather than a different world, as the characters got married in a church and Snow White prays the Our Father?"
287,"I don't usually review but thought that I'd give this a go because there are so many Kristen Stewart haters. I personally think that she is getting better with every film she makes. She is believable in this role of a girl that a has been locked away for 10 years. She pulls off the innocence that the Disney Snow White had along the with the willingness to fight for her life, her land and her people. I really want to see where they take the Snow White/Huntsman chemistry that leaped of the screen when they looked at each other. I find that I'm actually rooting for him to win the Princess and not William. I love Charlize Theron and think she is a wonderful actress but there were a few times that her character seemed a little spasmodic at times.Many people have complained that Kristen could never be more beautiful than Charlize but what most have forgotten is that Snow Whites beauty is not just about the physical. She is lovely within and without, while Ravenna has allowed her hate to make her heart and could black thing."
288,"This film is recommended.If opposites attract, then this ultimate exercise of style over substance entitled Snow White and the Huntsman will be packing 'em in at the movie theaters. It is a film at odds with itself, a schizophrenic frenetic display of impressive CGI imagery and bland storytelling. The film takes a more sinister revisionist spin of the well known folktale with decidedly mixed results. The dualities throughout the film are striking. Both title characters are dull stock characters with no genuine energy or depth, poorly written and nebulous, while the evil queen is better defined and a far more compelling force. The acting is of the hit-and-miss variety with Charlize Theron's deliciously evil queen overwhelming Kristen Stewart's brave but banal heroine, throwing the moviegoer's support in the wrong direction. ( More on the acting later. ) The highly-charged visual splendor of the film's special effects make the film temporarily soar while the dull narrative tethers the film at bay, keeping it earthbound. The screenplay is a mere outline of a story. That this undernourished script lacks any creative inspiration from its source and is actually credited to a trio of writers, the committee of Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini, seems absurd. The film would rather rely too heavily on the feverishly enhanced CGI artists to complete the unwritten. And to an extent, it succeeds in that department.The artisans and film crew work small wonders around the trivial subject matter on display. Gorgeous costumes by the talented Colleen Atwood, lavish production design by Dominic Watkins, atmospheric photography by Greig Fraser, and a rousing score by the always dependable James Newton Howard help to enrich the film. ( One should see this on the big screen to fully appreciate the overall effect. )However, it is the breathtaking surrealistic images that make this film so memorable: the liquidity of objects such as the golden mirror or the milky plaster bath that literally consumes the Queen, the black mirror soldiers that fall apart and simultaneously regenerate their obsidian shards, a wonderful bird motif found in both the computer generated visuals and also the subtle costumes ( ala miniature bird skulls and black feathers ), characters that morph into one another. The fluidity of the kaleidoscopic and ever-changing imagery make Snow White and the Huntsman worthy of your attention. ( Some technical nods should be coming its way around award season. ) Credit for the unique style of the film goes to first- time director Rupert Sanders, but he also gets part of the blame for accepting an aforementioned woeful screenplay and acting that ranges from the sublime to the regrettable. First the sublime: Ms. Theron, who again adds to her impressive roster of damaged women, with a wonderful camp-free portrayal of Queen Ravenna. Theron makes the character's obsession with beauty, vanity, and power totally believable. The actress could have easily made the role all exaggerated, over-the-top posturing. Instead she creates a fully developed character that transcends reality, yet remains humanly flawed. Whenever she is on the screen, the film comes roaringly to life. Now the regrettable: As Snow White, Kristen Stewart has the right look but the wrong acting style. She is miscast and brings little gravitas to her character. Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman brings his physically buff Thor-like presence to the role, but his line delivery and facial expressions are lifeless and, dare I say, too wooden? These title characters, who should be more compelling, stop the film cold. The handsome Sam Clafin as Prince William is more charmless than Charming. Much of the rest of the cast including the wasted talents of actors who have shown better acting choices in other production: Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, and Toby Jones, all are misused and rarely advance the plot.The film is not the unmitigated disaster as this year's earlier fractured fairy tale known as Mirror, Mirror, but Snow White and the Huntsman never achieves its own spirited aspirations, despite the visual sweep of the film. ( In retrospect, it may be the fairest of the two, but that is an idle boast at best. ) GRADE: BNOTE: The film, rated PG-13, is too intense for the younger set, age 12, but never as involving for the older crowd either, age 13 and up. So just who is the film's target audience?Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com to add comments."
289,"I went into this movie with not expecting anything more than the average pretty good summer movie. My hopes were exceeded a thousand times over. This is a brilliant retelling of the classic story, with a nod at the darker somber sides of the original fairy tales. That being said THIS IS NOT YOUR USUAL Clich√© FAIRY TALE CHICK FLICK. There is hardly any romance in it whatsoever, which makes it all the better of a movie.Now for the things that I liked. The casting was excellent. While I am one of the many that can't stand what I've seen from the Twilight movies, my hat is off to Kristen Stewart. Despite what other stubborn critics are saying, I think she did well and is on her way to breaking out of her ""Bella mold"". Charlize Theron was PERFECT, period. And I'm not usually one to rant about art, but this movie was utterly beautiful. It took the usual fantasy motifs such as fairies, trolls, dark forests, evil monarchs, and portrayed them in ways that were utterly unique and different than what has been seen in the genre before. And finally the costuming alone was amazing. The action sequences were just long and brutal enough to be enjoyable, not used as filler like in most movies. Summary: If you're looking for an exciting and different (though somewhat gloomy) fairy tale this is the movie for you. And yes having two very hot male actors in it ain't bad either ;)"
290,"A modern remake of the classic fairy tale without all the singing and animals including birds following the leading character who were by Snow White side through and through. A huntsman narrates the beginning the story's entrance following credits who was sought by the evil queen to find the king's daughter. The Dark Forest stays true to the original fairy tale where it is eiree for trees moving, mud and objects linger. The evil queen was suppose to take on an old hag form to trick Snow White biting a red apple, which this version portrays as a fake William. The Duke's son, adult William did not play a major supporting role as he did not contribute to the dialogue. I find him to be a supermodel for his good looks filling the void in the movie.Snow White's character wears a long blue dress as she did not wear pants in that time period, women only wore long dresses in this time period. The seven dwarfs do not sing ""hi ho"" and nor do they bear the Disney version fictitious names: Sleepy, Happy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful and Doc which an eighth dwarf appears oddly in this film. I believe most classic fairy tales carry the same villain: an evil step mother (Cinderella, Snow White, Mother Gothel ""Tangled"")."
291,"Widower king in medieval times is instantly smitten by a blonde temptress (named Ravenna!) who quickly takes over his throne; she imprisons his daughter and sucks the youth out of small girls in her quest to be the most beautiful and powerful in the land...though, considering that the land is populated mostly by dead trees and dirty, downtrodden townspeople, it doesn't seem like much to ask. Charlize Theron does some very good work as the wicked queen, but this updating of the Snow White tale is confusing, confounding, bungled, and occasionally laughable. Kristen Stewart is well-cast as the king's daughter, but director Rupert Sanders lets his camera sit on Stewart's tight little face far too long, robbing the actress of mystery (he even slows down the footage of her running or horseback riding for no other purpose other than to have us admire her 'courage', which could have been covered by a few choice lines of dialogue). The production is top-heavy with ghoulish design, some of which is worth seeing; however, the thin script is not helped by the director's lack of timing, nor by the editor's sloppy continuity. ** from ****"
292,"Snow White and the Huntsman is not a great film, but nor is it a terrible one. It is, put simply, a fun and entertaining two hours which presents an interesting perspective on a classic fairy tale.I'm not going to spend too much time going into the plot, as I think everyone is aware of it: in summation - Evil Queen steals the throne of a young princess and when the girl comes of age seeks to kill her. Obviously, there's more to it than that, but we all know the score. Instead I'm going to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the film generally. Charlize Theron is truly exceptional as the Queen, Ravenna. She raises what is traditionally a stereotypical ""evil stepmother"" figure to great heights, giving us a living, breathing antagonist with motivations and fears that are very, very human. Although the acts she commits are terrible, we get an insight into *why* she does them, a real rarity in films like this most of the time. Admittedly more time could have been spent fleshing out her character and motivation, but given the amount of content in the film already I think it's quite amazing we got as much as we did. The film makers could easily have not bothered and just left us with ""she's evil, get over it"".Chris Hemsworth as The Huntsman really gets to stretch his acting muscles and not just his physical ones this time around, showing that he is capable of far more than hitting things. In particular his emotion laden speech to a dead Snow White, comparing her to his deceased wife and how their strength's fuel him, was spectacular. Many actors would have chewed this scene for all it was worth, but Hemsworth delivered a performance that truly felt real and from the heart - a performance which nicely helps to gloss over the mystery of how such a speech and a gentle kiss could revive the dead Snow White. No explanation for her revival is given and this is one of the film's key weaknesses. Some reference to his having broken a spell would have been sufficient. Kristen Stewart. Oh. When I heard about her being cast in this role I was worried, very worried indeed. I'm pleased to say that some of that concern was misplaced. Not completely, but partially. Stewart acts and emotes far more believably than she does in the Twilight series. But she is still the weakest of the cast. I can't help but feel that she was cast for her looks, first and foremost. She really shines in some scenes - notably when she and Hemsworth reach a village populated entirely by women. But in other moments she seems entirely out of her depth, for instance the key scene where Snow delivers a speech to rally her allies for the final assault upon the Queen. Admittedly, few actors can truly manage the 'rousing speech' well (only Bernard Shaw in LotR: The Return of the King and Russell Crowe in Gladiator have truly pulled it off in recent years. Even Viggo Mortensen struggled with it), so it's hardly a surprise that Stewart was less than successful here. She also struggles with emoting in the coronation scene that closes the film, looking for the most part perplexed, which doesn't sit well with the rest of the film where she clearly knew she was fighting for her throne. Still, she excels in scenes within the dark forest and magical forest, the former has an especially powerful scene of her hallucinating. And in the latter, she really convinces as someone awed by the splendour and beauty around her. All in all, a mixed performance but easily superior to her role in Twilight and she is perfectly acceptable in the role.The Dwarfs - there are too many actors for me to discuss them all. They were all well cast and well played, but unfortunately got far too little screen time. But the time they do get is well utilised and plays well in the overall story. There isn't a single wasted moment with them. Bob Hoskins and Brian Gleeson in particular shine in their roles.And the Prince. Normally I'm a stickler for keeping characters, but he is so under used and largely pointless from a story perspective that they might as well have combined his character with the Huntsman and been done with it. Sam Claflin tackles the material he is given with much gusto, but sadly the role is so shallow and empty that he faces a uphill struggle. He manages it well enough, all things considered.Overall, as I stated to begin with, this is an okay film. It sits in that nice 7-ish zone of films that are perfectly acceptable, fun and entertaining but don't stand out as cinematic highlights. This is one to see in the cinema for sure and if, like me, you have a substantial DVD collection it will make a nice addition. 7 out of 10, hampered only by some dead weight, plot holes and the occasional performance blip. Had those been dealt with, it would be an 8 or 9."
293,"This is a darker, harsher, more embattled Snow White than you ever imagined. Charlize Theron gave a superb performance as Ravenna The Queen creating a beautiful, evil villain. Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Snow White, however, left a lot to be desired. She didn't present the beauty necessary to be a rival for 'The Fairest In The Land' and her acting was adequate at best. I'm about 100% sure a better choice for Snow White could have been made. Chris Hemsworth as The Huntsman was exciting and believable. Having heard how the powers that be, in creating this film, didn't have the good sense to hire real little people to play the parts of The Seven Dwarfs took away a great deal of enjoyment in that aspect. The actors who played The Seven Dwarfs were good, but knowing the facts rather took the shine off. The rugged scenery is striking and although I stayed to read every credit, unless I somehow missed it, I was left wishing I knew exactly where it was filmed. A picture with plenty of action, marvelous visual effects ‚Äì loved Mirror, Mirror On The Wall ‚Äì this is a movie worth seeing. Put aside your well-remembered, well-loved Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs and enjoy this film as a different story with only a few similarities and you will very likely come away happy you saw it."
294,"I have to admit that walking into a movie called Snow White and the Huntsman, my heart wasn't exactly leaping for joy. What I got was a great deal more than it could have been. Having been witness to last year's torpid (not to mention embarrassing) re-imagining of Little Red Riding Hood, I walked into this movie with a sense of dread.Yet, Snow White and the Huntsman is a movie of generous visuals, sumptuous production design and a story that, while admittedly thin, has just enough meat on it that the visuals don't feel as if they are propped up on a story made out of tissue paper. This is a re-imagining of the Snow White legend, not too far from the 1812 story by The Brothers Grimm, but just far enough to make the story feel new.The story tells of a king's daughter, Snow White (Kristen Stewart) whose mother dies and whose father takes a second wife, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), only a day after he meets her. Soon, the new queen murders the king and takes over the kingdom. Revenna is pure evil, a witch whose obsession with beauty leads to her commit multiple-murders and leave the kingdom to rot (her obsession with her beauty has a frighteningly contemporary feel). She can summon an army made out of sharp metal objects and transform herself into a flock of birds. She is so feared that a small village of women have scarred their own faces just to get off her radar.Revenna's powers are such that she maintains her youth and beauty by sucking the life out of helpless young virgins. Unable to keep up that pace, she asks her magic mirror for help. The mirror explains that she is no longer the fairest, that another has that mantle, and further explains that in order to have ever-lasting beauty, she must possess the girl's heart.The girl is Snow White, whom Revenna has locked away in a tower of the castle for a decade. Sending her brother to kill the girl, Snow White attacks him and escapes into the woods. Not to be undone (and since she can't enter the forest herself without losing her powers) the queen hires a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to go into the forest to find her. He is a a heavy drinker whose fighting skills are superior. Yet, his eyes betray a weary heart. He has recently returned from battle to find that his wife had been murdered. Finding Snow White in the woods, he sees a power in her nature and becomes her ally.If that had been the only thing worth mentioning in this movie, it would have been a total washout. The scenes with the evil queen were to be expected, but I was not prepared for the breathtaking imagination that brings the haunted forest to life. It is gloomy and filled with perilous magical creatures that reach out to swallow travelers whole. The special effects turn to the forest into a living, breathing entity unto itself. Branches reach out, creatures writhe around and a merciless troll that resides (not surprisingly) under a bridge. There is a powerful moment when the troll attacks the duo and Snow White brings him down simply by staring into his eyes.Along the way, Snow White and The Huntsman are aided by eight dwarfs, not seven. They are not identified by the peculiarities but are recognizable as played by several great British actors: Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan. All of whom have been brought down to size through some well-crafted special effects. The dwarfs lead Snow White and The Huntsman to the safety of a glen that is pure magic. It is green, and lush and populated by wondrous creatures of every size and shape and looked after by thousands of fairies. A close-up of the fairies reveals that they are not just actors shrunk down to the size of fingernail clippers, but have lovely faces that seem almost insect-like ‚Äì they seem organic and not just like tossed-off special effects. The forest is ruled over by a magnificent creature, an enormous white stag with giant antlers that seem less like an appendage and more like a work of art. That provides the single best moment in the movie as Snow White is allowed a rare approach to the feet of the magnificent beast.As I said before, the story is thin. The relief is that first-time director Rupert Sanders knows how to handle it. He takes the material seriously and doesn't pad it with in-jokes and silly asides. He paces the movie beautifully in order to give us time to get involved in what is going on. He allows moments to linger long enough that we can get a feel for the locations especially in the forest and in the glen. He allows Revenna's machinations to sink into our minds so that we understand, at all times, what is at stake. Charlize Theron's performance here nicely over-the-top.Sanders is not as sharp, however, with Snow White. Kristin Stewart's performance is the polar opposite of Theron. Whereas Theron is exuberant and powerful, Stewart underplays the role of Snow White to the degree that she almost seems half asleep. I would go so far as to say that I think she is miscast. Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Jennifer Lawrence, Rooney Mara or Ellen Page are better choices.Still, I think that Snow White and the Huntsman is a movie that rises above its flaws. It is better than it could have been but it doesn't tip over into greatness. There may have been no way that it could have avoided coming down to a tired old storm-the-castle showdown, but it might have been nice if the screenplay could have used the same imagination in its third act that was put into that haunted forest. THAT would have been a great film."
295,"Another weekend has come upon us and yet another Snow White movie has emerged from the Hollywood idea swamp. This time leading the charge is none other than Kristen Stewart who has put her vampire affection to the side for a more human affection. The trailers for this movie have promised plenty of action and an adventure twist to the classic tale to help get a new audience in, but did the movie live up on its promise. Well saddle up my friends and get ready to take a ride as I give my two cents about Snow White and the Huntsmen that released this past Friday.For those who have missed the trailer flood, Snow White and the Huntsman is yet another tale of Snow White (Stewart) living in a world that has become corrupted by the evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron). The evil sorceress has used her magic to enslave the kingdom and poison the land, at the cost of accelerating her age to the point where she must continuously suck the beauty from maidens to live. Yet Snow White is able to break away from her step mother's iron grip and flee into the forest to avoid the fate the prophecy has foretold. In panic and anger, the queen sends the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to fetch Snow White, facing the dangers of the dark forest. From the trailer summary you would think this movie would be one wild adventure film with loads of action. To an extent it is, but the action they promise is actually more limited than anticipated, at least for me. Instead of epic sword fights, strategic moves, and clever use of sorcery, a majority of the fight scenes are brief skirmishes that involve spastic camera movements and screaming soldiers. Although a few scenes had some good choreography, most of the battles failed to impress me and instead fell victim to massive numbers of men swarming over one another, or falling down. What took the place of the action? The answer to that question is drama, as this movie is chock full of emotional stuffing that is used to develop the characters and story. Various scenes involve uncovering the backstory of the huntsman and snow white and making those more than just pretty faces. Other scenes are used to uncover the various levels of the queen and helping to make her seem more human than a classic Disney villain. Although I appreciate the commitment to character, I could have done with fewer of these scenes if it meant speeding up the pace and adding some more excitement. Some of the details they showed us were repeated too many times, which made the movie drag for me. A few of the scenes that showed the queen's fury were a bit overacted for me as well, and had me thinking more spoiled brat than evil queen. There was also an attempt to make a romantic triangle to help capture the audience in another Twilight emotional plot. However, the relationship aspect was rather shallow, though a lot less cheesy, and rushed throughout the movie. Despite the interesting, although predictable, story and background, there were a few things to help relieve the overdone drama. The dwarfs for instance had a number of comedic moments that helped relieve the tension, usually with a well-timed line or action. Hemsworth even had a few one liners to keep the audience interested, but his dialog was more serious and downtrodden. Aside from the comedy though there was nothing really spectacular about the dwarfs despite the epic cast. The acting was pretty good for most of the cast, and I focused my attention on their abilities to make the characters come to life. Theron captured the dark queen well, the malice seeming to naturally ooze off of her. Hemsworth as the huntsman was just like Thor minus the arrogant pride and Nordic way of speaking. Surprisingly Stewart was able to break free of her awkward Bella character, though not by much as she took on a little more of the leadership/talking role instead of just ogling vampires and abs. However before I finish this review, I have to say that the biggest positive to this movie is the presentation. In a manner similar to Avatar, the special effects and artists of this movie did a fantastic job bringing the fantasy world to life. The various scenes of the forest, the countless tours of the castle halls, and the majestic landscapes of the other climates were beautifully crafted to pull the audience in. Yet, there was also some rather elaborate creatures that looked decently real as well, helping to bring the imaginary/secret world into a reality. Those looking for beautiful art and a fantastic use of computer graphics and digital manipulation are sure to appreciate it.Okay so let's wrap this up. Overall SWATH is a new twist on the classic Disney movie that focuses a lot on character development. Although a number of things were rushed, and the action was a bit lacking, I did enjoy the background story for the most part. Again the fantasy world is beautiful, and is worth seeing on the big screen with high definition, though that might be the only thing I can recommend it for. It's worth a group outing, but aside from that don't get your hopes up for it being movie of the year. Check below for my scores: Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0 So until next week, keep enjoying the movies and remember to keep on reading my reviews. Thanks!"
296,"I may not have been given a poisoned apple upon entering the theater, but I was definitely put under a spell by Snow White and the Huntsman.To be perfectly honest, I am not the biggest Kristen Stewart fan, so I wasn't in love with seeing her in the beloved role of Snow White. However, after a few minutes into the movie, it didn't matter who was playing Snow White. Charlize Theron's 'Ravenna' (aka the evil queen) had everyone in the audience captivated, including me, and I remained under her spell until the very end of the film. It's not easy to be evil. Especially when the role requires one to be overly dramatic and simultaneously navigate an enormous amount of visual effects. But, Theron masterfully found the balance between being just outrageous enough without going into campy territory. There were other memorable performances as well. Chris Hemsworth did an excellent job as the Huntsman. I totally bought it. I also really liked Sam Claflin as 'William.' He is one to keep your eye on folks. Gorgeous and talented. Nice combo, and I can assure you we haven't seen the last of him.In addition to fantastic casting (I'm letting the Stewart casting slide, as she did an okay job), the visual effects were stunning. I still can't get over the adorable little fairies... I wanted to take them home with me! And the action scenes were amazing. Yes, there is action. And lots of it. There is truly something in this movie for everyone. Good vs. evil. Romance. Whimsy. But, more than anything it's a new twist on an old tale, and I applaud the creativity. This is not the story of Snow White you read as a child. I'm not going to give away all the delightful twists, just go see what I mean and check out Snow White and the Huntsman for yourself... but be prepared to fall under its spell."
297,"7.5 out of 10.I was intrigued by the idea of a modern retelling of the classic tale of Snow White. I don't think we've seen a major Hollywood production of the story since the Disney version. Well, Disney it is not. This is a darker and more mature interpretation for adults and slightly older kids.When I heard that Kristen Stewart would be playing the title role of Snow White, I have to say I had my doubts. We all know her as the clumsy and awkward Bella, but she really surprised me in this movie. This role is completely different from anything I've ever seen her do. She goes from being a princess to a prisoner to a fugitive to a warrior to a queen all within the space of a film. And all throughout, she does a good job of inhabiting the character. As in the classic tale, she is a kind and innocent young girl who cares deeply for those around her. You believe that she would sacrifice her life for a friend or even a creature she cares about. You also believe her determination to vanquish the evil Queen and restore peace to her father's kingdom.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Liam Hemsworth who plays the huntsman. The huntsman is a drunken widower instructed by the Queen to venture into the Dark Forest and bring Snow White back to the kingdom. But rather than capture her, he befriends her and protects her and eventually forms a connection with her. Liam was particularly great in a scene towards the end. Speaking to a seemingly lifeless Snow White, he expresses his sadness at having lost his first love and now her, too. I think someone else on the site put it well ‚Äì he does a good job of playing a brute with a heart. Charlize Theron plays the evil Queen to chilling perfection. I don't think anyone else could have done it quite like her. She is beautiful and menacing at the same time. With one look, she could freeze your blood. There are times when she's very cool and collected and then there are times when her anger just spits out at whomever she's closest to. We understand what drives her in this movie. In order to become immortal, she must consume the heart of the fairest one of all, Snow White. Vain and shallow though it may be, we understand her motivation, and Theron plays the Queen's desperation and frustration very convincingly. Of course, there were some areas where the movie lacked. The first and third acts were great, but the middle was slow in some parts. There was a lot of build up to the final confrontation that could have been shortened. I also think the ending was too abrupt. Too much was left to the imagination. Unless it was setting up for a sequel, in which case, I could forgive the ending. It seems like the filmmakers had a lot of great ideas and tried to cram them all into the movie without fully explaining them. This is where the pacing suffered. I would have preferred to see more time spent on character and relationship development. Taken as a whole, I enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining and well-acted and certainly an epic feast for the eyes. I would say if you enjoy fantasy films in the style of Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia, you will enjoy it. It's a great way to kick off the summer movie season."
298,"When I saw the trailer for this back last December, I immediately added it to my list of must-see movies this year. It seemed like it was going to be an epic adventure with great graphics, a gripping story and plenty of drama. Sadly, only the first of those three really holds true.For something running to just over 2 hours, I'm surprised at how little there was to this. As a fantasy movie judged on its own merit, it's extremely poor; the plot is a confused mishmash of standard film tropes, and the CGI shines in some places (notably any scene involving the Queen) but isn't all that special compared to the general standard of films today. Meanwhile, the elements central to the original fairytale - the 7 dwarfs and the poisoned apple - seem jammed in for no reason and detract from the storyline rather than add to it.On the whole, the acting was surprisingly good - one of the finer points of this film. Charlize Theron shines as the evil Queen Ravenna, doing a skillful job of preventing her character from seeming too one-sided by also showing her more insecure, vulnerable side. Kristen Stewart played a great Snow White; the shy, thoughtful, nice-girl acting style she's been lambasted by many for (Twilight, anyone?) made her extremely convincing as the naturally kind-hearted protagonist. As the two male love interests, Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin's characters contrast nicely as the rough-around-the edges yet practical huntsman and the romantic upper-class childhood sweetheart; I felt both of them were extremely believable. It's a shame the movie didn't expand more on the possible love triangle; it would have added some much-necessary drama that was suggested in the trailer but never really created properly here.Overall, I'd say go and watch this if you like fantasy movies enough or are looking for a good family movie to take the kids to see, but don't expect too much of it. It's a fairly ""moral"" film if you like that sort of thing, and raised a couple of interesting issues as to the importance of women's beauty in society, but I felt that both the standard of the acting (big-budget actors Stewart, Theron and Hemsworth do extremely well in their respective roles) and the work of what seems a very talented CGI department were sadly squandered by a script that didn't seem like it knew what to do with itself. A very disappointed 6/10."
299,"This is my first review, but I will try to touch up on everything that counts.The acting: I honestly thought everyone was great with the acting. Sure, you can still notice ""Bella"" in there (that weird mouth thing she does when she is nervous), but I think it was necessary because Snow White lived in a freaking tower most of her life. I thought she did very well in terms of acting fierce, but also thought they could've dwelled more on her turning into a warrior; they kind of just added the fact that she can suddenly use a sword...There wasn't' much time for character development. **Spoilers** Snow White wasn't even taught how to fight, and yet the summary says how the Huntsman teaches her. She is only taught a few fighting techniques, but that's it.The Queen was amazing, of course. I actually felt bad for her the most because she was a tragic character. I think the director obviously liked the queen more than Snow, because he focused a lot about her past and stuff. Chris was good, too. I feel like he should've been in the movie more. Overall, I don't agree with how the acting was terrible. I didn't wince when ANY of the characters spoke. Sure, there were some cheesy dialogue, but the acting made up for it. There was even a time when I teared up because you can feel the characters' pain.The Dwarfs: Comic-relief mostly. I didn't even know their names, but they were important to the story.The pacing: Ah, this is what prevented me from giving more stars. There were like ten second-scenes that were put in there that I thought were random. There were times when they randomly showed the queen and the scene duration was literally five seconds. I kept thinking, ""What? What was the point of that?"" Of course, we want to see how she is feeling (she IS a scene stealer!), but they could've maybe put it all in one scene instead of chopping it up. The whole movie was like a roller-coaster that goes up and down. There were moments when they were exciting, and then there were moments when they weren't. Scenes felt like they were chopped up; it wasn't really fluid.Visuals: Simply amazing! There were a lot of moments where I was just like ""Wow!"" or ""Aww!"" Romance?: Not really, sorry romantic movie fans! I feel like the director wanted a love-triangle going on, but was caught up with a bunch of other things that he totally forgot. You can't even tell who Snow White really likes. She does this one thing that you are left wondering, ""Oh, but I thought...""The ending: Not going to spoil it for you, but it was kind of disappointing. The last, oh, fifteen minutes were a rush until it let me down. The battle should've been longer, and the ending was predictable. Final notes: Despite all the things that I said that weren't good, I still give this a 7/10. Acting wasn't bad, visuals were stunning, story was good. It was just the pacing. And the ending. People should still see it unless you are easily bothered by chopped up scenes. It wasn't a boring movie, but it wasn't a movie that kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time."
300,"Before I went to see Snow White and the Huntsman, I'd gone and looked for reviews for this movie. I'd searched quite a lot and it got mixed review so I took note of the drawbacks of this movie and went to see it anyway so I could see for myself if the reviews were true or not. So this is how my little research goes:1. I expected excessive screaming and over the top performance from Charlize, I saw none. I think Charlize was perfectly fine! She played the evil queen, what do you expect? Through reviews, I expected her to always scream in the movie but no, she only screamed when it was necessary. She played the queen so perfectly I felt for the Queen, I understood why she did what she did. 2. I expected no emotions from Kristen Stewart, I saw quite a lot actually. I watched her played Snow White and at the end of the movie, I was sad. Sad for her and sad for the her haters. Her performance was outstanding! She was not that emotionless Bella from Twilight! She was this fierce, strong, passionate and sweet Snow White! In the movie she went from this scared little girl to a bad ass warrior, and the speech she gave at the end of the movie, it took my breath away. Please haters, you have eyes, but you do not see! You've let your hate clouds your judgement!3. I expected to be sleepy through out the movie, I felt none. The movie kept me on edge and I could hardly take my eyes off the screen.The movie was good, very good but I wouldn't say it was perfect though. It does have some drawbacks, like: the romance between Snow and Huntsman happens so quick it is almost unbelievable! One minute she was kissing William and the next Huntsman is the who was able to wake her up! another thing is that Huntsman didn't teach her anything. Could've put in the movie a few scenes where he trains her pr something....In conclusion, the movie was worth waiting for. It was an excellent take on the classic novel. I highly recommend it. I've seen some nasty reviews on this movie and I'd say it was absolutely bullshit. The movie was good, go see it, don't let others preventing you from having fun."
301,"People who can not accept that Shakespeare and many other great writers often borrowed stories from an earlier time and brought them up to date will fuss and fume about how this movie did not adhere to the version of this classic fairy tale as they know and love it. But as far as I am concerned this version of the Snow White tale is much better than the original for teenagers and adults alike. In addition to that it has platinum standard special effects, ten star performances out of the actors, award winning screen writing and award winning direction and cinematography. Stills of some of the scenes like the lake setting could be captured and enlarged and used as a main painting in your living room. John Newton Howard wrote a marvelous soundtrack for this film as well. I did not see it in 3D so I cannot speak to the quality of that effort but I assure you the non-3D version has spectacularly good quality graphics. I am very comfortable awarding this movie ten stars and strongly encourage anyone who loves a great adventure story to take a chance and view it."
302,"Very disappointing! A great idea and a few good sequences but some very bad writing! Hollywood doesn't seem to have any good writers any more. I think they don't really care about quality or art, they just want to get your money. They even tend to rate films based on attendance while you don't really know if you like it until you've seen it, it's all about deception and greed! Charlize Theron is a phenomenal actor and proves it once again. Kristen Stewart is no actor. That is evident here as it is in everything in which she has appeared. The CGI is fair but there is not enough of it. Most of the scenes in this film are primarily shadows of Europe's horrible monarchy history."
303,"I was enticed by it's title and short trailer, I thought this would be an interesting twist to the age old story; that snow white isn't so powerless and she actively leads resistance and/or her character was sort of wicked or brutal. But there was none of it.I believe many people would say this film had so much potential to make a great twist out of it, I agree. However, this film does have it's own merits; this film had excelled all other films in areas of old clich√©. The horrible witch queen, ominous phantom army - only initially, withered land, black forest, fearless but intellectually handicapped huntsmen. And let's not forget the all time favorite of traversing treacherous mountains, 20 minutes of it, and human's last stronghold.The up side is that, casting that vampire movie actress and ask her to act as if she's in a vampire is, in my humble opinion, great! The dove eyed and imaginative teenagers will surely love it and all the more eager to splash out their emotional support for this celluloid flop.I have tried really hard not to smash up my TV and the DVD box - which has to be returned - from frustration and boredness. This simplest verdict from me? I want my money back!"
304,"This is one of the most disjointed films I have ever seen, it has no plot line, no clincher, nothing. Poorly acted, copycat scenery and the director clearly could't make up his mind if he was making a Gothic horror or a fairy story. Some parts were absolutely pointless, as mentioned in previous reviews, you are left wondering what was the relevance of ANYTHING that you were shown!!!""Snow-white with a twist"", where was the twist? The fact that none of it made sense? Or that you just didn't care how it ended? Oh, wait, no, of course you knew how it ended it was so flaming predictable. I couldn't agree more with the previous review, it was like segments of: LOTR's, Narnia and the Borrowers, had been ripped off unsuccessfully and stapled haphazardly together. Kristen Steward, sigh, awful. The poor girl can't act to save her life: heavy breathing and looking like she needs a good nights sleep. The fairest of them all? There's hope for us all so. Not that any of the characters really shone at all, Charlize tried her best but ""Mirror mirror on the wall...."" cringe-worthy.Some of the effects were good but then totally ruined by silly little fairy creatures and ugh, just, pass me the bucket. Nothing was consistent to create a flow through the film.Watch this film if you enjoy films that go absolutely no-where and feel completely redundant."
305,"I definitely had higher expectations for this movie due to the cast. I am usually entertained quite easily and enjoy almost all movies. I'm the girl that comes out of a movie thinking 'that was a good movie,' when everyone else thought it was crap. I'm THAT girl. However, I recall sitting in the theatre watching this film, and I actually wanted to leave, which is a very rare circumstance for me. This dark fairy tale remake was definitely a low grade on my rating scale.Charlize Theron was the wicked stepmother, Ravenna, in this film and did a horrible job portraying this character. It was not one of her strongest roles and I felt her acting was too over the top and exaggerated. Kristen Stewart was the leading role, Snow White, in this film and as in any other film she's been in, her acting was very dull and blank. I found that she was a bit too contemporary for this role and just didn't quite 'fit in' to the era of the movie. Chris Hemsworth, who already had great success this year in ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Avengers,"" probably was the best performance in this film. Needless to say, he was also the reason I ended up sitting in my seat for the whole duration of the movie. The director, Rupert Sanders is a first-time feature director, which may also explain why I did not enjoy this film. The scenes dragged on a bit too much and there was no climax, character development or much of anything besides impressive visual effects and some slick action scenes.The plot is the typical kingdom plunged into darkness ruled by Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) after she kills the King and banishes Snow White (Kristen Stewart) into a cell in the castle. Snow White ends up escaping and Ravenna hires the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to capture her which inevitably turns into a love story where they start developing feelings for one another as they go through this adventure in the woods together trying to escape Ravenna. The story is steered by Ravenna's only motivation to remain beautiful and youthful. The genre of this movie falls under an umbrella of action, adventure, drama and a bit of sci-fi. Unfortunately, none of the magic translated to the plot or the characters and the classic fairy story was just too stretched out at a breaking point of over two hours."

307,"This movie is just awful, the trailer is so well done comparing to the two hours I spent watching this. The only good thing in this movie is Charlize Theron.Stewart is once again awful and NO SHE CAN'T PLAY. Her monologue before the final fight, is..painful. you don't know if you want to laugh or cry. I'm not even talking about the fantastic universe and the odd creatures created by...I don't even want to know from which brain those ridiculous things/animals came out. Don't waste your time...really"
308,"This is one of those rare occasion where the movie is, sadly, really bad. One of the worst movie ever seen. There are so many errors in this movie that the best way to express this review is by levels: the plot, the acting, the rhythm, the soundtrack. Unfortunately there are flaws on each and one of them. If you can go watching something else, do it. It is almost a complete waste of time.Let's start from the plot. Even if it touches some interesting points, and is somehow close to the fairy tale, it seems to forget some important passages. In the classic version, one critical scene is when the huntsman sent by the queen to kill Snow White, is about to accomplish his mission. There is a moment of conversion, when the huntsman - dagger at hand- is about to rip her heart (in the original tale it was not the heart but her liver and lungs). In the Grimm tale,as well as the following versions, it is in that exact moment that the huntsman finds himself unable to kill Snow White, since he fell in love with her. It's a different plot, you may reply, therefore there is no need to show his compassion and love in the same way as the fairy tale. Sure. But when does the huntsman understand that he is in love with her in the movie then? There is not a linear construction for his feelings, since he is still in love with his wife and ""willing to die to see her again"". The part of her doing house-duties for the 7 dwarfs in exchange of hospitality is completely ignored. Fine, but shouldn't you depict her inner beauty, her kindness, gentleness, and her need of protection some other way then? The only things that she does in the movie to show her inner beauty is playing with a little girl for a couple of seconds, look into a troll eye (?!?) after screaming at him (?????!!), and admiring the beauty of animals and flowers in the forest. This is not a way of proving her beauty, this is a way of just stating her beauty. A terrible attempt. She is being imprisoned for about 10 years with no explanation. While in the Grimm version there is nothing about her being imprisoned, in earlier versions of the tale she is just 7 when the magic mirror states that ""she is the fairest of them all"". Why should you place a little girl in prison for ten years or more? Was the queen intentioned to ""steal"" her beauty from the beginning? Was the queen pitying? Should we feel more sympathetic towards her because the evil queen, who already killed her father, had imprisoned her? If so, why does she have - first scene of the grown-up Snow White- all she needs to make a fire inside the prison tower? Let assume there was a logical reason, I am currently missing, and proceed. Her escape. She uses a nail to hit the queen brother, and lock him in her cell, and escape from the castle from the sewer. The prince, who says that has never laid a finger on her before that moment, is depicted now as a maniac, approaching her body and about to rape her (he is already touching something). Why? In the entire movie, this character is depicted as subjected to his sister,the evil queen. But in some scene the feeling seems in contrast: first she loves her (as a brother or more? I don't want to talk about this),then she is ruled by her, sometime in contrast, sometime he feel sorry for her. When he died, far away from the castle, she feels his pain and the bond between the two seems more magical than real.. During the escape snow white enters ""the dark forest"". Obviously who enters rarely survive. I can accept that, but which are the dangers of the dark forest then? The only dangerous things we are shown are the hallucinations. what hallucinations, produced by whom? Obviously once again it is the most banal, trite of the possibility: produced by hallucinogenic plants who turn the fears of whom who breathed their gas into hallucinations. Couldn't they come up with something better? Or at least something different? Unfortunately they did. At the border of the forest, Snow White and the huntsman found a Troll. If you are starting to feel like something is wrong here, and a deja vu, hold yourself. The best is yet to come. She is somehow able to calm the troll with her eyes after shouting at it. Is it something new? Not really. Something different? Well, for Snow White it is. Was it funny? Not really.. Finally the 7 dwarfs. This is one of the few things faithful to the original version. They are gold-miners. You hear them brag about the evil queen who killed the majority of them. What I don't understand is why one of them should be one blind, and is obviously able to see her real beauty."
309,"If this was an in flight movie I would walk off! Kristen Stewart was born to play Bella Swan..and that's ALL she was born to play! There was zero chemistry onset with the actors. The story is lacking, boring, unreasonable,retarded...the list goes on. I love fairy tales but this was so boring I was rooting for Ravena to off the cast so i could go home. This story is empty. I'm saying don't waste your time watching this at home for free! One of the worst movies I saw ever (and i saw Pathfinder,Dragon wars & 10000 BC). I have no idea how this scored so highly, perhaps the hot actors . Chris Hemsworth performance was lifeless as well, evidently he too was born to play Thor and only Thor. Charlize Theron did give one life to he character. I made appoint to write this review(my very 1st) as I sat 20 minutes into the film wishing it would be over!"
310,"I was so looking forward to watching this movie but after the first 15 minutes all i could do was be very confused. The director/s vision of this movie is rather confusing, it flits from darkness to fantasy to war in a rather disjointed manner. Charlize Theron is probably the best in the acting stakes (in this movie) but still comes across forced, her diction is strange & sounds artificial. Kristen Stewart : i expected all sorts of ""breaking the mould"" scenarios but she sulked, looked pained for most of the movie & mumbled her lines very indistinctly..so all in all more of Twilights Bella! Of the rest of the cast, the Dwarfs were OK enough, Chris Hemsworth was a dish & so on..but there was no depth to the story..a LOT of loose ends & segueing blindly from scene to scene. The dialogues were atrocious to say the least..almost like a school play! All in all i really wanted to like this movie & would have forgiven a lot of flaws but it still was BAD!"
311,"I had to go to this movie for a birthday and despite my expectations i watched it with an open mind. this only got me so far. the effects were stunning and it was a truly beautiful film to look at, but it was overshadowed by bad acting, clich√©s and a lazy storyline.Kristen Stewart had her usual look of constipation throughout the entire film. she was awkward and it was uncomfortable to sit and watch her. she has improved since twilight but that does not say much. the biggest surprise was charlize Theron. I thought she would at least deliver but she overplayed the dark queen thing and simply yelled and cried her way through the entire film. the entire storyline was boring and predictable the vague attempts to create twists failed because they were so carelessly intertwined into the film. the original content that it managed to add to the story of snow white was added in an extremely unoriginal way which spoiled what could have been probably a better movie.the visual effects were stunning and it was obvious that that was where all the efforts of the film went. however they so resembled effects from other films of this genre and seemed utterly ridiculous alongside the bad acting and terrible storyline.it was a really unbalanced film and I really would recommend you to stay home and watch one of the films this was copied off of instead because you'll end up having a much better night."
312,"First of all, I have not seen her in the Twilight movies, but Kristin Stewart is an insipid actress. This is my opinion wholly formed during this movie. This is not a bad thing, necessarily: Keanu Reeves has made a pretty decent career out of being a mostly insipid actor. The Matrix is an excellent example of surrounding such actors with really good material that lets you ignore the terrible acting. This movie is not the Matrix.This movie felt to me like someone had a bunch of really cool ideas for visual images (and they are very cool and well done) but didn't really have a coherent narrative to connect them or give much thought to reasons for these images to be present. The director also obviously schooled all his actors in the fine art of yelling as a substitute for emoting subtly. Charlize Theron impressed me with subtlety in Monster. Here, she and every other actor will yell lines for emphasis and as a substitute for emotion. It gets rather silly most of the time.There are also a number of inconsistencies with the story. What exactly is Snow White's superpower or why is she special, aside from being apparently super hot (hammered home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer through the course of the movie)? Why is it necessary to have two possible male leads mooning over Snow White? Surely either the Huntsman or William would suffice by themselves? It's as if the studios spent so much money for Kristen Stewart that they have to protect their investment by hiring two men per movie to be romantically interested in her to make the audience believe she's worthy of being the leading lady. Why is the Huntsman physically weaker than the queen's brother at some instances, and strong enough to repel several soldiers in another? What is the point of most of the pretty locations Snow White travels to (where she is also instantly tracked by the queen's men) aside from visual eye candy? What was the point of the dwarfs, aside from letting them crawl through a gutter for Snow White? Why does K-Stew wear full body armor and leave her head unprotected for any archer to pick off? Why does the queen's obviously superior army need to fear a group of at most 80 people marching on her heavily fortified castle? After going through an elaborate charade to poison Snow White with the apple, why does the queen stand and make a speech about love and betrayal instead of efficiently ripping out Snow White's heart and becoming immortal forever? And most fundamental of all: why is Snow White even kept alive after the queen kills off the king and his loyal retainers? Surely keeping progeny of a beloved monarch alive to grow up and head a rebellion seem far too obvious for someone like the queen, who claims to have subdued many kingdoms?In a nutshell, this movie had some cool visual effects but not much else to recommend it. Watch only if desperate for something to watch this summer."
313,"If you expect something original, or at least, funny - don't! The director has to consider a career change. If you are able to spoil Charlize Theron's acting skills and put them in this hysterical mockery of an act - you should be banned from the guild. And not to forget the expressionless face of our Snow White - for the sake of love, what the hell is happening to Stuart? Not that she ever had an expression, but this was even worse than before. Being silent for 7/8 of the film and somehow in the middle of nowhere comes an ""inspiring"" speech, half of which was screams, the other half horrid, meaningless bulls**t?!? Not to mention the huge gaps in the story. We all know the plot, but they could have explained better the link between the queen and her brother and the nature of their magic. Also the legend behind the white stag's appearance. The ""love"" triangle was poorly presented, at best. To say there was no love story would be more correct. The final line was completely out of this world - ""You can't have my heart"" - the hell I just heard? It's still hanging in the nothingness. That's not nearly all. Stuart never smiled, looked like she has a severe case of gastric acid, and never even looked in either of the men with more than obvious boredom. What angered me most where the obvious ""references"" to other fantasy films/books. Seemed like there was an endless row of ""stolen"" moments/figures/characters/ideas from other fiction products. If MPAA credits this as a ""intense sequences of violence and action, and brief sensuality"" they should review their crediting system, like now. So, in short, poor acting, poorer directing and stupid screenplay. If you really have to kill some time and have absolutely nothing to do - go for it. Otherwise - don't waste your time and money on it. Excuse my poor English, it's not maternal to me, and have a nice day."
314,"This movie was so bad. Kristen Stewart, as always, can't act, she doesn't know how to. The dialogs where forced so the movie didn't flow correctly and it was way to slow. Instead of tuning into the emotions of the movie I was laughing with my friend about all the inconsistencies. They tried to use so scenery to make it more worthwhile, which was OK but made it even slower.The only good things about the movie were: Charlize Theron, that is an excellent actress and knows exactly what she is doing and how to portrait herself.Chris Hemsworth, how is a good enough actor and he's so hot is worthy just to look at him. The costumes for me where the best of the movie, perfectly designed, perfectly executed, they were gorgeous. Don't waste your time and money in this movie, watch it on t.v. when you are bored because it doesn't deserve you paying for it."
315,"Let's start with good stuff: the costumes, make-up, visuals and production design are mesmerizing. If you are really-really big fan of Charlize Theron or Chris Hemsworth, they both are doing quite a descent job grinning, screaming and narrowing their eyes. The beginning of the movie is quite intriguing: representation of a snow-white story from an angle, snow, blood, everything is at place. But once Kristen shows up the movie goes down with an increasing script. The Snowwhite is trapped in a tower BUT provided a dress, a pair of jeans and descent leather boots - just enough to escape. She jumps off the cliff and emerges on a shore nearby to find....a horse! Am I the only one realizing the script is a bit off? The queen in need of a heart is sending the Huntsman out to the forest, who is of course a self-destructive alcoholic trying to drawn vogue fears of his past in some kind of liquor. He goes on a journey with queen's brother - who is one of the dullest and most cartoonish characters in the entire movie. However, he is not the only character we feel absolutely nothing about: Snow White barely has any lines throughout the entire movie, which makes extremely hard to understand why the Huntsman develops any kind of affection to her at the first place. And even if he does, forget about any kind of chemistry: the characters are simply floating about the screen like fish in a tank. Oh, and there is Prince Charming, who definitely lacks sense of direction since he keeps on riding back and forth between the castle and the forest, without getting tired, and eventually, instead of meeting Snow White who is supposedly on her way to the castle, bumps into her pursuers and joins them for absolutely no good reason.And to top off this extremely flat and inconveniencing story, the movie lacks its climax, the viewers are lured into some kind of final battle which ends exactly the way we knew it would from the very beginning and leaves no clue why would we watch the whole thing at the first place.To sum up: don't waste your money watching stories with Kristen Stewart, if you know how they going to end from the very beginning. And if you happened to - try to count close ups without her front teeth showing. My count went up to four. Cheers."
316,"The only redeeming quality of Snow White and The Huntsman was Charlize Theron. Other than her performance, the movie was a disappointment. Kristen Stewart is incapable of moving the upper half of her face and, therefore, incapable of great acting. I'll admit, though, I could tell that she felt the part...But she did not MAKE ME FEEL IT - And that's what separates the good from the great.Turning a 7 page short story into a 2+ hour film is impossible without changing the story some, but certain parts I would have rather had kept original because changing these parts is akin to re-cutting a perfectly cut diamond. In particular, the part in the beginning of the original story when the queen pricks her finger on a spindle and wishes for a daughter with ""hair black as ebony, lips red as blood, and skin white as snow"" has been completely redone, and although it was done creatively and in the dark fashion of the original, there was no point in changing it. Also, the way in which the evil queen dies should have been kept original. IMO. Visually, the movie was done masterfully. I'll give them that. The composition of the framing, the use of scale and color, the special effects and the costumes all lent a pleasing dramatic effect, which is probably what most people are looking for when they go to see this movie. I loved the scene where the evil queen takes a bath in milk!If they were going to change the story as much as they did and let evil queen steal the show, then they could have made the movie better by elaborating on her past. Or they could have just cast someone who can act to play Snow White."
317,"This was a such a weird, yet somehow captivating movie... I don't even know where to start... Some beautiful pieces of landscape teeming with computer generated life for some part of the movie, shadowed by some weak plot and childish combat scenes, all coming together to a confusing end that everyone's expecting but is in no way a convincing conclusion... That should sum it all up in the confusing way of the movie.Almost good job from a first time director. It all looks good, and, being his first movie, I can forgive the unnecessary stealing from classics like Princess Mononoke , Lord of the Rings and Pan's Labyrinth. Even if most of the beautiful shots are not really connected to the story, eye candy is still eye candy and we all have a little craving for this kind of sweets. What this movie lacks is a pace. Sometimes way too slow, almost dragging the scene into an early grave, sometimes so fast you can't even follow the action, the pace always manages to annoy the viewer, making a two hour movie seem longer than three hours.The actors... Charlize Theron makes a convincing queen. A bit overacted, but the scenes where she gets to scream are fantastic. Trust me, you do not want to mess with this evil queen. She'll take you back to school in five seconds. Reminds me of my evil first grade teacher. That woman could really scream...Chris Hemsworth is getting better with each movie. I don't know why he needed the accent in this one, but thumbs up for trying. It's not a perfect accent, it seems a bit forced, but it goes along just fine.Kristen Stewart and her love triangles are becoming very annoying. In this movie she has a ten second scene with her mouth closed, but, for the rest, it's Bella Swan torn between some weird creatures all over again and that mouth just doesn't close. I mean, this is just ridiculous. There is heavy smoke from the fire, poisonous fumes from the swamp, wind, snow and fairy dust... and that flytrap refuses to close. The dwarfs were very very good, but greatly underused. I could have watched another hour of this movie just for them.The story is weak and with many plot holes. A nice try for a dark version of a classic tale, but it could have been much more. I liked this version of the queen. Evil is not entirely evil and this is a nice twist. But if you start on this path, then good should not be all that good. And this part is completely missing from the movie. Snow White is whiter than snow. Maybe killing another human being, or scaring another for life could have changed her a bit, but I don't see it in this film.Overall, I'd have to say I wasn't disappointed. But I wasn't impressed either. So this movie gets only 6 out of 10 from me."
318,"For the first hour I was enjoying it. It had an actual story (a fairy story but why not?), the characters were not unbelievable, the actors seemed to have a grip on their parts (Charlize Theron had a half-nelson on hers but she's good to look at), the pacing was great, the visuals were just right, and everything looked set for a fine time. Then what happened? The dwarfs happened. They started off well too. But then it seemed like someone got cold feet and decided a Grimm's Fairytale was too grim for a modern audience. Suddenly we're into an Avatar-like CGI fairy land, and the plot has gone into a sub-Avatar 'life force meets she who will do right by it' dead end. We get a mystical white hart out of Harry Potter, we get the dwarfs recovering from their lumbago and constipation because Snow White is among them, we get another mind-numbing drivel-powered subplot that seems to be meant to encourage the down-trodden masses to rise against their oppressors. We get wee little fairies who were taking their stage directions out of 'Hook'. What happened to the story? Oh, here it is, Snow White eats the poisoned apple in a great scene that put some life back into the thing, but then we were off into 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Braveheart'. Dudes, I was saying to my popcorn, keep your heads down because this has started to seriously suck.Then between some other random scenes that did nothing to restore any sense of hope the Prince/Dukes' son kisses Snow White but it's a revivification fail. Then the Huntsman kisses Snow White and she comes back to life in time to tell the Duke to get off his butt and risk the lives of all his subjects in some more LOTR/Braveheart scenes. Oh, here are the dwarfs again. Ah, the showdown between SW and Evil Queen. What point are they making here? Hard to tell. Don't suck the life out of virgins? Don't be nasty to people? Stay away from mirrors? The EQ dies. SW becomes a Good Queen. Phew, so far by my watch we could easily have done without 45 minutes of gratuitous drivel and plagiarism from some much better movies, but maybe the director has just been setting us up for the big spectacularly mushy happy ever after ending. Omigod, it's more drivel. Fine, fine, come on buddy lets do the needful now and get SW with the Huntsman and end the thing. But no. The last scene is a digitized loop of happy undowntrodden masses shouting let's hear it for the queen and I guess we're supposed to be intrigued wondering who SW chooses for her husband. Why are we supposed to be wondering that? My guess is that they had a better ending but polled it and found that some of the test audience liked SW pairing up with the Huntsman and some traditionalists wanted her to end up with the Prince/Duke's son, so they split the difference. Yawn."
319,"I'm not going to bother with details - there's been more than enough discussion about them already. It's a good thing I'm a big fan of Theron because I would have otherwise gone to sleep in this film. Yes, it contained some great photography and scenes. But, that's about all I can say for it, except maybe, been there and done that way too many times in the past. I will say that it was at least better than Mirror, Mirror, which was a real dud. The storyline was lame and nothing more than warmed over hacking of many earlier attempts at doing justice to the tale of Snow White.Kristen Stewart was hopelessly miscast for the role of Snow White. I've never seen any of the Twilight movies, but then, I'm hardly a candidate for them. Anyway, her performance in this film was virtually flat-line. Also, I think it was a big mistake to have her go from the appearance she maintained through most of them film to a Joan of Arc type in the final part. It didn't work for me."
320,"The film begins promisingly with visual flairs and then goes downhill rapidly. I find the first hour of the film more engaging than the second half though still too long.The movie is marred by weak storytelling and predictability. The battle scenes are flat compared to films of similar genre (say UnderWorld) with run of the mill action sequences (using CGI) that refuse to thrill. The protagonist (snow white) remains stoic throughout the movie with barely a flinch of emotion. The same can be said for most of the other characters.A sense of purpose permeates the film towards its expected ending and the direction would not make room for humor, suspense or incidental detours. This is a serious film about Snow White and no it could not be fun and exciting at the same time.The fairy forest set is enchanting but cannot hold a candle to a Miyazaki or Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton scene. The beautiful CGIs are wasted against a weak plot, poor direction and boring dialog.In short, a rather disappointing action movie and not really worth sitting through 2 hours of in a theater."
321,"It has been common to release films that seek to update old fairy tales, which seem to have gone out of style. So we never quite know what we're going to find when we're going to watch a movie based on a fairy tale: personally, I still prefer movies closer to the original tales but my taste, I acknowledge, doesn't seem to agree with the preferences of most people. However, I liked this movie, and it seemed to me good enough, turning the original tale into a story about revolt and resistance, in which the princess turns into a political and military leader, a mixture of Martin Luther King and Joan of Arc. This has its merit and its potential, although I think it was an option that wasn't taken to improve the film but only to transform the fragile princess of the original tale in a woman more acceptable for today's youngsters, removing the misogyny with which feminists usually accuse traditional tales. Nothing against, but if that was so, it was a good choice made for the worst reasons.Although I enjoyed the film overall, there are points in the story that I think the script sank, starting with love. The film shoots in all directions and misses all: the love story between the Princess and the Prince is never more than a teenage platonism while all the attempts made to suggest an infatuation of the Huntsman end up looking ridiculous for never materializing in something. Another problem is the Dwarfs, who have been stripped of their dignity and transformed into mere props, very convenient for solving one or two complicated situations but totally irrelevant to the story itself.Visually, the film is wonderful but that was to be expected in a film with much of its budget was for technical issues. The CGI is good but sins because its excessive, being so strong and abundant that at times it becomes clearly unrealistic. Its great, but we never feel danger or fear... this is evident in action scenes, where fightings looks like dances. I liked the medieval look, reminded me a little ""Game of Thrones"". Cinematography, sets and costumes also fit very well and was magnificent, especially with the excellent soundtrack, by James Newton Howard.As far as the actors and characters are concerned there is so much to say that I decided, contrary to my writing habits, to leave the subject to the end. I may start by saying that I find the characters generally undeveloped. The only characters that really get room to develop are Queen Ravenna and the Huntsman. Both have some common characteristics, like their painful personal past, with very strong psychological notes. This allowed the actors (Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, respectively) to have better material to work with, which had an immediate impact on their performance. In fact, Theron dominated the film, in one of her best performances to date, while Hemsworth proved to be able to do much more than he did in ""Thor"". All the other characters were very vague and had no personality at all. The dwarfs, as I've already said, were stripped of relevancy, so the actors who gave them life (some of them as prestigious as Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane or Ray Winstone) didn't have much to do. Sam Claflin also tried to do something good but his character seems to exist only to ""fill the sausage"" (as we usually say in Portugal when something is placed only to occupy an empty space) and therefore is quickly discarded. The same thing applies to Sam Spruell, whose character is totally redundant.And what can we talk about Kristen Stewart, who played the lead role? Personally, I've always disliked this actress. Those who watch her early works (""Zathura"", for example) are able to see some potential, but the truth is that she wasn't able to develop it and become a good actress. She was very deified by ""Twilight"" in an irrational attitude by fans driven by the impulse and not by an analytical judgment. Personally, I have nothing against her, I just think she's in the wrong profession, has no talent and is not as pretty as people say. She has a very strange look, being too thin and having such weird eyes that remind me of a half-dead lamb. As an actress, she looks like an ice-cold robot, being unable to create some chemistry with her colleagues or showing a trace of human emotion. So the choice of this girl for the lead role was an epic casting error, only amenable to an explanation: the attempt to conquer the audience that liked ""Twilight"" and turned the girl into a teen idol. Its the only explanation for a decision that completely ruined the main character and compromised the entire film. I think it would have been preferable to continue the whole movie with little Raffey Cassidy (the little girl who gave birth to the main character as a child), who made an excellent interpretation. Since they changed the whole story, why not?Moral of the story: there is no love equal to the first one. Those who grew up listening to the original tale will never do without it in favor of a modern rereading. Visually great, the film is an unbelievable but gorgeous CGI overdose, with a remarkable but under-appreciated cast, poorly developed characters, a great Charlize Theron and a satisfying Chris Hemsworth. Unfortunately, a casting error compromised all the movie and, instead of a great actress in the lead role, we had Kristen Stewart, who I eagerly want to see spending more time fishing than acting."
322,"Incredibly bad, and not just because the cast includes Kristen Stewart.Like the plot, the movie was always going to be a massive confrontation between two strong forces: -the forces of good, being Charlize Theron's acting ability and the fact that she tends to act in good dramas, vs -the forces of evil, being Kristen Stewart's complete lack of acting ability and the fact that she only acts in crap movies (Into the Wild was an exception, but she only had a minor part in that, so doesn't count). Unfortunately, the forces of evil won out in a big way and the movie was craptacular.Kristen Stewart should have been enough to tip the movie into the ""bad"" side of the scale, but she is aided and abetted here by the director and Chris Hemsworth. Director Rupert Sanders is clearly of the Michael Bay all-style, no substance variety. Lots of clever CGI, plot is basic, if existent.Chris Hemsworth delivers possibly the worst, most irritating, Scottish accent ever. The accent might actually have been worse than Kristen Stewart's acting, if that is possible. Charlize Theron must have needed the money, to appear in this schlock. She does the best she can with a dud script though."
323,"Snow White and the Hunstman gets almost nothing right. From the very start it feels like a false product. The look and sound of it feels too dark and grimy for it to seem like a proper fairy tale. And yes, the original Snow White is a dark tale, even the Disney version to some degree. But when it feels more slimy and polluted than anything else, it's going too far. So yeah, not a big fan of the art design in this one.And then they want and cast Kristen Steward as Snow White. Now, when I think ""skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony"", Steward isn't exactly the first gall to pop into my mind. And then she simply stands there, her mouth hanging open in every scene (it's a good challenge to try and find a scene where she closes her mouth even once), barely acting and simply not bringing any presence into the role.Not that the rest of the actors are all that much better. Even Chris Hemsworth cannot bring any joy and excitement into this borefest, because the script cannot handle three separate dimensions in a character.And then there's the story, which I honestly can no longer remember in any significant detail. And it hasn't been even a week since I saw this film. It tries to turn the story into a more adventurous form, with Snow White being more active participant in the overturning of the queendom, but it simply fails to captivate its audience, being more interested in pointing and laughing at the redneck dwarfs or throwing more grime and dirt onto our optic nerves. And when the final battle rolls in, I was actually cheering for the queen, because she had had less screen time, thus I didn't loathe her as much.This movie doesn't deserve to exist. If you've ever loved the original fairy tale or the beloved Disney classic, don't see this film. The gut punch is not worth satisfying your curiosity."
324,"The film tells the story of Snow White, a princess who is imprisoned by her stepmother who also killed Snow White father, the king.There are two main characters in this film. Snow White, interpreted by Kristen Stewart, and her evil stepmother interpreted by Charlize Theron. May be this is not the best of Charlize Theron films (Not her fault), but she acts well enough to outshine the bland acting of Kristen Stewart. Did you think she was that way in Twilight because that was part of her role? She acts exactly the same way in this film, so I don't think so. The only role of Kristen in this films seem to be making Charlize Theron glow even brighter by comparison."
325,"Snow White is one of the oldest fairy tales ever written. Also the one most recently turned into a feature film. Less than three months ago, in fact. Is this Universal Pictures offering better or just some carbon copy?Snow White (played as a young woman by Raffey Cassidy) is the child of a benevolent king and a woman who died as a result of complications arising from childbirth. Despite her tragedy, however, she has a happy childhood. Then her father takes up arms against a dark army. The soldiers in that army, while capable of striking blows as fierce as any and fiercer than some, breaks like glass when struck by the enemy. With the dark army vanquished, the king inspects a carriage that survived the battle and finds a woman inside. The woman, Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron), soon marries the king who fell in love with her at first sight. She appears to have genuine affection for the king and Snow in the short period leading up to the wedding, but that is, of course, a ruse. On their wedding night, she murders her husband while her brother Finn (played by Sam Spruell) overruns the kingdom with the help of that same dark army that the king believed had kidnapped Ravenna. Snow attempts to flee, but is captured and imprisoned in the palace tower. Years pass and Ravenna maintains her beauty and youth by draining the life from young women whose beauty might one day surpass her own. Those women are identified by the queen's mirror and chief adviser (voiced by Christopher Obi Ogugwa). When she reaches adulthood, the mirror tells Ravenna that she may maintain her youth indefinitely if she kills Snow White and takes out her heart. Snow (now played by Kristen Stewart) escapes the kingdom when the queen sends her brother to escort her. Obviously, there's a great deal more to the story. For example, the Huntsman has yet to be introduced. Neither, for that matter, have the dwarfs. And in this film, the men portraying the dwarfs are of average or above average stature made to look like dwarfs through the use of special effects as opposed to men who are actually shorter than 4'10"". There are comparisons being made between this film and Mirror Mirror, but they have very little in common, outside of the main characters. If more time had passed between the release dates, they'd stand separately and they should. It's like comparing Ridley Scott's Robin Hood to Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I won't say this film lived up to the hype but, given the degree, I doubt any film could've. I will say it's a quality film and you should see it."
326,"Snow White and the Huntsman represents a directorial debut for Rupert Sanders and as first forays into film go, this isn't at all bad. In fact the mixture of classic ideas (such as El Cid) with his own panache allows for some excellent and memorable scenes in a retelling of a classic tale. Credit should also go to Cinematographer Greig Fraser for getting the best out of the shots. The film opens with a montage of scenes explaining how the ""evil"" queen came to power. This is narrated by Chris Hemsworth's character, The Huntsman, in an accent that can be best described as unique; flitting from Irish to Scottish with some American overtones. Thankfully he is the only main character to use the accent and Hemsworth is a talented enough actor to shine through. Theron is better as the Queen, disturbing, tragic and therefore not truly evil, and well countered by Spruell, as her brother. The dwarfs, a selection of great actors, add a good further dimension and Clafin, as William, works well with what he's got. This leaves Stewart, and other reviews criticisms of her acting aren't completely fair. Yes she is a little wooden in certain scenes but in others, such as the rallying of the troops, she manages to create the required gravitas and knows how to move with grace.The story has been modernised and adapted well, with much stronger female characters in both the Queen and Snow White. This does not distract from the storytelling but there are also some oddities, such as the Dark Forrest, which, whilst allowing The Huntsman to meet Snow White, loses some of its message about Snow White's nature; until they leave and encounter the troll. The fairies also seem rather irrelevant and all together this makes the film slightly longer than it should have been.However there is a steady progression and scenes such as the White Hart, William and The Huntsman fighting the crows and the spectacle of seeing large numbers of mounted knights charging through forest, over hill or along beach are wonderfully captured and memorable. The ""evil"" Queen's death is also well handled and it is nice to see a film that does not demonise its enemy and allows her to die tragically, literally wheezing to expiry after she has been stabbed.It will be interesting what Sanders goes on to do next and whether he will curtail some of his ideas to make a finer, tighter package. Having said this Snow White and The Huntsman captures the imagination and engages with its fantasy tale well. An entertaining and worthwhile watch."
327,"I, like many others have a love hate relationship with adaptation films so when i heard they were doing snow white i got excited but then saw who was in it. It was very difficult while watching the movie to get past seeing The huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) as Thor and seeing snow white (Kristen Stewart) as Bella. despite that the movie in general was shot beautifully. the various angles in certain scenes really brought the story to life. Once again Kristen Stewart was a bit emotionless but she did much better in my opinion during this film then her previous. The star of the movie is clearly The queen (charlize Theron). she really is the villain we love to hate. Overall i would say it wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular."
328,"Another summer film that I was truly shocked that I enjoyed (i.e. Battleship)!!!! After seeing the crap that was ""Mirror, Mirror"", I had absolutely not motivation, desire, or drive to see this film; however, I am pleasantly surprised that I did!!!!When she's not pining over dead vampires or looking like death warm over, Kristen Stewart (Snow White) is really quite pretty, and can actually act. However, this film's true star is Charlize Theron (Ravenna) as the evil, wicked Queen! A role that she was born to play, a woman so beautiful in one scene, and ghastly ugly in the next; she gives new meaning to the word despicable. Chris Hemsworth stars as the Huntsman, originally hired to track Snow White down in the Black Forest; again reprising his Thor's voice for this role¬Ö (the dude really needs a voice coach or every role he acts in will be Thor teaches school, Thor as a cop, Thor the male stripper¬Ö.. enough already with the Nordic accent)!!!!!The film is visually stunning, and the special effects are exceptional. The Black Forest is truly dark, eerie, and wickedly creepy, while Sanctuary (the Enchanted Forest) is all that is beautiful to behold.The script is well written, and the action sequences are well gaffed!!! It was like Grimm's Fairy tales meet ""Braveheart"". Rated PG-13 for the very visual fighting sequences; however, there is no severed limbs or blood splatter.Again, I really did enjoy this refreshing retelling of the classic fairy tale. It's fresh, exciting, and well presented. I highly recommend. There has been some negative press regarding the roles of the dwarfs in this film not being awarded to little people; however, I truly believe that Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and crew performed superbly.SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL""."
329,"I was shocked that this version of Snow White was actually good. I was expecting something insipid especially since Kristin Stewart was in it. The big surprise was Cherize Theron. She plays the best evil queen ever. Her sinister faces and insane demeanor wins the prize. She's about as evil as you can get. Yet, you have to admire her. She's been through hell herself. She traded her soul for beauty and power as a young girl. She has the task of swallowing up kingdoms and delivering them into darkness. The special effects were really good. Very much up to par. Lovely sets and great acting by the whole cast. Sadly to say, Kristin Stewart looks good in this movie even if its hard to believe her the paragon of innocence and beauty. I believe this will be a classic version of Snow White right away. Its a cut above the other ""glut"" of Snow White stuff we've seen lately. I recommend it. I think you will be pleased."
330,I don't understand why some people have rated this movie so low it's a nice film which deserves a Watch! .
331,"In Branca de Neve e o Ca√ßador, however, the psychological violence of the original is rescued, while giving the story new twists and turns, making it relevant once more in times when the desire to be a princess fades away. early. Designed by first-time film director Rupert Sanders, a graduate of the advertising market, the film was sold in Hollywood as an epic with, as far as possible, realistic qualities. To convince the industry, in which several other projects based on the story were circulating, that his story had something different, Sanders created entire scenes of the film with the help of finishing houses. The result was impressive - and those who saw it, say that this ""sketch"" differs from the original only in the faces, since it was filmed with strangers - and the project was carried out with epic qualities that resemble The Lord of the Rings more than what is expected Snow White, especially in the beautiful photographic record. Although Snow White and the Huntsman is not effectively graphic in his violence, he has some images of impact, enhanced by the interpretation of his cast. Charlize Theron, Queen Ravenna, gives herself to the role with intensity, elevating the character's aura of malignancy, which also gains a well-developed past here. The protagonist's motivations, thanks to the script and the efforts of the actress, can even be somewhat understood, even though her attitudes remain questionable. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart, Snow White, guarantees the princess a strength that doesn't exist in any other film based on history, a quality of leadership, of strength, but without losing femininity or becoming a superhero. These qualities are also explored in a tribe of women, whose faces are marked to make them aesthetically ugly, allowing them to escape the known yoke of the Queen's mirror and their continued search for the ""most beautiful woman"" in the kingdom. Less interesting are the male roles, which are somewhat allegorical. With the intention of relating this film to the Twilight Saga, with an eye on an already established fan base, marketing makes it appear that Snow White is somewhat divided between the Hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and the Prince (Sam Claflin) . But the truth is that there is very little room for romance or procession in the plot, while a supernatural evil force ravages the kingdom, consuming it like a plague. Still, without the predictable romantic side, such roles bring very little new in terms of heroes from fantastic epics. Much more interesting are the eight dwarfs, played by excellent British actors (Ian McShane, Eddie Izzard, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Steve Graham and Nick Frost), who interpret them as members of a heavy gang London. Among the less inspired moments of the film are a sequence of free action against a troll, which adds little to the plot (but is visually cool), and fantastic elements of ""good"" (the enchanted forest is superbrega) that are not as interesting as all the rest (especially the Queen and her harm). Either way, the film manages to use well-known icons from history in new ways, such as intelligent mechanisms that work in the service of narrative. In the end, there's a lot to appreciate in this new version of Snow White, but enough to ignore it too.Film seen on October 15, 2020."
332,Not as bad as what some are sayingOnly real issue I had was struggling to hear Charlize T . . .she kept whispering.
333,"A good adaptation of the fairy tale. Kristen Stewart was okay, Chris Hemsworth was good, Charlize Theron was great being evil, which she normally is, unfortunately she's not that great at good people and loved the dwarves. Nothing to dislike, a good above average movie."
334,"This has all the ingredients of a good fantasy adventure mystery, but the cast all seem bent on trying to out-do each other on the naff-ness scale. This adult take on the ""Snow White"" story has some has some stylish costumes, great special effects, and a pretty good collection of dwarves (Bob Hoskins; Nick Frost; Toby Jones etc.) but Chris Hemsworth just doesn't seem to really care; and who can blame him given he has the dreadful wooden Kristen Stewart to rescue from the clutches of an oddly off-form, wickedly shrill, Charlize Theron. Nothing about this works - it's ham, ham, ham with very little to commend it."
335,"Great CGI.screenplay with so much holes, its fascinating. too much to write, meh.lets look at them like this and all will be more understandable:
weird princess ""Bella""(it was terrible play, but better then trilogy-that-cant-be-named);
drunk huntsman with good heart and using for hunting battleaxe ""Thor""(he did good);
queen, sucking people with clean skin(young people with scars apparently have bad life force), with great story(with weird flaws) ""Beaty""(too good for this movie)
7 noble dwarfs who kill and rob people(all good as usual);
Duke with ""great"" army from ~40 knights in plate armor, and everybody called them milkmaids and peasants with pitchforks(?) ""Blank Space""(meh, duke was added just for... space? and play was same, space wasting)
Queen's Brother ""white devil""(good, many emotions);
duke's son William, apparently never been seen outside castle by ""evildoers"", so he can infiltrate in their group without anyone knowing his face ""Bowman in plated armor"";
Father of princess Bella ""1 day widower"". did i forget someone? hmmm...well, music was honey for my ears, SFX was good too, except blasting in siege.what else? one time movie. rewatching it whole? nope.p.s. last scene with coronation is just horrible cliche. bueh"
336,"In all honesty,,, is this movie great? No,,
but there's more than enough to make warching it worthwhile.Great casting. Theron is awesome as the evil queen! Hemsworth makes a great huntsman,, and Stewart was in no way bad as Snow White (no, she's not a GREAT actress,,, but she's far from the worst)(yes,, I meant you KATHERINE HEIGL). The dwarves were cast very well with quite a few familiar faces.I'd give it a 6.5Just watch the movie!"
337,It was a good movie. Obviously not the best but it was a good time with my family.
338,"When this movie was about to get released there was a saying that this movie will be a dark and gritty reimagination of the beloved snow white source material,so while watching this movie I can be sure this was indeed the darkest fairy tale reimagining of a children's classic Hollywood has ever produced there are corpses there are deaths there are dark imagery all over the movie and that's a unique experience I witnessed apart from pan's labyrinth this is the one that really earns the above saying. The story is simple enough that the one princess will end the tyranny of the evil princess this good vs evil stuff nothing new but what's new is the visual aesthetic and the representation of the women in this film they are scared of the tyrannical men and there is always a tension between the kingdom regarding the hier so this things are subtle we cannot get these message in your face when you will watch it you will feel it so there is the corruption of the freedom and the sad way of a women living in the kingdom. Charlize Theron gave one of the most powerful performance in her filmography packed with powerfull performances, she is not hamming it up she is brutally honest of her views of men and why she needs to end them but because she is also very much concerned about her beauty that means she is somewhat a everyday women fighting to be comfortable with her skin the conflicted nature of her character is what makes her a acceptable villain. Kristen Stewart is stellar in her performance her confusion is well depicted she is the vision of a good humam being people deserved and all the men in this films are not stereotype they all are haunted by there actions Chris Hemsworth gave his emotionally devasted performance here and the actor who potrayed Williams was equally good the representation aspect of the both male and female are very respectable while we don't get that message enough beacause of the spectacle but that can be spared cause this film is a visually spectacular film with stunning vfx work I was marvelled with some of the fx work here great the gritty slightly greyish colour pallate of the movie fits with the tone of the movie and when there are spectacle the pallate doesn't distract with the colours presented in the later part of the film it blends perfectly with tones. All in all this is a very strong dark fantasy flick do watch it but don't watch the sequel prequel or whatever that is."
339,Worth the watch even if just for the effects. But just enthralling you me.
340,"Snow White and the Huntsman was the first movie in a while that took an old concept and made it something new. Not necessarily modern, just new. A new twist per say. That being said, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was always one of those ""mediochre at best"" stories. They were a drastic part of everyones childhood, but to elongate that into a 2h 15m movie seems merely unthinkable, and pacing is especially where this movie falls, no surprise. However, the film has a few things up its sleeves, some memorable, some questionable.The movie's prologue explains the origins of how the evil queen came to power. Queen Eleanor admires a rose and longs for a child. Her child, Snow White is born and she is as happy as can be, with the most beautiful and courageous heart and mind. Snow White befriends Prince William, as the two of them play. Eleanor fatally dies of illness. Instead of mourning, the king distracts himself with battle and war. He fights a ""Dark Army"" and finds a woman named Ravenna (Charlize Theron) captive. He is taken into a trance and marries her the next day. After the wedding, Ravenna kills the king and orders his daughter to be locked in the prison. William and his father ride off, never to be heard from again.Ravenna orders for her magic mirror to be hung up in her chambers. In order to maintain her mothers spell, she must take the breath out of the young and beautiful in order to stay young herself. She orders that Snow White (Kristen Stewart) is the next to be sacrificed. When Ravenna's brother approaches Snow's prison cell, she stabs him in the eye and escapes from the kingdom and flees into the dark forest. Ravenna, outraged, orders Finn, her brother to track her into the dark forest, and to bring along someone who knows the woods, a huntsman.Finn finds Eric (Chris Hemswoth), a drunken huntsman whose wife had passed away. He brings finn and the army to the middle of the dark forest where they find Snow White, lost. Eric and Snow bicker until Eric realizes that Finn lied about Ravenna's powers. The two of them run off and find the edge of the dark wood. Meanwhile, at another kingdom, word spreads that Snow White is still alive as prince William (Sam Claffin), her childhood mate, rides off to find her. He infiltrates the dark army in order to one day decieve them and elope with Snow.At the forest's edge, Snow saves Eric from being mauled by a bridge troll. After their victory, they find a village to stay the night in. The population is completely made up by women and their daughters, whom have all disfigured their faces so Ravenna could not use their beauty for immortality. That night, Finn and his army burn up the village after tracing Snow's steps. All of them escape, while Snow and Eric run off again, until they encounter eight dwarfs. The head dwarf notices Snow's beauty and states that only she can kill Ravenna. At their sanctuary, Finn's men attack once more, until he is killed by Eric. The rest of the army falls as well, except for Eric, who joins Snow and the team. Ravenna feels her brothers death and must move to Plan B.On the way to William's castle, the two rekindle their childhood relationship. Ravenna disguises herself as William in order to kill snow. She hands her an apple which temporarily poisons her. As she attempts to her, Eric and William find her mid-act and she disappears. The troupe arrive at the castle as snow lies on her death bed. Eric, explaining that he couldnt save her or his wife, feels upsettened and kisses Snow, causing her to wake up. Snow orders all of the duke's men to ride with her to bring down Ravenna's reign of terror once and for all. As the army arrives at Ravenna's kingdom, Snow climbs the tower alone, while the rest fight the dark army. Ravenna proves to Snow that she is invincible by putting herself in a firepit. Snow stabs Ravenna, undoing the spell. Ravenna dies, shriveling up to her true, elderly self. Snow White is crowned queen and all is well.Snow White and the Huntsman really lies on its acting, since the scripture and editing is just terrible. It is a visually stunning movie, even for years after its release. The film falls into three acts: Ravenna's reign, Snow vs the Army, and Ravenna vs all. The movie is missing Ravenna, since Charlize Theron should've taken home an oscar for her work. She is magnificent. Twilight's Kristen Stewart shines as well, however her acting is more-less melodramatic and thus cannot carry the elongated boring movie. It is entertaining, however there are some parts that could've just been cut and some should've been elongated. It has the potential to be a great movie, it just isnt one.
Overall: The score goes as follows. The first act is a perfect 10. The second a 5 and the third, a 6. Add them up and divide them by three and you get a final verdict of 7."
341,"Yea this movie is really awesome. Visually aesthetic and artistically appealing. Great story, great actors, great cinematography. Very artsy, I wasn't expecting that. An absolutely amazing rendition of the snow white story that adults and serious film buffs can enjoy and everyone must see."
342,"There are other and far better versions of Snow White. Some are visually better, some have a better plot, some are even funny, most have good acting - and apart from Charlize Theron as the wicked queen, this comes across as drama school by Disney.
I have not seen the Twilight series, and I doubt that I am missing much. So this was the first time I have seen Kristen Stewart, and when she came on I immediately asked myself who she was, and why she had been given the leading part when it was obviously beyond here ability. It's that bad. She does the usual poor helpless woman bit, falling over all the time in the enchanted forest, and manages to be the fearless leader of an army at the end. But seeing her in armor, exhorting her troops to fight, just made me think of a school production of Saint Joan, the favorite role for stage-struck little girls. In between she wanders around most of the time with her mouth open, gaping like a landed fish.The twist to the story is the huntsman, a sort of modern-day Neanderthal, down to the hairstyle and macho grunting. But his role in the story is on a par with Kristen's, the pair of them display wooden acting and about as much chemistry as an iceberg. So, a derivative plot, stolid acting and zero romance make for a less than stellar film. Along the way it tries to get mystical with the appearance of a sort of horse or unicorn, I was left with the feeling that I was looking at outtakes from Narnia. In fact, the whole film seemed to be outtakes from something else, and radically better. The final scene where the villainous queen disintegrates into a cloud of CGI looked just like others of the same ilk, but done better.I wonder if Kristen Stewart and the hairy fella that played the huntsman will wish one day that people would just forget this film?"
343,"I loved this movie soo much!! PLEASE, I need Snow White and the Huntsman 3 with Kristen stewart üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Please bring Kristen Back!!!"
344,"While yes the film has clear problems, I can't help but enjoy the dark magical madness that is Snow White and the Huntsman! Charlize Theron is incredible as the evil queen, giving us a powerful and evil performance! The film is also very beautiful in terms of CGI! If you're looking for an over the top fantasy movie, definitely check this one out!"
345,"Another children's classic gets the Tolkien treatment at ponderous and inordinate length with excessive use of steadicam, slow motion and far too much swordplay (hardly any of it by Snow White herself until she finally gets into armour at the conclusion).The transformation of Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins et al into dwarfs is convincingly and unobtrusively done, but as usual the special effects team is allowed to run away with the rest of the film too.A cursory glance tells you that Kristen Stewart does not have skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood or hair as black as ebony; while Charlize Theron remains too blonde to properly chill the spine as the Wicked Queen."
346,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has an impressive cast, cool performances, a true-to-life setting, and great cinematography and sets (nominated for an Academy Award). To bad that it has an uninspired plot. The whole movie comes across as a cynical cash grab in that respect. The better Snow White-themed effort in 2012 was ""Mirror Mirror"", mainly because it depicted the queen less as an evil maniac and more as an empty-headed narcissist.The cast includes Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones. Put another way, it stars Bella Swan, Imperator Furiosa, the Ghostbusters' secretary, Finnair Odick, Al Swearingen, Eddie Valiant and Truman Capote/Karl Rove/Alfred Hitchcock."
347,"The first time i watched this movie i thought it was decent. the second time i thought it was pretty useless. any of the action, fight scenes or war scenes were pointless. there were some cool visuals but other than that i didn't really like this movie (2 viewings)"
348,"A well-prepared fairy tale reinterprets the film.
1. The film is drawn from the fairy tale Snow White. No matter how old or young, men and women, this fairy tale is no stranger. This is a plus item for this movie.
2. The flow of emotions is very confusing and even confusing. This is also the biggest problem in this film.
The first 20 minutes of the movie can be said to be quite good. The succinct expression of the Queen's cruelty and sinister intentions, as well as her and her brother's deep affection.Until the hunter's story line is drawn, the film as a whole remains above its standard.After the appearance of the seven dwarves, the story began to collapse. This includes the elf suddenly have a good impression and great affinity for Snow White, the childhood of William's fighting power over the entire story and so on. The content of the story starts to look particularly good from here, and there is very little paving.The most incredible thing in the films is why the hunter kissed Snow White and Snow White woke up. William, who had been in love with Snow White since childhood, kissed the princess before, but did not wake her up. The film has already spent a great deal of space to express the hunter's thoughts and love for the deceased wife, as well as the true feelings of William and Snow White. Only in the feelings of the hunter and Snow White, there is very little ink, or there is a disconnect. Therefore, when the hunter kissed Snow White, the whole story became very strange and unreasonable. Because, even if you don't think about emotions, the hunter is just a guardian of Snow White in the narrative of the story. So when I saw this scene, I naturally had the feeling of ""WTF.""3. In the depiction of some big scenes, the feeling is just a point to the end, such as the depiction of the Elven woods, and the description of the scenes such as the final attack of the army into the castle. Here to vomit, because the hunter and William's force is too strong, the film can only rely on the queen to summon a monster similar to Marvel venom to compete with it. Although it is a little regrettable, it is a 2012 movie.
4. In short, this is a movie that makes the audience feel very strange. Although the name is Snow White, the person who maintains the entire film and story is the queen. The whole film is only normal for the queen from performances, story clues, emotions, etc. Other characters have more or less problems with lines, unclear motives, and feelings. As for the role of hunter, the feeling of giving people from beginning to end is superfluous, and it is still a simple image of a simple coward."
349,"PRO: Some good CGI.
CON: This film is an insult directed towards watchers' intelligence and also to the original story."
350,This is a visually beautiful movie. The twists on the original Snow White story are fun. I enjoyed the different characters.
351,"3 June 2012. This over-reaching version of Snow White introduced too many new elements and the weight of the movie almost collapsed upon itself, pulling the movie down from succeeding in dazzling its audience with many worthy potentially astounding accomplishments. Charlize Theron as Ravenna took on a role that had great potential and her performance was admirable, but betrayed by a well-intentioned but flawed script that attempted to humanize this evil character, but not succeeding in its more balanced, wavering presentation. The movie was bogged down as in the forest of misery eclectically pulling from so many various classical movies that it become almost lost in itself. The Princess Bride (1987) without the humor, unmemorable characters except for Ravenna; The Lord of the Rings (2001) without the consistency and focus; The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) except for the youthful, lighter elements and the persistent magic fusion into the entire plot; or the epic nature of Medieval classic Excaliber (1981). Snow White and the Huntsman's contemporary Mirror, Mirror (2002) captured well both the essence of the original fairy tale, personalizing the dwarfs with individual character, avoiding the confusing inclusion of two male protagonists whose relationship with Snow White was never fully developed.The movie's first half bordered on a darker occult, horror bent like Constantine (2005) or the more pertinent adult Medieval horror of Black Death (2010). Unlike A Wrinkle in Time (2002), this more darker, adolescent version of Snow White didn't retain the charm and fairy-tale backdrop, except for the fairy forest. The principal character of Snow White played by Kirsten Stewart was unevenly portrayed and the balance between naive, innocent princess and a strong bold Medieval warrior like Joan of Arc or Jennifer Garner in Elektra (2005) was confusing and not consistently believable, or even more compelling would have been a character-based on Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy the Vampire Slayer that combined both innocent high school female with a sturdy, hard edge ability to slay. Even Ravenna's brother's character was inconsistently portrayed whose transformation throughout the movie didn't seem believable.Overall, the movie had several brilliant and visually creatively dazzling scenes and its efforts towards blurring the good and bad was commendable, but the end result was a compilation of numerous fantasy threads that weren't woven into a nicely, knit together composition."
352,"It is very strange to me that people can love and hate the same thing. But maybe that is the fun of life. I liked this movie because it has a heart and a beautiful soul. If you are in only for the action or great war scenes, you are not at the right address here. If you like a twist on a fairytale in a fairytale land, I guess you like it. Don't take me wrong, there is action, but there is also room for fantasy and story, I like that."
353,"I'm fantasy movie lover and I must admit that it's really hard to find pure fantasy movies able to take you to a completely different reality. The atmosphere is rather dark but definitely more realistic than the original snow white story. I totally love the performance of the three main characters who are incredibly convincing in their acting. While watching this movie, you will be totally absorbed by the story: a must watch for fantasy lovers!"
354,"Snow White and The Huntsman (2012) Starring: Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, Bob Hoskins, Sam Spruell, Johnny Harris, Brian Gleeson, Vincent Regan, Noah Huntley, Liberty Ross, Christopher Obi, Lily Cole, Rachel Stirling, Hattie Gotobed, Raffey Cassidy, Xavier Atkins, Izzy Meikle-Small, Anastasia Hille and Elliot Reeve Directed By: Rupert Sanders Review THE FAIRY-TALE IS OVER This is one of the films that ran for a little while I feel was trend of taking classic fairy tales and making them darker and turning them into big action films, this is one of them. It's got Kirsten Stewart who does not have a good reputation in the film world what for being in the Twilight movies. Ugh those hunks of garbage. But if you told me I would enjoy watching this I would have called you crazy, but I thought it was quite fun. After the Evil Queen marries the King, she performs a violent coup in which the King is murdered and his daughter, Snow White, is taken captive. Almost a decade later, a grown Snow White is still in the clutches of the Queen. To obtain immortality, The Evil Queen needs the heart of Snow White. After Snow escapes the castle, the Queen sends the Huntsman to find her in the Dark Forest. The Huntsman betrays the queen wishes and teams up with Snow White and trains her for battle to take down the evil queen. I like the idea of this film, still not a great main lead choice though. Snow White is supposed to be pure and filled with wonder, yet still strong and fierce in this movie. But every-time we see her she looks like she just woke up from a coma. Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman that seems like a good choice but he's just playing the same type of character as he did in Thor. Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna was the best performance in the movie. She was a great casting choice and villain in general. The pacing was a little bit of an issue it felt a little drawn out. Like that scene where she's thought to be dead and the Huntsman is talking to her, that went on way too long for my taste. The CgI was pretty good and the action scenes are great. It would have been great to see more of the dark forest, I mean they face one giant troll and that's it? Pretty weak don't ya think? I would have expected for there to be dangers around every corner for a place known to the land as the dark forest. Rupert Sanders does a fine job directing the film but some of the scenes in the end are shot a little close when the battle inside Ravenna's castle is going on but aside from that he does pretty good. They opted to make a fun dark fairy tale film and with that they succeeded. Snow White and The Huntsman is a very flawed film but it can still be enjoyed for some, with one poor performance, bad writing on The Huntsman a bit of pacing issue yet still a fun decently directed film with a great villain and performance from Charlize as the Villain I'm giving this a three out of five."
355,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is an American English-language movie from 2012, so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. The script is by Evan Daugherty and he collaborated with two other writers, including an Oscar nominee, on this one here. The director is Rupert Sanders and I guess most people know this name now because of what happened behind the scenes of the shooting of this two-hour movie here. He had an affair with lead actress Kristen Stewart that resulted in the end of his marriage as well as the end of Stewart's relationship with Robert Pattinson. Quite a coincidence that this happens exactly the same time the Twilight franchise ends, the series of films that turned Stewart into a global super star. But let's not talk about that any further as we will never find out the details and truth about all this anyway. Instead, let us talk about this film we have here. It came out actually at a time when several Snow White films were made. Another one starred Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen and then there is also a Spanish movie that brought us back to the days of silent film and combined bullfighting with this classic tale.But this one we have here is probably the most known, even if the Spanish one received the most praise by critics. One reason is this one here scored two Oscar nominations in the visual categories (costumes and effects). And then there's of course the stars attached to it. Film buffs know Stewart, Hemsworth, Theron and probably also a few of the supporting actors, especially the dwarfs. By the way, the title is very fitting as Hemsworth was too big of a star by 2012 already to play a minor part only. He starred in ""Thor"" as the title character the year before and as a consequence they pretty much turned him into a co-lead here. He is always on Snow White's side during their journey and the aspect with the animal heart and the attempt to trick the queen was not referenced in here at all. Of course, there are more differences compared to the very old animated movie by Disney. One would be the complete lack of humour and comedy, but that's not a problem at all as this darker approach works well too. A huge problem, however, is the way Stewart's character turns into an action heroine eventually and this had nothing to do with Snow White anymore. She was that fragile volatile character early on and basically for the entire film and then after she awakens, she suddenly has all this power and spirit and it just did not feel realistic. The fact that they put her in some heavy knight armor with a powerful sword did not make it more believable either, even if it is an okay reference to Theron's character's early comment about what Snow White would do with a sword. Now that I have mentioned the film's biggest weakness perhaps, you could even say the last 25 minutes roughly, time to mention the film's biggest strength: It is probably the visual side because this was at times a really beautiful movie. My favorite scene is probably the one with the poisonous apple.But with this beauty comes some struggle too. I don't think the film ever made Snow White look as great to an extent that we are really buying into the whole idea that she is the solution to all the problems, that she will bring back life, also to nature during that scene with the majestic deer. There just wasn't enough build-up to that point really for me to believe it. Other criticisms for me include the romance aspect in here. Apparently Snow White was attracted to her childhood friend as she wanted to kiss him in the scene I mentioned earlier, but then it is Hemsworth's character who kisses her, so she is brought back to life. I think the latter would have been the better choice to be honest as seriously Claflin's character has very little background in terms of the story. We have that one scene really early when they were playing as kids and then later on he is just there and Snow White is apparently suddenly in love with him. Romance is never one of the strengths of the film to be honest. Maybe they should have kept it out completely. The love story line with Hemsworth's character and his dead wife is still compelling enough, maybe elaborated a bit more on this one and it would have been okay.Now for the villains, Theron does a good job for sure and she also has decent material to work with. But I also want to mention Spruell here, a name that not too many probably know, but he played his part well I guess and deserves the consideration overall. As a whole, this film pretty much delivered all I expected and this includes the positive and the negative. Yes there are weaknesses in here, but there are also positive moments and as a whole I think it was pretty balanced. It was a solid movie that felt especially in the first half a bit too long for its own good as not too much happened for this runtime. But I still recommend seeing it, especially to fans of Stewart (like myself) and Hemsworth. Sadly I must say that Stewart did not really have the material to shine in here, but this is also not unexpected looking at the genre. It was not good enough to get me really curious about the recent sequel, but all in all I give ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" a thumbs-up. You definitely can go for it."
356,"This movie was OK but it was kind of paced a little. I mean the story was good, but the story was told a little bit too fast. Also the dwarfs are kind of like the dwarfs in the Lord of the Rings universe. I do like Chris Hemsworth anyway cause he's Thor and Kristen Stewart who was in the Twilight movies was Snow White who is a warrior in this and not just a princess. I'm not a huge fan of the Twilight movies anyway but she's OK in other stuff. Also the evil queen in this was pretty evil as she was in the Disney version of Snow White. Now it's basically the same story and kind of like the grim fairy tale version but with more action and adventure. Also the magic mirror in this was a humanoid like creature who can not only be used to be seeing someone's reflection and see who's the fairest in the land, but also moves around. This movie is OK, but just a little bit paced. 6 out of 10 for this."
357,"The only real reason I decided to finally sit down and watch Snow White and The Huntsman was due to the release of The Huntsman Winters War this weekend. Though there are plenty of beautifully shot sequences and cool imagery, the film is an overall bore with no real chemistry between any of the actors on screen.The good things I had heard from this film besides the visuals revolved around Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna/the Queen. Sometimes the performance blurred the lines of it being over the top, but I enjoyed every second of it. She really seemed to be the only one having fun with her role as the rest of the film is a grim sloppy mess. Kristin Stewart wasn't unbearable as the titular character and Chris Hemsworth was Chris Hemsworth, but he didn't get a ton to do. I didn't mind watching their individual performances but their chemistry together was nonexistent.The film has extraordinary visuals, however. Not only is Greig Fraser's cinematography gorgeous, but the visual effects are top notch. It's aesthetic is largely different than the original 1937 film, with a few exceptions. Of course, the dwarfs do make an appearance, albeit not a memorable one. But there's also a twist or two in the latter half that borrow from the old film, but sadly, they are handled poorly. In all, it's an entertaining watch without volume or any real investment in the story, if that's what you're into.+Visuals+Theron-Chemistry is lacking-Poorly handled 3rd act5.0/10"
358,"Well, my friends, my boy's back. And he's doing more voice-over.Chris Hemsworth is by far the best part of this film. Charlize Theron's a close second and Kristen Stewart isn't bad.People hate that chick. Understandably so, she's not caught smiling all that often.But hey, lay off Kristen, she does okay in this film.Hemsworth steals the show though. And overall¬ÖIt's very good!Here's the thing.Snow White and The Huntsman is just a great adventure. That's all it is. Expect nothing spectacular in terms of metaphor, narrative intricacy and complicated motivation.It's just a fun, action-packed and intriguing retelling of the classic story.All critically acclaimed derivations of Snow White offer commentary about the strength of women in their relevant historical context.Grimm's classic fairy tale, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was finalized in 1854. It's about a young woman who is highly susceptible to trusting suspicious strangers and her inability to resist temptation in the face of personal gain (without the presence of men, of course.) Obviously it's not the most empowering narrative.Walt Disney released his first full-length animated feature in 1937 under the same name. Our protagonist is more loving and helps the dwarfs to grow as individuals.Animators at the time were struggling to draw masculine facial features. So the audience rarely catches a glimpse of the The Prince from the front. When they do, he appears quite feminine.ABC's series Once Upon a Time features Snow White prominently as a major player. She's a strong female who actually saves Prince Charming by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (It's a brilliant and compelling inversion on the classic narrative.)Snow White and the Huntsman is Universal Pictures's 2012 reinterpretation of the classic tale. And while it attempts to offer commentary on the place of women in royalty, it's merely to justify Ravenna's (played by Charlize) evil nature.When it ends, you kind of think, ""Well okay, that's that. Guess I'll move on to other things."" But that's okay, if you're a generous viewer.What works particularly well is the CGI and special effects. The fight sequences are spectacular. I love a movie that gives you a little taste of battle at the beginning, and unloads a huge scene at the end.At one point, an army on horseback raids a castle from the beach. And it looks completely real! The final battle is epic. There's hot tar, catapults launching fiery rocks and some solid sword clashing.Stewart's Snow White is a shallow character. That's ultimately her problem in this movie. I like the part where she's dancing with Gus.Her character is not wholly fleshed out because her power doesn't stem from anywhere other than her royal blood, and she only acts out of desperation. She doesn't necessarily rise to the call, she just sort of falls into place and plays her part.But the adventure is, at times, truly captivating. Things slow down when bedtime nears in the fishing village, and with the dwarfs in the forest. Overall though, the pacing remains pretty quick.The stuff in the forest is a lot of fun; of particular note are the mushrooms that exude noxious fumes that have a hallucinogenic effect. The mossy snakes and tortoises, the butterfly flowers, and the dangling mushroom caps in the fairy Sanctuary are all great too.The scenery is elaborate, and the settings are picturesque.Some strong editing and cinematography is used to seamlessly align the surreal with the surrounding environment.The giant white elk is so cool. What a great piece of fantastic imagery. I've never seen anything like that before.So although the plot element in this specific story is unclear, the elk represents the spirit of nature. It's an original take on a concept that only exists in the fantasy genre. The mythical animal is rendered beautifully.I also really like the glass soldiers that Ravenna could control. And the new take on the magic mirror is a lot of fun, but a bit misleading.Ravenna seems to be imagining the mirror's effect. Which is intriguing, but inconsequential. It goes back to my theory about the 'incongruence of metaphysical properties.' We're unsure where she derives her power from, so what is to be taken from the implication she's imagining the mirror effect? I'm afraid the answer's nothing really.But the best part of SW&TH is, like I said before, Hemsworth's role. Once Upon a Time dabbles in exploring the background of the classic Huntsman character. However, this movie illustrates a more complete picture.The use of a small battle-axe, and the two hatchets as projectiles, is innovative and fun.It gets a little dusty when we lose one of the characters, which is always a good sign.The ending's a bit unsatisfying because we have a few questions we'll never get the answer to. Primarily, do Snow White and The Huntsman ever fall in love?So although this rendition of Snow White doesn't do much for the feminist cause, it's still a great adventure, and an eye-catching retelling of the classic narrative."

The queen dispatches a huntsman to track the princess down and bring her back.*Special Stars- Charlize Theron, Chris Helsworth, Kristen Stewart.*Theme- Good will always win over evil.*Trivia/location/goofs- Many of the leads roles were recast many times due to actors dropping out after reading the script.

No actual dwarfs actors were used in this film calling up heavy criticism by real little people actors like Warwick Davis ('Willow') publicly comparing this to the discredited practice of 'black-up' a white actor for a black film character. Bob Hoskins (Dwarf) last film before announcing his retirement.*Emotion- This is a much more darker film of the children's story. While this is a classic story, due to the unbelievable nature of the characters, I cared little for the cast or plot. There's no wonderment in this film at all.*Based On- European children's fairy tales and legends."
360,"I was really excited for this but after seeing it I am left rather disappointed. Charlize Theron was the only saving grace , there just wasn't enough of her. Kristin Stewart is such a terrible actress , she only gets these kind of roles because of Twilight. She is so wooden and there was so chemistry at all between her and Chris Hemsworth (who is a HOTTIE). If another actress had been Snow White I think the movie would've been so much better. Emma Stone would've been a great choice for the role and is a better actress than Stewart by a long shot!. Charlize Theron was just amazing , she really plays evil well but not in a camp over the top way like some actresses do when they do a baddie role. So to finish off what this movie needed was more Charlize and another actress in the Snow White role."
361,"Truth is more entertaining than fiction. At least for Snow White and the Huntsman. The background story of slutty Stewart and the director was far more fun than the drab movie they made.Before the movie retelling of the old classic, I never thought I would compare this with The Matrix¬Öbut here it is: Both feature the luckiest and most awful actors in film history portraying ""THE ONE"" characters.My god, I thought Kristen Stewart was bad in the Twilight series¬Ö here she shows as much life as some that just died, as much depth as a jellyfish's skin and as much charisma as a Republican in a Planned Parenthood clinic. As usual, she's moping around and, as usual, people swoon over her without the slightest evidence, outside of spoken words, on how or why she's worth it.Beyond her ‚Äì and you'll see too much of her, the movie is as bland as her acting. Even the powerful Charlize Theron couldn't hold my interest for too long. And the action sequences, story lines and twists felt as old as the Snow White tale itself.Normally, I would explain the plot or give a summary, but I'm afraid I would begin to fall back asleep typing it out as I did watching it. I will give the movie kudos for decent, albeit not great, cinematography and the score was fairly good.But, neither of those was worth watching this. Watch Disney's first animated classic before even thinking about this. Even though that was 2-D, it held ten times the depth as Snow White and the Huntsman did."
362,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, I thought the trailer made it look good.In fact it was......Boring, tedious... Hours of my life I'll never get back. I could've played the lead role - just pout like a sl*g and cry every now and again. I'm normally a calm individual and not a dramatic at all but this film has ruined my life...I might just kill myself!Mirror mirror on the wall please fall And smash to pieces, So I can use the broken glass to slit my wrists!!Although the troll made me smile a bit. But not enough to save this steaming pile of dog turd of a movie!!Ps the dwarfs were annoying and have made me hate short people!"
363,"Saw this at a screening yesterday. I have to say the movie exceeded my expectations, but I didn't have much of any to begin with.As bolted in to my brain by the Twilight series, Kristen Stewart continues to be a bad actress. But this time supported by actually good actors, which makes the movie watchable. Aside from her, the movie was cast really well.The movie's pacing could have been faster and it'd have turned this movie into an intense experience. The visual aspect of the film, effects, design and costumes were very impressive and I liked how it consciously played against some expectations. Some dialogue was plain cheesy and the movie could have done without it and removal some of this dialogue could have also help the movie move at a more fluid pace.Overall, the movie lies right on the whether to Netflix or not line. If you liked the trailer, you'll most likely enjoy the movie."
364,"It wasn't until I watched SWATH on DVD in the comforts of my home that I was able to truly appreciate it.Factoring in all disciplines involved with movie-making, SWATH is a winner on all counts.Many scenes reminded me of Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema's Victorian Age paintings, in both their composition and use of soft color hues.The 7 Dwarfs were a real treat.My favorite dialogue went as follows. Duir: ""six dwarfs against an army ""? Coll: ""I like them odds.""The Evil Queen Ravenna and her brother, Finn, have what appears to be a very peculiar relationship, that is, they behave almost like a married couple.Snow White and Eric The Huntsman develop a solid bond that's almost cosmic, i.e., always meant to be.This story is an allegory of how important it is to have a benevolent King or Queen. Which is why I really enjoyed seeing how all the characters on the side of good, grow to love one another."
365,"The main problem with this movie is it tries to retell the Snow White story and then gives up. For instance, we get the interesting tidbit that the seven dwarfs were actually royal gold miners for the king. They went into one of the deepest caves before the evil queen (Ravenna) took power and when they emerged, everything they knew and loved was gone. They are the only seven left.Also, the reason Snow White is the only one who can kill the Ravenna is because the spell keeping Ravenna young and powerful was done with ""fairest blood"" when Ravenna was a child. Now that Snow White is fairest, she has the fairest blood, thus making her stronger than Ravenna and able to kill her.The movie sets itself up to explain things and give us insights and background into the Snow White story we never had before, and then it just decides not to after a while. I enjoyed the imagery of the film, but more depth could have been provided for all characters and a majority of the movie could use more explanation.One instance is when the magic mirror tells Ravenna she has to eat Snow White's heart in order to come into full power and be beautiful forever. Why Snow White's heart? Snow White's mother told her that she had ""great beauty of heart"" so does that means her heart is pure? We also see Ravenna eating hearts earlier. Why? Does it benefit her in some way? Is the heart powerful to consume? We don't know.Also, where did the mirror come from? We get no explanation, and it seems like the only person who knows what the mirror can do is Ravenna. She makes sure she has complete privacy when she speaks to the mirror. And we even have one scene where her brother peaks in on her and he can't figure out who she is talking to (apparently Ravenna is the only one who can hear the mirror's voice). It's clear he's worried for his sister's sanity. But another question is why include this scene at all? It's never expanded upon or referenced.Ravenna and her brother also seem to have a symbiotic relationship. Although the spell enacted by Ravenna's mother only used Ravenna's blood, Ravenna and her brother both remain young. Later, when the brother dies, Ravenna feels his pain and also seems to be weakened in power because of his death. Again there's no explanation.The queen offers to bring back the huntsman's wife if he returns to her with Snow White's heart. Why can't the queen get Snow White herself? She has no power in the forest. Why? We aren't told. Later, Ravenna's brother calls the huntsman a fool and says the queen cannot bring back his wife.This part is confusing because the mirror said Ravenna would be ""all powerful"" after eating Snow White's heart. I'm inclined to believe that she could bring back the wife. It's also possible that she lied, but again, we're given no information on how this magic works so we don't know.During the film, Snow White has some kind of connection with animals. And also healing abilities that people experience simply by being near her. Why? One of the dwarfs calls her ""life itself"" but that doesn't explain things. Exactly what makes her life itself, her pure heart? It would have been great if we'd gotten some example of Snow White being pure or being life itself. Maybe she makes a plant grow from a seedling in three seconds. Maybe she shows an incredible act of kindness when no one else would. But from what we can tell, she's just a normal girl who animals seem to like and who spends most of the story doing nothing but running from place to place.Another part that doesn't make sense is the poison apple. Prince William kisses Snow White but she doesn't wake. Later, the huntsman kisses her, and his kiss works, but the question is why? The traditional legend is that true love's kiss wakes her (which is never mentioned in the film). Both men seem to care for her, but it's not clear Snow White loves either of them. The only one she kisses is William, and it's not clear that it's a kiss of love. Rather it seems that she is just testing the waters to see if there is something there. On the flip side she never shows any kind of feelings toward the huntsman. There's no real explanation as to why the huntsman's kiss works, and the movie ends without resolving the romantic interests.Ultimately, the movie is entertaining, but it's not a successful adaptation. It's a darker retelling of the same story we already know that somehow makes less sense than the original. There's plenty of moments where visuals are put in higher regard than explanation. Like, why show the paint-like white stuff the queen took a bath in? There's no explanation as to what it is or why she bathes in it. It just looks cool.The story could have been told better with the characters and the rules of the world developed more. Instead Snow White and the Huntsman is only eye candy with its stunning visuals and just enough garbled focus on retelling to confuse you."
366,"The Director for this incredible movie is Rupert Sanders. He has taken the Grim's tale of 'Snow White' and Twisted it a lot further than previous films. The result becomes "" Snow White and The Huntsman. "" In the original fairy tale, a young beautiful princess (Kristen Stewart) is scheduled to be taken to the black woods, killed and her Heart Removed, on the orders of the Evil Queen. The killer? The loyal, trusted brother, who flubs his task and allows Snow White to escape. In this updated Gothic version, much of the original tale is re-enacted, but the bloody murder is vacated. Instead, the (Chris Hemsworth) executioner is tricked, deceived and he too fines himself is on the run from the Queen. Thereafter the entire film becomes twisted in nearly every way. Instead of one Prince Charming, there are two. Further, they have different agendas as to why they have to save the Princesses. The seven dwarfs become more that just tiny protectors, but courageous warriors. Nearly all the frail women in the film, handle a weapon quite effectively and have other powers as well. Indeed, this film adds several innovations such as wondrous flying apparitions, magical trees, tiny faeries and exceptional menacing Trolls. The fight scenes are gloriously Dark, the Castles and Landscapes are Fabulously foreboding and the cast of Characters are wonderfully creative. All in all, the movie is a brilliant adaption of the original and I believe the Grimm Brothers would have been pleased. I know I was. Recommended. ****"
367,"I am sorry Kristen Stewart shouldn't be in the sequel AT ALL! She doesn't look like Snow White. Her acting is terrible. She has no emotions at all.I even watched her ""On the Road"". She completely ruined Marylou for me. I don't care if she continues to do movies in some obscure pseudo intellectual film. She would fit right in. But not in a fairy tale. Please no more Kristen Stewart. I think the only reason this movie was a hit was because of Theron. When I watched the trailer, I really wanted to watch it for the evil step-mother. She is brilliant and her beauty alluring. I actually think this movie was centered around the evil step-mother rather than snow white. I really hope this sequel doesn't have a major role for Kristen. Maybe she can give birth to a daughter also called Snow White and die. And someone who can actually act can redeem that role. This girl should take all her money and disappear. She ruined my idea of Snow White FOREVER!"
368,"Ugh. I don't know where to start. I have heard Florence and the Machines ""breath of life"" which happened to be the soundtrack of Snow White and the Huntsman - so I wanted to see the movie. They lost me already 15 minutes in the movie. I was so bored of the movie and it hadn't even begun! But I watched it till the end anyway. Now, I think the cast was actually pretty spot on. Chris Hemsworth is awesome playing a sorrowing huntsman, however I don't feel like he gave it his best. His emotions were sometimes... cold and emotionless, however he was one of the actors that lifted the movie. Charleze is indeed beautiful as the dark queen/Ravenne and she plays her role well, but sometimes it feels like she's just screaming at people. She, however was the only reason I saw this movie till the end. And then comes Kristin Stewart. What a bad choice that was. I mean, the whole role was so easy and laid out for her. She failed miserably. She was just depressing, emotionless in what should have been a character full of life, joy and love. Why she is still in the movie career is a mystery to me, when she delivers a performance like this. Even when she is powerful and even has to yell which is the best way to show power, she just.. fails. Depressing, she really is. Isn't it supposed to be the main role that inspires you? That makes you want to see the movie? In the end, I wanted the queen to win because she was more beautiful and a better actor with more emotions. The editing and scene effect are extra-ordinary. It's beautiful except it fails sometimes at the editing. For an example ~spoiler~¬†a dwarf dies, and at one point he is crying and red eyes and snort and everything you combine with crying - the next second he can talk clearly without a tear in his eye say something like ""it was an honor to meet you"" or something like that, I do not clearly remember (it didn't really catch my attention, the only thing that caught it was the editing fail) Disappointment movie in general. If they had a stronger/more emotional main character, it would clearly have been so much better."
369,"Me and my mum, watched this, and we both liked it, apart from when the new Queen, does all that weird magic, to herself and people was like watching a TV show, that was all about the magic i have seen before. The place for filming was great, but if it was all filmed in England, should of had English actors and actresses (sorry thats harsh but i felt the voices where mixed about. I love how the drawfs become friends with snow white, (Kristen is pale but she did'nt look very pale as she does in twilight) and the huntsman (Chris is a great guy, but i kept thinking him as Thor). How the action and film special effects was done, that was fantastic, but think afew scenes where cut out, mum was like thought he died, how come he there, was their meant to be 8 drawfs. It does take ya time to understand this NEW snow white, i would buy it, as i really liked it. I think it was hype up because of Kristen in Twlight and Chris in Thor. Thats why many people thought it wasn't there cup of tea for a film."
370,"I think that Mirror Mirror did a better job. I feel that the movies revolves around Kristen Stewart's ""characters"". She's weird, shy and I don't find her acting very good. I think because she was in it she took away a good role for Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron. I was disappointed. I wish they would've found someone else to do Snow White because it could have been a pretty good movie. Two thumbs down! I must say though Charlize Theron was killer in this role, she definitely portrayed the Evil Queen very well so I was pleased with that. It was a different kind of role for her I think. Also Chris Hemsworth was just sexy as hell so it was easy to stay focused on the movie."
371,"It's a real shame that the recognition this film deserves for raising the bar of unoriginality in motion pictures is going to be overshadowed by the performance of Kristen Stewart. I'm mean she wasn't that bad.... at least she brought in some twilight revenue... or did the fans find out she was banging the director behind Ed's back before they got to see it.Can't seem to think of too much more to say about this thing that my eyes just watched, I feel like my brain cells have been continually turkey slapped for 2 and a wee bit hours.I just went to read about what other movies this director has done in the past or will do in the future, you know so you can avoid being turkey slapped again and it turns out that IMDb is telling me that some lunatic has not only green lit a sequel to this film but they've also decided to put this guy in charge again. I just hope next time round they'll remember to shoot the ""behind the scenes"" porno so my $5 video rental money won't be a complete waste.""Please DO NOT SHOUT in your summary"" it's NOT SHOUTING, it's singing)"
372,"Around a decade after it first appeared, the influence of Peter Jackson's seminal ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy continues to be felt. Among the films which owe something to this influence are the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series, based upon the works of Tolkien's close friend and colleague C. S. Lewis, Tim Burton's recent re-interpretation of ""Alice in Wonderland"", and perhaps even the later episodes of the ""Harry Potter"" series. ""Snow White & the Huntsman"" is the latest Tolkienesque fantasy film to hit the cinema screen. In one of those strange coincidences which occasionally occur in the cinema, 2012 has seen another film based on the ""Snow White"" legend, ""Mirror, Mirror"", which I have not seen. 2011 also saw a film loosely based on a traditional folk tale, ""Red Riding Hood"", but that is perhaps more of a ""dark fantasy"", closer to the horror genre than to sword-and-sorcery.This film's interpretation of the legend is very different from the one we are used to from that old Disney cartoon, although it keeps many of the salient features. As in the traditional story, Snow White is a princess whose mother dies while she is young and whose father takes as his second wife a beautiful but evil woman. In this version the wicked Queen, Ravenna, murders her husband on their wedding night and seizes control of the kingdom. (The name ""Ravenna"" was probably derived from ""raven"", a bird often seen as an evil omen, rather than from the Italian city). The Huntsman who features in the title plays a more important role here than he does in the cartoon, becoming Snow White's protector and ally against the Queen. The Seven Dwarfs also feature, but in personality and appearance they owe more to Tolkien and Jackson than they do to Disney.The biggest difference between Rupert Sanders' version of the story and the Brothers Grimm and Disney versions is that he turns it from a fairy-tale into a sword-and-sorcery epic. Those battle sequences in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series obviously impressed a lot of people as the makers of more recent fantasy films have often tried to copy them, rewriting their source material if necessary. (An example is the Narnia film ""Prince Caspian"" which includes battle scenes not found in Lewis's novel). Burton's rewriting of ""Alice in Wonderland"" includes the transformation of Alice into a warrior-maiden reminiscent of Tolkien's Eowyn, and something similar happens to Snow White here; after escaping from the Dark Forest she places herself at the head of a rebellion originally led by Duke Hammond, her father's most trusted knight, against Ravenna's tyranny. Cue one more battle scene. These scenes are reasonably well done, although for my money none of Jackson's imitators have yet been able to outdo him, or even equal him, when it comes to spectacular battles.The military aspects of the story, in fact, seem more important than the romantic ones. There is no Prince, and although Snow White has two handsome male admirers, the Huntsman and Hammond's son William, she does not seem to be in love with either. The story has been described as a ""feminist"" interpretation of the fairy tale, although the only really strong, independent woman we see is the villain of the piece; Snow White is only able to triumph because she has an army of men at her back.I must admit that in the past I have not always found it easy to regard Charlize Theron as the serious actress which her admirers insist she is, partly because she has appeared in so many second-rate films (""Reindeer Games"", ""Mighty Joe Young"", ""The Italian Job"") and partly because of her habit of taking her clothes off at the drop of a hat. (Or perhaps I should say at the drop of a cheque from the editor of a lad's mag). I was not won over to her cause by that bizarre Oscar for ""Monster"", and although ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellars"" was a good film, her role in it was only a small one. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", however, is the first film in which Charlize has really impressed me, playing Ravenna with a splendid mixture of seductiveness and viciousness.I wish, however, that I could say I was equally impressed by Kristen Stewart. Having avoided the ""Twilight"" saga, this was the first time I had seen her, and she did little to show why she is currently regarded as a rising star. Her performance as Snow White was dull and insipid to say the least. Moreover, I couldn't understand why Ravenna felt so threatened by Snow White's looks. If that Magic Mirror seriously thought that Kristen was ""fairer"" than the lovely Charlize, all I can say is that it must have been either blind, mad or gay.Besides ""Lord of the Rings"", the main influences on the film appear to have been the Gothic fairy tales of those two masters of the visual imagination, Burton and Terry Gilliam. Ron Howard's ""Willow"" may also have been an influence. Like many of Burton's films, this one is visually dark and sombre, but with many imaginative touches. (I particularly liked that Gothic castle towering over the rocky sea-coast). Despite some uneven acting, this is generally a powerful and imaginative film. It was Sanders' first feature film, but he is clearly a director to watch for the future. 7/10"
373,"'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A dark more epic take on the classic Brothers Grimm' fairy tale. This one has a twist where the Huntsman assigned to kill Snow White ends up being her protector. The movie cast Kristen Stewart as Snow White, Chris Hemsworth as The Huntsman and Charlize Theron in the film's most memorable role as the evil Queen named Ravenna. It was directed by first time feature film director Rupert Sanders and written by Evan Daugherty, Jon Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. This version is a great deal better than the recent comedic version starring Julia Roberts and my favorite adaptation of the fairy tale yet. The story opens with the birth of Snow White to King Magnus (Noah Huntley) and Queen Elanor (Liberty Ross). While Snow White is just a child her mother dies and the King falls in love with another woman named Ravenna. He rescued her from a Dark Army, made of glass, invading his kingdom. It would only appear that he rescued her though; Ravenna is actually in command of the army, which has overthrown several other kingdoms. Mesmerized by her beauty (which is the fairest of all the land) King Magnus marries Ravenna. Ravenna than murders him on their wedding night and takes over his kingdom. She locks Snow White away in a high tower for several years while she captures young women and consumes their beauty (through dark magic) allowing her to maintain her youth and her incomparable appearance. One day she learns that Snow White is the only person who can surpass her gorgeousness and if she consumes her heart she'll maintain her powers and youth forever. After sending her brother (and right-hand man) Finn (Sam Spruell) to get her Snow White escapes and flees in to the Dark Forest. The Queen's powers are useless there so she enlists a drunken Huntsman to lead Finn and his men into the forest to kill Snow White. After finding her the Huntsman decides to aid her instead and the two begin a journey to retake the kingdom from Ravenna and her army. The movie is stunningly beautiful; full of glorious visuals and breathtaking sights. The magic of the world really resonates with the viewer (and this is a film that actually could have been a lot better in 3D, odd that it wasn't released that way). It's classic epic fantasy storytelling much like the films of the 80's I grew up on. I can see many influencing elements of movies like 'LEGEND', 'LADYHAWK' and even 'WILLOW' in it. I loved it for it's grand storytelling and astonishing creativeness; Sanders is definitely a director to watch. Stewart is decent in the lead, Hemsworth shows that he's a great leading man action hero (in the same league as the likes of Viggo Mortensen, Gerard Butler or Hugh Jackman; all actors considered for the role) and Theron steals the show as one of the best villains of any movie in recent years. A lot has been said about how Stewart isn't nearly as beautiful as Theron (but who is? She's one of the most beautiful women in the world!) but defenders of Stewart have argued that the film is about inner beauty so it works. I agree, although Stewart isn't nearly as physically gorgeous as Theron, she does posses a quality that works for a movie like this (in an argument towards strong character and inner beauty) and this is a great feminist film. The two lead woman characters dominate the movie and the world that encompasses it and that's one of the film's biggest strengths. It's everything I hoped it would be and one of the best fairy tale adaptations I can think of to ever hit the big screen!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcAC98DcUEQ"
374,"There have been many reviews of this movie, which isn't surprising considering how anticipated it was. As for what has been said before, I agree with much of it. Yes, Kristen was a bit one-dimensional in her performance (young Snow White was very good though), the only smile I noted of Kristen was at the end (gave me the feeling that she was saying ""whew, now that's over and I can get paid"", and it had the same ""twilight"" smirky quality. Yes, Charlize was amazing, sexy, scary, terrific, and the rest of the cast was good and believable in their roles. And yes, the music was great, the CGI was top-notch, and the landscapes and trappings were well done. That being said, there was something missing, or maybe lacking is a better reference here.The storyline was fine in my opinion, but the movie seemed poorly stitched together, as if instead of taking the time to craft a masterpiece, there was a rush to just get it done to meet a deadline. I believe the feeling I had here was primarily the result of a lack of character development of most everyone excluding the Evil Queen. The dialogue did not inspire introspection, or genuine empathy, it just was, serving the purpose to move the story, but otherwise it fell flat. There were no real transformative elements as is typical of fantasy, and the Fey realm was poorly transitioned into, and a bit too comic for me.What I did find interesting is that the movie uses the Arthurian idea of the King's connection to the Land, meaning ... when the evil queen takes power the land begins to wane and die, but when Snow White comes of age, and the mirror notes that she is now the fairest of the land, the Land begins to heal some, and of course recovers fully at the end. This was referenced, but glossed over, which is sad since it is a powerful concept. In the same regard we have the white stag of the Fey realm (a potent symbol in mythology), which shows respect to Snow White, and again this could have been conveyed in a much more powerful and emotionally engaging way.Getting back to Kristen, I personally feel that she was miscast (she would have made a good kitchen wench), but one could argue that her emotionally flat, sullen quality fit since she had been locked away in the evil queen's keep for approx 10 years, her father was killed, and kingdom taken. But the ""idea"" of Snow White, at least to me, is that she is the fairest of the land, not by birthright as one of royal blood, but by possessing an inner beauty as well as outer, a genuine love of the land, a love of others. And while I understand that Snow White was presented in this Grimm style as a darker warrior princess, she doesn't really embody the qualities inherent, be it as a warrior, as a princess, or as one who has a deep connection to the land. If the producers/directors had spent a bit more time developing this, and other missing aspects, I believe the movie could have been much better.Finally, we are treated to a very cool looking Troll. I loved the short sequence, but once over, nothing. Really? Snow White was good, but ""Snow White, Blood Red"" was better, why? The richness of characters, and the fullness of the plot. Look to the original Excalibur, and the Lord of the Rings, these are epics, sadly, this Snow White was not."
375,"I love the Snow White fairy tale, and enjoyed the movie, but something was distracting me from the movie the whole time. It was Kristen's acting. Now don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with Kristen, but when an actor or actress fits a character good, you stop remembering that they're just acting. I think they could have picked out a more suited actress than her. I felt like she was still filming Twilight. The awkardness of Snow White at times reminded me of Bella's awkardness in Twilight. And other little things too. Like faces she'd make in Twilight that I saw in Snow White. I'm not a big Twilight fan, but I did enjoy all the movies."
376,"Hollywood rarely attempts to create a serious quest tale, usually opting for lots of silliness stuck in the middle of serious. Snow White is a dark tale - a wicked queen wants the death of a young girl. Disney made this a palatable and precious movie. Snow White and the Huntsman honors the archetypal and presents us with the age-old elements. A seemingly powerless orphan called upon to save a kingdom. A band of ""less than heroic"" helpers. An overwhelmingly powerful villain who has been wounded and is filled with pride and self- pity. And a touch of magic as an ally. Notice we now have the basic plot of: Harry Potter, King Arthur, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, pretty much all quest tales.The screenwriter, director and cinematographer honored the concept and expanded it to create a world of incredible beauty. They deepened the tale itself so that it explored all the quest concepts, they choose talented actors who filled the roles, and they dazzled us visually. And surprised me.When we arrived in sanctuary, I was enchanted. As Snow White is called by ""him,"" I thought omg, is it going to be the Stag? Is it going to be Arthur in his magical form? I could not believe they took the tale this deep.Few movies have stirred me like this. A fabulous tale with stunning visuals. Avatar. The English Patient. Pan's Labyrinth. The Fall. Mighty heady company to keep."
377,"It is pretty hard to compare ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". But ""Mirror Mirror"" entertained me. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" didn't.The film takes itself so seriously while the audience can't.The cinematography and mise en scene were great with its gloominess but the acting was just so histrionic (especially Charlize Theron's). It seems to me like a half-assed project. There is a love triangle introduced but never really solved. The movie wants to be Robin Hood, Lord of the rings and romance but is neither in the end. Kristen Steward is.... well... Kristen Steward and I am even disappointed in Chris Hemsworth. He makes a vulnerable and broken huntsman but without the charm he had in ""Thor"". There are so many (well made) fantasy elements but they seem out of place... and sometimes even unintentionally funny."
378,"I personally never understood critiquing a motion picture by giving away the entire movie. Seems silly to me. For this movie people really want to know about fan favorites Kristen Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth. Kristen gave a good performance in spite of being terribly miscast. So if your a die-hard fan of both actors, then they are worth watching. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemworth gave the best performances. This movie has elements from the popular fairy tale, however that is where the similarities end. This is not an action packed movie as the trailer would make you think. The story is long and drawn out. A lot of dialog and the movie spends too much time setting up the ten minute finale. The special effects aren't anything new. Also the effects are spread out throughout the movie, so anyone that's a fantasy buff need to steer clear of this movie. There isn't a lot of violence in this movie, a lot of the reviews state that this movie has a lot of blood in it. That is not true. There are only a few scenes of action that contain violence and most of them don't actually show the contact of weapons hitting skin. The director cuts away from a lot of the contact. Only in a few scenes are there any contact shots and there is little blood. There is an adult them as it pertains to relationships, but it is safe for teens 13 and over. The warning for parents is excessive boredom not violence or adult themes. I could barely sit still through this movie, so I can assure any parents out there that their kids will have a hard time doing so as well. The action scenes and story-lines are very similar to Gladiator, Lords of the Ring with a dash of Disney fantasy. It does have fairy's but they are mixed in with, large men wielding swords trying to kill each other. The two elements really shouldn't be in the same film. The director seems to take too long to break away from each close up, the editing is strange because there's a strange pause in many of the scenes. The movie also has heavy handed contemporary religious themes that took away from the ""fantasy"" element of this movie. Wait for this to come out on DVD and keep plenty of snacks ready to consume while watching this film."
379,"Snow White And The Huntsman, another example of the amazing coincidence element of Hollywood, whereby two or more films appear in quick succession based on similar ideas and themes, is a lot different to Mirror Mirror. The former was played for laughs, SWATH is not.I liked a lot about this film. I liked the excellent production design and the flawless special effects. I liked the gritty battle sequences and the feel that magic was something real and dirty (in this respect, the film was very similar to Excalibur). And I loved the dwarfs, played by the cream of British acting talent, who got all the best lines.So what didn't I like? Well, also quite a lot, unfortunately. I have to start with Kristen Stewart. While her English accent was excellent, and while she is what a friend of mine would call ""a bonny lass"", she is not in any respect ""the fairest of them all."" And she was fairly low on charisma and charm, both qualities of which the scripted Snow White needed barrowloads.Then let's move on to Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth wasn't bad, apart from an accent which wandered about more than Marco Polo. I think it was meant to be Scots, but I wouldn't swear to it.Moving on to Charlize Theron, I confess to great disappointment. Her wicked queen was the best thing in the script - wicked, certainly, but conflicted, and with the opportunity for Snow White to redeem her (curiously, after being carefully set up by the script, this possibility was then abandoned). Unfortunately, the always watchable Theron then chose to play her as pantomime villainess, and the subtlety built into the characterisation was lost.Finally - and most grievously - this film was often boring. Losing half an hour in the edit (it runs just over 2 hours) would improve this film enormously."
380,"SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN visually redefined fairy tales, it's nothing like I've ever seen before. The dark forest should get a best supporting nod for being ridiculously creepy. It plays Jedi mind tricks on your eyes. I'm sure those who've tried LSD once in their lifetime would want to get lost in that place. All joking aside, the film does have too much emphasis on the visual, which is not surprising, seeing that this is first time feature director Rupert Sanders' field of expertise, if you're familiar with his commercials especially the one for Sears' Arboretum, but the script is weak and Sanders' direction is rather uninspired. Sure the movie has all kinds of freaky fairies and gigantic troll and other mind-twisting imagery, but a film can't rely just on those. And how is it titled SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, when the strongest points are Queen Ravenna and the dwarfs?! They're practically the whole show, they steal every scene that both Snow White and the Huntsman are in¬Ö Let me make this clear that it's going to take a while or it's going to take more than just this movie for Kristen Stewart to distance herself from her iconic role Bella. I give B for good effort but her accent comes on and off and her rage and expressions are still Bella's but I'm inclined to put the blame on first time director Sanders who may not seem to have a full understanding of characters, how they'd interact, how they'd develop, and for a guy who's good at visuals, there's no creativity in staging some of the scenes including the final battle. This movie has butterflies that could turn into some kind of giant white moose but there's nothing extraordinary or inventive about everything else. I think the concept is also flawed, the idea of making Snow White to be this kind of messy angel that everything and everyone would immediately be so in awe of, seems a bit silly. I think the huntsman and I are the only ones that don't understand why nature would just bow down without question. There's a scene where Snow White just escaped from the castle and found herself on the shores, and out of the blue just sat there a white horse as if it was waiting for her all that time, that kind of wonderment may work in Sanders' commercials but here it may cause audiences to chuckle.Charlize Theron is a remarkable actress, let me repeat that.. Charlize Theron is a remarkable actress and her performance as Queen Ravenna is a reminder why Theron is one of all time's greatest. Evil, ruthless, and unpredictable don't even begin to describe. Theron as Ravenna would take her competition, Julia Roberts in Mirror Mirror, and smash her into pieces and she'd still have some time to smile. I have to give mad credits to the costumes by Colleen Atwood, the ones worn by Ravenna faithfully follows the character, from glory to darkness to downfall. I think Chris Hemsworth does a decent job for what's given to him, considering this is the role that other actors like Hugh Jackman decided to turn down. I'm still not sure what type of accent that Hemworth acquired for the huntsman but at least you don't see THOR at all. If he can't do more, it's only because the weak script doesn't allow him to. You're gonna get a kick out of watching the dwarfized Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Johnny Harris, Brian Gleeson and Toby Jones. These are all fantastic Brit thesps, each with a body of work that we all know about, so to see them in this format, if you will, is simply amusing and they seem to be having a blast. Sadly for actor Sam Claflin who plays prince William, he's barely visible. But then again, his role in Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides wasn't that memorable either. Poor guy can't catch a break.I think the dark forest plays a very significant supporting role in this movie and the brothers grimm would pee their pants. The dark forest and the fairies home become sort of a playground for director Rupert Sanders, he's in his element in those places, where anything goes, where imagination and terror go hand in hand. I think Sanders should not consider this first time venture, SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, as failure but it's something that he could definitely take and learn from the next time he tackles something this ambitious-- www.Ramascreen.com --"
381,"Sorry, but me thinks if Theron's acting that spoils the movie more than anything. I'm only half way seeing it through, but it's so noticeable that Theron is over acting her character's emotions - maybe she's trying hard to be an Al PAcino method type? That, or she's probably trying to elevate an average script (it's average when the Queen yells at her helpers for nothing, to ""leave me alone!"" Aww pleaaze...) to a another level. But that's where the class difference is; she can't do it, and she's not convincing playing Madam Bad Hat. And prove of it is seen her carrying on the same bad acting in Prometheus. In fact, believe it or not, I think it's Kristin Stewart who handles her acting much better than Theron. I know she's been getting a lot of flak for the Twilight series, but if you watch her without wearing our oft prejudiced blinkers - then she does her job well."
382,"The visual effects were great and so were the costumes but that was about it. I took my wife to see this movie and was sadly disappointed in what i saw. Kristen Stewart is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen on the screen.Her accent kept going in and out, she could never properly portray emotion at all, and that so called speech she gave to rouse the men had me busting out laughing in the theater. I was rooting for the queen to finish her at the end cause I couldn't stand to to have Stewart open her mouth again. Every time I though I was starting to get into the movie cause they were away from Snow white and had other people on the screen they would go back to her and I would pull away check my watch and wish someone would put me out of my misery. Now I hear that they cast her again in the next one I'm personally going to boycott the movie if she is cause I will never waste my money on her again stick to twilight Kristen its the only thing your good at cause it only requires you to act like your self so there for its believable leave major acting to the professionals sweetie"
383,"I remember being intrigued upon watching the trailer of this movie. It looked like it has a lot of things to offer; fairy tales, sword fighting, rebellion army. So when its first premiere came out, I walked into the hall with quite a handful of expectations, and thinking to myself that if there's any moment for Kristen Steward to redeem herself after a handful of bad movies and bad acting, this would be the moment.So I sat through the movie until the end. The beginning of the movie was great. The preliminary of the Queen Ravenna, and her obsession over Dark Magic and her consultations to the Magic Mirror. The never-ending quest of her seeking immortality. The Queen part is well-delivered. Then came the Snow White part. And it ruined everything. Her character has only a few amount of sentences to deliver compared to other main casts, and even that, it was stiff and emotionless. I remember the part when Snow White and William kissed. The look on her face is so cold that I think no one in his right mind would even think of kissing her. The second peak of disappointment is when the Huntsman woke Snow White up with a kiss after she has been unconscious due to poisoned apple given by the Queen. And she walked out and stand in the middle of the crowd and started giving speech. The battle speech could have been an act of heroism, dauntless and vivifying even, but instead we're served with the downfall on Kristen part in the delivering the strength in the character's built-up. The only few things that made this movie bearable is because convincing portrayal of Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen and the CGIs. And even that, it's not good enough to withdraw the movie out of the pit of shame.If you're really looking for a fairy tale and want to watch princess fighting for her right, skip this one entirely and watch Princess Mononoke instead."
384,"Completely ruined by Kristen Stewart. She only has three facial expressions and if she brushes her hair behind her ears one more time I will lose my mind.. Her bad acting actually had me rooting for the evil queen!!! Where ever a plot line needs ruined k-stew will be there. I thought I would give it a shot because of all the other names, but I was so wrong. The music was too loud. It made the emotion feel forced which still could not compensate for the lack of emotion from Kristen Stewart. I truly feel that the plot line lacked the development to allow us to love Snow. However had they picked a better actress this emotion may have shown through."
385,"This movie is an interesting spin on the classic tale. It was very reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, and Beastmaster. So although it wasn't very original, it had good visual effects. Charlize Theron was very good and carried the movie in her scenes. However, I really could not enjoy this movie because of Kristen Stewart. She certainly is not prettier than Charlize Theron, so major hole in the plot there. But even if I were to suspend disbelief on that issue, Stewart's perpetually sour expression and big-toothed blank stares did not follow with the character's description of someone pure at heart. Rather she seemed depressed and jaded. She was unconvincing at best and frequently laughable. She killed the movie."
386,"This movie had potential. Whoever casted Kristen Stewart to play Snow White ought to be taken out and shot. To say she acted poorly would be an understatement, she didn't at at all. There were credible performances given by the Huntsman, Charlize Theron and the chap who played her brother. They also had an outstanding cast for the dwarfs, everyone being well acted, especially Bob Hoskins. The story was well filmed and I thought well paced. There were great action scenes and good special effects. Again, the major flaw was basing the entire project on the acting of Kristen Stewart who couldn't carry her lunch in a pail. She could capture none of the innocence the character required nor any of the passion. What a waste. i can only think that the executive producer owed her a favor."
387,"This is obviously a vehicle created especially for Kristen Stewart to get her out of her Twilight type cast by moving her slightly away from that character, but not too far, so her fans won't abandon her. She is still the object of affection for two different suitors so there are plenty of familiar elements for Twilight fans.The most irritating factor of this movie is the dialogue. Everybody in the movie talks in either of two affected voices 1. a slow whisper, especially annoying in the case of Charlize Theron or 2. using their super hero voice √° la Christian Bale's Batman. This leaves actors tiresomely posturing in front of the camera as if they are standing at the front of a stage pronouncing every word no matter how mundane as if they were imparting the secrets of the universe.It's a tedious movie with the worst of overacting by actors taking themselves and their characters far too seriously. A waste of time for everyone involved in the production so save yourself some grief and don't waste your time watching it."
388,"The movie tries hard to be mystical and serious but fails completely. It seems more like bits of Lord of the rings & Narnia were badly pieced-together to form a shapeless, shallow story with bad acting. It takes more than a witch-like antagonist, a dark forest, some random fairies and dwarfs to be meaningful and gripping. And whats with all the stupid animals running around? Just plain overkill! Kristen Stewart may be young and trying new roles but her lack of versatility and depth of character shows clearly. Her role calls for pain and suffering and doesn't show it. Throughout the movie she appears aimless even though technically a goal has been defined.The script is mostly unoriginal and at times out of place. The language is a very distracting mix of old and modern. The fights are amateurish and fleeting. The reunion of William and Snow white is underwhelming at best. The death of a Dwarf lacks sadness and substance. Their history is hardly given any importance and yet they seem to want to play a major helping role. Overall the movie feels like a bad re-enactment/play than the real deal. Waste of time."
389,"Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)With such classic material, amazing set design and choreography (call it staging, or mise-en-scene), and some terrific effects and photography, this should have and could have been great. Great.Yes, it's a fairy tale made real, using real actors and richly imagined but real places. So it faces the problems of making the real fantastical and, well, like a fairy tale. Walt Disney avoided that with hand drawn animation (you know, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""). And the same production team avoided it with ""Alice in Wonderland"" by having a computerized animation. And a stellar central actress in Helena Bonham Carter (not to mention Johnny Depp).And further, this ""Snow White"" has the big name actress Charlize Theron as the evil witch queen. But now we are surprised. The talented Theron was stiff and imperious in her recent ""Prometheus"" role and is a bit constrained even as she shouts and contorts in this imperious ""Snow White"" role. She isn't as chilling, pathetic, or outrageous as the part requires. And she's the best actress here.What kills this movie most of all is the acting beneath Theron. Snow White herself, played by Kristen Stewart, is fine, but boy oh boy, Snow White can't just be okay. She has to make your heart melt. She has to be astonishing. She takes on a more powerful warrior kind of role here, which is terrific, but she still has to have our utter sympathies. And a kind of glowing hyper-beauty, somehow. Blame the makeup, if you'd like.Far more troubling are the two males, as Snow White is torn between two lovers, both raggedy long haired handsome as heck young men with the charm of blocks of wood. Both of them. Throw in lots of extras, even the incredibly underplayed evil brother with a terrible white wig, who are not let loose or who just don't have the oomph to make the movie sing. There are seven dwarfs here (count 'em), and they seem to have the looks and the character to take this somewhere, even if their names are not apparently Dopey and Sleepy and so on. What has to be said here is the huge themes are largely sidestepped here, except as much as they end up implied and stepped on in obvious ways (both). That is: the terrible social trap that women face because men demand they have physical beauty, and in fact everyone gets old (including a lot of ugly men). The movie does have a couple moments where the women voice their anger at men for having ""ruined"" them, or for having to compete with younger women, but this gradually gets drowned by a more ordinary love and lust for Snow White, who is young and lovely. A shame.Ultimately, there is something beyond all this that drags this movie down. The director. This is Rupert Sanders's first movie. How in the world does an untried unknown guy get the green light for a budget this big and a cast this imposing? Well, he directed a few television commercials prior. Go figure. At 41 he's a handsome (and married) charmer who managed to bed Snow White herself, causing some strife all around (Stewart broke up with her boyfriend, for one thing). Anyway, personal digs aside, this is a movie that looks great and won't make you miserable, but you'll definitely wish it was more. Especially because it so easily could have been."
390,"My gf wanted to see 'what to expect when expecting', and I wanted to see 'Prometheus', so we figured Snow white might be a good middle ground. BIG MISTAKE. Half way thru the movie we were both just looking at our watches. If we didn't spend a bunch of money on snacks and the tickets we would have left and never cared how it ended.Positives1) Charlize was great as always 2) Dwarfs were funnyNegatives1) Kirsten Stewarts front teeth are distracting 2) Pacing sucked 3)The movie felt cheap 4) The relationships a lot of the characters had felt fake 5) Story was blah.Good movie it you're a teenager and just go to the theatre to make out and feel each other up because you won't be missing anything but a mildly entertaining action/comedy/love/BSHope this helped :)"
391,"The concept of a gritty, action-packed, mystical take on the Snow White story is quite appealing. The art direction, costume design, and special effects are top notch, but the lifeless direction, poor pacing, overacting by Theron and monotony of Stewart, along with the empty dialogue and lack of character development drag this film into oblivion. You want to like this movie and become lost in the fantasy world, to have your heart- strings tugged by an epic romance and get excited about the big battles. Unfortunately, it does not even begin to deliver. Five stars, all earned by the fantastic art team and the decent Hemsworth."
392,"I was looking forward to this movie with expectations of a raw medieval take on the Snow White story. Visually the movie was beautiful, as well as good acting from Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron as the Huntsman and the Evil Queen. The dwarfs were also humorous and entertaining to watch. If only the other elements of the movie were as well developed, especially Snow White.I feel like another actor should have been selected to play Snow White, someone that could breathe life into the character who was meant to be the fairest of them all. Kristen Stewart made Snow White as intriguing as the tree prop. It felt like the writers on purpose gave her limited set of lines so that she would not open her mouth too frequently, and not let the audience get drawn in too much into those supposedly emotional moments. Eg. When she bumps into the love of her life who has come to rescue her after many years apart, when she wakes up from the dead, when she ultimately defeats the evil queen and takes over the throne. If you normally expect a tear jerking speech at such occasions, Kristen Stewart just blinked and let these moments fall flat, like she didn't quite comprehend the gravity of the situation.Another element that was underdeveloped is showcasing relationship between Snow White and her long time friend/lover William. William just kind of shows up, Show White blinks at him, and he follows her around with nothing much to say. If his character was scrapped from the movie, you'd barely notice.Overall, the portrayal of Snow White brought this movie down for me. The writers forgot that Snow White is wooden only briefly the end of the story, not through the whole thing."
393,"This movie can't decide if it wants to be a classic Disney-ish fairy tale or something else.Princess locked up for a few years until the day she manage to escape. Crawling through sewers, a day spent running through a swamp, a speech which makes you wonder why she didn't ended it with ""this day will be known as our independence day!"" then equipping a full steel armor suit plus a shield and leading an army against the which. (Tough Princess.)I don't know what you expect from Snow White, but this was so utterly stupid that the boundaries for stupid has been pushed in the wrong direction. Only thing missing was a matrix style slow-mo end fight with the witch."
394,"Well, this could have been a very nice movie but it is just an average pop-corn movie mostly because of Kristen Stewart's super bad performance. The movie starts good. Story is kind of OK. The visuals were well studied and the atmosphere was done in a good way. What ruined this movie for me was Kristen Stewart. I think she has medical problems with her facial muscles. Her face was so expressionless, depressing and boring, I mean it. At some point it starts being disturbing since you cant concentrate the movie. The male characters are not the finest either but at least they try. What a waste of such a nice idea. I feel very sorry for the director."
395,"This is the the second Snow White adaptation released this year. Having seen both of them, one can distinguish the different twists in the story. In this case, screen writers made an action movie with too much attention on visual effects, rather than paying attention to the actual plot.There are parts which are boring throughout the movie and you just wait for the story to move on. Personally i don't think that casting Charlize Theron for the lead role paid well. Especially, during her raged monologues it gives you the impression you are watching an amateur performance in an experimental theatre. Maybe Maria Bello would be a lot better for this role.Basically, i believe that movies which in general use actors for being ""in fashion"" during their casting period, instead of looking for people who actually fit to the role, is pretty obvious at the end product. In other words, people don't like to see the same actor in a number of films throughout the same year just because he/she made a big hit recently. And that's because the ""big hit"" most of the time is because the role is a match for their personality and not via versa."
396,"It was a bit of a smorgasborg. Lets just chuck in heaps of stuff here and see what sticks. To begin with snow white is portrayed as this super spiritual being who is really special. She can look at a murderous ogre and it goes quiet, and I swear, blushes. In the end she becomes a warrior and just stabs the queen, so I don't' see the point of all the calm & peace stuff. This is after saying that although she originally hated the queen, now she just feels sorrow for her. OK i guess you do sometimes ring a birds neck if it's terribly badly hurt.Why use full size actors to portray small people. That irritates me - why not just do the whole thing with cgi & dispense with actors completely. There are enough really talented small actors out there. OK, so I guess if it works one way it can go the other, so we can have small actors doing non-small people roles.I got really fed up with queen and brov, being a total psycho only takes one so far. Honestly get over yourself and stop navel gazing. It honestly got really boring queenie throwing another tantrum, she was probably quite happy to die in the end, just to stop having to hear herself screech.The sanctuary was obviously not a sanctuary as the baddies - psycho brother & his mob - came in and started slaughtering things. So why bother calling it sanctuary?I got quite bored with this film and just hoped someone would kill someone and end it. It was full of magic, but it was not a magical film. It would have been nice if the pace changed to a bit of humour or irony or something. Like the village of the women, I was thinking about the huntsman - aye mate, you're going to have to shag the lot! It's that long since they've had any. But no, no, everyone is just po faced and terribly tedious."
397,"Well, as a fairy tale, this film was very close to accomplish its purpose: to sleep who was viewing it! I expected much more from this movie, but the truth is that I found just a terrible script, poor performances (except I think Charlize Theron), with many boring parts that I think were unnecessary.If there is a section of ""deleted scenes"", I would include many of the original film scenes in this section. They are so many! Perhaps the redeeming issue of the film were some interesting special effects that brought the audience something to see.In my opinion this was another film that does not worth it to go to the cinema to see it. Maybe it's good to see it at home one Sunday night while being in bed there is nothing to see at TV."
398,"The transition from scene to scene in this film was horrible. The lack of character depth even worse. How can you enjoy a movie when you are not given the chance to fall in love with any character or feel the pain/struggle/triumph in and of that character? Not enough action, not enough romance. The Huntsman falls in love with Snow White, but at what point? The guy is ready to abandon her, then suddenly is instantly over his deceased wife? Really? Terrible choice for Snow White, same emotions and her big speech was embarrassing to watch. The Dwarfs were blended and had no real personality of their own.Visually, it was a very pleasing movie. Hemsworth showed depth as an actor(his love for Snow White was believable but when exactly did he fall in love) and Theron was excellent as well. Other than that, I can't really name anything memorable or good.My recommendation: Redbox it for $1, not really a movie you want to own. Zero re-watch value, unless you are on acid."
399,"I am in a rush, so I will keep this short.Acting: The actors were OK. Charlize Theron made for a great evil queen despite a bad script, but it really was Kirsten who shone brightest in this movie. No idea how, but she managed to pull off really well this ""vulnerable-and-pure-yet-courageous-and-down-to-earth-maiden"". Impressive stuff. But the Huntsman. Aye aye aye. Not helped by a bad script, his character was totally unbelievable on a number of occasions (won't list for fear of spoilers, let's just say the biggest ones are early on and towards the end). Queen's brother - no different. The rest were really bland - nobody stuck to mind. 6/10 - because of Kirsten and Charlize, otherwise would have been 5/10CGI and effects: As someone else said before me - nice, but nothing special. Failed to use crowd multiplication in one of the battle scenes which made me wonder ""what kind of an army consists of 100 people or so"". 6.5/10Script: Full of holes like a rat infested old English pub. But OK, it's a fantasy, one can make do with a lot of the holes. What really kills it is the combination of clich√©d characterisation, lack of focus and depth in telling the story, and the holes. Seriously, I would expected in this day and age writers to have idea of multiple dimensions. The one good thing I will note is the derived explanation of why everyone fears the ""Dark Forrest"" and the infiltration in the baddies' camp. 5/10Directing: A let down. At least when it comes to the actors. The director could have really made a difference and saved a poor script, unfortunately though, he was too busy filming the movie. Uninspiring. 6/10The final score is 5/10 overall. It may be more accurate to give it 6/10 but that may make you want to go and see the movie, whereas I am actually telling you - you are only gonna save yourself 2 hours if you don't.NJ"
400,"I was disappointed by ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" The main problem was I didn't like Snow White or the Huntsman. They had little or no charisma and their dialog was banal. Overall, I got bored through parts of the films.On the other hand, the film is worth seeing for Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen. She really hams it up and comes off as pure evil. The costumes she wears are amazing. She is definitely the ""fairest of the all.""Another problem is the film is so dark, serious and violent. I didn't have much fun watching it. A movie about Snow White should be more enjoyable.There was a made-for-television version of Snow White on the Hallmark channel over 10 years ago that was much better than this film. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" isn't terrible, but it should have been better."
401,"I will agree that the film was very aesthetically pleasing with breathtaking effects and great costumes however it seems that this entire film was simply developed around what effects could be implemented into this film. The plot was very under developed and lacked direction or any sense of purpose whatsoever. The dark forest was interesting but served no legitimate purpose. The entire progression of the movie seemed completely random. The writers were so uncreative and so unoriginal that they had to STEEL ideas from Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. The scene with the fairies and the deer was a complete rip off and had absolutely nothing to do with the story, the creators simply wanted to demonstrate the visual effects that they paid literally no attention to development of the plot or characters. The only actor who I believed deserves recognition was Charlize Theron the fact that she could take such a horribly written screenplay and still be brilliant is definitely note worthy. As I write this review I continue to realize how horrible this movie is and continue to rate it lower. The only aspects I believe warrant this movie a 4/10 are the visual effects, the costumes, and Charlize Theron. To summarize this is a horribly written movie created solely for Visual Effects that also had to steel from people who are actually talented."
402,"I was no less than enthralled by the trailer & wanted to catch the movie on its 1st day. I made it to the evening show. The story is really good and has a lot of energy. So are the exotic locales and the acting by everyone. The locales and the camera work are really good & for sure you would not be let down. kristen as snow white is pure beauty. chris as the huntsmen has done quite well. The bad part is the pace of this movie.. i found it seriously slow and dragging. This sometimes made my experience frustrating so much so that i took a small nap in between :). The ingredients are good, the preparation steps are good but the time to cook is something that was the spoiler. So the verdict, if u can sit through this movie , u will enjoy it."
403,"All in all a big disappointment??? I don't know what movie that reviewer watched but this was a very entertaining movie in my opinion. How they made Bob Hoskins look like a dwarf is obviously due to CGI. It was definitely a good job. Now what actually pushed the envelope of believability was Kirsten Stewart's role. It is great movie fare but for some one who has been imprisoned for many years from about 10-12 years old where does she get her marital skills and acumen? Charlize Theron plays the evil one very well. Of course she gets killed by Kristen in the end. Which as evil as her character is is definitely deserved, as is every vile evil character in the movies. The dwarf's are a hoot and a vital part of the movie. Helmsworth turns out to be the reviving factor after the apple is eaten. All in all a very nice take on an old fairy tale."
404,"We just left the theater, checking out Snow White and the Huntsman... 1st let me say , while there may be a Dark and Enchanted Forest, singing blue birds and even Seven Dwarfs, this is not your Walt Disney's Snow White it's more like the Brothers Grimm meets Lord of the Rings... The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is dispatched by the evil queen to kill Snow White but along the way something happens people begin to change... I thought the show was incredibly great! Snow White herself wasn't as entertaining as the Queen or the huntsman. I gave this Show an 8 out of 10. (by the way Charlize Theron is an incredible actor... can't wait to see her in Prometheus!)"
405,"What can I say about this movie...it had potential but it failed epically.There were too many cheesy parts to this film and a lot of unanswered questions. In fact almost every question that may have been brought up in the film went unanswered. For example why is it that Snow White was respected by a troll? That was never answered and also what was the real significance of the moose? The logic in this film was also way off, Snow White never had a scratch on her despite being in a battle, being imprisoned, jumping off of a cliff and going through a killer forest. She even had perfect speech yet probably had no social life in a dungeon. There were too many unbelievable and unrealistic things in this film. Acting wise Chris Hemsworth was really good but most of his parts especially comedy wise were destroyed by Kristen Stewart's awful acting. She needs to go to or go back to acting school. She showed no expression the whole film whether to love or anger to a Ravenna who kept her locked up most of her life,destroyed her kingdom and killed her father. It was painful to watch her expressions as it often looks like she is confused on what to do or how to react. Charlize Theron also did a nice job although the poor directing clearly ruined some of her scenes as she stood for too long in some scenes doing next to nothing. The dwarfs were also pretty convincing. Another problem with this movie was that the drama aspects and the love portion of the story amounted to nothing and the action scenes (minus though's with Chris Hemsworth) were very dull especially Snow White's not to epic battle at the end where she stabs Ravenna and quotes something about fairest blood which of course was never explained properly and we weren't sure if the blade had blood on it or if she just had to stab her. One thing I did not buy from this film was this fairest pure garbage because Snow White seemed far from pure being a coward, horrible strategist, whorish (kissing two guys and girl) and killing people. There was nothing special in her character that showed she was pure, all we saw was some beast obeying her which was not further explained.All in all this movie is a 4 because of poor directing, some plot holes and Kristen Stewart's horrible acting especially towards the end."
406,I've looked at reviews for this movie on this site a billion times and all I ever hear is that this movie would be fantastic if Kristin Stewart was not in it. People say she's whiny' does not do any acting and is moody and is not a good actress and is the same in every role. I recommend that you open your mind and give Krisitin and this movie a chance. I think you will be surprised to find out that this is a really great movie. Don't concentrate solely on Kristin Stewart and think about other things like the make up and the costumes and the set and the action effects and the film editing and more. I personally LOVE Kristin Stewart as an actress. I'm only telling you to to not concentrate on her because I want you to watch this movie and give this very good movie a chance. This is a fantastic epic movie of a lifetime and I think you will really enjoy it. So please do yourself a favor and watch this movie without whining that Kristin Stewart is awful as Snow White and then maybe you'll give this movie the same rating I did and even if you don't at least TRY it. Because the last thing I'm gonna say about this movie is that everyone should see it at least ONCE in their lives.
407,"I really didn't have any interest in SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN and it took quite a few reviews to get me to the point that my interest rose to the point of giving it a chance. A classic fairy tale re-imagined from the bright, colorful world we've become accustomed to (thanks for Walt Disney) to a grim, violent adventure sounds interesting enough. The original Snow White tale did have it's darker elements so I suppose it was only a matter of time in this post-DARK KNIGHT world of movies that a ""gritty, real"" version of a classic children's tale would hit the big screen. This new version of the Snow White tale is directed by Rupert Sanders, whom I'd never heard of but apparently had a successful career in the world of commercial direction. It shows a bit here, with the movie's flashy elements and uneven pacing that might be a result of his previous work limited to 30-60 second advertisements. The story is one we're all more than familiar with (unless your childhood was a bit sheltered): Snow White's father is murdered and the evil witch Ravenna rises to power in his kingdom. Snow White is imprisoned in a castle tower until she comes of age, when Ravenna learns the key to immortality lies in Snow White's beating heart. Snow White escapes from the castle and is taken under the protection of a drunken huntsman who was originally tasked with bringing Snow White's heart to the Queen. They meet some dwarfs, rally the troops, and Snow White leads an epic battle against Ravenna's forces to free the people. Wait, I don't remember that part in the original fairy tale¬ÖThis movie obviously draws a lot of its visual influence from Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS movies. This movie is established in a magnificent fantasy world inhabited with fantastical creatures and magic. The production design probably sapped the majority of the budget with impressive landscapes, imposing castle fortresses, and magical lands of both good (the Sanctuary) and evil (the Dark Forest). The look of the film is probably one of the best parts and no one can fault the filmmakers for not having a vision. Everything about the movies looks amazing and the visual effects are seamless. They are going for the epic feel we associate with the magical epics we've been given in the past decade (LOTR, Harry Potter, etc.) and it succeeds in that regard. My primary complaint with the movie is more about the stop-and-go feel to the whole thing; it's pacing is just jolting at times. We'll get a tight, thrilling action sequence and then the exposition will drag us on to the next plot point. A lot of wandering. After Snow White and the Huntsman begin their journey and escape the Dark Forest, the movie just screeches to a halt until the dwarfs enter the picture. Then, once the novelty of the dwarfs wear off, the movie slows down again until the final act.While the movie suffers from pacing issues, it's saved from mediocrity thanks to the production value and the talent of the cast. Well, not all of them. I've never seen a TWILIGHT movie (and, if all goes well, I never will) but I did enjoy Kristen Stewart in THE RUNAWAYS in 2010. I haven't completely written her off as a possible talent but her turn in SNOW WHITE is not helping her case. She doesn't really do much of anything here, emotionally. She's living up to the running joke that she's got one expression in her acting arsenal, and that expression is a mixture of fear and constipation. The rest of the cast: top notch. Chris Hemsworth (THOR) has just about solidified his place as a rising action star that can actually act. He's really the star of this movie with his huntsman providing more emotional involvement in the movie than the title character as he finds a reason to live life following the death of his wife. Charlize Theron is beyond over-the-top as the evil Queen Ravenna, and it totally works within the scope of this movie. I never quite bought her accent but the scenery chewing makes for a great villain in an otherwise serious film. And then there's the dwarfs. Honestly, by the time the dwarfs arrived in the movie, I'd completely forgotten they were supposed to be there. I guess that's a compliment for how drawn-in I was for the first 45 minutes or so of the movie. The dwarfs are a rag-tag group of familiar talent: Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, Nick Frost, etc. The mix of visual and practical effects to create dwarfs of these men works perfectly, and the dwarfs were one of my favorite elements of the film.SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN is more of a hit than a miss. It caters to both men (with its fantasy sword/sorcery action) and women (with its tale of love) enough that there's something here to make the movie enjoyable for just about anyone. I don't see it becoming anyone's favorite movie and I hope the rumors of a potential sequel prove to be false, but this movie is worth a viewing and a solid fairy tale for adults."
408,"I admit, I was completely unsure of what to expect from Snow White and the Huntsman the minute I began to watch it. I had had no previous interest in the film, but had instead decided to wait until it reached the Redbox before even considering giving it a go. It had been a simple act of boredom- I had nothing to do on a Friday night, saw this was available, and decided to give it a shot.And in all honesty, I was pleasantly surprised.SWATH is a dark twist on the Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. You begin the movie with the birth of Snow White, whose mother soon passes. In a blind act of grief, Snow's father, King Magnus, leads his army into battle against the Dark Army. After the strange victory over the glass-soldiers, the King discovers a woman, Ravenna, that has been held ""captive."" Blinded by her beauty, he rescues her, and takes her back to his castle where he plans to make her his Queen. Following the wedding, Ravenna turns out to be an evil sorceress and the true commander of the Dark Army. She kills King Magnus, and takes control of Tabor. Chaos ensues, and she immediately captures Snow White and keeps her captive in a tower in the castle. Many years pass. Ravenna's dark magic has rid the land of any life, and Tabor is practically a wasteland. In a room in the castle, she has a Mirror, which she consults often. One day, she calls upon the Mirror, asking who the fairest of all is. Unlike the normal response she receives, she learns that Snow White has surpassed her. So begins a journey in which the Huntsman, a former ally of the Queen, joins Snow White on a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen and gain back her throne.Now that my brief summary is over, here's my review. Let's begin with the casting. I had no idea that Chris Hemsworth was even in this until I watched it, but found that he delivered a very good show. He was believable, had a strong character, and proved to be a very excellent huntsman. If you had any hate or dislike towards this movie, I'm sure it had nothing to do with Chris Hemsworth.Charlize Theron played the Dark Queen, and I must say, she was excellent. She just seemed to meld with her character, pulling off every bit of beauty, evil, and twisted soul that the evil antagonist should be. And then we have Kristen Stewart. Many people say that they didn't watch this movie simply because she was in it. Others say she made the same performance she does in all the movies she does. I will be the one to admit that this is true, but you may be surprised to know that her ""emotionally damaged"" acting personality actually worked for this movie. This girl has had both of her parents murdered, she's been locked in a tower her whole life, and is going through physical and emotional turmoil when she finally DOES manage to escape. I'm not trying to say that she is a great actor, but her acting style really did work for this movie. Many people will disagree simply because of her acting in the Twilight saga, but I thought that she did really well in SWATH.The rest of the cast does extremely well. Sam Spruell as Finn, Sam Claflin as William, and especially Ian McShane as Beith. He stole every scene he was in.This film does have it's moments of confusion, and there are plot holes. But I believe that there are too many good things about this film that simply force you to overlook those faults. There are scenes that are simply breathtaking, and if I may point one out, the whole Sanctuary scene was just amazing. In Snow White and the Huntsman, there is drama, tension, romance, angst, good vs. evil, and everything in between. It's hard not to get satisfaction from this film. It's definitely not the best, but I do know that I will be buying this film the minute I find myself able to. Cast: 8/10 Plot: 9/10 Overall film: 8/10"
409,"I only finished the movie because Kristen Stewart is a babe. Fake English accents and all (Theron, Stewart), I thought it was abysmal. Stewart's looks, as I said, and the dwarfs were the only redeeming features. Some will think I'm being chauvinistic concerning Ms. Stewart, but I'm serious when I say that she was the only reason I didn't hit ""STOP"" within the first 30 minutes. I find it amazing that she was involved in this, these types of movies rarely succeed. Some are praising Theron's acting. The instrument with which to measure the ridiculousness of that has yet to be invented! At least the ending was not as I envisioned, and that's good. Imo, Snow White was dry and humorless, mostly. I would go into greater detail as to why it was, for me, a flop, but it would be a waste of my time. Children and adults who live in fantasy worlds will enjoy this."
410,"the director's assumption that she can pull off the characters premise, does!Snow White and the Huntsman is NOTHING more than a bad action flick, which toys with being something more on the edges. There were potentially interesting questions to be explored: What ""curse""/""spell"" parents inflict on their children and how the children can overcome this and become their own person. - The typical Snow White conflict between the ages and beauty - Using beauty as a weapon in a misogynistic worldBut then the flick decided to go ""nah, lets have LOTR style battles and have Kristen look constipated all the time"" and did none of the exploring.The atmosphere shifts mid-movie from fairytale-creepy to cheesy-trite adventure and the writers couldn't decide if Snow White was a pure innocent girl, a plank or some kind of empowered Jeanne D'Arc. I'm not sure there was supposed to be any character development, as it feels like Snow White's character jumps between supposed personalities (not that Kristen pulls it off). Feels almost like they had a different writer for every 10 minutes.Consequently, the characters are flat as a board, the plot is criminally unsurprising, putting Kristen vs Theron is laughable!, the death of a dwarf (yeah, spoiler), leaves you cold, your hopes are being raised by some interesting points only to smack you in the face and the action is ... not even thrilling, just choreography.The good? Theron is amazing, the scenery is beautiful. But you know that from the trailer."
411,"Where do you go with a Brothers Grimm story that has been told and retold about a thousand times? The writers and film debut director, Rupert Sanders, were right to think that you need to do something different‚Äîespecially with another Snow White movie, Mirror, Mirror, being released just months prior. While staying true to the essence of the story, the focal points were changed to bring a fresh film experience to audiences who still came for a good fairytale. Filled with action and adventure, it is very light on the typical fairytale romance.As expected, the wicked witch, Ravenna, (Charlize Theron) makes a swift entrance into the kingdom and, in one night of chaos, takes control of the kingdom and plunges it in to darkness. The uncertainty of her future value to Ravenna is the only thing that saves the young, pure hearted Snow (Kristen Stewart).After surviving many years in the North Tower, the young princess seizes her chance and makes a daring escape. Desperate to kill Snow, Ravenna makes promises to a broken hearted huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) in exchange for the girl. Longing for his own healing, the huntsman heads into the woods and quickly locates the girl. At this point, the queen's deception is revealed and the expert huntsman flees with Snow to save them both.The journey that follows takes the two fugitives through new, as well as familiar, chapters in the well-known fairytale. They travel through dark and dangerous places until they arrive at the Sanctuary, a world of fairies in a peaceful, lush green forest, reminiscent of the world of Avatar. Here they find temporary rest until danger catches up with them and once again they are fleeing for their lives.While the acting of Kristen Steward falls flat, Charlize Theron brings intensity to the character of Ravenna. Her desperation to kill Snow White is felt by all. Chris Hemsworth's inner struggle to find peace and honour is also well portrayed.Sanders took full advantage of the natural beauty of the United Kingdom as the filming location of this medieval story. The lush green countryside contrasts well with the despairing kingdom which has turned black under Ravenna's rule. The rugged shoreline, crashing with magnificent waves, adds an element of natural strength to scenes of escape as well as battle. The beautiful scenery is paired with an effective film score that is able to evoke emotion, from peace and tranquillity to anxiety, panic and horror.Many subtle references are made in the film‚Äîfrom Robin Hood-esque moments of survival in the bleak days of the queen's rule to a momentary image so strikingly like Joan of Arc as Snow White prepares for battle. Interestingly some of the strongest elements of the original storyline are so subtle that viewers would miss the significance of the moments without prior knowledge.I think that the film was true to the trailer and poster advertising. For viewers to be disappointed, they would have to have had missed its promotion entirely. In my opinion, it delivers an engaging, though not overly heavy, two hours of entertainment value."
412,"I liked that the movie's plot didn't go entirely as I expected, in several key ways. We never get any big romantic scenes. That's not to say that there isn't a lovely romance happening quietly within it all, but it's not the win condition. Snow White doesn't resolve the conflict by winning the heart of her Prince Charming.I also loved the fact that the writers had all the ingredients for a love triangle and they just don't go anywhere near it. Although both male leads are fond of Snow White, they don't let their feelings cloud their judgment. There's never a moment when either has even a single jealous glance. We never have a scene where Snow White agonizes over which one she's in love with. Both men are essential to the plot, but they are ultimately both incidental to Snow White successfully bringing the plot to a close. Again, a pleasant, well-executed surprise.Charlize Theron chewed the scenery as the Queen, which made the character work. You hated the Queen and yet at the same time ached horribly for her. Her powers were formidable and yet frustratingly limited. She oozed evil but was never campy. Theron adds a level of believability to what otherwise could have been a cardboard villainess. In her hands, it was clear that the Queen wasn't shallow: she had plenty of depth, but the only things she had in those depths were pain, betrayal, fear, and a life without selfless, trustworthy love.I also liked how the Queen never indicates that she's jealous of Snow White's beauty; the mirror is more of a measure of the strength of her magic than a means of perpetuating vanity. The word ""fairest"" takes on a different meaning in this movie, referring more to righteousness than to beauty. Snow White's claim to fame is repeatedly established as her moral blamelessness, not her looks. (Yay!) When the Queen asks the mirror if she herself is the fairest one, she's asking whether she still has the moral high ground, compared to the men in her life who have used her. When she encounters Snow White, though, her own sense of righteousness pales in comparison to true righteousness. This is a tale of a woman whose life was twisted around a lie that eventually destroyed her. Her actual death felt more tragic than triumphant and Theron was utterly convincing.When Chris Hemsworth had a chance to do something other than swing a heavy weapon around and growl at things, which he's great at, he did it well. The Huntsman is almost immediately an interesting, unexpected character: he's a widower. That one fact of his existence drives nearly everything else he does and makes him more than just a thug. After all the physicality of the character throughout the movie, Hemsworth's performance in the pivotal waking scene was a marked contrast and was all the more powerful for it.Kristin Stewart is believable an orphaned and imprisoned teenager: an old soul in some ways because of the pain she's endured, but a woman-child in so many other ways. Yes, her perpetually-open mouth is a bit tedious, but the fierce fragility she conveys is the right note for Snow White.The movie is visually gorgeous: the landscapes are beautiful, the fairies looked otherworldly without being cutesy, Sanctuary was breathtaking, the dwarfs were a great mix of comic/tragic, and the Queen's scenes were all worth watching a second time. You never get bored with the visuals.But the real reasons I liked the movie were all the ways in which it didn't go where I expected, and yet still worked. It was both satisfying and left me wanting more. Excellent."
413,"The biggest casting mistake they made with this movie was Charlize Theron. Because her awesome acting talent makes poor Kristen Stewart look like a piker in comparison. Kristen, unfortunately has two facial expressions, and most of the time you cannot determine if she is sad, angry, afraid, or just tired because she looks exactly the same in each case. Even when she is rousing the peasantry to fight, her expression never changes. Contrast this to the incredible wedding scene early in the movie when Theron transmits her thoughts and feelings without speaking a word, using only her eyes and facial features.As my summary statement would indicate, there are a lot of parallels between this movie and Star Wars. You have the Princess (who is the savior of the people); the handsome rogue who secretly loves her (Solo/Huntsman) evil ruler (Vader/Ravenna), comical side-kicks (droids/dwarves);handsome male counterpart (Luke/William); armies (stormtroopers/knights), etc. This is especially noticeable when the Huntsman makes a comment about how ""fetching"" Snow White looks in her armor - the statement reeks of a Princes Leia/Han Solo exchange.Aside from this, we never get a sense that Snow White has really anything special going for her. Everybody talks about the ""light"" that shines from her and, of course, the animals all love her, but again, she has the same facial expression throughout. I realize that the tone of the film requires a little more grit than the Disney version, but even so, I was not convinced.The high points of the film are, of course, scenes with Ravenna who, predictably steals the movie despite very good performances by most of the rest of the cast. Obviously, the producers were hoping to cash in on the popularity of Kristen Stewart thanks to the Twilight Movies. Although she gives it a good try, her performance is lackluster and unconvincing on all levels.Overall it is a good movie and well worth watching and I would recommend it to others."
414,"I liked it. I read some of the other reviews (there are several hundred). What do you go to the movies for? Excitement? Action? Special Effects? Everyone has a different agenda. I liked this film because it was both quite different than I expected and yet somewhat predictable. The DVD extended version is better than the theatrical one. Of course the Evil Queen has to die at the end, and that is the major weakness of the film, as she in supposed to be invulnerable, like Superman. Nothing can kill her. Yet,somehow, there is an element of ""magic"" in Snow White that allows her to stab the Queen to death(?) She interacts with the forest creatures and has the ability to regenerate flora and fauna. How? (This is not explained.) Also, I expected Snow White to be a little prettier! She looks tired after all the battle scenes! Anyway, there is a lot to this movie: The untold romantic story between Snow White and the Huntsman, the strange connection between the evil queen and her brother, the evil figure that emerges from the magic mirror (which reminds me of the liquid-guy from ""Terminator 2""). The CGI is fantastic and flawless: The ogre, the dark forest, the fairyland. Most of the castles are CGI but look very real. They used ""motion-capture"" for a lot of it (the dwarfs, ogre) and it looks very convincing. I think that the people who didn't like this film saw a different movie than I did. Yes, it was long, but so was every part of ""The Lord of the Rings"". Faults: 1. Some elements of the film seemed too familiar: sucking the ""life-force"" out of people (a plot device used in all these movies: Life Force, Stardust, Hocus-Pocus). 2. The CGI generated battles are too familiar looking. 3. A ""Joan of Arc"" style ending with Snow White leading the charge is a bit over-the-top. How I wish I had seen this on a large movie theater screen. Warning: This is not a ""kiddie"" movie. PG-13 and they mean it."
415,"I had delayed going to see this movie because Kristen Stewart was in it. I mean she plays every character exactly the same and I didn't want to see the same performance yet again. I so so so wish they had cast someone else in this role. I also expected the Snow White character to be far more beautiful than both the little and adult Snow White's where.By far, the stand out performance was Charlize Theron. She was just amazing and it's worth seeing this movie just for her performance. There were a few problems with plot along the way but I turned my brain off and just watched what was a very pretty movie to watch. Cinematography was brilliant.Bottom line, if you're like me and not seeing this movie simply because Kristen is in it, then don't let that stop you. Really enjoyed it and will definitely see it again soon."
416,"Snow White is back in theaters for a second time this year but is she the fairest of them all?An extremely hot Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) seeks eternal life and beauty and overthrows kingdoms in the land with her dark magic. All of this, because women can hold grudges like no other. Only Snow White (Kristen Stewart), who is the purest of them all, can break the curse and stop the Queen. Yeah, yeah. I think we are familiar with the story of Snow White, especially with Mirror Mirror recently in theaters and Once Upon A Time taking over the television airwaves this year.What you expected: Amazing special effects and an emotionless Stewart.What you get: It's true. Most of the special effects are truly breathtaking, especially when the tone in grim. The film really captures the somber environment of the kingdom ruled by the Evil Queen. However, when the group travels to, what we can call, the Disney inspired version of Snow White, the effects look dated and fake. For the purposes of this film, I wish that stylistically it would have stayed away from the scenes that play to a younger audience. There could have been a better way for to portray a sanctuary without breaking up the film.Your question: Can Kristen Stewart play a good Snow White and carry the film?I usually don't pay attention to the criticism of Stewart and her emotionless Twilight role, but it carried over in this performance. Stewart was supposed to portray a truly pure princess. However, I rarely got the feeling that she was the 'chosen one' and could stop the Evil Queen. In fact, I got the feeling that many people in the audience were gunning for the Evil Queen. At one point, Snow White gives a speech towards the end of the movie to try to rally the troops. However, instead of delivering an inspiring speech, like in Independence Day, her loud voice has one level, awkward. Overall, I don't think Stewart gave the character enough innocence and kindness it would take to play Snow. Instead she gave off an emo/misunderstood vibe.You Thought: Chris Hemsworth is going to play a kick-ass hunky Huntsman.And you would not be wrong. Hemsworth does a good job playing this type-casted character. The Huntsman is the only character with any real depth that the audience can make a connection to or rally behind. Not to mention again that his is a plus for all the ladies in the crowd, with his large flexing muscles and long flowing hair. I mean, I've only heard those things about him; I didn't really notice. . .Other Notes:I really like that there was a sense of urgency to stop the Queen. It made her feel more evil because she is extremely cold-blooded and will stop at nothing to get what she wants. She conjures spells that are creepy, gross, and makes hairs curl.There was a scene, however, where a character flops on the floor like a fish, which is completely laughable and takes the audience out of the experience. Truly some of the worst acting/direction I've ever seen in one contained scene.I'm really glad with the direction they took the magic mirror. It was innovative the way the mirror came to life.The ending just cuts off. For the audience members that did establish a connection with the characters, it would have been nice to take two minutes extra to wrap up the story. I'm not talking about a Return of the King type ending, but some ending would have been nice.Conclusion:Is it a great summer action movie? YesIs it Inception/Batman/LOTR quality and should you expect that? Definitely not.Snow White and the Huntsman was a fun action film, with great special effects. I like the dark, imaginative environment, and felt engrossed in the overall experience, especially in the dark forest. However, Snow White gave a weak performance and the Huntsman is regrettably forgettable.""I don't like killing girls. I do!"""
417,"Who ever cast the forever-dazed-looking Kristen Stewart in the role of Snow White needs to rethink their career path. I mean seriously, I was hoping Kristen's performance in twilight was a reflection of the character and not of her actual acting ability, I was sadly mistaken.The scenes where success hinged on Kristen's ability to show ""some"" emotion were incredibly disappointing, to the point where the entire scene was simply awkward to watch. I found myself sitting in the theatre thinking, how many shoots did it take to get this one scene... and this is the best of the best? So other then Kristen's acting the movie itself actually wasn't that bad, the story had a nice spin on the classic, and both Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did wonderfully with their respective roles.Overall I give it a 6, it's not a theatre movie but it'd still make a decent renter when it comes out for home release."
418,"Underwhelming. Aimless. Disappointing. All words that I've heard my grandmother use to describe my Uncle Larry's life. But these words also convey the snooze-inducing experience of watching Snow White and the Huntsman.Centered on the implausible ‚Äì and downright laughable ‚Äì premise that Kristen Stewart is fairer than Charlize Theron, Snow White lumbers out of the gate at such a slow pace that my interest was immediately disengaged and I soon found it hard to stay awake. The film is peppered with moments of action and fight scenes, but the pacing remains uneven throughout and viewers ultimately receive nothing more than false hope that the story will eventually come alive.The main problem with this is that all the trailers I had seen were action-packed and promised a dark and thrilling adventure. As such, they certainly served their purpose ‚Äì I was convinced to pay to see this on the big screen. Unfortunately, the 2 1/2 minutes of jam-packed action we're treated to in the trailers is spread throughout two hours of runtime, leaving a whole bunch of wandering filler.It's a shame because I was on board for a re-imagining of the Snow White fairy tale. Unfortunately, the film's lack of imagination caused me to jump ship. The uneven pacing, uninteresting dialogue, and uninspired action all make for one big missed opportunity. Sure, the cinematography is easy on the eyes, and the special effects provide a little fun, but overall the film gives us no real substance, and to be honest, not enough style to compensate.Theron is great as the Queen. Despite a few moments of some voracious scene-chewing, she takes the role seriously and gives it her all. Stewart, on the other hand, does what she does in every movie I've ever seen her in ‚Äì act like Kristen Stewart. Therein lies a major problem with the story's narrative ‚Äì Theron is more convincing as the antagonist than Stewart is as the protagonist. She gives a big speech near the end of the film that's meant to inspire her friends ‚Äì and I suppose the audience ‚Äì as she sets to do battle with the Queen, but all it inspired within me were a few giggles. The fact that her pulled back hair and chain mail makes her look like a 10-year-old boy dressed up as a knight for Halloween doesn't exactly make her any more convincing.Snow White and the Huntsman isn't a terrible movie and it has a few shining moments, but it is terribly unbalanced and the shine quickly fades. You'd be wise to wait for it to hit Redbox or Netflix."
419,"This is how the film went: It started out boring, then it picked up, got boring again, picked up the pace again and then ended boring. Kristen Stewart was a better actress in this than in twilight. Hemsworth was good, not great. The whole concept and idea was good. The rubbish ending kind of game me the feeling of a sequel coming. A few things bothered me. Firstly when she just happens to find a horse on the beach (very handy if you ask me) she then easily mounts it and can suddenly gallop off bareback. Bareback is not easy to do, especially galloping. So how can a 16/17 year old girl who's been locked in a tower for about 10 years know how to gallop a horse bareback? It also conveniently stopped in the village. Next, the stag.... I mean have some imagination! I've seen a stag be the life of the forest in tons of films, I'd have liked to see another animal be the ""king"" of the forest. There were a lot of convenient things that happened in this film. What I liked was the Queen, thought that side was executed brilliantly.And despite the stag I liked the forest, technology at its best.Very beautiful. The ending disappointed me. It was very boring to, what seemed, a fairly good film so far. Big let down and clearly there is going to be a sequel."
420,"Adult reworking of the Snow White fairy tale. Here the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who is sent to capture Snow White (Kristen Stewart) by the evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) ends up protecting her.I have no problem with someone rewriting the Snow White tale and making it for adult audiences (I don't care if it has a PG-13 rating--this is for adults ONLY) but this was WAY too dark. It looks fantastic with incredible scenery and plenty of CGI but it's very dark and vicious. You see people getting killed (but no blood for the PG-13 rating) and LOTS of battles and there's a negative, depressing tone throughout. It really wore me down. This is NOT for children! On the up side it is well-done. As I said before the scenery was incredible and the movie does move fairly quick. Also the visit to Sanctuary is breath-taking and the only light sequence in the film! As for the acting--Stewart never was a good actress...and she STILL isn't. She's blank-faced throughout and I had trouble caring about her. Hemsworth (a good actor) wasn't much better but the poor guy is give nothing to work with! On the other hand Theron has the showy role as the evil queen and she runs with it. She chews the scenery often but in an amusing way. Also Sam Claflin is good as William--a childhood sweetheart of Rose.This has gotten raves from critics and I can (sort of) see what they like but it left me cold. Way too depressing--this deserved an R rating. I can only give it a 6."
421,"The story of Snow White is one we've all been familiar with since childhood, either through the Disney animated movie or the original Brothers Grimm fairy tale. However Snow White and the Huntsman presents a totally new take on the legend, one of sorcery, battle scenes, and LOTR-style fantasy adventure. This movie is satisfying on every level and offers solid performances, awesome visuals and battle scenes, and a gritty fantasy element that is certainly not for children, despite the Snow White brand name. The story itself is fairly simple and for the most part retains the basic plot points of the original tale we all know...it's basically Snow White and the Huntsman vs. the Queen and her supernatural forces as they try to get to the castle and end her rule forever. With some fantasy creatures, trolls, fairies, and of course dwarfs thrown in for good measure. The cast really goes a long way, particularly Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen...she's never before played a role like this so it's great fun to see her really cut loose and and let the villainy fly. She was the highlight of the film for me. Chris Hemsworth was good as the Huntsman even if the role is very similar to Thor at times, as far as actions and appearance. And Kristin Stewart is finally in a role that didn't annoy me and made for a convincing Snow White. The actors who played the dwarfs were solid and entertaining as well, giving some humor to the proceedings. Cinematography and visuals were excellent and worth the price of admission alone. The battle scenes were cool, if not really anything new from most other similarly themed movies. Overall I highly recommend this movie, certainly gives your money's worth and if you are a fan of Charlize Theron or fantasy movies it's worth a look,like looking in the ""mirror mirror on the wall!"""
422,"Snow White and the Huntsman retells the classic story in a much more edgier, darker, and (believe it or not) violent manner, showcasing exceptional visual effects and cinematography. The film adds a scarier twist to the original story, but it stays faithful to it. Newbie director Rupert Sanders does a fine job executing the story and the characters, but fails to flesh them out and develop them as people we're supposed to look up to, lacking emotional depth. That is to say, this is still a perfectly good film: visually stunning, beautifully shot, simple story, and never boring. Rupert Sanders has what it takes to make a great film. I'm expecting one from him in the future. If you don't already know the Snow White story, it's basically about an evil queen, Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron), whom, according to her magic mirror, isn't the ""fairest one of all"" in the kingdom. The ""fairer"" one is of course Snow White (played by Kristen Stewart), who has been imprisoned in the Ravenna's castle for most of her life since the queen killed her father (who had originally took control of the kingdom). Ravenna orders her brother, Finn (played by Sam Spruell) to retrieve Snow White from her cell and bring the girl to her. Snow White eventually escapes the castle into the land, where help, beauty, and danger awaits. At this point, Ravenna is ticked off. She wants to be the ""fairest"" one in the kingdom. Out of jealousy, she wants Snow White so she can consume her heart, taking away Snow's beauty. She orders the heroic Huntsman (played by Chris Hemsworth) to hunt down Snow White. When Snow White and the Huntsman finally encounter each other in the dark forest, they work together. Snow White wants to get an army and attack on Ravenna and her army, reclaiming her father's kingdom. It's a fun ride. As I said before, the film has sensational visual effects. Queen Ravenna's castle, both interior and exterior, looks amazing. It has a very eerie vibe to it that feels appropriate. Though, as far as visual effects go, the two locations that stand out the most are the spooky dark forest and the fairy sanctuary land. The dark forest is a terrific set piece. Very imaginative. The ground shoots out this gas that makes the person who inhales it hallucinate. And, my God, you see some creepy s***. The fairy land, which is the home of all of the fairies and little animals like rabbits and deer and what not. This, too, is a very imaginative set piece. It's visually beautiful. This set piece alone makes the film worthy of a Best Visual Effects Oscar. The film has a lot of battle sequences, maybe a little too many. But they're all very riveting and exciting. They are well-executed by Sanders and the visuals add to the excitement. The battle scene on the beach is the best action sequence in the film. What's not to like? There is a lot to appreciate in Snow White and the Huntsman. But the film is pretty flawed. Excluding Charlize Theron's portrayal as Queen Ravenna, the performances aren't so great. Kristen Stewart does well delivering a monologue towards the end of the film, but everything before is still her dull, one-emotion acting. Chris Hemsworth was fine, but he could have made the Huntsman a more exciting character. What's good is that the film has Charlize Theron playing the queen. She is marvelous. She makes a great villain, giving a really menacing look and feel to the character. She steals every single scene she is in. When she screams, it's pretty frightening. I want to add that the dwarfs are in it, and they're great! Through the use of visual effects, they digitally made these great actors into smaller people. These actors include: Nick Frost, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, and many more. It's nice to see these great actors playing the dwarfs. They're very fun and they supply some great comic relief. In some moments the performances seem kind of laughable because of how bad the dialogue is. Not all of the script is poorly written, but in many sequences it falls flat. The movie is also a tad too long. Maybe because of the one-too many battle scenes. It runs 2hrs and 7mins. It feels much longer. Is all of this exciting? Yes. It's a great thrill ride. As a large-scale action epic with countless visual effects, it's well made. The problem is that it lacks heart. This is a movie where, under it's battles and violence, should have some heart. It doesn't because you don't really feel for these characters. Like I said before, it lacks emotional depth. While the visual effects may certainly be memorable, the characters really aren't. Despite it's flaws, Snow White and the Huntsman is a fun ride from beginning to end. It could have been a great movie if the characters were more fleshed out and the script was improved, but it's good entertainment for a summer blockbuster. The visuals are terrific though. This is something you should definitely pick up on blu-ray when it comes out. It's a good movie: nothing more, nothing less."
423,"The story of Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs has been told for 100s of years. Do we really need another take on a story that's been told & retold a number of times? Well, in this case, we do. Snow White & the Huntsman is a fresh & dark approach to the classic fairy tale. Ravenna(Charlize Theron), is an evil sorceress who steals people's youth to stay young forever. She does this by either sucking in their youth through her mouth or pulling their hearts out with her bare hands. When she marries a king, she kills him and takes his place as ruler of the kingdom becoming, Queen Ravenna. Ravenna decides to lock up the king's daughter, Snow White(Kristen Stewart). Years later when she asks the enchanted mirror as to who is the fairest of them all, the mirror tells her that she is. However, the mirror also tells her that the king's daughter, Snow White is going to be the fairest of them all. All the queen has to do is, rip her heart out & then she'll be young & immortal forever. However, Snow White somehow escapes from the tower and ventures into the dark forest. Ravenna can't enter the dark forest as her powers don't work there. So, in comes the Huntsman(Chris Hemsworth). The queen orders the Huntsman who has come out of the dark forest alive once before to find Snow White capture her & bring her to the castle immediately. This is the summary of the movie.The reason I like this take on the fairy tale is because there are a number of fresh twists. For example, Snow White is not just a petite princess in this adaptation. She's a warrior who leads an army into battle at the last moments of the film to kill the evil Queen Ravenna. Another interesting twist is that in this flick, she has two possible grooms or princes. Snow White has to choose between the brave & kindhearted Huntsman and her childhood flame William(Sam Claflin). One tweak that I didn't like in this movie is that the dwarfs don't have as big a role as they do in the original story. The other aspects of the tale are intact. The Poison Apple, for example. A note on the performances. Kristen Stewart is impressive as Snow White. There is a massive improvement in her acting abilities compared to the Twilight movies. Charlize Theron is mind blowing as Ravenna. There are quite a few moments where the viewer feels sad for the queen & understands her pain. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as the Huntsman. His acting is as good as it was when he portrayed Thor in Thor & The Avengers respectively. Sam Claflin is effective as William. Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones & Brian Gleeson are spectacular as the seven dwarfs, Beith, Muir, Gort, Nion, Duir, Coll & Gus respectively. My main problem with this movie is that it wasn't converted into 3D when it deserved a conversion from 2D to 3D. Anyway, Snow White & the Huntsman is worth one watch. Complete value for money. Go for it."
424,I went to see this thinking it would be great what could go wrong with Chris Hemsworth ans Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. The answer absolutely everything. I was willing to give it a chance even after the first hour of boring mush but i just couldn't believe what an epic fail it was and that i should have gone to see something else and I'm being generous with giving it a two believe me when you see this you'll be thinking the same thing. I was excited when i saw the advertisement on the t.v. but believe me what you saw on the advertisement was the best parts of the entire movie. I never felt as bored in my entire life i really should have gone to see Men and Black 3.
425,"Just been and seen this, had high hopes for it but it lets itself down in many ways apart from the visuals which are amazing.The start is so slow without any real character development or purpose. I nearly nodded off before it started to pick up (around the introduction of the 7 dwarfs). I cannot describe it in any other way but boring and very much pitched towards to twilight generation, the huntsman goes from 0 to 100 in a second and for the most part is overly clich√© and cheesy.It does pick up but after 2hrs 7mins I walked away thinking it lacked very little substance and point with massive plot holes.This review sums it up in a line: ""A strong visual style tussles with flaccid storytelling in this ambitious retelling of Grimm""."
426,"We just saw Snow White and were underwhelmed. The producers had all the ingredients, great visuals, powerful effects, fascinating casting, costumes, horses, the whole shebang. And it all went thud. There's just no driving soul to this film. The plot meanders and is full of holes and conradictions. It's a combo of clich√©s and fairy tale adaptations of scenes from Star Wars (especially the final confrontation) and other flicks that leaves you still feeling hungry. The producers should have paid more attention to the story and less to the accoutrements. As Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry used to say, ""movie problems are best fixed in the typewriter.""I'd wait for it to be on Netflix. At least you can see it at no extra charge. Shouldn't take long to get there."
427,"So, I'm a Twilight fan. (Before you write off everything I'm about to say based on that fact, I enjoyed the books and am aware that the movies are basically crap.) I went into the movie theatre excited to see this film and liking Kristen Stewart because of her role in Twilight, a role she was perfectly cast for. Well, you guessed it - I left SWATH liking her much less. I don't know if it is inexperience or some sort of genuine mental block but Kristen does not know how to display an array of emotion at all. Her mood remained the same; dark with a splash of fiery teen angst. Which, sure, matches a dark film. But it's the moments of sheer joy or complete and utter despair that help us to root for you. Kristen's awkward nature suited the enigmatic, out-of-place teen from Forks in the Twilight Saga, however it contaminated the atmosphere of this film. It was too much to even hope for a genuine smile at the inevitably happy ending. Things I enjoyed: CharIize was good. I loved the animation/special effects, especially in the 'bright' forest (my friend & I joke that the two-second animated rabbit showed more emotion than Snow White did). I was really looking forward to this movie for those reasons alone, and at least they didn't disappoint me. However I still left feeling fairly disappointed."
428,"Very nice movie ,great story ,good acting . i found the actors very good in their roles ,special vote to Charliz Theron .she is a good actress .If i can definitely suggest that movie to everybody i will say .i found out the story of the movie in this link http://www.flowmagazine.gr/category/view/C11/movies Then i decided to watch it and i was right to do it ,because its a great movie. fantasy movie are always the best ,according to the specials effects on the movies.the contents of the story is a daily question for all the women ,stay young ,stay beautiful have the power and for that be ready to do everything .While watching the movie ,there where no such adult content so its mean ,kids can watch it ."
429,"Ao we had two Snow White movies this year. The both focused on the queen in the story which really isn't a bad idea since in the Disney version she was the important character. The real problem with both of the attempt lie in the focus. Mirror, Mirror took gorgeous Julia Roberts and made her silly, old and frankly ugly. Snow White and the Huntsman did get the queen character spot on with a great performance by Charlize Theron, but then forgot about all of the rest of the characters that complete the story. In the Disney version Snow white is a characters who enchants with her voice and her manner.Unfortunately Kristen Stewart (just so you know I am not a Twilight fan) doesn't enchant at all. For some reason the film maker must have recognized his mistake in casting her because he gives her very little to say and when she does speak you want her to shut up quick. It is also unfortunate that she is not very beautiful, I guess the film maker likes her eyes and thought that would be enough to enchant people, but its not. In fact the child actress was infinitely more attractive than her grown up counterpart. The visuals were interesting even though the creature features were a bit much and the muddy atmosphere got a little tired. I wish that Hollywood would come to understand that characters are everything the Huntsman's character was OK so was Prince William but they could have been more flushed out. It would have been nice to see in flashback the Huntsman and his wife and his confession and ultimate affection toward Snow White might have made sense. Snow White though is by far the weakest heroine I have ever seen, does this girl care at all for her kingdom or is she just content to go after the queen. The dwarfs motivation is done so quickly that you don't get to know who they are. All of this makes the story very unpleasant. Too bad this version could have been a hidden gem if a real actress had been cast as the heroine and the story had been more carefully written. A real missed opportunity."
430,"What happens when you take a movie titled ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and subtract anything resembling actual acting talent?You discover the antithesis of method acting - or any true acting: Let's call it ""void acting"".If you are planning to go see this movie, by all means, do: But I *dare* you to try NOT to rely on the supporting actors to figure out what Snow White is supposed to be feeling. I've never seen Charlize Theron play down her acting ability before, but I suppose that's about as close as any actor gets to showing pity for another ""actor's"" unfortunate situation.¬†Isn't the ""lead role"" supposed to... lead? Even Thor (Chris Hemsworth) was Oscar-worthy by comparison..."
431,"I would normally never give one star to a movie, but Snow White and the Huntsman earned it. The creativity barrel apparently ran dry long long ago, and so what you are left with is a numerous concourse of clich√©s and close up facial expression views. The music, writing, and even producing was poor. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I want to keep friendships with. The action sequences that everyone is raving over can be found in literally every middle age theme action flick. The value of a movie is completely dependent on the reason you go I suppose. If you don't mind clich√©s, or knowing the ending before the twists even occur because they have been seen before many times, and hearing typical music while watching underdeveloped characters routinely go through the motions of a stereotypical movie is your motivation for going to the movies, much like those who go simply to see the good guys win in the end of their Disney movies, then this would be a satisfactory choice. If you look for real, uncharted paths and deep substance, then I would save your money for another day."
432,I expected a really good movie and all I got was a really bad one.I should have expected it since the script was written by a 12 year old.Whoever agreed to cast Kristen Stewart in and action role made a big mistake.I feel bad for Charlize Theron because some of the lines were very corny.The audience laughed in places that I think were meant to be serious.I feel bad for Chris Hemsworth but a paycheck is a paycheck and at least his lines weren't corny.
433,"Snow White and the Huntsman had potential to be a good movie. It could have been a dark twist on the classic fairy tale but they decided to choose the least likable actress to portray Snow White. Snow White is supposed to be innocent, beautiful and life itself while Kristen Stewart on the other hand is emotionless, cold and anything but spectacular. Throughout the entire movie she probably had two lines that just oozed out of her mouth. The rest of the acting you have to look forward to from Kristen is frightened breathing and a complete lack of emotion in her face FOR THE ENTIRE MOVIE. The only thing this movie had going for it was the beautiful and brilliant Chalize Theron. She was the perfect fit for the evil queen. Her performance was the only thing enjoyable throughout the whole movie. Every time she wasn't in a scene it was time for a nap. She was terrifying. She was the only part of the movie that was dark. If it wasn't for her it would have been just another typical Disney fairy tale. This movie might have been better if they chose someone likable to play the lead, I found myself rooting for the evil stepmother over emotionless Snow White. I'm not sure why they would hire Kristen for this role after the embarrassment that was Twilight. Such horrible films... but I'll save that rant for another time.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. All 4 stars are for Theron, if she wasn't in the movie it would be a 1."
434,"The story itself is dark, but basic. Not entirely boring, tho not entirely interesting either. It pretty much follows the fairytale we all heard as children. With twists here and there. Sword and sorcery fanfare. The action sequences were alright and the special fx characters were cool. Overall I didn't find the movie epic. Or moving. It's almost one step away from being a B movie. It didn't even have an epic music score. Normally I wouldn't mention something like this, but I read they spent $170 million on this movie. Well, there was this one scene off the coast, in the water and rocks near the beginning. Snow White is in the water. I noticed that water splashed onto the camera lens. Hmmnn....Kristen Stewart plays one of the title characters and barely had any lines, and the ones she did have, I could have slept through them and wouldn't have missed anything of importance. There was even one ""great"" speech she gave to rouse the kingdom. It stunk. Words. Delivery. All. I hate to be another one to pick on her acting, but it's true, she really is wooden. *Please note, this is the first thing I've ever seen her in. Have yet to see the Twilight movies, so I had no idea how her acting was beforehand. This was just an honest opinion. Chris Hemsworth was likable as the anti-hero. He was the Han Solo of the movie, only not as charismatic. I really liked the dwarfs. All of them. They were funny, and believable in their devotion to Snow White(yes, I'm able to look at it as a separate context). Charlize Theron was the best thing about this movie. I sensed she hammed it up a bit, yet still gave a great performance as Ravenna with the mysterious dark past and many lives. I've heard they're doing a sequel with Hemsworth and Stewart. Gotta say this movie is not that great that I'd want to rush out and see a sequel. I love the fantasy genre, but this just wasn't exciting or enthralling to me. I wasn't wowed. I didn't love it. I think there may be a missed opportunity here with the Ravenna character. She seemed more damaged to me than evil. Telling her story could be a far more interesting movie than this was, or a sequel. 5/10"
435,"How can anyone slate this movie!! I really enjoyed it and was glued to the screen all the way through. It wasn't dragged out at all the film was produced perfectly! acting was brilliant from all especially the evil queen herself! The special effects were really good especially the monsters and the mirror which the queen used. the dwarfs were funny and lovable like the original characters. The fighting scenes were really good and reminded me a little of lord of the rings! I would def recommend this film to others, please don't be put off by other reviews watch it first you'll be surprised! I was and i really enjoyed it would def watch again!!"
436,"I tried to get into the fun spirit this film so obviously wants to create, but had to give up half way through when I realized that no fun was going to be had from this ponderous and pretty terrible revisionist fairy tale.What is it with studios today that want to reinvent beloved and well-known stories and then remove from them everything that made them charming and endearing in the first place? ""Snow White and the Hunstman"" is done in the style currently in vogue in Hollywood action movies -- it's all slow motion and over-amplified sound effects, completely lacking in humor or any sense of wonder. I am completely baffled by Kristen Stewart's appeal. She has one expression as an actress -- sullen boredom. She always looks like she'd rather be anywhere but where she actually is, either in a movie or in real life. I thought if nothing else Charlize Theron would be some fun as the wicked queen, but she overplays it to the hilt and is directed to take her role far too seriously. Sure, there are some neat special effects and some good-looking production design, but who cares? Grade: D"
437,"I have to agree with those who wrote about Kristen Stewart's passionless acting, Charlize Theron's over-acting, a lack of back-story on the evil queen, the illogical plot line (including vast overuse of ""deus ex machina""), and the multiple dragged-out scenes. I started laughing at points that were intended to be serious pretty early in the film, and then lost interest to the extent that I logged onto IMDb to see if others were as disappointed in this film as I was. I only gave it two stars because the costumes and visual effects were very good. Thank goodness we rented it through Redbox, instead of paying theater prices!!"
438,"As abundant in number as the tell-tale signs of a fantasy epic are, they're not qualities that (ironically) can be brought about with the wave of a wand. Few films will offer better evidence to this than ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" a film so aesthetically confident and captivating yet shockingly hollow.Some filmmakers are gifted with incredible vision, and though it's just his first film, Universal expertly identified Rupert Sanders as someone capable of building something of this scale. He hasn't hit on his own distinctive style yet, but he brings the visual authenticity that distinguishes good medieval fantasy from the posers. If the script could operate at the same level, ""Snow White"" would have easily won over legions of adoring fans. The fault doesn't lie in the concept, which essentially recasts the classic fairy tale as a straightforward fantasy-adventure, but in the paint-by-numbers execution of the story, which leans a bit heavily on genre tropes and fails to get an emotional foothold.Beginning with a 10-minute prologue that sets up writer Evan Daugherty's take on the legend, ""Snow White"" creates a dark, more adult foundation for the familiar story. After losing her mother at a young age, Snow White sees her father ride off into battle and come back with a new bride in the beautiful Ravenna (Charlize Theron). Before he knows it, Ravenna reveals her true colors and seizes the kingdom, plunging it into years of darkness and locking Snow White away until there came a day when she might be of use.That day comes when the evil queen's magic mirror tells her that consuming Snow White's heart will grant her last immortality, but teenage Snow White (Kristen Stewart) escapes and flees into the Dark Forest. She hires a sorrowful, drunken Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to find her and bring her back, but realizing the queen's true evil, he decides to help Snow White flee to the castle where a duke and his son (Sam Claflin) once loyal to her family can protect her.For a film over two hours, it all happens so fast. Whether it's the trip (two senses of the word) through the Dark Forest, a stay with women who've scarred themselves to avoid the queen's wrath, or the encounter with the dwarfs, these moments that make a fantasy-adventure feel rushed and empty. The great epics use them for genuine character development, but this script utilizes them for explanation and expository boredom.The actors on display don't lack for talent and offer flashes of emotional performances, but so much of what they do comes off as either flat or way over the top. Theron, for example, can't make up her mind to play the queen troubled and subdued or certifiably crazy. At the beginning she's so subtle and devious, but then she starts squawking. We know she can play a true psychopath, so the culprit has to be the dialogue.At one point, Snow White must rally the troops. She gets to deliver an inspiring speech, and as strong as Stewart has become as an actress (she shows genuine improvement here), it's almost comical what she's forced to say. If you're going to write the ever-risky ""rally the troops"" speech, you better damn make sure everything leading up to it worked emotionally or the speech will fall flat on its face. Sure enough, that's what happens, and it speaks directly to the effectiveness of the screenplay up until that point.It trickles down into every element of the film, despite Sanders' best attempts to dress everything up with visuals that will inspire your curiosity. A scene in which Snow White and the Huntsman cross a bridge to discover it's being guarded by an angry troll cleverly camouflaged into the rocks demonstrates an exciting use of visuals, but it turns out to be a completely wasted detour meant to serve as just one of what will become several examples of how the creatures of this world respond differently to Snow White than other people. As if you couldn't figure it out ‚Äî she has a destiny.Fortunately, the action and sense of danger is quite palpable, and ""Snow White"" hits on moments of legitimate suspense. Sanders finds some excellent ways to work with the PG-13 to give an appropriate sense of violence and bloodshed, and his sense of fight choreography borrows from the most reliable of techniques. This is a rather dark film for Snow White, which is a refreshing take considering films like Tim Burton's ""Alice and Wonderland,"" which have tried to be but drowned in their own off-the-beaten-path-ness. So it's not that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" falls apart because of the writing, but that it cancels out a lot of the good things the film does from a visual standpoint. Hiring Oscar- winning costume designer Colleen Atwood, for example, speaks to what ""Huntsman"" does to create the feel of a fantastical visual feast. Even the eye candy isn't as sweet when you don't find yourself emotionally enchanted as well. As strong as it is, it doesn't forge a connection with the audience. ""Avatar"" would be a great comparison of a rich world that accentuated a classic story. Given its history, this story should feel even more classic, but instead it's taken for granted.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"
439,"i did want to see this movie, i couldn't wait to see this movie, and then i did go and see this... thing. i never wrote a letter of any kind to any newspaper or their editor or cast a vote for any TV shows and such, but i had to do this. i will be brief, and here we go. the cast: if i was the producer i would demand my money back. pity, because i love Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone etc. i normally don't mind Charlize either, but i'm afraid that she come up short in this one. maybe a couple more acting classes won't hurt. must say that it probably was a hard role to play properly in the first place. as for the huntsman, i didn't know if i was having flashbacks with Rocky and Rambo, or both. i thought that only Stallone was allowed to speak like that. and then there was Snow white... can't find words for her. correction, i could, but that would be a total waste of time and effort and probably not allowed to print without the appropriate warning. the word ""pathetic"" is the first one that comes to mind. the story: what story? we had to keep pinching each others to stay awake. what a bore. i'm sure the Grimm brothers are still trying to escape their burial plot in order to find and strangle the screen writer/s. as for the special effects i remember that the molten metal in the ""Terminator 2"" looked pretty real, the molten mirror in this one did not quite cut it. maybe it was because of the different metal... In short, i don't know how this movie ended up making this ludicrous amount of money, but hey, i too did help in that department. so, if there is a moral to this story, it would be to never forget the names of the people involved in the making of this movie and stay away from anything they will put their hands on, forever. could have bought a couple of beers and gladly watched ""Mirror Mirror"" yet again..."
440,"In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen.Snow White & the Huntsman could have been a huge disaster, but luckily first timer Rupert Sanders does a better job with story, characters & visuals than directors who have been in the game for years. What worked, all of the technical stuff like production design, costume design, visual effects & music all of which should be in the running for some Oscars. What also worked was Charlize Theron's evil queen,over the top but every time she's on you are focus on her, Chris Hemsworth's huntsman,he's basically playing medieval Thor but he's good at it, & even Kristen Stewart's Snow White for most of it, I was really liking through out with the exception of one sense were she is giving a speech, all of the dwarfs were great,and it's also amazing to see how they have darken up this tale. One of the very few things that didn't work was Sam Claflin's prince character. He just seems to be their so they can have a love triangle. Which thank god they dropped. My last problem is that it get's a little bit slow in the middle. But that is just a nit pick. What could have been a huge disaster turns out to be one of the better film's this year, A-."
441,"SWATH is a fairly direct retelling of the familiar tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but with a few twists designed to make it more palatable to the modern audience. Our heroine Snow starts out as the classic character we love, almost a carbon of the Disney version, but she undergoes an abrupt transformation in the last act to a Xena figure who leads an army into battle. The heroic male characters all mean well, but are ultimately ineffective. This is the feminist version of Snow White, where the girl ultimately is the hero that saves the day. Whether or not that is a good or a bad thing, I will leave for the reader to conclude.Director Rupert Saunders no doubt had intentions of making a classic fantasy film like Legend; he had a good start with some artful visuals and a good sense of cinematography. The cast list is near-faultless, and they all delivered what I thought were solid performances-- even the sullen KStew was convincing as the sweet and pure Innocent.And yet...all that wasn't enough to make this film dazzle as it obviously contrived to do. Simply put, SWATH lacked a good script. The storytelling was flat and unimaginative. The dialog was forgettable. The characters ( I am thinking especially of the dwarfs, and of Snow and her Prince) seemed to hint at interesting backstories that were never explored, nor were any of them fleshed out enough to truly become sympathetic. It's as though only Queen Ravenna's tortured past merited any screen time. In the ultimate irony for this tale, the script lacked heart. Saunders, like his evil Queen, must have sacrificed it to achieve the undying beauty which is all we are left with. It's deliciously poetic, isn't it? If Saunders has a chance at a sequel (which is increasingly unlikely at this point), then I have some advice for him: it's not all about looks, dummy. Build your characters! Invest in a good script! Beauty is only skin-deep. Maybe there is still time for him to learn from the sad tale of Queen Ravenna."
442,"After seeing the trailer for Snow White and the Huntsman I was totally pumped and ready for all it's seemingly awesomeness, and yeah it totally didn't pay off, the trailer made it seem really Gothic and dark and epic and cool, and it was most of those things but only slightly, for starters the casting of Kristen Stewart as Snow White is one of the worst casting decisions I've ever seen, Kristen is a great young actress, but she doesn't have the innocence, the pale skin or the black hair to play Snow White, Chris Hemsworth is good but not great, and Charlize Theron pretty much out acts everyone else however she's not in the movie near enough and her scenes are too short. The cast are all great actors but a somewhat boring script doesn't do them any favors.The storyline is pretty similar to the original fairytale I guess, but when it steers to far away from it is when the film starts to suffer, one thing that really bugged me was how it totally skips most of Snow Whites life, she gets locked up and then the next time we see her she's grown up and you get no back-story as to what happened while she was locked up, in my opinion that's bad characterization and lazy writing, in fact most of the characterization is weak, the only character you get any kind of a back story on is Queen Ravenna, and even then it was just confusing.The production is good mostly, except at the end, the battle is nowhere near as epic as it should be, a few hundred more extras would have helped it along, but most of the movie looks amazing production wise. The movie is far too long, which isn't a good thing considering I was bored nearly all the way through, if a movie is long it has to keep me interested, and half the time I was just checking my watch for the time. There are many things wrong with this movie, mainly character wise, script and length, and let's not get started on the boring and abrupt ending. It could be a lot worse I guess but that still doesn't make up for the fact that Snow White and the Huntsman is a pretty lackluster movie that really should have been awesome, unfortunately it isn't. :(I'd recommend watching the Snow White film from the 90's with Sigourney Weaver, much more entertaining."
443,"The latest cinematic retelling of the beloved Grimm fairy tale translates its literary source in much the same way as Tim Burton's very enjoyable 2010 version of Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland. The story is placed within an adventurous medieval setting and two opposing military forces are introduced. The evil side, headed by a fearsomely tyrannical Queen with a devoted yet weaker right-hand man, is distinctly dominant with their fantastical secret weapon and their masses of ruthless uniform troops. The good side is a humble, stealthy rebel force whose morale has been understandably diminished in the long wait for their saviour, the story's protagonist. It has proved a very wise approach for both stories, given their brevity and idiosyncrasy that don't quite play out well on screen. The story here is noticeably linear, and in Rupert Sanders' expressionistic fantasy debut picture, that proves to be very effective. The sincerity of many characterisations is also very satisfying, and greatly assists a meaningful expos√© of integral humanist themes. Surprisingly, this version uses the villainous Queen as its main outlet for the thematic material. Her tyranny is grounded in a very empathetic morality: she spent her formative years surrounded by the callous sexual gluttony of men, and has come to realise that, in a world where women are coveted and spoilt until they grow old, youth and beauty are synonymous with power. Therefore, as long as she retains those attributes, by devouring them from other women as men do shamelessly, she is invincible. She is by no means a caring feminist concerned with liberating her fellow females or proving their inner strength. The cruelty of men has instilled her with an insatiable bloodlust that she will take out on anyone.Her mesmerising complexity is largely thanks to the conviction with which she is played by the fine actress Charlize Theron, as well as the sumptuous deathly and evocative imagery that surrounds her with spectacular effect, most notably flocks of ravens, no doubt connected to her name, Ravenna, which become more prominent as the film continues the Queen descends further into murderous hate and sickening desperation. Her sinister, subservient brother, Finn (Sam Spruell) is another well- drawn character, who serves as both an intriguing object of affection for her otherwise heartless sister, and a man struggling to prove his worth in the face the formidable matriarch and the tough huntsman who consistently gets the better of him. Unfortunately, the heroic half of the conflict is not nearly as strongly portrayed. As the titular heroine, Kristen Stewart is for the most part painfully wooden and self-conscious in her delivery of those poetic pieces of moralising always assigned to the heroes. On occasions, however, she does succeed in conveying the indomitable fortitude of this warrior princess, especially in her earlier and later scenes, but she is mostly overwhelmed by mounting external pressures. The script sets high challenges for her, both in her own dialogue and in that of the other characters. Muir, the wise, blind oracle among the seven dwarfs proclaims her to be ""life itself"", a tall order for an unexceptional tender-aged star of mostly lightweight popcorn flicks, and Stewart simply doesn't deliver. The characters of the dwarfs look just as out of place as Stewart does. They may have been part of the original story, but in this version, rather radical changes have been to the narrative landscape, and their presence feels merely obligatory and redundant. An excellent, genuinely frightening scene is made from the other Snow White staple, the poison apple, but the seven little men sadly add little to the overall picture. At first, they fill the space of those annoyingly unoriginal bandits, who manage to string Snow and her unlikely ally, the outwardly hardened but still inwardly compassionate huntsman, and then shout clich√©d empty threats at them until Snow finally comes clean with them. Then, after they eventually start listening to Muir's equally clich√©d prophetic drivel about Snow being ""the chosen one"", they become noble followers ready to make something of themselves once again after they descended into drunkenness since Ravenna's takeover. The moral of redemption after a gnawingly fatal mistake buried deep in the past and in the soul is an admirable one, but it has already been delivered by the huntsman in his incredibly moving monologue, Chris Hemsworth's finest scene in an otherwise dull gruff macho display, and in the restless rebel soldiers under the command of the soberly cautious, world-weary Duke Hammond (Vincent Regan). As wonderful as it is to see Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson all gathered for a handful of unforgettable ensemble scenes, there's little they can do to enliven such dreary scriptwriting. Even Ravenna can't bring people back from the dead, and these hackneyed roles were killed by overuse long ago. The strongest feature of the good side is Snow's noble childhood friend Prince William (Sam Claflin, best known as the dashing preacher in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). his conscientious devotion to their cause is believably endearing. Still, anything the good guys serve up pales in comparison to our captivating villainess, who undoubtedly steals the show. Sanders is every bit aware of her brilliance, and gives us a more than decent serving of her character, especially at the beginning where it feels as if the film is about to centre on her. Snow White and the Huntsman, is at its best when it's embracing the gruesome, sadistic malice of its fascinating villains. The mercifully few scenes that take place in the familiar, gentle forest glade are cloyingly cute and joylessly designed, and the second-rate construction of its heroes and heroine might easily have dragged any other film into pitiful mediocrity. However, the astonishing Ravenna makes a judgement of this film as anything less than impressive extremely ungrateful."
444,"This is a movie that is balanced by two extremes. An amazing evil queen played by the excellent Charlize Theron, and the performance of the extremely untalented Kristen Stewart who is unable to perform anything that does not resemble her role in Twilight. Charlize Theron manages to give her character depth, emotion and a very convincing background that almost makes her likable at times by explaining why she has become the ""thing"" she became. It would be unfair of course not to mention the fact that her character has received very special treatment by the writers. As a matter of fact, the only thing that the writers bothered to write about in this script was she. Everything else in this movie is just ""small print"". The writers and producers focused on creating a fantastic ""Evil"" Charlize Theron, they spent all the budget on her special effects, gave her all the cool lines, and just left everything else to the talent of the actors. Since the actors are not particularly talented though, this did not work out in the end. So when ""Snowhite"" was on the screen, the audience was trying to find ways to pass the time. Her emotional scenes were exceptionally bad, as Kristen Stewart has only one single facial expression with which she acts. It is a combination of ""annoyed teenager""+""something smells bad""+""I will cry in 5 seconds"". No one can go through 10 movies with this expression of course, and personally I do not intend to ever pay for another film starring Kristen Stewart! If you do not take into account the existence of Snowhite, and if you forget the fact that the Evil Queen has to loose in the end, this is a good film !"
445,"The past nine months have been an up and down roller coaster ride for the mythology that is Snow White. In September 2011, television network ABC began televising a show built around Snow White and Prince Charming, named Once Upon a Time, that went on to be one of the highest rated new shows. At the end of March 2012, Relativity released the film Mirror Mirror, starring Julia Roberts as the evil queen. The film went on to gross just under $63 million; much less than its budget of $85 million. Snow White and the Huntsman was scheduled a mere three months after Mirror Mirror and many wondered whether Universal Pictures was risking a case of too much too soon; however, Universal never wavered.Prior to viewing the first trailer released, Snow White and the Huntsman barely registered on my radar. Upon seeing the first trailer my interest was piqued, and only grew with each subsequent trailer. It deserves pointing out that the marketing behind Snow White and the Huntsman was perfectly executed. The film was able to slowly build itself up as something far more than just the typical ""fairy tale"" and more as an action film filled with special; much closer in style to Lord of the Rings than to the silliness of Mirror Mirror.First time director Rupert Sanders does a very admirable job of crafting a dark version of a familiar story, by including just the right amount of special effects without going overboard. Sanders does a good job of using his strongest asset, Charlize Theron, to hide his weakest link, Kristen Stewart.Charlize Theron's Ravenna is the most beautiful evil queen to grace the big screen. Theron's acting is top notch, and although at times she seems to be over acting she does it with grace a style. The woman who nine years ago won a Best Actress Oscar for playing the mass murder Aileen Wuornos, a role in which Roger Ebert wrote was ""one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema"", easily makes the transitions into a woman whose only want is vanity. Theron easily commands the screen and carries the film.I understand and realize that Kristen Stewart has a very large fan base thanks to her playing the part of Bella in the Twilight series of films. Unfortunately for Ms. Stewart, I haven't seen nor have any desire to see any of the Twilight films. Stewart's Snow White is supposed to be the main character in the film, but she has very little dialogue and her time on-screen is enhanced playing opposite Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman or Theron's Ravenna. Additionally, Stewart's acting appears stiff and in many ways is lacking any passion, and although a cute girl she is a far cry from what I would consider ""the fairest of them all.""Although looking very much like his Thor character, Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman is without arrogance. The Huntsman is a widower, who wears his emotions unconditionally and makes it his purpose to protect Snow White from the evil queen. Hemsworth's performance is a pleasant surprise, and I look forward to him showing his full range in the future; after, of course his many appearances as Thor.Additional roles are played by: Sam Spruell, who's a bit peculiar as Ravenna's brother, Finn. Spruell isn't bad in the part, he just doesn't look quite right to me.Sam Claflin, who plays Snow White's prince charming, William; I don't know that there's ever been a more useless prince charming before. William starts out as Snow White's friend at a young age, and ends up in love with her and her defender?? C'mon now!!!Robert Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson, all very talented actors, make up the dwarfs. You'd think with the level of talent involved, the dwarfs would have more depth to them. Regrettably, they are underutilized and it feels as though they are merely included to complete the fairytale that is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Snow White and the Huntsman is a far cry from a fairy tale; it is a dark, dramatic action film that is visually very beautiful and not over done with CGI or special effects. Although the story revolves around Stewart's Snow White, she isn't required to carry the film; that job lies with Theron's evil queen, and she owns up to the task and gives a memorable performance. The film runs about 20 minutes too long and is a bit unsatisfying in the end, but is still a very enjoyable twist on a well-known story.Grade: Bvisit our site at www.twodudereview.com"
446,"First off, I just want to point out that I can't stand when filmmakers come to IMDb and review movies they've just seen. It's the same thing over and over. Instead of reviewing the actual movie itself, they'd rather use ""intelligent, production vocabulary"" and talk about what would have been different if they've filmed it themselves. I find it annoying and misleading. These reviews aren't about what you would have done differently if you were hired as the director, it's all about how you liked the movie. So my advice to anyone would be to take the movie for what it is and go from there.Now for the review itself. Snow White was good but definitely not great. The only reason why I went to see the movie is because of Charlize Theron. I found her small segments in the trailer were captivating and I wanted to see more. Besides, I love a good female villain and Charlize is definitely one of the best actresses at the current moment. I was pleasantly surprised at Kristen Stewart's performance. She did an exceptional job as Snow White. Yes it's true there were probably other actresses who could have possible portrayed the fairy tale princess better but Kristen was good and gave a surprising range of skill. Especially , the speech she gave before the final battle. My only inhibition is that the Queen is supposed to jealous of Snow White's beauty and it's obvious that Kristen is definitely not more attractive than Ms. Theron so the mark was missed in that area but that just says that new coming director, Sanders, was more focused on performance than looks. Chris Hemsworth gave a solid performance as The Huntsman. I grew annoyed at the constant comparisons to his performance in this movie and Thor. Two different movies, two different worlds, two different characters and Chris is a very talented actor, in my opinion. The actor who played the Queen's brother was very impressive as well. Yes it's true that the dwarfs come in half way through the movie but to have them in the beginning wouldn't have made any sense at all. They had a good amount of screen time but not a lot, but that's only because this wasn't ""their"" movie. It was Snow, The Huntsman and the Queen's film. I utterly disappointed at the the final battle between Snow and The Queen. The stakes were so high but I thought it went by so quickly. I was thinking to myself, ""this is it, it's about to get real"" (LOL) but it was so easy in the end. I understood the part about fairblood but even after The Queen was stabbed, she couldn't at least got even more angry and try to kill Snow in her last breath? And is it just me or were there a lot of drawn out, silences in the movie?!The movie was very slow at times but I understood why. I was really impressed by Charlize' costumes. They were gorgeous. Also, I loved the contrast between the dark forest and Sanctuary. Very beautiful. Overall, the movie is watchable. It's nothing fantastic but definitely a good take on a classic children's story. Charlize Theron rules the screen. Everyone else should be her bitch!"
447,I don't get it how can a beautiful princess trapped in a castle for all those years can lead an army and win a war against an evil queen how did she know how to fight and how no enemy soldier attacked her???women leading an army is a joke for me...and bro kristen's acting was trash...
448,"Stunning visual effects, many great landscape shots, good acting, great action, and a classic yet originaly made storyline. i dont understand why there is so much hate about this movie."
449,"With a harder commitment to the macabre, a recast lead and the abolishment of the love triangle, this could have been a minor classic."
450,I like remakes of fairy tales but any movie where the leading lady has so little ability that Chris Hemsworth looks like he is a good actor in comparison means that the movie is pretty much a hollow exercise in junk film making. Charlize Theron is the only thing giving it any spark at all.
451,"While Therone per usual provides spectacular perfomance, the film suffered from every possible mistake. Bad plot, bad casting. Stewart is a wonderful actress, but the horse riding and action fuled fantasy did not sit well on her and such roles don't serve her career, as she has since learned and went back to brilliant indie making where she truly shines.
Moreover, the storyline is absolutely horrible, rapey and bizzare, absolutely laughable moments that were meant to be taken seriously, and not even good actors could save this mess."
452,"I was somewhat surprised by the reviews, and felt they needed some balance. The look is stunning, and Charlize Theron is amazing; she gives such depth to the character. The film is beautiful to look at and the special effects never let you down. Not without flaws, Kristen Steward is admittedly a bit wooden at times, and doesn't exactly balance out the action parts with the empathy and love the character really needs at times. Sometimes the other characters don't have enough time to capture your interest and affection but they are small quibbles. One or two bits could have been done better, but this is hardly a second rate film as many reviewers who have you believe. On the whole the film is well paced with some emotion, and as I say, Ms Theron is totally superb and the film is worth watching just for her and her character alone. Chris Hemsworth binds the action together with an understated performance that doesn't distract from the two lady antagonists. Do watch the film, get the popcorn and the nibbles in, relax and enjoy a good fantasy film - ignore the critics they are plain wrong."
453,"In contrast to many reviewers, I really liked Kristen Stewart's performance here. She's sort of a tomboy princess, with the requisite untouchable purity that the part demands. Again in contrast to others, I find her performance subtle and intelligent--never overstated. And her beauty is iconic, which fits the classic nature of the tale. I wouldn't want some overly lush,overly ""sexy"" young actress in this role. Of course Charlize Theron is excellent as the evil queen, as are the rather Romanesque or perhaps Gothic visual effects. In addition, almost any movie with the great character actors Bob Hoskins and Eddie Marsen is worth watching. All in all, this movie is a fitting antidote to the saccharine nature of much Disney fare."
454,"So,no surprises here,we are watching Snow White,right?Well,guess again!!King Nobody falls in love with a blonde woman who kills him on their wedding bed right on the next scene.She turns out to be Snow white's bad mother in law who is also a witch!!It appears she created a black iron glass army in order to trick herself in the kingdom.After she kills the king,walks like nothing has happened through the entire castle,opens the gate and lets another army inside to kill everyone,without being noticed by absolutely no one.How convenient!She also has a brother who looks like a product of inbreeding.She keeps consuming young girls in order to stay young and only when she starts getting affected by her overuse of magic does the mirror tell her that all that is happening because snow white turned 18.After that we have some run and chase moments and the introduction of a now wifeless drunken huntsman.From then on things do get a little better,we have some excellent visual effects and you actually start remembering that this is a fairy tale....But it does not last long.The dark forest is scary only because of some dark gas coming from mushroom like plants,so people basically get high and hallucinate.Trolls come out of nowhere only to disappear after they get tamed by a very indifferent snow white....Then the eye candy carnival begins...Butterfly flowers,animals,plants and trees all going a bit Tolkien-like,fairies and a huge male deer that blows up into hundreds of butterflies.Of course we also have dwarfs but who cares with all that visual overload?Prince William disappears from the beginning of the movie only to appear again later,trying to save his old love.But in the way his character is displayed it's like he never came back.Snow white eats the poisoned apple and dies.Prince William gives her a kiss but nothing happens.After they manage to get her to duke's castle and after a cringy monologue by the again drunken huntsman,he kisses her too.She wakes up after a while,with him being absent from the scene so we really have to love story here.Then,all of a sudden,Snow white gets all fired up and after a very long,awkward and cringy uninspiring speech,becomes a sweet little warlord and gets people killed just because the film has to move on somehow.The visual effects is all that matters here in eye-candy kingdom!Acting,even by Theron is disappointing,battle scenes straight out of Xena and character development and dialogue are both lacking and tiring.What you get here is a very generic movie with nothing more to offer to the viewer than just a way to kill a couple of hours if you have nothing else to do.This is what happens when Hollywood,which is all out of original ideas,tries to milk some old projects,aiming on the nostalgia of adults from their childhood's favorite stories and cartoons,but fails miserably.And it fails because apparently they do not understand the rules.You don't take one of the most popular fairy tales and turn it into a mindless battle movie with ridiculous lines and shallow characters,stripping all the beauty from it....or you do,trying to make more money and everyone hates you for it.WELL DONE!"
455,"This originally comes from a tale of snow white, and the arranged story is very interesting. I love this film. The beautiful visual is worth watching. The clear and fine differences between beautiful and ugly visuals make this film much better. And every actions are reflected to another one. Especially in the last scene of fighting Snow White against the queen. Anyway, from the beginning to the end, the story is always exciting. I understand the concept of this story. Snow White is confined for long time and she has to fight against the queen, but if I am allowed to hope for more, I wanted to see more kindness and smiles of Snow White."
456,"To any parents who are considering renting or buying a copy of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" in order to screen it for their little ones, beware - this is one movie that really earns its PG-13 rating. It is pretty dark in tone, full of death and grim images. But I will say that as dark as it is, this dark world is portrayed in a convincing manner. The sets, costumes, and special effects are first rate. There are also some well done action sequences and scenes of suspense.However, despite all that good material, I didn't think that the movie quite made it. There's a problem with the movie, but one big enough to severely sink things. The movie is much too long (over two hours), and probably because of this the story moves at too much a slow pace. It didn't take me long to feel impatience, despite the nice eye candy. Some viewers might also be disappointed that the dwarfs in this particular telling are not given that much to do. In the end, the movie is kind of a failure, albeit an interesting one. It's still better than many other Hollywood blockbusters, but be prepared to be frustrated at times if you decide all the same to watch it."
457,"I feel that, though it's certainly not amazing, this film is underrated. Snow White and the Huntsman looks great,and it does a good job of making you forget your watching an adaptation of snow white; instead it feels more like a Narnia of Middle-Earth film. However one major problem i have with the film is Kristen Stewart. Kristen Stewart is a problem for two main reasons; firstly, she just really isn't particularly good at acting and I feel that there are other actresses who could have done a better,and secondly it brings memories of the Twilight movie series (that definitely isn't a good thing).Overall though, I feel that this film is definitely worth watching for fans of fantasy films."
458,"Who would have thought that this film would more resemble the Lord of the Rings rather than the classic fairytale itself. But I'm not the one to complain because I found it refreshing to see a darker spin. This film doesn't lack brand-name actors or excellent CGI effects or attention-grabbing battle scenes. This film looks very pretty, ironically enough. The set design, costume design, and visuals will definitely sweep you into the film. The script itself is decent and all of this makes for an entertaining time.Rupert Sander's film is about a princess named Snow White who escapes the clutches of her father's second wife, the Queen. The Queen sends a huntsman to capture her but after he found out he was being played, he vows to protect Snow White. As they venture out to save the kingdom, they come across new people including the famed dwarfs.This film has many brand-name actors. Kristen Stewart still needs to improve her acting, but at least she smiles more than in her Twilight films. Chris Hemsworth is a rising star and this film helps him do it. Charlize Theron is just brilliant as the Queen and her portrayal will terrify you. Many famed British actors such as Bob Hoskins, Nick Frost, Ray Winstone, and Ian McShane all do a fine job as the dwarfs.Overall, this is a fun fantasy film that gives off a Lord of the Rings vibe. There are plenty of action scenes and CGI effects we get to take in. I loved this darker tone they gave Snow White because it works. I hope their is a sequel because I certainly would like one. I rate this film 9/10."
459,"Back in 2012 I've originally rated this movie 5 stars out of 10, and have forgotten about the movie until recently I've had a chance to watch it again on a cool head. Must say that on this second attempt at seeing this piece my rating wasn't as harsh as the first time round, and now I'm really ready to give it a generous rating of 7 stars out of 10. Oh, don't think that the story improved over time, either that I got dumber, or anything. Not at all. The first time watching the movie I felt I was being cheated and could not overcome the fact that someone as terrible at acting as Kristen Stewart (WHO told her she could act, huh?)was playing acting for 127 mins, giving one numerous flashes of her front teeth and that 'duh, what's going on?' expression of someone stoned or something instead of what one could expect which is acting. The main reason behind my new and improved 7 stars rating comes from the fact that watching Snow White and the Huntsman for the second time I knew what to expect in terms of Stewart's 'acting', and I could see past it. This helped like a lot. Oh, the story was still quite mediocre, too dragged and all, but now I noticed and appreciated all the hard work Charlize and Chris have done, and for their superior acting (especially if compared to - ahem - some one pretending to be actress) was so enjoyable, that I even enjoyed the movie quite a lot."
460,"I love fantasy films so was looking forward to seeing this even though the associated press surrounding Kristen Stewart put me off a little. However I am glad I got past that and watched it. Having since read some reviews on here I am confused by the number of very negative reviews. I felt it stayed pretty close to the fairy tale whilst including enough action and adventure to please the fantasy fans. Charlize Theron puts in another fantastic performance but the other stars of the show are the dwarfs played by a host of well known actors. The biggest disappointment for me is Kristen Stewart. She is so one-dimensional, emotionless, even when she gets angry I find myself yawning. If you are expecting to see a different character to Bella then you will be disappointed. However, this didn't spoil the film too much for me and the twist at the end...does this mean there will be a sequel?"
461,"Due to the mixed reviews, I didn't rush but waited for Christmas before I watched it, yet then I liked the movie much more than I had expected. Undoubtedly the performance of Charlize Theron as Evil Queen is excellent, but Chris Hemsworth shows that he can do more than playing the smiling blonde hero 'Thor'. His huntsman never disposes easily of enemies, he's hit very hard quite often, and drinks a lot to forget past defeats. I have seen Kristen Stewart (Snow White) only once before, namely as Joan Jett in the 'Runaways' movie, and she may seem a strange choice as Princess, because she is to embody the Pure & Sweet. Pure and sweet would frankly not be the words that spring to my mind when describing Joan Jett, and in that role Kristen Stewart was very good. But it must be said that the Snow White character starts a war at the first opportunity, and that rage and vengeance would be hard to play convincingly for a nice blonde, Stewart certainly is better at that.Altogether, 'Snow White' as a modern dark fantasy film succeeded in my view. It did not do too much deconstruction of the myth, as for example the white stag is a piece of innocent fantasy. But on the other hand, it has the most credible dwarfs ever, a really mean bunch at the beginning, and also the Evil Queen has had a tragic past that caused her to use magic, usually the villains in fantasy movies just use magic because that's what villains do, but here is definitely more to it. Not a perfect movie, but a good movie, not suitable for younger children due to violence, though."
462,"After reading the mixed reviews this movie had when it was first released in the summer of this year, I wasn't sure whether or not I would try and watch it just so I can either be impressed or disappointed, but it only depends on taste and opinion. So, I watched it on a red-box rental copy saying to myself, ""This might not be so bad."" Later, I thought with a smile on my face, ""This was a really beautiful movie."" Now, don't expect a much more compelling story because while it is a good film despite the bashing it received from the critics, it does have some problems.The story kept the basics of the German fairy tale perfectly, but it's lackluster storytelling kind of ruined it with several parts that are completely long and dragged. It's beginning was, shall I say, unengaging until almost an hour in, it started to really build up to the pathos of it's fairy tale. The second flaw goes to the pacing which seems to be a little bit on the longer side.Flaws aside, everything worked out well. The cinematography is brilliant and the editing is handled nicely. The visuals are great with beautiful landscapes that gives the movie an epic sweep and the direction from Rupert Sanders is lively. It also has an epic music score from James Newton Howard which fits really well the movie's darker and grittier tone. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the gripping action sequences and the excellent acting.Now, I've heard that some people questioned about Kristen Stewart's casting as Snow White, but I think she did a fine job for the role. She was alert, keen, and changed into a warrior instead of a plot device and I really liked her speech in the climax. It was forced, but it was so emotionally beautiful that I really started to like her from the beginning. Chris Hemsworth from Thor became a great choice for the huntsman and when he revealed his back-story I actually felt sorry for him. Several cast members like Sam Claflin did what they were given and the eight comical dwarfs, played by Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris, Eddie Marsan, Brian Gleeson and Nick Frost are funny and gave me a chuckle and a laugh. The only person who steals the show the most goes to Charlize Theron as the evil white queen Ravenna. She was so over-the-top and handled the role perfectly.Overall, Snow White and the Huntsman isn't exactly a masterpiece, but it's by all means a beautifully emotional fairy-tale epic despite it's lackluster storytelling and sluggish pacing. I understand that it got bashed by critics, but I still think it's a pretty good film worth-watching."
463,"Initially this was a change of pace from what I was expecting, but when you stop expecting an action movie with a twist, it is actually a very good fairy tale. I enjoyed it. Not the best film of the year but certainly worth a watch. It has a great cast, who give the novelty of a fairy tale the right amount of angst. The dwarfs deserve special mention as I thought they added valuable humour with out managing to camp the whole thing up to much. I think its a shame there wont be a sequel. Kristen Stewart and especially Charlize Theron give a cracking performance. Overall a good fantasie film, a good cast with a fantastic performance from Charlize. Its a shame this film got so much PR for salacious reasons as it deserved credit as a film."
464,"I'm not sure why so many people disliked this because It's a solid fantasy movie! The movie kept my interest throughout the entirety of it. Yes, some parts were predictable if you know anything about the fairy tale of Snow White but there were enough variations that made it different from the original. The Queen is defiantly the most interesting character and I'm glad they took the time to flesh her out. She isn't a simply villain, at parts you even feel empathy for her. The script can be a little cheesy at times but hey, it's a fantasy movie! The best part of this movie are the visuals because they are simply AMAZING!! Not only are the special effects stunningly life-like but they're also very artistic. This movie is very enjoyable if you take it for what it is and don't expect a groundbreaking drama."
465,"I've watched the Snow White story (cartoons) I think a hundred times already. When I saw the trailer I'm like ""WOW! I must watch this!"". From the main male characters to the step mother, it's a WOW cast! They made it a bit different with the unexpected twists and changes of the story which is really good. I really did enjoyed the movie but there's a part where Kristen Stewart have this ""supposed"" to be an emotional or shall I say encouraging speech that if well played I may shout ""go Sparta!!!"" but I can't feel the emotion on that part.On the other hand, bravo to Charlize Theron for doing such a great job in her role. Each time she's on screen I have my mouth open and eyes on her. I never saw her (or her movies) where she played similar role, usually they're romantic and funny movies. So her playing the role of the (evil) step mom was surprising for me.I wouldn't recommend that you let your kids watch this alone since there are scenes where they might get scared - because of Charlize Theron and movie effects. As mentioned, it's not like your original snow white story they made some changes. But to all people who are like me, who grew up knowing and watching Snow White (the cartoon) since they're little, then go on and watch this."
466,"Kristen Stewart, who was about 21 during filming, plays the young adult Snow White in this adaptation of the old fairy tale. Her father, the King, has been killed and she has been imprisoned since his death.Charlize Theron is the evil Ravenna who tricked the King into having sympathy for her, and marry her quickly. She kills him on their wedding bed. She possesses some sort of magic that allows her to stay young-looking and beautiful, but to do it she must inhale the youth out of other pretty young girls, in the process turning them into old hags.The magic mirror plays a prominent role. Snow White has managed to escape, and presumed dead. But when she turns 21 and becomes the 'fairest of them all', Ravenna must have her hunted down.Chris Hemsworth is The Huntsman, initially forced to work in Ravenna's behalf, but he eventually takes the side of Snow White, and together they work to get the kingdom back.There are seven dwarfs in a dark forest, filled with strange creatures including fairies. In a cinematic twist the actors are not actually dwarfs, but made to look like dwarfs via cinematic tricks. They are played by such well-known actors as Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, and Toby Jones.A very good production overall, and entertaining once you get over the idea that this is not your usual 'Snow White' take. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron are both particularly good in their roles."
467,"I didn't want to like this movie because I'm not a Stewart-fan but I was pleasantly surprised with the overall result. Stewart's performance varied a lot throughout the movie but she had couple of high points, especially when faced with the Queen. The story was good enough and even though it's a very familiar story, it was able to bring along twists I didn't expect. But the very best thing about the movie was the world design. So many different people, in many different and original environments and they were all beautifully created and outstandingly shot. It would've been much better with some character development but let's face it, Grimm's original isn't about character development either."
468,"The Snow White tale we all know gets a darker and more epic take on the story. Snow White escapes from being imprisoned by her evil stepmother, Ravenna, who needs Snow White's heart to keep her young forever. Snow White ends up teaming with the huntsman who was meant to kill her. He ends up saving her numerous times from Ravenna's army. The two of them, along with the seven dwarfs - who they meet along their journey - try to recruit the next kingdom over to vanquish Ravenna's reign to the thrown.Overall, the movie was good. Don't get me wrong, the movie did have some problems. The major problem with the movie was the pacing. The filmmakers could have easily trimmed off scenes where they venture into the woods and swap it for more of Charlize Theron's character, Ravenna.Another major problem is with some of the random things that get planted into the movie. Like when Snow White first escapes, she randomly finds a white horse just sitting on the beach waiting for her and she rides it out of the kingdom as if the writers just threw the horse in there because they didn't know what else to do. Her escape was too easy. Some of the battles get repetitive throughout the movie as well, having similar styles to other movies like Narnia and The Lord of the Rings. But the main strength of the movie was the visuals. The movie nails the dark and cloudy middle age period it is set in. The makeup effects are great when we see Ravenna ageing, then, gracefully turn young again. The creatures like the fairies and the trolls look good.The acting was pretty good too, with Charlize Theron playing a good villain. Even Kristen Stewart, who I don't like very much, does a decent job as Snow White. Saying that, I would still rather have had Amanda Seyfried or Emma Watson playing Snow White instead."
469,"Like many reviewers said on IMDb, I heard about the film, heard Kristen Stewart's role and scoffed. I saw the trailers and thought...okay maybe but still didn't rush out to see it. I had all but forgotten about it and thought it had tanked until I heard about the sequel announced and saw it had actually made almost twice its money back (300 + million dollars) and I decided to give it a go. Its very near epic. I think there were only a handful of mis-steps that stopped it from being outrageously brilliant. Regardless of where it is on the epic scale it was rip roaring fun, non stop action, a solid story and some great performances. It certainly got a handful of bad press because of the recent infidelity between star and director and because many mainstream cinema goers (me included) have trouble taking Kristen Stewart seriously since Twilight which gets worse and worse all the time. The film is absolutely visually stunning. The special effects are brilliant, the cinematography is mind shattering, and the battle scenes are solid though they do lack a certain gritty realism that historical epics tend to have.I don't hate Kristen Stewart. In fact it was years ago after seeing her in The Messengers that I thought and said that she could be really something in the future. Then she got bogged down with Twilight and constantly looks greasy and goth. This is the first thing I've seen her in, since long before Twilight and I'll be darned...she CAN act, and she actually suits the role really well!! She looks good, she's a strong female lead, and she does a good job. Its not earth shattering but its a decent performance. Chris Hemsworth also really shines as The Huntsman sent to hunt her and then ends up protecting her. He actually looks and acts way different than Thor so the comparisons aren't even there. He makes for a great leading man! I thought from the trailers that the highlight of this film would be Charlize Theron as the evil Queen. She definitely makes for a twisted villain but in a dark and new version of Snow White made more for an older crowd...she shouldn't be campy and silly and at times she comes across that way. Its the way she speaks and moves and some of the scenes she has. As iconic as the phrase is, I think they would have done well to get rid of ""Mirror Mirror on the wall..."" She definitely is over dramatic in the role, her end scenes are like something from an SNL skit. Sam Claflin plays Snow's beloved childhood best friend William. I'm not sure why The Huntsman was decided not to be Snow's Prince but Claflin is ridiculously underused and the chemistry is minimal compared to that with Hemsworth. None of them have truly outstanding chemistry (another factor in why this falls short of epic.) I also thought the dwarfs were very underused as well and in fact felt forced into the story because you expected them to be there. They had some big name actors behind those motion captured faces like Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane and Ray Winstone.The now infamous director Rupert Sanders clearly did some outstanding work at shooting the film. The fight scenes are well choreographed and the special effects are amazing. He stops at nothing to make the Dark Forest come alive, to show us a troll, fairies, dwarfs, mystical creatures and at the same time stunning shots of the Kingdom and the castles and the countryside. The pacing of the film is excellent and the story is told in between some really great action sequences. What it all boils down to is this...the film is very entertaining, I would absolutely watch it again and far more excited for a sequel than I was for this film, but the chemistry in the cast is lacking and some of the performances are melodramatic. Absolutely well worth the cost of admission though. 8/10"
470,"I'll give credit to Snow White and the Huntsman where I think it is due. Like all proper fairy tales, this one is certainly unafraid to get dirty, dank and even grotesque, which includes covering Kristen Stewart in lots of mud. Indeed, Snow White is sometimes Snow Brown in the first half of the film. At the same time, it also doesn't hesitate in bringing some some Disneyesque innocence, joy and sunshine into the picture, and it does so without being cheesy. Rupert Sanders' directorial debut starts like a fairy tale, progresses like a fairy tale, but it ends like a Hollywood movie, and one that is is eager to wrap itself up. The last half hour feels like something half baked in comparison to the more rounded and patiently paced preceding hundred minutes. This visually stunning motion picture is almost visually humorous near the end. For the record, let us not forget that Snow White is a princess ...NOT a warrior. She doesn't wear a full suit of armour, ride strait saddle and fight with a sword and shield which she could never lift. Being a fantasy film, doesn't strike me as an excuse to stray from historical accuracy when you are mimicking a historical time period like the dark agesI also didn't like the ending at all. I was impressed that the movie was able to give so many supporting characters some story, but the ending kind of leaves them all dangling. Snow White and the Huntsman needed another ten minutes to achieve a better sense of closure.Kristen Stewart is not someone I would have picked for the role. While she is not terrible, she is not quite at home here, because she lacks charm. Meanwhile Charlize Theron is almost perfect as the wicked queen. She is pure evil, almost to the point of being cartoonish (which actually feels appropriate here)Snow White and the Hunstman entertains in various ways, but there is work to be done. There was a point where I could no longer suspend disbelief, and from there, things wen't downhill. This is a medium good film at best."
471,"The first time I saw this, or tried to, I fell asleep. The cinematography is handsome, and the acting pretty good all around. Nevertheless I was bored out of my mind until, alas, I fell asleep, about 40 minutes in, unengaged by the characters, uncaring about their fates, although they seemed to be engaged and caring about themselves and their world.(ie: the acting was not the problem. Rather, the presentation of the characters was failing to engage me in their destinies before I lost consciousness, if that was the plan.) I awoke some 40 minutes later, to yawn through the reminder of the movie, still utterly unengaged in the now melodramatical action, of course.As a neutral point, I'd say the scripting on a tale wellknown to all is pretty standard fare - nothing too far removed from the classic tale, nor too clingy about that. Here, the style is greytoned, gritty and medieval in comparison, but that is about it. At the level of just relating the scenes of the tale, nothing special is going on here, for better or for worse. That is, except perhaps in the (somewhat interesting in itself) surreal/psychedelic perspective on white magic and dark sorcery, which is hardly thanks to the scriptauthor, although these interesting effects are well enough integrated in the story.I just gave it a second chance to tell its story a few hours ago, and I am very pleased that I did. Once again I found the beginning utterly unengaging and boring. This time around, I was prepared for that dull ride, though, and simply paused it every so often to take care of other business around my home, then to return and watch a little more. Also, I was becoming somewhat intrigued by the lackluster storytelling, and trying to understand what was off. I'm still not entirely certain, but I have a few clues, that shouldn't be spoiling to anyone. First off, I challenge the claim that anyone is acting downright badly in this movie. I tend to think the whole crew did pretty good on their respective characters, actually. This movie just isn't doing what we are used to: steadily building momentum, and insisting on you to fall in love with the characters from the outset or never ever. Seeking/succeeding in getting your pulse rolling from the outset with exhilarating chases and teethgrinding pathos. Which is more or less how you construct your run-o-the-mill blockbuster. The first time I felt a flicker of interest in this tale, was 53 minutes in, when the princess encounters a troll. I can't promise that you'll be equally interested in what happens in that scene, it is still subtle, (and not necessarily for everyone, of course) but from that point on, and only then, the sparks starts to fly, building the pathos and ethos of the tale, and as such making the logos of it all meaningful and thoughtprovoking. At least to the extent that you are not too insulted by the failed or absent seduction in the loooong and dragging beginnings to be charmed by it now that it is turned on. I know I wasn't, now that I was awake and attentive enough to watch the 'fire take hold' at long last.The resulting movie is one that I consider to be a rare and unusual pearl of storytelling, touching on themes of death, aging, loss and lack of innocence, meaning, heart and caring; as well as their counterpoints of having/finding the warmth to keep the fires going, and of daring to age, lose and die, and therefore, to live.I do not blame those who scold this movie. I only wish for them they'll give it another chance, and be as rewarded as I was. I also have a hard time believing it was the Hollywood producers accepted intent for something like the first half of this movie to be so unengaging, as it has no doubt cut the commercial winnings on the finished product in half, if that can even cover it. I do suspect, however, that it was the directors final intent to deliver just such an unusual and daring piece of storytelling, as it does seem to deepen the otherwise apparently simple and overt fairytale, and let its subtle symbolic depths really shine.If you are ready for an old school fairytale with something it wants to say about life, like it used to be; and if you can accept this movies insistence on the rhetorical freedom of being tediously unengaging in the telling, for the first 53 minutes, at least, you might see something rather interesting and beautiful, here.7 out of 10 stars for the still less than streamlined telling of the tale (imho) 1 extra for daring to be deep, by turning on the charm only at the point that the participating storyteller was charmed, rather than just trying to entertain its audience with cheaply sold pathos up front.8 out of 10 stars, all in all."
472,"I don't like comparing movies, unless they relate to each other directly. Even then, I'm not wholeheartedly for it, but here is one rare exception. Not only another version of Snow White with a certain twist but a version that follows one of the biggest disappointments of my film viewing history - Mirror Mirror. Well it's not a perfect version, but it's a much better one. The pace is all right, the familiar bit of the story is over and done with as fast as possible. The evil queen is very evil and menacing, Julia Roberts was perfect as an evil cartoon, she did her role flawlessly and yet, wasn't even slightly scary, Charlize Theron, did better roles in her career, but most of the time she carries the role with the right amount of bitterness and venom. Chris Hemsworth is a very good huntsman, and Kristen Stewart looks the part and doesn't lose credibility all the way through. The rest contain a small surprise with a cute appearance of Bob Hoskins, and most of the others don't really leave any impression. Still apart from some pointless digressions into silly mysticism that almost damage the pace , but luckily stop short of doing so - the movie holds up fairly well, I wish Mirror Mirror was half as gratifying as this one."
473,"This film receives just over the half-way mark from me, simply because whilst I didn't dislike it, I wasn't wowed by it either. The actors played their roles well, not brilliantly, but convincingly enough. Stewart was actually rather good and I much preferred her in this role than in the Twilight films. Her English accent wasn't too bad either. Hemsworth was great as always but I feel that there wasn't much for his character to do. Theron was incredibly well suited to the role and played Ravenna with both menace and vulnerability. The dwarfs were by far my favourite characters, showing both sensitivity and humour, adding the light relief that we craved during this dark film.It was the plot that I was most disappointed with. I felt like too much was attempted to be crammed in, without giving much background. The director touched upon Snow White's background, how the Queen came to be under the spell, why the Huntsman was a widow, what the King's men had been doing in the meantime and what had happened to the dwarf clan. All these fingers in different pies and yet we learnt nothing conclusive. More of an effort should have been made to expand on these themes; particularly the Queen's childhood which would have explained a lot as to how she had become this evil youth-obsessive. The romance too should have perhaps been expanded; it appears that Snow White and the Huntsman fancied each other but that wasn't portrayed very well at all. The cinematography was incredible and the visuals were stunning, both in terms of the scenery of the forest and the castles but also in transitions such as turning the evil Queen from old to young flawlessly in seconds. The film was fine and a good watch but not one that I'd necessarily go to see again."
474,"I took the movie ""Cowboys and Aliens"" on the face and enjoyed it and some pretty weird and confusing scenes still a joy to watch..1. This movie is quite terrible. Sometimes The bad Queen sucks beauty out of beautiful women, later she is sulking in horrid appearance when she could very well suck beauty out of other women... 2. No idea what was the reference to his brother and her, when he was dying.. 3. Why was his brother, who was a sissy suddenly become so brave and fight even the huntsman... 4. Last but not the least, shouldn't the Snow White was a good heart, clean hearted angel who touched everything turned beautiful; this character from initially lacked substance sincerity (except the scene about troll) and not to mention to avenge her parents death and reclaim the throne she even encourages people to wage a war and lastly rides the horse in lead and fights like a true fighter... i thought snow white hated war and death and blood - as initially portrayed ...she was blood thirsty I am now scared of Snow White in general..."
475,"This is a different interpretation of the classic fairy tale. In this version, the wicked woman tricked the recently widowed king to marry her. Not only is this woman wicked, but she has lived way before and attained unbelievable powers to keep her young. Of course, Snow White is a threat to her vanity and she plots to do away with her.The film is different as the huntsman becomes her love interest and the dwarfs she meets in the forest reminded me of the Munchkins.Of course, there is a final battle where Kristin Stewart, our heroine, leads a charge as if she is Joan of Arc. Charlize Theron is absolutely terrific as the treacherous stepmother.Though we know it, the ending is a little unclear."
476,"For a video review of 'Snow White and the Huntsman' by ThatPunkJoCassidy, try the link below!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDGQ_O_xizEYou've probably seen this movie before and just didn't know it. If you've seen 'The Lord of the Rings' movies, 'Game of Thrones', the 'Twilight' movies, even a little 'Princess Mononoke', thrown in with shaky cam, Thor, and sun flares from Michael Bay wanna-be films and you've pretty much got this film. There's honestly not much to talk about this movie, besides how much it copy and pastes from other films. I guess you can point out how ridiculous an idea it is to take what was a short, simple fairytale, already been done better by Disney, and throw in a ridiculous 'prophecy', a amp it up to 'some' level, and try to make some epic tale... When it's not. OK, you have Kristen Stewart as Snow White, enough said, and Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen. Theron is actually pretty entertaining to watch since she chews scenery like Kobayashi at a hot dog eating competition. And Thor? Well he's there... Looking at his worse not doing anything. And then Ian McShane and Nick Frost as dwarfs!? Wait what!? Why can't we get more of that! Anyways... The movie is pretty boring, full of holes, but over-all harmless and forgettable. Nothing epic to see here..."
477,"Absolutely uninspiring movie. Nothing I've not seen million times before. No new ideas. Seems like an amateur movie done with no money and no professional actors although visually it is well made. (Not impressive really, but well made.) Absolutely sub-par acting. Kristen Stewart is not an actress. She cannot play. Sorry. She has no control over her facial expression and it is constantly... odd. Mouth open and about to, what, faint? It is strange to watch her in a very sad moment of the movie looking as she is about to start to laugh for no reason. The hilarious part is the motivational speech at the end - you got to watch this yourself - it is worth seeing. Never seen so bad piece of acting and never heard so dull script. The film is total disaster on the level of the cheap movies done for small TV channels. Total waste of time."
478,"This movie just got on my nerves. The film tries to reinvent the Snow White fairy tale by further exploring the relationship between Snow White and the Huntsman, the man sent by the evil Queen to kill her, but he lets her go instead. First and foremost, I don't buy Kristen Stewart as the essence of purity and innocence, aka Snow White. Then, turning Snow White into a warrior princess? Come on. While the effects team do a marvelous job at building the fairy tale world, and actor Chris Hemsworth is awesome as the Huntsman, the film is just a cluttered mess. There is very little character development, with one wondering what the relationship between Charlize Theron's evil Queen, and her grovelling brother, truly is. Then, adding insult to injury, the dwarfs are never fully distinguished from one another, marking this as a film not worth seeing.I give Snow White and the Huntsman a 3 out of 10!"
479,"While many point jest at Kirsten Stewart's acting capabilities, I became utterly turned off by this film do to her dry and expressionless being. Where I tried to absorb myself into the movie and forget about the dreadful acting, I couldn't help regurgitate at the very dialog she nonchalantly chattered out of her ever showing teeth. This mouth breather essentially ruined the entire film. Natalie Portman? Emily Browning? No, mouth breather. Essentially the Movie takes you on a wildly grim tale of how the evil queen took power of the kingdom and what was to come of the ""beautiful"" snow white. The makeup, costumes, and scenery are all essential gorgeous. The plot, while seemingly hairy, was solid enough to follow thoroughly. I would probably suggest this to anyone that wanted to throw rotting vegetables at there Televisions."
480,"This movie started out good with the King and the evil Queen for like 15 minutes...and then Kirsten Stewart shows up. I have tried in the past to watch her movies with no prejudice, but I can't overlook the fact that she never seems to close her mouth and be the most awkward Snow White they could ever cast. I kept wondering if Kirsten Dunst had been there instead it maybe would have been a decent movie. No hate against the personality of Kirsten Stewart, but she does not seem to know how to act. Aside from that the special effects looked great, but the polished Disney look and the filthy settings combined was not a hit for me. It was like a misunderstood Monthy Pyton set meets Twilight.And the ending was awful."
481,"Aside from the nice sets and costuming, the rest of the movie is very trying to sit through. The plot, dialogue and acting is some of the worse I have ever seen. Anyone who compares this to the wonderful feat Peter Jackson achieved with Lord of the Rings, is way off the mark. Just because both movies can be considered in the fantasy genre, the similarity ends there.So much of the plot is non-nonsensical and obviously not well thought out. I don't know if the acting is bad because the dialogue was so bad, or perhaps both just combined to make it even more dreadful. The cinematography was good, but the audio needs a lot of work, as it goes from barely audible whispers to ear assaulting noise.Do yourself a favor....SPARE YOURSELF!"
482,"I will not repeat the old story..hope you already know it.I give just some advice AGAINST this picture:Kirsten Stewart act as a dog (""act""?? dogs I beg your pardon). She seems to have two (2) expressions: standard that means a bore and dull face, and sad, portrayed with a sort of facial paralysis and a grin. I suppose the director had two panels with STD and SAD on for ""the actress"" to readsome parts of the script, the ones not strictly following the standard plot, are so stupid that I fell asleep several times..Vote 2 instead of 1 thanks to Charlize, at least she does a decent job in her role."
483,"I love going to the movies, but lately (after becoming a father of four) my time is very much limited, so I enjoy most movies through DVD watching. Here in Iceland Mirror Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman were published at a similar time (in DVD form). Me and my wife watched them both over the span of three days and my review will be colored by that fact.THEATER vs DVD: I know much of the experience of watching movies gets ""lost"" by only watching it on small screen, but there are some movies that benefit being watched on the big screen. Both these movies probably would have been enjoyed more if seen in theaters but still ... my 10 stars grade for Mirror Mirror couldn't be higher. I doubt Snow White would raise to 3.DIRECTION: For the whole outcome, the director should always be the most responsible person. Rupert obviously couldn't handle this task. It is like a beginner vs. a pro (Rupert vs. Tarsem) STORY/SCRIPT: Almost from the first second Mirror Mirror captivated us. I found myself waiting for something special to happen in Snow White ... nothing! Result?? Show white never makes sense. You never get attached to any of the characters, never! And that HORRIBLE speech made by Kristen Stewart near the end ... please please please please!!!! I was aching! CINEMATOGRAPHY/COSTUMES... : Dreamlike and so wonderful in Mirror Mirror, but very gloomy in Snow White ... so much dirt, filth, hopelessness, but they get a star for making it believable :-) MUSIC: I like Howard's score in many movies, but not here. Alan Menken by far wins this comparison.ACTING: Much more believability in Mirror Mirror - probably the reason why I connected much more to that film. Here, all those incredibly big names in the movie business (Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Kr...Ste... ) ... horrible acting. Chris Hemsworth was the best to watch and one of my faves (Theron) did an okay job but the part was so badly done. Kristen Stewart is in my opinion the most overrated actress working today! result: Horrible movie!!!! Don't see it! See MIRROR MIRROR instead!!!"
484,"So the directors of Snow White and the Huntsman sat down, and asked themselves... What are we going to get if we throw together a ton of special effects, lots of slow motion scenery scenes, elements from Narnia, Bridge to Terabithia and Lord of The Rings and every fairy tale in existence, constant screaming from the evil witch, no facial emotion from Snow White, terrible dialog and absolutely no plot whatsoever? You're right! THIS! BRILLIANT. LET'S GET DOWN TO IT!It had tremendous potential. I repeat, it really, really did have potential. Hemsworth and Theron would have created a perfect dynamic as leading cast if their roles were challenged just that bit more. The effects were great and the scenery shots were excellent. However, there was too much of everything and too little of all that would have made it even remotely special. Besides, I don't believe that this role fit Steward at all. It would have wanted someone much more spirited, emotional and passionate. There were parts when I wanted to shake her from her constant wooden expression, but then I remembered Twilight and shut up. Everyone's acting throughout the film was either wooden or over the top. Theron simply screamed out every line while Hemsworth hulk-smashed his way through the props. And then - the hodgepodge of every single fantasy film mixed up in one. Trolls, elves, poisonous gases, deadly forests, Aslan...I mean - a magical deer, Snow White's magical recovery from being locked up for 20 years in a tiny cell to being able to leap and run and fight overnight... I could go on forever.And so many dialogs and scenes that were unfinished even if they had a great start. Not to mention that the ending disagreed with me enough to give me indigestion.I mean, fairytale by all means, but no. Just no. Too many cooks spoil the broth, they say no?Or quite possibly I've watched too much Game of Thrones and was expecting the same elegance and beauty."
485,"I heard from some people this movie was worth watching, so I rented it, hoping Snowwhite was played by Lily Collins but it wasn't. That was a great disappointment. Lily Collins is in the version with Julia Roberts and I'm not going to waste my money on a Julia Roberts movie so I'll wait for Mirror Mirror to come on the television.Snowwhite and the huntsman had very little action, very bad acting and not a very pretty snow white. After one hour the dwarfs came and they were boring. Charlize did what she always does; a lot of screaming, just being pretty and not very good acting. Still I am happy with the thoughts of Prometheus where she was driven over by a dough nut shaped spaceship. It wasn't good enough for me to see her ""die"" in this movie, because she will be back in Snowwhite and the huntsman part two. So what was the purpose watching this movie? If the acting is the same in the second movie, please don't bother making a sequel. But then again, a lot worse than this one it cannot be.One big plus of the movie was the forest of the dwarfs."
486,"Major spoilers: I was intrigued when I initially saw the trailers for SWatH. Grimm fairy tales have quite a dark under tone and we often know them by their Disney version. So I like the idea of taking these fairy tales and exploring them from the other end. The problem is SWatH had a terrible anti-climactic plot and poor acting.First major problem is Kristen Stewart who I strongly assume was casted to attract the Twilight audience. I cannot stand the Twilight movies and Kristen Stewart's acting in them which I had previously blamed on Twilight's direction. She usually just stares off looking vacant and slightly startled. Here she is the same. She is emotionless and it hurt the movie. I felt no chemistry or connection between her and the huntsman, Hemsworth. When scenes popped up discussing why Hemsworth was hanging around, as far as I could tell he just felt a need to protect her out of goodness. Until it was hinted at that he had feelings for her, I didn't know there was a romance brewing. There is an underdeveloped love triangle with William, a childhood friend. That love interest, I believed more since their connection was previously developed by the child actress playing Snow White.Charlize Theron was the best part of the movie. Her acting was over the top and I am not faulting her because she was probably directed to be this way. If the rest of the movie had turned out as sinister as it hoped, I think her acting would have worked. She was also stunningly beautiful as always. On a side note, even with the make-up on to be old, she was still by far the fairest of them all.The plot was the most abysmal part. Things seem to just happen, I assume to fill time. The beginning of the movie follows Grimm sort of, a pricking of a finger and a wish by the Queen for a beautiful child with snow white skin, blood red lips, and raven hair. The child is born and the mother dies soon after. Then the evil witch uses trickery to get in to the castle and gain the king's sympathy and he immediately marries her. I was still on board. The queen begins a rule of terror with her creepy brother at her side, sworn to protect her.Then the story comes apart once a now grown-up Snow White escapes from her captor. A Huntsman is sent to retrieve her from the dark forest where we find out the Queen's magic has no power. What, there is other magic? If you write a story about magic you need to define its parameters. It can't be infinite and you can't say by the way there are magically safe zones, it needs to be established at least that it is a magical world they live in. And if her magic doesn't work in the forest, why doesn't the brother die when he gets an ax to the stomach? The Huntsman does a switcheroo and decides not to hand over Snow White. The Huntsman mentions at one point that the dark forest feeds off your fear and becomes more treacherous as your fear grows and that's it for the dark forest. We find out how to survive it and then we are out of it. Then there's a troll bridge because a troll guarding a bridge is fairy tale 101 so it has to be included. A troll, really? Again world-building parameters, there are magical creatures. The troll mysteriously is calmed by Snow White, why? It is actually sort of explained later but still utterly pointless.Now it's off to the village of women. They are just here to show that some women are physically scarring themselves not to become youth food for the Queen, smart. The director/editor or whoever seemed to think it was a little too smart. This village is only here so you can see how the queen's appetite is affecting the kingdom. It has little point and everyone we meet is gone after we quickly move along. The scene could be left out completely and it wouldn't matter. The women scarring themselves could be incorporated in a more thoughtful way.Now, it's off to Disney Land. Literally. We step off of the rather dark an ominous set of Snow White and the Huntsman and enter the live action Disney movie of Snow White. Everything in the forest we are now in is in heightened color. There are cute cuddly animals, fairies, and butterflies. And 8 dwarfs? The number problem is rectified but why are the dwarfs here? Do they serve a purpose? They do help in some fighting but could you remove them from the movie and not really notice? Yep. Also a spirit animal or forest spirit or forest god or whatever appears, why? I don't know. Maybe to make the dwarfs useful and tell us that Snow White is life itself. How? Why? I don't know. We learned that the Queen's magic can be undone by the fairest which is now Snow White and already assumed the land had died because of her wickedness. So who stupidly and randomly decided Snow White is life itself and the land would heal because of her? The Queen's demise should simply be enough and we have Snow White, the fairest, who is able to accomplish it.More things just sort of happen. The plot also uses quick resolution which I hate: how will I lead men? OK I can lead men now. The imagery though is lovely. Some shots are wonderful to look at but even on mute the movie can't be helped.The writers/directors had too many fairy tale references that they wanted use that didn't aid the story. If they had realized that and cut them out while streamlining the plot, the movie would have been better."
487,"This movie has a plodding drawn out start, and is very predictable even if you have never heard the tale of Snow White. The dwarfs (when they eventually enter the movie) have limited uses and it felt as if they were stuck in as an after thought. There are one or two really lovely scenes where the computer graphics make you all cutesy and happy, but the battle scenes are for children and are not done very well. There are reminders of LOTR here and there, but where this movie fails most is in the storyline and its lack of depth. The acting is good enough, as were the sets, graphics and effects, but the Snow White tale does not make for a very good movie. Despite all the modern touches, it is still a movie for children, and if you are an adult looking for some fantasy/action then forget it."
488,"I don't know what happened with this movie, I was so looking forward to this one, with so many big name actors in it. But sad its really sad to say... what happened to this movie... it really truly was a waste of 2 hours of my time. It seems like it could have been great, but it fell so short, and you don't really know where, I blame the writing. This movie or series of movies could have been on the level of ""Lord of the Rings"" but it was so bad. I will never recommend this movie to anyone and I will tell them how bad it was when they ask.I don't really ever leave comments, this one just got me, if you have anything else you want to watch tonight... yes go with that not this, trust me you will be more satisfied. OK I'm done."
489,"While starting a review with a clich√© might be considered a bad taste by some, I just cannot help myself: life is short and over one hundred and twenty precious minutes of it have been hopelessly lost, wasted away on the pathetic profanation of a movie called ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". That frightful bore happens to be utterly mediocre in almost every respect, possibly except the special effects which are brief, scarce and not even remotely sufficient for a two-hour action and adventure movie.The only memorable fact about the first-time director Rupert Sanders is his infamously scandalous affair with Kristen Stewart. Unfortunately, there is nothing even remotely memorable about his exceedingly weak directing of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". Having said that, it is not an easy task to decide what is more pathetic ‚Äì Rupert Sanders's first time directing flop, or the dreary drag of a screenplay painfully labored by the first-time screenwriter Evan Daugherty.It remains a profound mystery to me how the talented writers John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and Hossein Amini (""Drive"") got involved in this farce. I could only speculate that they were summoned by the nervous producers in a desperate attempt to rescue the story from the dire condition Evan Daugherty drove it into. Having a regrettable misfortune to fully experience the finished product, I could confidently say that the brave attempt of these worthy fellows miserably failed as the screenplay proved out to be unsalvageable.The story suffers from the numerous defects prominently described on the first pages of basic screen writing schoolbooks for beginners: unnecessary plot lines leading nowhere, lengthy uneventful wanderings in all sorts of surroundings, boringly stereotyped dialogs and monologues, severe lack of character development, and incoherences of all kinds mercilessly polluting the flow of events, as meager as it already is.Action lovers will be additionally disappointed with the very brief and rare, badly staged, unoriginal and unimpressive battles and fight scenes.The outstanding mediocrity of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" reaches its ugly climax in the very bad acting, caused in part by the weak directing of an inexperienced first-timer. Rupert Sanders clearly did not demonstrate enough professional skill in working with the actors. Most of them, from Kristen Stewart to Charlize Theron seemed to be hopelessly lost, left on their own to invent their roles, to fill them with substance.People, who still remember Charlize Theron shining under the wise direction of visionary Ridley Scott in the well-crafted role of Meredith Vickers in ""Prometheus"", will be appalled by her confused, unsteady, seemingly unguided by the director performance as the evil queen Ravenna ‚Äì one of the many badly written characters from ""Snow White and the Huntsman"".Ravenna's featured transitions from the cold, calm, exercising self- control royalty, to the sinister angst-ridden witch overwhelmed by rage looked distastefully overdone, weird, and overall unconvincing. Instead of shocking us, striking us with horror, they would leave us in a disappointing puzzlement every time. The main disappointment, however, was Kristen Stewart While she might be a natural fit for the role of the hanging out with vampires and werewolves teenage girl in ""The Twilight Saga"", she is an absolute miscasting for the quite different role of Snow White.Snow White is supposed to be a royal youngster, a true princess, ""the fairest of them all"" - a girl with a kind, caring soul beautifully reflected in her thoughtful look, an agent of grace, nobility, innocence, and light. Such a character calls for a certain type, which Kristen Stewart has very little in common with.All I saw looking at the Snow White played by Kristen Stewart was an inexperienced teenage actor with limited abilities. I saw someone, who was a wrong type for the role, who did not have a clue how to play the role and did not have a meaningful guidance from the director, who in turn did not have an original vision for the role.As the story unfolded, the innocent young princess was supposed to overcome numerous challenges and discover her hidden strength, her inner self, her other side ‚Äì a fearless, but tender warrior, a true heir to the throne, whose destiny was to unite the people, to destroy the evil and to bring peace and freedom to the land.Needless to say, Kristen Stewart was as hopelessly unconvincing as the charismatic military leader, as she was as the noble princess.While Chris Hemsworth the Huntsman, fared in his role a little better than Kristen Stewart did in hers, his one-dimensional performance once again highlighted his noticeable acting limitations.Having heard some rumors about a sequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" with Chris Hemsworth in the title role, I simply cannot imagine him, with the limited acting abilities and the lack of charisma, carrying the whole movie on his shoulders.One of the rare colorful birds among the dull acting crew was Bob Hoskins as Muir, one of the dwarfs. Watching him playing his small role was like miraculously taking a breath of fresh air amid the suffocating whirl of bad acting offered by ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". Interestingly enough, being such a bad movie, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" managed to intrigue millions of people including yours truly. The deceptively marketed movie triumphantly lured many of us in the theaters and successfully tricked yet many others into renting itself.Whatever it was - the well-made deceiving trailer or the cult aura that surrounds Kristen Stewart after the ""The Twilight Saga"" - it worked.Nevertheless, I think these clever marketing tricks might not work that well for the sequel. I want to believe that we are capable of learning from our mistakes and therefore we will not swallow the same bait the second time.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
490,"Snow White, imprisoned daughter of the late king, escapes just as the Magic Mirror declares her the source of the Evil Queen's immortality.The Queen sends her men, led by local huntsman to bring her back.But upon her capture, the huntsman finds he's being played and turns against the Queens men, saving Snow White in the process.Meanwhile, Snow's childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her too......Every year there is a summer movie that gets a lot of hype, but just doesn't really do anything for you. This was that movie, and it really is the pits.The first thing you notice is that the makers really don'e know where to go with this. Do they want straight out fantasy? or are they going down the Ridley Scott epic way.Either way they fail. Stewart is woefully miscast in this, and although her other projects away from Twilight really show her flair for acting, this just shows how wooden she can be, and it's unfortunate for her that this will be seen by many, who would have never heard of the 'Runaways'.Hemsworth sports the worst Scottish accent this year, but is diverting when he isn't speaking, but Theron is magnificent in the movie and makes every scene she isn't in just scream for her.other than that, the film doesn't really deliver any thrills, laughs or action, we just plod along from one set piece to the next, which considering the huge budget is way to go to make such a boring film."
491,"In the first opening scenes I was mesmerized by the visuals and the enchanting raw power of the young Snow White, Raffey Cassidy. I could see my imagination taking flight in those ayes of hers, a story to come as pure as her child innocence. I wanted to discover through her the magical world about to unfold. How I wish now she never had to grow up and give the main role to Kristen Stewart. At that moment, the movie died. It would take me 30 minutes to realize what had happened and then I spent an hour and a half uninterested, squirming in my seat for the ending, bored among spectacular visuals.The beautiful decors could not carry the main protagonist. Charlize Theron, so perfect and powerful in her role could not replace the main character. The story itself so old and true could not come to life when the principal was a walking dead. Kristen Stewart, her usual inert self would be perfect to play the role of a corpse. Seeming to realize this, the director gave her very few lines, the ones she had were painfully delivered. Her speech to rouse the troops before the battle, just left me deeply uneasy.In the end, I did not care for the actors on the stage nor the story. That must be a deadly sin for any movie."
492,"Actually, I lost around 1.5 hrs because I fast forwarded a lot. The biggest failure of this movie is having Kristen as snow white, which is totally inappropriate. Kristen doesn't have any acting skill, very strained. I suspect that the director only chose her so he can seduce her. The movie doesn't sound much like the fairy tale mostly with a number of unnecessary scenarios. Charlize Theron, as always, was the best in the movie but I am surprise she wasted her talent for this. This 2nd movie with Kristen as main actress will be the last time I watch her, but this 1st movie from this director would be the last time I want to see his name as well. He should spend more time with his family than making movie for his scandal"
493,"I was looking for this movie and was expecting another visual orgy, which I got and I must admit I like this kind of high budget and not complicated story movies very much. On the other hand, even with this kind of big money, some scenes were too long for me and almost boring.So, not so bad so far, but then there is the acting.... The dwarfs were fun, The Huntsman was man at his place, William was totally unnecessary but had good archery skills...The biggest problem however is that I really felt nothing towards a Snow White, maybe when she was the little girl? But Kristen Stewart really did not convince me that I should care about her, I was even sad when the queen died. Think about it, the queen was evil and all, but also hot and I liked her magic, she also had her purpose and no one is only good... On the other hand, there is a princess who looks ridiculous in armor and would not be able to pick up a sword, yet she leads an attack, but most importantly has no feelings at all, I don't see how it is an improvement? Maybe the land will turn green, but my feeling from the movie were that the people will have much less freedom with this new queen in the end.So my feelings about this movie are very strange... Maybe this Snow White is a lesbian? That would explain a lot."
494,"We got two Snow White movies this year, go figure. Tarsem's was a small bite of candycolored dance. This is the serious, dark version closer to long-winded saga. Ultimately, both movies are poorly scripted excuses for CGI scenery. But story was going to be irrelevant anyway, wasn't it? This is fantasy, a business of tethering images from the ether around the edges of reason. I want to note some of the visual parts used here.generic Ridley Scott - Peter Jackson aerial flows to support the panorama of the epic long arc, which is a Fellowship of the Ring scenario about innocence hunted down by overwhelming evil.The Cell (ironically enough) for melted imagery that emphasize fluidity and 'strangeness'.a subjective camera that refracts intimate light.a Chimes at Midnight battle.Dior commercials for haughty , alabaster sparkles in sensual darkness. Charlize Theron holds this part, both haughty and sensual.generic castle siege and battle for the finale, with Snow White as warrior-maiden Jeanne D'Arc.Now I don't know if the filmmaker is consciously aware of where the parts come from, for instance the Kurosawa-like whip pans of riders rushing through a forest. Or if they just seeped in his work because they are prevalent elsewhere. What Welles did in Chimes is simply common Hollywood vernacular for filming war these days.The intimate camera is the one I want to talk about, because it is new at this level, and as the only human eye, it creates a powerful dissonance with the artificial world of the film.Most likely, this incarnation is through Malick. I'm sure we're only beginning to feel the ripples of his Tree of Life. Malick did not invent this, but in his twenty years of exile, he has probably studied it longer and harder than anyone currently having a budget. The cinematic inventor is a guy called Jean Epstein, who similarly revolted against the parlor tricks of stagebound -theatric- spectacle in the 1920's. He made films about the experience - not the fact - of seeing, a new and elusive eye-logic. It was deemed important enough at the time that he was giving lectures about it at Sorbonne. That was a few years before Eisenstein.A more immediate influence to Malick -as well as Tarsem- has got to be the Armenian Sergei Parajanov, a close friend of Tarkovsky. He managed two films in the 60's that were considered by Soviet censors so subversive, he languished for nearly a decade in the gulag system on trumped-up charges. He was truly a radical man. His first film took Epstein's subjective eye that remembers a story and made it float outside the limits of story and reason to give us a view of cosmic machinery that expand reason. It was pure genius and you deserve to have such richness. So for nearly a hundred years now, you have all these guys puzzling about new ways to deliver a visual narrative, doing amazing things. And the new Malick film currently premiering in Venice is no doubt going to be another step forward. Early word is that film is about a man floating through women he has touched, peripheral in his own vision. And here is a film about different selves of a woman (Queen - Snow White - the Huntsman's dead wife) who is peripheral in the vision of men who dream about her so long as that image is fresh and beautiful, and only that desired image is central. Thirty, twenty years ago, the same film would have been done simply the old way, in sweeping swathes of story. And here you have that other camera in the flow that is not storybased at all, that is slowly , very slowly expanding into Hollywood money. It seems new in context, because unlike Kurosawa and Welles (and Ridley Scott), this camera cannot be used to film a battle (or someone hasn't figured out how).The film has nicely presented snippets from that camera but none of the dissolution of hard-wired logic it was meant as a tool for. For a work of fantasy the film is ever so dull and reasonable.You simply have a hodge podge of cinematic devices some of which radical at their time, dressed from the outside to have motion and effect."
495,"Would have been much better with a different Snow White. Kind of a bust when the even witch is much more beautiful than snow white. Bad idea to cast Kristen Stewart.Overall the story was good, good plot, good effects. It dragged out a little bit in certain parts and you could tell people in the theater were losing interest. I heard multiple people sharing my viewpoint that kristen Stewart was a bad choice in cast for Snow White. I really think this is what made the movie not so good. If there is a sequel, hopefully they will cast someone better. Not a very good actress at all."
496,"The biggest problem with Snow White And The Huntsman is the leaden performance of Kristen Stewart as the main character. Stewart is loved and loathed in equal measure for her performances in the Twilight series¬Ö and whether you're an admirer or a detractor, you can't deny that the jury is still out on the extent of Stewart's abilities as an actress. Snow White And The Huntsman requires her to run a full gamut of emotions as a bedraggled prisoner, frightened fugitive, reluctant rebel rouser and, ultimately, Joan Of Arc-style warrioress. Unfortunately for the film, she rarely demonstrates sufficient range to make the role particularly convincing. This is a shame, because there's a fair bit of promise lurking beneath the surface. Debut director Rupert Sanders is clearly in love with his various fantasy locations, filling the film with sweeping fly-by shots of imposing towers, deadly marshlands, fairy-tales forests and muddy medieval villages. It's flavoured very much like the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, with nods towards The Neverending Story, Willow and several other titles from the heyday of the sword 'n' sorcery genre.Visually the film is a qualified success throughout, like a piece of stunning background art for the set of a grand stage play. It's almost a shame the actors have to come along to get in the way of these tremendous backdrops. Charlize Theron does at least get to ham it up nicely as the evil queen Ravenna and Chris Hemsworth has a certain rugged charm as the forlorn huntsman who learns once again how to live for something. His character is played with an inexplicable Scottish brogue and is rather wasted in the film's big set-piece final√©, but in the acting stakes he doesn't fare too badly. The same cannot be said for the dwarfs, who turn up belatedly assuming a strangely familiar look. Apparently there's no call for real dwarf performers in Hollywood these days, for here we have the likes of Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone and Nick Frost digitally resized to appear half as tall as the other actors. Such a collection of talent deserves better than the short, under-developed guest spots they are offered here. Hoskins most of all is utterly wasted as a blind wise man who speaks in prophetic clich√©s and becomes a sort of unofficial narrator for those viewers still having difficulty keeping abreast of the plot. Even worse is poor Sam Claflin as William, a young warrior who has spent his entire life regretting the day he let his childhood sweetheart Snow White fall into the clutches of wicked Ravenna. When he learns she is still alive, he gets his second chance to rescue her¬Ö only to find there's competition in the form of the huntsman. The character is about as interesting as a tree stump¬Ö and any potential for a romantic tug-of-war between Snow White and the two men in her life fizzles out with barely a whimper.It would be unfair to dismiss Snow White And The Huntsman as a failure, but it certainly does not score a direct hit either. The film's visual splendour remains its trump card, with some impressively staged battle sequences and a strong sense of other-worldliness. Overall, though, one can't help feeling that the potential for something much, much more has been missed. Perhaps one day this perennial Brothers Grimm story will get the extraordinary subversion that Hollywood seems so desperate to give it ‚Äì until then, the 1936 Disney version remains the true one to watch, with Snow White And The Huntsman emerging just another passable but unremarkable retelling."
497,"It was overall good and beautiful, but this movie stole some idea from ""Princess Mononoke"" from Miyazaki movie. Especially the magical white deer in the fairy forest is totally similar to Shishigami, Deer God, from ""Princess Mononoke."" If you have watched ""Princess Mononoke"" before, you would notice a few more similar details between 2 movies.However, I really like how they depicted the queen though. She was not a simple villain. Like the queen said to Snow White, their behavior might not be much different. Both of them fought for their people. Probably one big difference between them is who they fought for. For Snow White, it was all the people in the kingdom; but for the queen, she only had her brother and herself."
498,"After seeing and enjoying Red Riding Hood in 2011, I was excited to see this interpretation of Snow White. It started well with a good narrator and believable acting.However, it quickly lost momentum after Snow White grew up. I quickly found myself wondering when the Luck Dragon of Never Ending Story (1984) fame was going to arrive, or when Snow White would enter the Labrynth (1986) or when the Dark Crystal (19892) would be involved.I was disappointed by Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna. I wasn't convinced of her as a villain nor in those fleeting moments when I think we were meant to feel sorry for her.I couldn't tell whether Kristen Stewart was playing Snow White or Bella (of the Twilight Saga). Given that I wasn't a fan of her role in Twilight, I found it difficult to connect with her character in this movie. I felt Snow White should have been portrayed as a stronger character.The two male characters really disappeared into the background quite quickly for me. I felt like they were just there as the brawns to counter-balance the female leads.The movie wasn't awful but I certainly wouldn't watch it a second time.If you like the whole Never Ending Story style film, then you will probably love Snow White and the Huntsman. But for me the film lacked power, purpose and originality."
499,"""Snow White And The Huntsman"" is yet another pretty spectacle without much substance in it to make it the movie it could have been. Too bad because the technical aspects of the movie don't really fall short of the mark, but the rest exists somewhere between sub-par and mediocre.You know that a movie is in trouble when Charlize Theron is really the best thing about it, in terms of acting and screen presence! I can't help but wonder, what the movie would have been like with another actress in the lead role, and God knows there are plenty of talented actresses outhere that could have done a better job than her (Kristen Stewart).Kristen Stewart, much like Robert Pattinson, her on and off screen partner, has that same continuous look of being constantly constipated and longing to take a s*it at long last...she is the weakest link in a very weak chain of actors populating this movie. Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins are good in their roles, but are not given much to do or say in it, beyond the predictable dialogue and morality phrases. What a shame to waste so many talented actors.I'm sorry but a movie does sometimes rise or fall on its lead or leads, and in this case, for me at least, it sank to the bottom of the lake like a turd on a string... Kristen Stewart, cannot act her way out of a paper bag, and basically repeated the same ticks, manneurisms, facial expressions etc., as she has in every other movie she has been in.I know the movie was a financial success (and perhaps even critical), but I did not much care for it, and will soon forget I ever saw it...which is not a good thing, given the potential the movie did have! Hey there is the small consolation that it looked terrific in the previews, so do yourself a favour, stick to those and wait until the movie comes out on DVD/Blue-ray or OnDemand.PS Chris Hemsworth is pretty much Thor without the hammer in this one..."
500,"Only one way I can review this movie. It is a film for 13 year old girls. Not a Lord of the Rings kind.. more a Twilight kind..The Trailer gives a wrong impression of the movie.Theron is very good in this movie.Snow White is not a good actress. (not even going to bother naming her)The Dwarfs are just not entertaining. Such a waste of some comedy.Had loads of anticipation for this movie, but I was very disappointed. In fact the movie kind of bored me. There were a few moments where the CGI was quite good, and Theron was great as the Queen, but sadly that was not enough to save the movie."
501,"No character development, weak dialogue and overdependent on cg. There are numerous scenes that feel incomplete despite being stretched and some equally rushed. Charlize Theron is the only saving grace, she's wonderful as always. It had a lot of.potential but it fell flat and short of expectations. It is a commendable effort considering this is the director's debut. WARNING SPOILER- DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE Even though we all know the story anyway! I could not help but laugh when Snow White wakes up from the dead and immediately starts screaming at the top of her lungs urging the commoners to join her to overthrow the 'evil' queen. The shock and surprise of seeing her alive is underplayed as if everyone was expecting her to come back, even Snow White shows no emotion after 'waking up'."
502,"Something has happened recently that really doesn't happen all that often: I was wrong. Yes, let that sink in for a moment, because I realize that is so difficult to comprehend. When I saw the trailers for ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", the audience collectively rolled their eyes. I saw it as a fail safe for the next ""Twilight"" movie. But I was pleasantly surprised. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" offers a relatively dark, twisted take on the classic tale of the princess Snow White. Sure, some of the elements are familiar, but it's based off of a Grimm Fairy Tale. It's not a movie that you'll see to understand some deeper meaning of life. But it's a very smart, handsome, and Gothic look at a beloved classic.It's almost inevitable to compare this latest fairy tale rendition to March's ""Mirror Mirror"". While both movies look great, ""SWatH"" is not only more exciting than ""Mirror Mirror"", but it's vastly more complex and entertaining. Let's look at our heroines. Snow White in ""Mirror Mirror"" was played by Lily Collins who was very much a basic, generic protagonist. Kristen Stewart, whom I usually hate, offers a better take: she plays Snow White as a damaged, tragic heroine. She's lived her entire life locked up as a prisoner, mentally scarred by seeing how the evil queen drains youth from fair young maidens. If that isn't enough to make one crack, I don't know what is.Now let's look at our villains. What I find very distracting in both ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""SWatH"" is that their directors seem to enjoy the villains vastly more than the heroes. Both Julia Roberts and Charlize Theron are given vast amounts of screen time. But Theron seems to use this to her advantage. While all of Roberts' scene were force and padded, Theron uses her extra screen time to develop her character and make her more identifiable. We've never sympathized with any rendition of the evil queen before, so I really enjoyed Theron in the role. But, with that said, there's a problem I have with Theron: she either plays the role too calm and calculating or too loud and over-the-top. I guess I just would have liked to see some middle ground in her acting, but I'd just wave this off as nitpicking. The side characters are fun in both versions, but as you might have guessed, ""SWatH"" characters are done better. The dwarfs have sort of a gritty feel to them; they can be charming and fun, but they can throw down when they need to. The dwarfs in ""Mirror Mirror"" were fun, but they were also kind of unlikable in some scenes. Still, at least the filmmakers in ""Mirror Mirror"" got actual midgets to play dwarfs instead of pretty terrible CGI.The princes in both versions are okay, but what I like more about ""SWatH"" is that the prince and princess don't fall in love throughout the course of movie. They just redevelop a childhood friendship, which I thought seemed very mature for a fairy tale. The huntsman in ""SWatH"" is played by Chris Hemsworth, who has already proved himself a great actor. And he does good here as well.I guess if I were to find another problem with ""SWatH"" it would be the pacing. At least ""Mirror Mirror"" flowed smoothly, where as ""SWatH"" gets a little too self indulgent. I understand that a film needs atmosphere and slow scenes to develop characters, but some just aren't needed. For example, there's a village full of women who scar themselves so that they can avoid being harvested for their youth by the evil queen. We spend a good twenty or so minutes with this plot line, but what does it add up to? Nothing! The same can also be said about the fairies and the (implied) incest between the queen and her brother.Final verdict: Not only does ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" outshine ""Mirror Mirror"" in almost every way, but it works as it's own, unique creation. It's definitely not a children's movie, with its creepy imagery and subtle, suggestive themes, but it's a very intelligent movie. Check it out and see for yourself."
503,"I was excited yet skeptical to see this movie because of Kristen Stewart. I've watched many of her movies, and most impressive was Panic Room, after that, flat-flat-flat acting, especially after Twilight (worst saga ever!). First minutes went by, and the longer I watched it, the more familiar scenes/cut/splashes from other movies just made me a bit furious. The plot was scurry, jumping from here to there like there's no consistency with the storyline. And too many regular/rip-off scenes, and I'll just go ahead and write some..1. The drunk, broken-hearted huntsman can be found in many movies, nothing new there but still okay for me.2. The fairy forest scene, almost the whole scene just a rip-off from Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, from the set, the creatures, and the forest God which stood upon a lake and blessed the main character.. 3. The queen changed into this giant goopy bird after she poisoned the princess, it's also a rip-off from another Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle scene.A huge waste of my time and money."
504,"Why oh why must Hollywood make such flawed movies when they have so much potential ?I only saw this because I really liked Snow White: Tale of Terror; I thought it was an interestingly dark portrayal of the classic tale, especially with names like Sam Neill and Sigourney Weaver ! So I thought hey, it's 2012, so we're going to get a lovely grim mood but with better visual effects !I was right about the effects, they are indeed stunning, especially as far as the scenes with the Evil Queen (Theron) are concerned. Her costumes are gorgeous...and that's about it.Tell me, in what universe would a blank damsel like Stewart be considered fairer than the sexy, outgoing Theron ? None as far as I'm concerned. To make the Queen's jealousy believable, at least cast an actress who is drop-dead gorgeous ! She does not constitute a credible threat whatsoever ! It goes without saying that Stewart conveyed no depth to her character. None. We got the same blank expression as in the Twilight movies. Her Joan of Arc costume in the battle scene was ridiculous. Also...Isn't the mirror supposed to be a key element in the story ? I see no reason why it was replaced by an UGLY gold disk that shape-shifts into a liquid silhouette whenever it spoke with the Queen..Is this The Ring ?I won't even mention Hemsworth's terrible acting (and accent) because, frankly, he's such eye candy he makes you forget how dull Snow White looks in comparison..He even makes you forget the badly filmed/edited forest sequence.The character of William was, sadly, under-exploited. Seeing Snow White so detached from him was almost laughable, while he proved to be faithful and honorable after those long years of separation.See this movie only for its beautiful opening scene, the child actress who played little Snow White, and for entertainment purposes (Theron's over-the-top, excessive acting is a little startling, before turning downright ridiculous). However, I'd recommend you rent Tale of Terror instead, despite the cheesy title. At least that Snow White was pretty to look at and that Queen was chilling !"
505,"I won't tell you the story, everybody know it. Just a slight variation of the original. Theron was great in it. Hemsworth and Stewart were okay in it. Storyline and editing were very good paced. Not to slow or to fast. Just perfect. The most remembered acting was Theron's. Which was good, because i went to see it for her. While Stewart and Hemsworth brought their standard acting, it's not to bad. The cameras, background and production value were outstanding. The castle, costumes, especially the dark queen's was very exceptional. Apparently it was not a mistake to watch this movie after only saw the trailer. If you love eye candy, action paced and fairy tale told in adult way, then this movie is just right for you."
506,"Two attempts to jazz up the old fairy tale plot in one year. ""Mirror, Mirror"" aimed for lighthearted camp...and flopped despite delightful design and a cluster of delicious performances.This attempts to follow the narrative of the Disney version (too literally at times...the ""run screaming through the forest"" scene was so comical I expected Kristen S. to start warbling in a wobbly soprano...).For me the attempts at modernizing the familiar plot MIGHT have played better if the script had been less lethargic, mechanical, dull, and hysterically self serious...( everyone wanders around grimacing as if they were doing Macbeth or a cut rate production of ""Joan of Arc""...Points for daring to rip off ""Avatar"" and try to twist the old ""prince charming...loves first kiss"" bit...but it does not keep this form being overlong and dangerously close to being flat out boring."
507,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW: SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMANMINI REVIEW: It's Charlize Theron's movieRATING: Don't Waste Your Time (Rating System: See it in theaters, Wait for the instant download, Don't waste your time)Queen Ravena (Charlize Theron) is enchanted with the ability to stay alive and beautiful, so long as she has beautiful young maidens from whom to steal their youth. But if she can steal the beating heart of young and beautiful Snow White (Kristen Stewart), she can become immortal. But Snow White has escaped into the Black Forrest where the Queen has no power. So, she sends a dashing Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to find Snow White and return her before the Queen's powers fade. And we're off...""Snow White"" is a mess. We spend the first 10 minutes of the movie in a back story prologue that tells us how Snow White came to be and how the Queen took the throne, etc... For some reason, the Queen has locked Snow White (then a child) into a tower, rather than having her killed. Fast-forward to the day when Snow is 18 years old and finally escapes - that's when the mirror on the wall informs the Queen that Snow is the key to immortality and the Huntsman must retrieve her.This part of the film is all Theron's. And she is amazing as the evil Queen. The special effects they used on her allow her to grow old and young again right before our eyes. As an actress, this is pretty courageous work. As with her role in ""Monster,"" she allows herself to be seen as something less (far less) than perfect. Many actors would never allow their ""brand"" to be tarnished in this fashion. Hats off to Theron for a powerful, if over-the-top, performance.Not so for young Kristen Stewart. Stewart has hardly any lines in this story and her role is mainly to look both angelic and distressed at the same time. And she does it well. Likewise, Hemsworth speaks with a Scottish accent and does scant little talking in this film. He looks both buff and wet most of the time.So, if there isn't a lot of dialog for the leads, what do these people do? They walk a lot. They walk through the dark forest, they walk through the Faery forest, they walk through the Snow forest. A lot. They also spend time in a small village of women whose huts get burned down - both for no apparent reason. Perhaps just because director Rupert Sanders thought would be interesting for it to happen.Don't despair, there is comic relief in the form of seven dwarfs. These aren't the dwarfs of Disney fame. Alas, they are far less interesting.Finally, Snow White becomes Joan of Arc. She dons chain mail and armor and leads a battle against the Queen.One final note: Why are there so many archers in movies this summer? Since ""The Hunger Games"" we've seen archers in ""The Avengers,"" ""Snow White,"" and the upcoming ""Brave.""Sadly, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" won't put an arrow of love through your heart. If this was supposed to be Kristen Stewart's opportunity to shine outside the ""Twilight"" franchise, she failed. Also, this movie is strangely graphic - possibly too much so for younger children. Not so much for blood but for lots of people getting stabbed or killed. But nobody really ever dies, they usually turn into shards of black glass.So, for a movie that is dull, plodding, and pointless. I recommend you don't waste your time."
508,"OVERALL: After watching this version of Snow White, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. I hope that it could do more, more like the LOTR; but it just fell flat all the way through the end of the movie. There is no climax, just a flat story...ACTING: Charlize Theron is remarkable here, but I think her acting talent is wasted here due to the flat storyline and little character development. Much can be achieved with her if she is given more screen time. Nevertheless, she is the show stealer! She commands your full attention whenever she's in the scene and you'll miss her whenever she's missing from the scene. There is not much to say about the other main actors. Kristen Stewart is still in her Bella's mode here and Chris Hemsworth is in his Thor's mode.VISUAL: The strongest and the best thing about the movie is the visual. You are treated with lots of eye-catchy environments; on par with the LOTR's visual. ACTION: The action scenes are mostly shaky and left more to be desired. I felt a little bit dizzy watching them. The last battle scene was supposed to be epic but it was rushed; making it less epic and totally lame for a climax.SUMMARY: Like I stated earlier, this movie is flat. It could be better if it was provided with more interesting sub stories, character developments and an epic climax. But still, I learned a lesson from watching this movie. True beauty comes from within..."
509,"The one big drawback of this film was the casting of Stewart as Snow White, who despite being surrounded by the impressive talents of McShane, Hoskins, Winstone, Frost, Marsan, Jones, Harris and Gleeson was unable to deliver a performance worth watching. I was sorely disappointed by how flat and uninspiring she was. It shamed the fantastic work by Theron and Hemsworth, who both brought a depth and realism to their roles that grounded the fantasy elements and made them seem believable. The worse moment came when Stewart attempted to move and inspire a crowd to rally behind her, she was so limp and unimpressive that it brought the momentum building to a screeching halt; Made all the more noticeable because it came on the heels of an unexpected, yet very touching moment of vulnerability by Hemsworth's Huntsman over the sleeping Princess. Luckily, Theron's deeply flawed Queen, played with enough humanity that you actually felt for her more than a little, got things back on track. I found myself rooting for the evil Queen to rid us of the insipid and mewing Stewart, who played Snow White, basically, as Bella dressed for a Renaissance Fair."
510,"I took my fianc√©e to see this movie at her request and honestly I wasn't expecting much, even though I had heard many good reviews of the film. Overall I liked the movie, the writing was a nice call back to the darkness of the original Grimm tales and for the most part the acting was good. Most of it, not all. Our evil Queen and our heroic Huntsman were well cast and excellently played, the queen's brother did a good job and the dwarfs likable. The thing that ruined this film for me was Stewart as our heroine. The girl really needs to learn how to emote, she had her ""deer in the headlights"" look on through 90% of the film only breaking it on a few rare moments and not the ones you might expect. Other than the dismal performance by Stewart, the only other complaint was the excessive use of ""shaky-cam"". Like the Hunger Games this film uses that method of filming far too much. It gave me a headache after a while."
511,"Snow white and the huntsmen is a good movie with cool locations,good costumes ,magic ,comic moments and some good fight sequences.Charlize Theron has done a wonderful job as the evil princess.Kristen Stewart also has done a wonderful job as Snow White. Chris Hemsworth has done justice to his role but could have done better.The First half of the movie is really good ... but the second half fails to meet the expectations given by the first half.The best part of the movie is the wonderful and colorful set and the 'magical' experience the movie providesAll in all it is a good movie which will take you to different world and is definitely worth a watch.."
512,"As a ""fairy tale twists"" fan I am mad that this movie got a green light and I get even madder when I see so many good actors gone wasted.The special effects were good,not superb,just good.And that was pretty much what gave this movie something to brag about.As far as the storyline/plot/script there was no twist to be seen for miles except making snow-white hold a sword.Pretty sure that this was not on the fairy tale.Every other attempt to add some mystery,suspense or plot twist failed to the level that can be considered non-existent.And there comes the second part of my rage: ""Why would anyone hire so many good actors and make them work as extras?"" ,cause to me that is what they were,a rich background that did not serve its purpose since NO character was built or ""brought to life"" in that movie.But let's pretend for a moment that the storyline had a chance to make such a movie happen,""actor"" Kristen Stewart surely killed it. There is no movie,excluding animations,bearing a bit of emotion that this woman should be allowed to be a part of since she can't show any kind of facial emotion than apathy.This movie does not need a sequel,it needs a REBOOT!!!"
513,"I've got to admit, this was an interesting film. But, like many others, I was absolutely confused about what was going on in the film: who was this boy, and why was he wanting to be the princess? Yes, she ruined. A no talent hack who is neither pretty nor English. All the awkward face-shots of her half-dead smile, ugly, bucktooth. I thought of Snow White to be at least good looking. And the acting, don't even get me started. Fading in and out of an American accent didn't keep me focused on what I was watching. Maybe that would be the reason why she didn't have much dialog in the film.If anything, Paris Hilton would of made a much better Snow White.What were the producers thinking when they casted her? I guess pop culture got the best of them. 20 years down the road, theyll be looking back at this film and saying ""oh thats that lously film with the Twilight chick in it. You know, the one who got more credit then she deserved."" If it weren't for that I probably would have watched this again. I'm gonna give it 1/10 just to spite her. Keep your face in them ridiculous Twilight films that only young girls of the iPhone generation watch."
514,"Like everyone else- I was suckered into seeing this by a really fantastic trailer. However, all the elements that made the trailer so interesting were completely lacking in the movie. The CGI/special effects, of course, were absolutely astounding. I mean, almost every scene was breathtaking in it's own way. You could never say that this isn't a visually appealing movie. However, that is the only aspect of this movie that is worthy of praise. The acting, the dialog, the pace; all of these aspects are completely thrown away in an attempt to make a pretty movie. In fact, some scenes were laughable at best. At the end, Snow White must rally her troops behind her. Kristen Stewart merely shouts at these men, and more than a few people in the theater laughed at her attempt at acting. It's understandable to cast for purely marketing reasons, but don't force the audience into watching a sub-par actor. Let her be a fixture in the background- pretty but silent.Even Charlize Theron, who I've always had faith in, fell short in her character. Her depiction of the Queen was stilted and mainly turned into her just screaming at characters. Or by herself. Then, they place this really beautiful plot piece in our midst and eventually just abandon it midway through the movie. I'm talking about the driving force behind the Queen's hate for men. I mean, they just added that in for the briefest of moments. Then, it falls by the wayside. It's almost as if someone sold an okay script, and then someone just decided to cut the script in half and hope that the audience won't notice. Given that the movie received applause at the end ... they were right?All in all- this movie is visually stunning. If you don't mind sitting for two hours wishing that it was a silent movie. Or maybe an hour long fantasy nature-documentary."
515,"This is truly a really awful film. Has nothing to do with any fairytale. It think they raped the well-known fairytale story with this deeply disturbing garbage. There's is NOTHING to enjoy, just fighting. LOUD music, no nice characters. Nowadays there are lots of such films but none pertaining to have something to do with a fairytale. If you are expecting anything like in a fairytale you will be as disappointed as I was. This is a ghastly film to avoid as the ones who will like it are the sort of people I would never want to know in person. The whole mood is dark and frightening, whereas any really fairytale has something to enjoy for all ages. This one will frighten all children."
516,"SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN There have been battles in the past of same theme movies. There were dual Bonds, dual space invaders, and dual Earth crushing asteroids. Each time, there has been a clear cut winner. In this spring's battle of Snow Whites, SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is far superior to MIRROR,MIRROR, making it the New Age interpretation of the fairy tale. But, that title may be won by default simply because MIRROR, MIRROR was too eclectic.SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is methodical. Editor Conrad Buff IV, who has THE LAST AIRBENDER, SHOOTER AND TRUE LIES to his credit, tries to pace this film as best he can, but the script ties his hands. I am happy he added the IV to the end of his name. He didn't use it in his other films, and frankly I was getting a bit confused between him and Conrad Buff III. First time screenwriter Evan Daugherty demonstrates his inexperience in movie scripting by penning staccato segments. Previously, he penned short films and the transition to full length movies is not yet a comfortable one. Time to have coffee with Syd Field. Likewise, first time Director Rupert Sanders is uncertain how whip up everything into a free ride, so audiences must sit through ""actionus interruptus"" far too many times. Greig Fraser, who offered amazing cinematography in LET ME IN, is the best technician here. His shot angles and sequencing assist when the others falter.The actors help. Chris Hemsworth is the Huntsman, and basically playing Thor in Robin Hood garb. At least once, they should have handed him a hammer. It would have been worth the laugh. As it is, he swings a large axe through most of the picture. Kristen Stewart is Snow White. There are actually a few scenes where she exhibit some acting talent lurking behind her doe eyes. Charlize Theron is devilishly delicious as Queen Ravenna, though she spends so much time in hag make up, one must wonder what that mirror on the wall sees in her. Finally, in a move sure to anger the Midget Actors Guild (MAG), full grown stars are inserted into the roles of the seven dwarfs. They include: Nick Frost, Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan and Ray Winstone. The CG effects are good, but at times it's too obvious other actors are standing on risers.Sometimes, it's a hindrance to be in the film review game for so long. (I can't believe I actually wrote that) It's rare a film can offer sequences that are not purloined from a previous endeavor. For example: in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, Queen Ravenna utilizes the finger and palm technique to destroy an enemy's heart. This is taken directly from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM. One could almost hear ""Kalimahl"" being uttered in the background. When Bob Hoskins declares: ""Do you see? She is the one!"", it hearkens back to Laurence Fishburn stating the same thing to Carrie Anne Moss in THE MATRIX. Queen Ravenna surrounds herself with black ravens, working a spell of magic that is reminiscent of Christian Bale's Batman using black bats to make an escape from a surrounded building in BATMAN BEGINS. She sucks the youth from her victims in much the same manner as Anna Silk in LOST GIRL. And, there is the scene of Snow White visiting the God of the Forest that is stolen almost verbatim from PRINCESS MONONOKE. The only difference is green fairies replacing the Kadama. The fairies are cute; the Kadama are better.All told, SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is not a bad view. It shows some promise for the folks making their feature length debuts and even a glimmer of hope for Stewart in the acting department. The movie just takes itself too seriously at times, when it shouldn't.THE RATING FOR SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN = C -30-"
517,"In the past I have prepared for films I wasn't sure about by not expecting too much, and for the most part it has served me well. In this case however there was no expectation low enough to pleasantly surprise me. This film, like the entire Twilight saga, which I was dragged to watch by my ex, seems to be just a long series of vehicles designed to show off a pretty face with absolutely no acting ability what so ever. Whoever thought Kristen Stewart was deserving of a shot at acting needs a lobotomy, and whomever keeps giving her staring roles need to be sterilised for the good of society. This film had numerous great actors in it, Charlize Theron, Bob Hoskins, Ian Mcshane, Ray Winstone to name a few. However, it's hard to overcome the enormous drag factor of a main character. Especially when it seems the director is in love with the long boring shots of her which seem to have no purpose other than to send the audience to sleep, which also plagued Twilight. I gave this film 3/10 purely for the effort made by the rest of the cast and crew, but in reality it deserves a 1."
518,"Elaborate, though derivative, CGI cannot rescue this meandering film from its risible, cobbled- together script. In the course of the shambling plot, the by-the-numbers screenplay mechanically runs through every emotional device known to Hollywood - but totally without conviction. In the final scene, even the actors seem at a loss about what is supposed to happen next, and the routine rising fourths in the score seem uncomfortably ill timed. The sorry project grinds to a halt with the love interest still awkwardly unresolved... unless the film's makers plan a sequel, from which curse, heaven protect us all!At the premier in London, Charlize Theron - an intelligent woman - seemed oddly uncomfortable, and look as though she did not want to be associated with the rest of the cast. Having seen the film, one can now understand why."
519,"I want to start off by saying that Kirsten Stewart at least got a little better, a little more passionate by the end of the movie. She was the wrong choice for the role of snow white. That girl always looked like she was trying to remember her lines (what little lines she had) she's kind of a mouth breather. But oh, Charlize Theron, yet again, you literally gave me chills! This movie is absolutely worth seeing just for the beauty and imagination that went into the visuals of this film, and Charlize's performance which was absolutely 100% spot on. The other characters were alright as well. Not a whole lot of character development, or passion as a whole but there was enough I guess. It really was Charlize that stole the show though. She was the best villain I have seen in I don't know how long. I would NOT want that woman after me! If she wasn't believable as being absolutely, terrifyingly evil, the film would have actually been an average shallow visual spectacle, nothing more. The guy that played the brother Finn was the only one that I felt actually met Charlize's passion about being evil. The good characters in the story really didn't match the passion about being good, as the baddies were about being bad. Frankly I am surprised they lost. Again, Snow White started to get passionate at the end. However by that time, her weak, blank-looked, mouth breather character had already been established, and so her pre-battle speech was a little unbelievable."
520,"Snow White is the daughter of the king but shortly after her mother dies the king goes into battle against a strange army. He is victorious and 'rescues' a woman who was being held captive; he rapidly falls in love and marries her¬Ö that night she murders him and takes the crown. Snow White is imprisoned in the castle. Years pass and as Snow White comes of age the queen is told that by taking Snow White's heart she will gain immortality. As her brother goes to get Snow White she escapes from him, gets out of the castle and flees to the Dark Forest; a mysterious place full of danger. Her pursuers lose her so the queen acquires the services of a huntsman, promising that if he brings Snow White back alive she will bring his wife back from the dead. He manages to catch her but soon learns that the queen can't deliver on her promise so he switches sides and helps her flee. After a number of run-ins with the Queen's brother and his men they are captured by a band of dwarfs. When they realise who she is though they pledge their allegiance to her. They are later joined by William, a childhood friend of Snow Whites. Snow White determines to take the fight to the evil queen and claim the thrown that is rightfully hers¬Ö it will be far from easy though.I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much from this; I only bought it because the DVD was in the '20p box' in a charity shop¬Ö perhaps because of these low expectations I was rather pleasantly surprised. While it isn't gory there is a surprising amount of impressive battle action and there is frequently an oppressive tone; especially during the scenes in the distinctly creepy Dark Forest. The film looks really impressive with some great scenery and the special effects are of a high quality making fantastical creatures look real. Kristen Stewart does a solid job as Snow White; playing her more like Joan of Arc than the familiar Disney version of the character. Charlize Theron puts in a delightfully over the top performance as the evil queen and Sam Spruell is suitably menacing as the Queen's brother, a creepy character whose relationship with his sister seems a little too close at times¬Ö although I may be reading too much into that having watched too much 'Game of Thrones'! The rest of the cast are pretty solid; the dwarfs are made up of a number of well-known British actors who provide some laughs without being relegated to mere comic relief. Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin are decent enough as the Huntsman and William although at times these characters feel a little bland compared to the others. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those looking for action is a fantasy setting; it is a bit too scary for younger viewers though."
521,"The movie has a nice story .. some good actors and some better actors but Kristen is not even close to be one of them , for the love of god those dwarfs act better than her , even that poor girl in the cell the two scenes she did equals the entire movie of Kristen .and oh my ... Charlize Theron WOW she is an amazing masterpiece and it is always a pleasure to watch her do evil , she is the only reason i watched this whole 131 minutes of this extended version , besides she is so beautiful i just love watching her .Do not waste your time watching this movie , unless you are a Charlize Theron fan ."
522,"This film tells the story of an evil queen with unearthly powers. The evil queen kills the king of a kingdom and imprisons the young princess. The princess escapes and seeks revenge, with the help of a huntsman and various clansmen along the way.Maybe the presence of Snow White in the title misleads me into thinking this is going to be a more cheerful film. I find ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" very unrelated to Snow White, and I wish there filmmakers didn't make that connection with Snow White. I find the film dark and eerie, especially the dark forest scenes which are understandably rather unsettling. The woman playing Snow White goes against all stereotypes of Snow White, hence I had much trouble in relating to her and her story. The huntsman's unusual accent doesn't help either. In short, I found ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" rather boring and less than engaging."
523,"I think the best thing to do with this film is to go into it with low expectations. I'm no fan of Kristen Stewart and am getting pretty fed up with Hollywood milking every conceivable old story (and now fairytale) and repackaging it as something new (I've already watched and hated their adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood).So, it was fair to say I went into Snow White and the Huntsman not expecting too much. And, for once, I was pleasantly surprised.For a start, Charlize Theron carries the film. She seems to love being deliciously over-the-toply evil as the nasty Queen and Thor (sorry, Liam Hemsworth) is an excellent leading man (if, at some times, a little too similar to his Hammer-wielding alter ego). The dwarfs (who come into it about half way) are also quite amusing and, by the time they do come into it, add another dimension to the film.I've never read Grimm's original Snow White. I've only ever seen Disney's classic cartoon adaptation, but, amazingly, Snow White and the Huntsman follows the story pretty well. The only (slight) drawback is Kristen Stewart who, despite her best efforts, still seems to come across like Bella Swann in different clothes.But, if you forgive her (and can believe that a supposedly magical 'all knowing' mirror would claim that Kristen Stewart is 'fairer' than Charlize Theron) then you should be able to enjoy the film. It's certainly different enough to the animated version (I certainly don't remember any mutant trolls and fairies in the 1930s version). In fact, Snow White and the Huntsman comes across more like a Lord of the Rings entry than a fairytale, but, in my opinion, that's no bad thing.Snow White and the Huntsman makes up for the travesty which was Little Red Riding Hood and I now hope that the upcoming Sleeping Beauty live action remake (with Angelina Jolie as the evil witch) will be half as good as this."
524,"I don't think the movie was bad at all, it just had one major flaw being snow white herself. Seriously, is that the best they could do? The queen is way more beautiful then snow white it. There is something very wrong with snow white. We are supposed to love her, being stunned by her inner and outer beauty. But we're not. The queen is stunning, snow white is only so so. She has no outer beauty. I did not like her either, there's something which makes me dislike here.... a lot. As for inner beauty, again, not there. Somehiw you get the feeling that there is something, dark and sinister about this snow white. She sure isn't the innocent character we expect to be.While most character are chosen very good, the main character destroys the whole movie.... wrong choice."
525,"SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is the second of the recent big budget Hollywood adaptations of the fairy tale, following on from MIRROR, MIRROR. The good thing is that it's better than the previous one I saw, although it swaps the terrible Julia Roberts for a wooden Charlize Theron and replaces the not-bad Lily Collins with the one-expressioned Kristen Stewart.The good news for film fans is that this one goes for an action-adventure look and feel, although that doesn't mean there aren't some drawn-out moments and attempts at a sappy love triangle (inevitable, given TWILIGHT actress Stewart's presence). There's a fair bit of action thrown in along the way, and while the choreography is poor, at least it all looks quite nice; the set design in particular is inspired and as a whole the movie has a colourful and vibrant feel to it. A shame then that the movie is saddled with an actress who looks like she's sucking on a lemon throughout and whose idea of emoting seems to be in sticking her jaw out.That doesn't mean the film's not without problems, though, particularly the needless presence of CGI armies who seem to have been shoehorned in from some LORD OF THE RINGS movie. The mirror isn't a mirror any longer, either; it's now a golden T-1000 with a black man's voice, which is quite bizarre. On the other hand, the best thing about the movie are the dwarfs, who are a bunch of British character actors shrunk down by CGI; we're treated to the presence of old reliables like Ian McShane, Ray Winstone and Eddie Marsan. Towering above them all - figuratively - is the late, lamented Bob Hoskins in his last screen role, although there's a touch of the tragic about seeing him so aged and frail-looking (even though he is a dwarf), a mere shadow of the powerhouse actor he once was."
526,"I loved this movie. For sure, it is an updated version of the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale of Snow White. The update is innovative and on-the-mark, making it a fairy tale for our time. Kristin Stewart did a great job, creating a character that is both tough and vulnerable, believable and inspiring. Charlise Theron, in turn, pulled off a very evil queen. The rest of the acting was also very good. But the real reason this movie is a success is this: The purpose of fairy tales is to inspire us, to help us be more conscious, to give us the strength to carry the torch of goodness and wisdom through our lives. This movie actually succeeds at being that type of inspiration, and that is no easy task. For shining that kind of light in our sometimes very dark world - Thumbs up!"
527,"This is a very entertaining film,lots of action,chemistry between the actors and a little magic thrown in,but why didn't the makers of this film,employ real Dwarsf actors,instead of casting Ian Mcshane,and Ray Winston,it doesn't make sense. It's not like Mcshane and Winston,are, struggling actors,and really needed the work. It's like going back 40 years,when you had the likes of Jack Palance or Rock Hudson playing a American Indian But if you liked the story of Snow white you'll love this version,I just wished the ending had a little more closure,I would definitely,watch it again. It would be interesting if the makers of this film did a similar version for Cinderella."
528,"A film that relies very heavily on special effects and I think it's because of this that it doesn't quite work. I never see it as a good sign when there are more than two writers and there are three in this case. I generally means that the studio has had more than a passing interest in the mechanics of the storytelling (never a good sign). What you end up with (as in this case) is a film that looks very good, but usually has little, or no, substance. Yes, Charlize Theron is pretty good as the evil queen, as is Chris Hemsworth as The Huntsman; sadly the same cannot be said of Kristen Stewart. Don't get me wrong, I rate her as an actress but she just doesn't have the screen presence to carry off this role. I give her full marks for effort, but, for me at least, it didn't quite work. Over all, the film only got interesting when the dwarfs turned up and that was an hour into it. I think for the sequel (yes there's a sequel in the works) they'll have to put a lot more work into telling the story and a little less into making it look good on screen.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (¬Öbut only just)My score: 5.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
529,"Considering that other classic stories have been successfully turned into adult movies, like ""Red Riding Hood"" and ""Hansel & Gretel"", I thought maybe the famous white snow fairytale would be convincing as well. And it is. From the get go, spectator slightly remembers every situation of the classic story, even thought there's been years without seeing the original film again. At first sight we believe it's going to be actually SCARY, but it is not-- unlikely the other movies I mentioned above. Other than that, cast isn't anything phenomenal-- in fact, performances are sometimes weak, mainly Kristen Stewart's. Charlize Theron plays a terrific witch, don't get me wrong, but sometimes she seems to be out of her character. Action scenes, special effects and photography direction are great, providing spectator an entertaining time. Forest scenes are beautiful and pretty nostalgic. All in all, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is another grown up fairytale to entertain all ages."
530,"Hollywood loves new ideas or even better, old ideas without back end deals made shiny new again. So in 2012 we have two ""Snow White"" movies, the light hearted ""Mirror Mirror"" and the grittier, down and dirty subject of this review.Ravenna (Theron) is the oh so beautiful wicked witch who has tricked her way to the throne, by dispatching the king and all hope throughout the land. Requiring regular top up's of youthful energy to maintain her looks and youth for all eternity.All is well, for Ravenna and her incestuous brother Finn (Spruell), although conversely life is not so good for everyone else, as the land dies and the populace starve and darkness falls ""across the land"".A ray of light flickers in the form of Snow White (Kirsten), the daughter of the slain king, locked up in a dank and dark prison after being separated from her high born childhood friend William (Claflin). Finally wising up to the fact that Snow White could both save or destroy her, Ravenna's sends her besotted brother to deliver Snow White to her. Finn however, mistakenly allows her to slip through the castle defences into the ""Dark Forest"".A guide is required to track Snow White, he will be ruggedly handsome, melancholy with the loss of a loved one and initially drunk most of the time. Cue ""The Huntsman"" (Hemsworth), wise in the way of the woods and fighting but rather naive is most other regards.Will the princess be restored to power, will the witch Queen bind the land in darkness, will dwarve's be involved. Yes, probably not and most definitely, in that order.The film commences with a well played prologue, the set up, initial fleeing and chase are visually arresting. The film establishing itself as ""Lord of the Rings"" (LOTR) lite. Obviously director Rupert Sanders channeling his inner Peter Jackson to middle of the road effect. Some sequences are lavishly filmed with stark bright colours and attention to detail but on occasion the tone is all wrong and tension dissipates. The effects, unusually created by many disparate special effects houses, are uniformly cutting edge, a bridge troll a notable stand out. The film benefiting greatly from high quality effects and the costumes are also worth noting, the budget is certainly on the screen to see.The acting is variable, Chris Hemsworth manages to carve a believable rugged character and Spruel manages a fine line of 12 certificate malevolence. Theron is impeccably dressed and plays to the fairy tale aspects well enough, most original tales skewing much darker in reality than perhaps we remember them. The weak link unfortunately, is our ""Twilight"" star Kirsten Stewart. Whilst fitting the bill from the looks department, she also appears believably down and dirty where required, however many lines just come tumbling out like an early script read through.Whilst Hemsworth and Theron can take rather weak lines and invest some gravitas, Stewart drags the believability back to zero every time she speaks. Clearly in this company her acting ability is shown up rather badly. The director has also taken an interesting approach to the dwarfs, allowing top flight actors to play them through CG trickery (similar to the upcoming ""The Hobbit""). We are treated to Ian Mcshane, Nick Frost, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones and even, in his last pre-retirement film role, Bob Hoskins. Whilst these sequences could have fallen over badly, in a Star Wars Ewok way, it actually works quite well.The sequence in the fairyland however brings proceedings to a screeching halt and may have your average 14 year boy target audience running for the exit. This highlights perhaps the biggest flaw, who is the movie for? Too scary for young children but not hard edged enough to be a LOTR contender, constrained as it is by a 12 certificate requirement.Overall then, a film that is largely good fun with some fine scenery chewing from Theron but uncertain of it's tone and with a weak central protagonist. Of course, much of this will be overshadowed by the ""affair"" between the married director and lead actress, which is perfect gossip mag fodder but ultimately the film must stand by itself, which it does but only just.With a $400 million take on a budget of $150m, clearly the film found an audience. Whether even Hollywood can squeeze out a sequel from a story with such finality, remains to be seen.Summary Uneven, fun in parts but ultimately a mildly disappointing LOTR wannabe.Enjoyable enough romp but is somewhat undone by a poor performance from the lead and some questionable directional tone choices that could have made for a better film Cautiously recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
531,"This was one of the most anticipated movies in 2012 and with reason. It credits some of Hollywood's big names such as Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth but still got very mixed reviews from critics. Charlize Theron does a phenomenal job in this movie and almost makes it hers. She managed not to be absorbed into the wonderful use of effects and technology. Kristen Stewart's acting is intriguing most of the time however does not make the audience relate to her character. Snow White did not manage to become the blood-line of the movie. Chris Hemsworth did a great job but his character stayed too mysterious throughout the whole movie and didn't develop very well for a main character. However, the script of this movie(which is not very flowing in itself) fails to maximize the potential of these actors and seems to forget that the characters are human. It had all that one would expect from such a high budget film with a very appealing concept which is a thrilling twist on the Snow White tale. Despite this it lacks emotion which is not cold; the actors had to constantly play a part which is fueled with anger and revenge; love on any level was very dry and unfounded. The plot is way too dark for a very long period of time. Anyone would expect a happy ending in such a movie and while it did somehow have one it was a high anti-climax in comparison to the rest of the movie. Taking all this into consideration, it is still very enjoyable to watch but don't be fooled thinking that it is a movie for kids just because it is about Snow White. The effects are stupendous and even with a poor script the actors did a marvelous job most of the time; there were times when the acting was either over or under done. One must keep in mind that these actors shot a big part of the movie with less than half of the stuff that appears on screen; it is all added later so it becomes more a challenging acting job. Its biggest pro is that while watching the movie you are taken into a different world that leaves you feeling satisfied despite not leaving a big impact on you afterward. All in all, I give this movie a '7' or a 'B'. It is definitely worth watching especially if you are into the world of fantasies, but will not be the first priority for most people. Despite making you think it has all the ingredients for the fairest movie of the year it seems to miss the highly essential basics!"
532,"I'm a big fan of epic films with a huge cast and mid-evil castles. I was very impressed with the quality of the production you can see that a lot of thought process,and planning went into this film. Charlize's performance in this film deserves an Oscar every scene was from the fountains of her heart,and because of this I watched Snow White twice. I am proud of Charlize being a South African and love her too,I hope she gets more roles like this.Overall, this movie lacked a hero who could face the evil queen and give her a tough fight to the death.I think Snow White was no match for the queen and it was disappointing to see how she easily killed the queen, that's a low point that could have been avoided with the Huntsman assuming that role."
533,"The beginning takes a while to get going but other than that I thought it was good and I never liked the fairytale and hopefully directors will produce more films like this! Don't be put off by the slow start it will get better. In my opinion I did not like the queen at all I think that it was all tried so hard to get lines right and screaming out words that you can't understand. But the dwarfs I thought were absolutely brilliant, yes I agree with Warwick Davies that it was unfair that they didn't use real dwarfs but I get bored with seeing the same old faces when people are playing dwarfs. I think that they shouldn't do it in ever film but one in a while will be a good change. Overall slow start got better later in the film. 7/10"
534,"it merges the well-known fairytale ''Snow White'' and the epic style scene of ""the lord of the rings"" into this fantasy film. As we all know, the evil queen is still the evil one but with more powerful and horrible spell, she leans on taking away others' youthful life to maintain her young and beauty. At the same time, the prince is a bowman who is not that charming and not the true love for snow white... no surprising, the huntsman is the sterile true love... coz he is the one who can revive snow white from being dead...while the snow white is a very tough warrior, she kill the queen at the end and regain her throne~ I have to say, overall it is quite a freshening story, but I will only give it 6 points for a little bit bland...not enough blood, fighting, killing, goo or even romance."
535,"""Snow White and the Huntsman"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Mild Language, Mild Sexual Innuendo, Violence, Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hr&07mns.My Take *** (Out of ****) / 7/10 on the IMDb Scale ""Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? Please stand up?"" I know, I know. To quote the lyrics to an Eminem song isn't the normal way to start a film review. But it seemed relevant in the case of ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Here is a film version of ""Snow White"" unlike any other before it. Though the 1937 animated Disney film became the popular version of the Snow White tale, it is not the definitive story. In fact, there isn't one. Can the real Snow White please stand up? I don't think she can.There are multiple versions of the Snow White story throughout Europe. The generally accepted fairy tale was added to a collection of stories by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 (which was also revised for later editions). Despite the differences in the various tellings, there are common aspects to the story. These elements include an evil queen, a magic mirror, a poisoned apple, dwarfs, haunted forests and a potential suitor for our fair maiden. Is she fair? In ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" she's more like Joan of Arc crossed with Aragorn from ""The Lord of the Rings."" Given her iron will, maybe she's more like an ""iron maiden""? ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" opens ""once upon a time"" with a beautiful queen admiring a solitary rose blooming in the dead of winter. She wishes to give birth to a child with raven's hair, fair skin and a fierce determination to live just like the uncommon rose. The queen gets her wish when Snow White is born. Tragically, as is usually the case in this kind of story, the queen dies and King Magnus (Noah Huntly, ""Your Highness"") and young Snow White are left without her.A few years after the queen's death, the marauding Dark Army, comprised of supernatural glass soldiers, attempts to overtake King Magnus' kingdom. After Magnus's soldiers defeat the Dark Army they rescue the beautiful captive Ravenna (Charlize Theron, ""Prometheus""). Magnus is so enamored with her loveliness and beauty, he marries her the very next day. To his horror, Ravenna is the dark sorceress who commands the Dark Army. She deliberately plotted to get into Magnus' marriage bed to murder him and overtake the kingdom as the new queen of the land. The queen imprisons young princess Snow White in a tower, with the people believing her to be dead. The kingdom is no longer peaceful and prosperous it once was, but now dark and grim. The land becomes harsh and haggard under Ravenna's reign.Flash forward 10 years. Ravenna has remained young though her witchcraft. She is able to suck the lifeforce from fair maidens to maintain her radiance and beauty. When she asks her magic mirror ""Who is the fairest of them all?"" she learns that Snow White (Kristen Stewart, ""The Twilight Saga"") has the ability to destroy her. This will not do.Snow White escapes into the haunted forest where her pursuit is halted by the forest's treacherous nature. The queen's lead henchman and brother, Finn (Sam Spruell, ""The Hurt Locker"") recruits a drunken widower (Chris Hemsworth, ""Thor"") to track Snow White for them. Not liking the arrangement, the huntsman decides to aid Snow White in her plight.Snow White is determined to defeat the tyrannical queen and restore peace and order to the land. Many people are willing to take up arms for the cause. This includes some fairly handy dwarfs who are experts in guerrilla-style combat.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is director Rupert Sanders' film debut. He got his start directing television advertisements, including one for the video game Halo 3. He doesn't hold back in creating a dark foreboding atmosphere for a majority of this picture. The cinema-photography is brilliant, yet so grim and colorless it might turn some people off. Nevertheless, it is stylish without going into cartoonish territory. Snow White's world, though make-believe, feels real and lived in. The clothes and the sets are believable.What really captured my imagination was the enchanted fairy forest. For me, this sequence was the crown jewel of the picture. The animals, the foliage and fairies are presented with such a vibrancy in stark contrast to Ravenna's kingdom, I felt like I was watching a completely different movie altogether. This is easily the most fully realized storybook forest I have ever seen done in a live-action movie. The last movie to come this close to achieve this was Ridley Scott's ""Legend"" (1986).There is no doubt ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" looks great. CGI helps tell the story, but thankfully its use doesn't go over the top beyond what it is needed for. In fact, the whole picture has an old-fashioned quality to it. The tone and the pacing are on par with the sword and sorcerer pictures from the early '80s. This might be distracting to some who want their movie action to come a little swifter. The movie takes time to set up the characters and develop the background stories for them, their lands and their goals. This adds a dimension to this tale probably not previously seen in the movies.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is the second Snow White inspired film to be released in last three months. Both are live action pictures with alternate spins on this familiar story. I speculate the property is being revisited in 2012 to commemorate the 200 year anniversary of its inclusion into the Grimm's fairy tale anthology. This new film is an interesting take on Snow White, though the pace might throw some people off. Nevertheless, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is nicely crafted and tells its story well."
536,I enjoyed the 'evil' queen played by Charlize Theron. Her portrayal of 'Ravenna' was one of the better parts of this movie. CG effects seemed well done. Battle scenes were filmed with cameras that couldn't hold still which I didn't care for. In 'Private Ryan' battle scenes were filmed in somewhat the same fashion but it was from a soldier's frantic viewpoint and so it worked in that film. The romantic 'tension' just wasn't there in this film in my opinion. Snow White didn't radiate a want or need for the Huntsman throughout the movie. It was somewhat predictable in places. I've seen worse movies than this. I was entertained but I'm not jumping up and down with enthusiasm about it.
537,"The dark version of the fairy tale was entertaining, and well acted, for the most part. Since the Twilight movies, I always expect Ms. Stewart to bring her scenes down, but I saw emotion in her face this time, and I was pleasantly surprised. She actually added something to her scenes, until she opens her mouth. Why can't any of her directors get her to slow her speech down, ENUNCIATE, and put some acting into her acting? There are always a minimum of two sentences in each of her movies that are completely intelligible.For example, at the end, when she says the line, ""only by pure heart's blood is it undone"", or some such, and I thought to myself, now wouldn't that whole climactic scene have had such impact if she had actually said it slowly with the import it was meant to carry? Also, someone needs to tell her to square her shoulders and carry herself better, especially if she is playing a princess with right on her side. Just stands to reason. She's lovely to look at, but aren't they all? Suque into Charlize Theron. I cringed every time she said an ""r"" with her manufactured accent. Espectially since she had to keep referring to Snow White saying ""gull"" for ""girl"", and ""ha"" for ""her"". I could have done without that, otherwise she is an actress that does not disappoint.Also, the final scene was too ambiguous. When Snow White locks eyes with the Huntsman at the end of the hall and he is detached from the crowd, after their eyes meet, he should have either continued to move away, or joined the crowd, so we the audience would have an inkling of what their future would be. It was an exciting adventure though, and I enjoyed it."
538,"What a great story. The visuals and cinematography were terrific. The actors knew their parts well. Outstanding performances from Charlize and Chris. Kristen was good but needs to keep her mouth closed more and find a different stressed or depressed look. It's the same in all her movies. She's too much of a contemporary actress so many scenes she did didn't fit in that time era. Her laugh was too ""today"" and should have been more of a jolly laugh of that time. I know she is passionate in her work but she needs to find ways to express different emotions. I was really hoping this would show her range but I guess she has no more range."
539,"Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho and it is off to review, 'Snow White and the Huntsman', I must go? With a name like that you would think a guy would be too bashful to go and see it. OH NO! Not me! I was not bashful at all. This is bad since I can't use all the 7 Dwarfs' names (The Disney version) so sorry sneezy. I am happy to say that this was one of those movies that had the potential to really shine, and in some cases, the brilliance was blinding. For an example of bedazzling excellence, one only needs to watch the queen. No dopey performance here! I have to admit I had no idea that Charlize Theron was such a master of her craft. I mean I was never sleepy. I always thought of her as one of those up-and-coming starlets who depended solely on her physical attributes ‚Äì and very little else ‚Äì well doc, I am here to admit I was so wrong. She played the no-good-rotten-evil-but-drop-dead-gorgeous-nasty queen-who-eats-hearts perfectly. I will never take a nude milk bath ever again. She played her part so well I was throwing pretend popcorn at the screen. I know it sounds dopey, but she did that good of a job. She was so good, I now have to go back and check out her other roles. For the other characters, what happened? I do not know if it was the handling of the other cast members or what. Kristen Stewart, a brilliant actor in her own right, did not fit the part or the part did not suite her ‚Äì whatever it was, something did not click. Her roll just seemed kind of empty or pointless. She needed to be the star. I am not saying she had to fly or perform deafening hung-Du kicks (there is a lot more to being a strong woman than superhuman tricks). Something was definitely missing. Anyways, I would have thought Anne Hathaway would have been superb for this part, but I hear she was catting' around somewhere (this is a joke ‚Äì OK). Now Chris Hemsworth was definitely the right choice ‚Äì but that goofy accent and that 'Mr. Nice Guy' behavior ‚Äì what gives? I think the accent was supposed to be some kind of a Cornish-Scottish-New York-Aussie mix, or something. Whatever the twang was supposed to be I think it definitely did not help his character. The man does not need some phony accent. He has such a powerful persona on screen that maybe they should have put a wig on him and made a different flick titled, 'Thor-white and The No Good-Rotten-Evil But-Drop-Dead-Gorgeous-Nasty-Queen-Who-Eats-Hearts.' OK, maybe that is a bit much, but it seemed that the cast (with the exception of the queen) lacked definition. I might have said too much already, but another thing that could have done without are the flashy-shaky fight scenes. They hurt my eyes. The fairy or haunted forest scenes were excellent and the scenes of St. Michael's Mount ‚Äì excellent! But I hate going to a movie where my eyes are not allowed to focus. For the most part, I am happy I saw this movie. If it wasn't for the Ms. Theron, I would split the difference and give this venture a five. But that, ' No Good-Rotten-Evil But-Drop-Dead-Gorgeous-Nasty-Queen-Who-Eats-Hearts' deserves recognition."
540,"One star is taken away for the lack of chemistry between Snow white and her true love. And another for not being in 3D!... This film had memorable scenes that I think 3D would have beautified them even more so...Overall, this movie is awesome. I love the new dark twist to the snow white story. This movie gives us a chance to see inside the characters and how an evil queen had become so evil and broken. The film shows a fair development of how the true love aspect unfolds for Snow White and her true love. I hope my review was helpful. This is a must-see blockbuster for sure."
541,"Greetings again from the darkness. After suffering through the miserable Mirror Mirror earlier this year, my fairy tale palate needed cleansing. The original Brothers Grimm tale was actually pretty dark and first time director Rupert Sanders has some success going heavy into ominous with his version. The movie has some flaws, but is actually quite fun to look at.Early on, we get a taste of Charlize Theron as the wicked stepmother/evil queen. Her calm voice and unforgiving stare prove quite chilling and one of the best parts of the movie. The magic mirror (on the wall) shows signs of life and we understand quickly that this Queen's power will not be used for the greater good. The palace itself is quite a site and Snow White's escape provide us a behind the walls pass, including the medieval sewer system.My favorite parts of the movie are the foreboding Black Forest and its polar opposite fairyland. The art decoration for both is excellent and fairyland even offers a nod to the Disney cartoon version. Both sets offer some stunning visuals ... the forest ogre, the dwarfs and the white stag with a matrix rack. Ahh, the dwarfs. Can't have Snow White without them. This group (originally eight) have the superimposed heads of actors we all recognize: Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris, and Brian Gleeson. This camera trick allows us to connect pretty quickly with the group.Kristen Stewart brings her successful Twilight run to fairy tale land. She isn't given much to do other than fight and gaze. Her Joan of Arc look serves the film's purpose, but does any guy really think she is ""fairer"" than Charlize? Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays the titular Huntsman and serves the cause admirably, as does Sam Claflin as Snow's lusty, trusty childhood friend. Sam Spruell plays the Queen's henchman brother, but is most memorable for one of the worst haircuts in Hollywood history ... straight out of Dumb & Dumber.The battle scenes are well done, the soundtrack is not overbearing as one would expect, but there just seems to be something missing here. The film is fun to look at it, but just doesn't deliver on any type of emotional level. Perhaps the material is just too familiar after all these years of hoping the first bite of an apple doesn't render us unconscious."
542,"I will start politely and comment on the things that I liked about the movie. Some of the creative effects, that's it. Moving on. This is a review on the movie solely. I am not comparing or any other word that some of you will try and tag this review with regardless of what I say here. The movie starts off normally enough. A guy with a thick accent explains some story. A woman sees a rose and wants a pretty daughter after being pricked by the thorns of the rose and bleeding. Big surprise, she has the most beautiful daughter in all the lands. They did choose a very pretty young actress for this role. There is some boy that climbs in trees and bites apples that she is kind of friends with when they are at this young age. The king and the queen are both great rulers and the entire world is happy. A big winter comes and the queen ever so inconveniently dies. Sob, sob. The king goes into a depression and an unknown army declares war on his land. For whatever reason, he goes into battle, and engages this army he knows nothing about. He swarms these guys that look like they are plated in black kryptonite, with his army full of horses and cloth as protection. The krypto army doesn't budge as they swarm. Hint #1 they should get out of there. Or at least send archers or some other artillery to take a look at the field. Who sends an army instantly into battle after knowing nothing about what to expect? This guy. This guy does. After attacking some of the enemies they start busting into glass. Exploding and crumbling into glass actually. Hint #2 that they should maybe reevaluate the situation as a whole. But no, they continue to fight and die against this army of glass. So after losing whatever number of men and conquering these glass things the king notices what appears to be a gypsy's wagon. He goes inside and there is Theron balled up as a trashy slave with rice or compost at her feet. She has grimy hair, disgusting nails, dirt and muck all over her face and body, and a million other horrendously unattractive characteristics that would throw 96% of the male population into a state of limbo. But no, she is apparently the most beautiful creature the king has seen. He instantly forgets about his dead wife, the battle that he just lost, to question the shady looking peasant in a wagon, the men he just lost, and everything else that should be important right now. So what does he do after finding this stranger? He waits six months and marries her after finding out who she is. No, I'm kidding. He marries her the next day after finding her. The next day. The next day. Common. So they marry with no questions asked. Apparently the king's men don't question anything or have any influence or intelligence on the matter, along with the peasants and people he rules. After the marriage the king goes straight to his chambers to engage in a bangfest. Theron then gives some groaning speech about how she's made love with kings and they've all fallen and used women. While she is giving the speech she is doing what appears draining the life from him. Imagine that girl from X-men that does it when she touches people. The exact same thing. Effects and all. So as she is draining life she pulls out a dagger and throws it into his heart for whatever overkill reason she found necessary. After killing the king and everyone knowing it (or not) she somehow lets an army in that wipes everyone out in seconds. No questions asked. An army was just waiting outside without anyone knowing, then these guards willingly let the gates open, just because. Awesome right? So after the king's army is wiped out after 30 seconds of film little Snow White sees her dead dad with the dagger poking out of him. So sad. Theron sees her and says some words and Little White tries to run and escape. Her and the Apple Boy exchange some words and get broken apart in a ridiculous parting scene from one another. Afterwards Little White is captured and killed and the movie is over. Kidding, again. She is captured, but for some reason not killed. Even though it is made clear from the beginning that she is the most beautiful in all the land. And even though if someone is more beautiful than the gypsy with magic (Theron) she will die. She is captured and thrown into some high part of the castle. I almost forgot to mention the wonderful introduction of the magic mirror. After the king is dead, the army is defeated, and all that other stuff, the mirror is brought to the ""new queens"" chamber. This so called mirror looks like a giant cymbal to a giant drum set. In no way is this thing, by definition, a mirror. I don't know what the proper definition of a mirror is, but I hope it is not this. A brass looking over-sized cymbal. Theron politely asks the guards to leave upon placing the mirror down by saying ""out"", then .76 of a second later screams at the top of her lungs OOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean really, really screams. A shrieking howl that busted my ear drums for the first time. We are also now introduced to a pedopholistic looking brother of the woman. The haircut? Really? He also later does the soft and quiet ""out"", then screams OUT in the same manner Theron did. Also unnecessary and an audio level that greatly inconvenience my ears. Skip a mysterious number of years and the movie is back. --->Apparently I cannot write another review after this. So this is 1/1. Message me if you'd like the rest of this review. There is much more."
543,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Although I did enjoy it, Kristen Stewart really rubbed me wrong as Snow White. I do not understand the rave about her, the girl has zero talent and two expressions she wears throughout all her performances!! (enough already of the close up of her with the mouth half open, the vacant eyes and the two huge front teeth showing!)Charlize Theron was excellent! She brings depth and substance to her character, enough to care more about her than of Snow White! The Huntsman (too bad he doesn't get a name in the movie), played by Hemsworth is also, amazing in his part. His performance is excellent, very deep and believable.Stewart as Snow White is stiff, awkward and clumsy. She could have been Bella in a different outfit! There was nothing new to her performance. You do not feel for her, you do not connect with her. She is supposed to be life itself but she is dull and stiff. There is nothing inspiring about her...The movie had nice visuals but the story was a mish-mash of elements from other movies (Lord of the Rings comes to mind), with lots of gaps, leaving many questions unanswered whereas it seems to drag on and on at times for no reason.It's a nice movie, but the trailer and posters promise something that is not delivered. I think mostly because of Stewart's performance. Maybe if we had a Snow White we actually LIKED more...?"
544,"""Somewhere in the valley, there is a woman living in a basement. She's actually amassing followers. These people believe that she will actually lead them to salvation, or whatever. And yes, she's dangerous - but we have to see this thing through. All the way.""Peter Aiken (Christopher Denham)As co-writer and actress in Another Earth (2011) and now Sound of My Voice, Brit Marling seems to delight in ambiguity, be it transporting to a doppelganging other earth or playing a time traveler returning to recruit cult members and meet her mother. She has a Twilight Zone affinity for the ambiguous, a talent for teasing out the uncertain in daily living. She seems to be in love with possibilities which have no definite nature, just suggestions.Documentarians Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius) join a cult to produce a film that exposes Maggie (Marling) as a fraudulent cult leader claiming to be from 2054. Although the film has some of the feel of the current found footage craze (see Blair Witch, among others), it's a straight forward narrative broken into 10 chapters, each with a tantalizing cliffhanger quality that keeps an otherwise minimalist, budget production moving along.For instance, although the location of the cult in a basement is not cinematic pretty, the slow-pace and assured direction of Zal Batmanglij makes the narrative interesting enough to create anxiety about the fate of the protagonists.The sedentary presentation keeps Sound of My Voice from being compelling although the concept of time travel helps the time-travel gravity of discussion after the film. Even if a viewer doesn't believe in the sci-fi aspect, the thrust of the narrative from chapter to chapter and curiosity about the fate of the undercover journalists gives it a thriller-like storyline that covers over the weakness of the science fiction.Then there's indie favorite Marling. Whether she's writing or acting, she's a force in contemporary low-budget production. Very much of our time."
545,"Was Kristen Stewart really the best they could come up with to play Snow White? I felt she was completely miscast. She's supposed to be the most beautiful woman on earth! Charlize Theron was awful. She's a great actress, but in this movie she just whined and screeched, and her English accent was really atrocious. There are some excellent English accents out there from non-British English speakers - Gwyneth Paltrow immediately comes to mind - but Charlize Theron's was very poor. There aren't many action films I'll switch off halfway through, but this one I did. I'm can't help think of other fairy tales that have been turned into big-budget Hollywood films - Maleficent, the one with vampires and werewolves! - both of which were far superior to this effort."
546,"What is the different between this and ANY tween and twerp wish fulfillment fantasy out there? And I mean for both gender. The main character (which is Bella, NOT Snow White since it is obvious that she also had everything handed to her and not have to work for them) is just another damsel in distress and had to rely on the men around her for everything. Feminist? The queen is a hypocrite who killed and mistreated other women, and had a RAPIST brother. Snow White become the leader while not doing anything to earn the rebel's respect. How can a girl who was locked away for almost all her life suddenly became a general? And how did she win without any strategy, tactic or preparation? And somehow won the duel with some tiny training? How does she know how to rule a kingdom? It is painfully obvious that this is just another Twilight."
547,"The movie is a more epic twist of the tale of snow white. The movie starts as bad as it continues. Maybe I should start with the good bits of the movie. The visual effects were nice and I rather enjoys the more Gothic and horrorish parts of it, even though at some point they get too much that they get gross. Than again Chalrise Theron, Cris Hemswhorth and Sam Claflin are really good, especially Theron, and that makes it hard not to actually feel a little compiled to vote for her. And now the bad ones. I guess I should start with the obsession over Snow white's beauty, kindness, purity, spirit etc etc. They simply made her a saint, a supernatural human being to be exact, something that the script and the performance of Kristen Stuart didn't support. The whole story isn't that good either, and the epic battle was simply boring, and maybe too short. Finally, the love triangle between William, Snow white and Eric (especially Eric didn't even seem in love with her or even experiencing a feeling for her other than simply friendly affection) was really stupid. And so I give this movie a 2 out of 10."
548,"You've got a good recipe, fresh and good ingredients, to cook a delicious cake. You are about to cook it but someone tells you, suggests you, compels you to add an extra, powerful, expensive, attractive ingredient because they say the cake is gonna be even more delicious than ever and people would love it. That new ingredient is literally poo. So you add poo onto your recipe and your cake, of course, will taste as poo.The cake is Snow White and the Huntsman, that shitty ingredient is Kristen Stewart.Kristen Stewart has chosen her career very badly. She can't act. Her mouth is always open (maybe a premature sign of sinusitis) and her eyes, her gaze are completely inexpressive, in every single bloody scene. But she's undoubtedly pretty, very pretty. At least, she could be. She surely was in Into The Wilde.She reminds me Tori Black (and everybody knows what I am talking about), and this is the main reason why I truly think... Kristen Stewart could be a very good porn actress. Porn career is the right one for Kristen Stewart. I strongly believe in this. I really do."
549,"Started as an reminiscence of Kull the conquerer,the movie could have been handled with some good dialogs and screenplay but it didn't. This movie was based on German book named Snow-white with few twists inspired from other fairy tales. The movie set on sanctuary (home of the fairies) was top notch and the bgm to it added more charm. The costume design is such a sight.I hated Kristen Stewart's acting. I feel she doesn't show any sign of grief or happiness properly and felt constipated or something throughout the movie. The dwarfs were cool. Charlize Theron's (Ravenna) awesome make-up and her screen presence was the movie-saver.The movie features mild violence and few sensual scenes (too mild) so parental guidance is advised and children may enjoy the movie which was meant to be."
550,"I love the movie! I bought it on Blue Ray and every time I watch it I like it even more. The picture, the effects, the script the were fantastic!, in my opinion the cast were great!. I have to mention that Charlize Theron did an amazing job as a Ravenna. I am disagree with some people complaining about K. Stewart acting skills, I think she was perfect for that role. I am fascinated with her expressions in the movie. The end of the movie was just perfect, it makes me want to watch some more!!. I can't not wait to see part 2 of course with K. Stewart and C. Hemsworth. ""Love is in the air"" Mirror mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all?"
551,"Finally had time to watch it - this film is what I'd call a mixed beast.Set design and atmosphere are good (or excellent), Charlize Theron makes a nice villain, Chris Hemsworth as the grumpy huntsman is good too, and they handled the dwarfs in an OK manner. On the other hand, Snow White didn't look as beautiful as she should if we bring the mirror into it (why then bring it at all?); the introduction of a cruel queens' brother was totally uncalled-for, and the ending - after the queen was dead - was a complete cop-out. I thought: Now let's see her emotions and loyalties collide when she has to decide between William and the Hunter - and then the end credits started to roll. wtf?!"
552,"As a huge fan of high fantasy, I was looking forward to this movie. I just saw it on TV and now here I am with a review.Much like the best of anything from Hollywood in the last, oh, decade or so, this movie is good but could be much better. Like everything else from an industry with a hard on for CGI, it is assumed that pretty pictures will make up for sketchy plots, shallow characterizations, and lackluster acting. I must reiterate I am a huge fan of high fantasy and will watch a fantasy film even if it totally sucks, as long as there is plenty of swordplay and sorcery.Snow White and the Huntsman is the classic children's tale, but a bit darker. Actually, thinking about it, all the children's tales I grew up on were pretty darned dark and twisted to begin with- small wonder we grow up to be what we are. Anyway, simple plot. The movie is interesting but never really grabs my attention, never really offers anything other than some good CGI. And there are some great battles with amazing CGI monsters. But I don't care about the heroine. She is like so many other characters in films these days- shallow, one-dimensional, not enough time spent on the character's development, which in modern Hollywood always seems to take a back seat to special effects. One may take a very technically perfect, high-res photo of a dead dog on the side of the road, but it's still just a pretty picture of a dead dog on the side of the road. Long story short, I got distracted by something else for a good twenty minutes and when I came back to the movie I didn't care that I had missed twenty minutes of it.Five stars because it's really hard to screw up a children's fairytale."
553,"This movie was OK, but nothing great. Kristen Stewart just isn't great and has that same off look (like she smells something bad) on her face throughout the film. She plays Snow White whom has been locked up by the evil queen. The queen needs her heart to stay young, but Snow White escapes. She is aided by the Huntsman(Chris Hemsworth who was not quite as hot since he dyed the blond locks). The run through the dark forest and encounter a troll, the only thing they run into there. So the middle is them trying to get to the Duke's kingdom. They get help from the dwarfs and find William, the princess's childhood friend. Then there's the fight at the end and Snow White dishes it out to the queen.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but the story could have been better."
554,"I loved everything about this movie. It is definitely not the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs I saw as a child! Charlize Theron is unearthly and terrifying as Ravenna. The special effects are superb and well done, particularly the dwarfs.Unfortunately the biggest downfall to the entire film is Kristen Stewart. As side from her constant ""damsel in distress"" mode, her acting falls way short of everyone else's in the film. I'm sorry everyone; she just can't act!!! She barely pulled it off in the Twilight series, but she missed the mark in this movie completely. I feel they could have cast someone else of higher caliber with more years experience to play this part. If there is a sequel, I hope they consider another actress to replace her. Just sayin'."
555,"It surely wasn't the greatest idea to release two Snow White movies almost back-to-back. Even if they are different, it still will divide people or annoy them so much, they might not watch either. But of course they are different, this being a bit of a darker affair, that has other priorities. Mainly the Queen (Theron) and the Huntsman (Mr. Thor himself) are really looked at greatly. Which almost makes you wonder, if she shouldn't have been in the title too.I didn't mention the elephant in the room, the ""love thing"" (love triangle). No I'm not talking about Kristen having an affair with the Snow White director. No that shouldn't affect your judgement or liking of the movie. I'm talking about Kristens character again being involved in a love web, as she was/is in that other film series (you know what I'm talking about). It just seems weird. Than again, I'm sure it was added to make this even more different than any other adaptation up to this point. While I loved a lot of the changes this made, it still isn't the best adaptation out there. If you want funny though, go watch Tarsems Snow White"
556,"I only have two aspects of the movie I was disappointed in. There was a lot of camera work were the camera was shaking and the camera angels constantly moving. I felt like I was trying to watch the movie while going down the road, sometimes it even felt like was on horseback. I really found the camera work a problem. The second aspect I was disappointed in I can only remember seeing Kristen Stewart smile maybe once. The plot was awesome, I really liked this take on a story that we all know. The story also moved along and I was never bored. The special effects and musical score were perfect for the movie. I really enjoyed Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron performances and a lot of the supporting cast all performed outstanding. I found the movie very entertaining and worth watching.I would not watch it over and over but I do plan to purchase the blue ray when it comes out."
557,"This movie shows an evil queen, who takes over Snow Whites kingdom and wants to kill Snow White. After a narrow escape from the Queen's Castle, by Snow White, the Queen's brother begins, what appears to the viewer to be, an endless hunt for Snow White. Snow White shows cunning as she continues to survive the constant attacks against her. She is always on the run. She is constantly hunted. She continues to narrowly survive. As the damsel in distress portion of the movie dragged on, Snow White also begins to show a talent for getting people to change sides and aid her, even if they are about to kill her.Major Spoiler here - Within the last 15 minutes of the movie Snow White changes, and she gives a short but powerful ""Call To War"" speech. Considering the prior monotone performances of the actress who plays Snow White (Kristen Stewart), for me this speech was every bit as good and surprising as ""The King's Speech"".From this point, the movie finally becomes what many stated it was, a new twist on an old story, and an empowered version of Snow White. The hunted becomes the hunter. Snow White the warrior emerges and leads her newly inspired army into war against the Queen and her army."
558,"Sometimes movie ads can be insightful as well as deceptive. For instance, all of the posters, trailers, and hype for Snow White and the Huntsman reveals what‚Äîor should we say, who‚Äîit's proper star attraction is. Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth play the two titular characters, but it's plainly clear that the true marketing element of the movie is the casting of Charlize Theron as the cruel queen/sorceress persecuting our beloved Grimm brothers heroine. Miss Theron receives top billing in most advertisements, her image is printed upon more than half of the posters that I have seen, and her magnetic strength as a movie star will be undoubtedly what draws half of this movie's eventual profits. She is also one of just a few of the actors and actresses in the film who seem to care at all about what they are doing and how they are doing it.One thing purists will appreciate about Snow White and the Huntsman is the way it draws upon the darker, more grim roots of the original fable. Deservedly cherished as it is, Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, like many literature-to-animation renditions, used its source material simply as inspiration. This new film is gritty, visually striking, oftentimes unpleasant, and has very little sense of relief or happiness to be found. People are poisoned, have their life drained out of them via sorcery, half-drowned, and impaled with every sort of stabbing weapon from swords to broken tree stumps. Not many people know just how dark the original Grimm brothers fables were, and this film's hype campaign will surely fight against this unfortunate trend. Unfortunately, it's not that impressive of a movie. It contains very little sense of genuine terror and almost no majesty.Even though Charlize Theron, as the evil queen who desires to be ""fairest in the land,"" is the heart of the movie's campaign, she spends very little time on the screen. So there's where the ads are deceptive as well as insightful. So despite the fact that by the first 20 minutes, we know far more about the queen than about Snow White (Kristen Stewart), the majority of the remaining running time follows the latter. Snow White escapes from her demented captor and into the dark, twisted forests inhabited by carnivorous animals and man-eating trees. A huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited by the queen to tail after her, having been promised that his wife will be returned to him from the hereafter. Instead, as you would imagine, Mr. Hemsworth betrays the queen and instead helps Snow White across the landscape, eventually leading up to a big grand finale with the queen and her army. Where the movie ultimately founders is its level of involvement with the characters. There is very little. The screenplay presents very little personality for the Snow White character, and Miss Stewart's limitations as an actress prevent her from expanding upon it. Unlike most people, I do not believe that Miss Stewart has absolutely no future whatsoever as an actress, but she's got lots of room to grow. Playing the 'victim role' in every single movie is certainly not helping. On one hand, Chris Hemsworth, who is much more impressively personable in his acting style, does provide some interesting moments with his character, but they really do seem to come from his own personality. It's a good performance, but a forgettable character. And the dynamic between the two of this is so limp and predicable that it really meant little to me whether or not they escaped the queen's wrath or if poor Miss Stewart's heart was torn out at the end.The screenplay, written by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini, is a scattershot mess. The story leaps and bounds from one twisted location‚Äîand character‚Äîto another without a sense of adventure. A defining example is a group of peasants to whom Mr. Hemsworth and Miss Stewart flee for shelter. The sequence, which lasts the better part of 15 minutes, promises some interesting character dynamics not only between the two titular characters, but their relationship with some of the villagers. Chiefly, a friendship between Snow White and a little village girl: a dynamic that is never referenced or thought of again once the scene has passed. Also not in service of the movie is the directing by Rupert Sanders. The man has promise as a filmmaker; his film contains some very interesting shots. He seems to specialize in extreme wide-angles. Some of the best shots of the movie are early on, when we see Snow White being pursued on horseback by the queen's soldiers. His montage of the famous Magic Mirror (which melts down and takes the form of a hooded figure, not a face in the reflection) is also quite clever with the way he toggles between close-ups and long shots. But far too often, he pushes his camera lenses in too far, going for a sense of claustrophobia where it is not necessary. A potentially great moment where two archers square off with each other is missing a key shot that would have made the scene grand.But what I think I wanted the most from Snow White and the Huntsman was a sense of spectacle. Now there is a moment that does contain it. That is the famous kiss sequence‚Äîand if you do not know what I mean by this, remember this is Snow White, you've probably just spent the last 70 years on Mars. Here is the scene where the dialogue, the performances, the musical score, and the directing all come together and the effect is rather spellbinding. I only wish the rest of the movie were at that level. Unfortunately, Snow White and the Huntsman seems to have lost its ambition after the planning stage."
559,"As befits a film with three listed screenwriters, Snow White and the Huntsman is a lot of different things all at once. They don't all fit neatly together but enough of them work well enough on their own to make this a good motion picture. It's definitely one you admire more for those individual elements and less for the overall result. The big screen charisma of Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth keeps most of the mismatched pieces from banging into each other and Kristen Stewart again demonstrates what a wonderful young actress she is, even with this sort of lightweight material, but I'm not sure you can say she proves here to be a bona fide movie star. This movie also has the visual stylings of a big summer blockbuster but conducts itself with a deliberate pacing more akin to what we see in the late fall and early winter. All in all, though, it hits the mark close enough and often enough to be worth seeing.The story is surprisingly not that far away from the classic fairy tale or the Disney cartoon. An evil queen (Charlize Theron) seizes the kingdom by sorcery and treachery. She imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart), the slain king's daughter in a high tower until the day the queen's magic mirror tells her that Snow White is the only true threat to her rule. The young girl escapes into the dark forest and the queen demands a defiant huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to track her down in return for his wife being restored to life. The huntsman finds Snow White only to realize the queen lied to him and he and the girl, along with 8 dwarfs, set out to the castle of the only remaining noble who stands against the queen's rule. Yeah, that's right. 8 dwarfs. Complicating matters are the queen's twisted brother (Sam Spruel) in hot pursuit and Snow White's childhood sweetheart (Sam Claflin), now grown and also seeking his long-separated love.The disparate nature of Snow White and the Huntsman is nowhere more clearly seen than in its three major characters. While Stewart's Snow White has certainly been transformed from damsel in distress to Joan of Arc, she's still 100% fairy tale earnestness. She is pure and good without flaw, right down to a rapport with nature that positively Disneyesque. Theron's queen, while still evil, has been re-envisioned along feminist lines. Her cruelty and hate flow from her terrible abuse at the hands of men because of her beauty, a beauty she desperately clings to as the only thing which validates her existence. Hemsworth's huntsman is straight out of a sardonic take on fairy tale clich√©s. He's a wiseass who has no use for the pretensions of either Snow White or the queen. These three people should all be in separate films with different tones and ambitions. That they can share the screen as entertainingly as they do here is to the credit of these actors and director Rupert Sanders. This is the sort of thing that can just destroy a movie and they make it work with barely a ripple of trouble.The only real problem with this film, besides its somewhat ponderous tempo, is that it introduces two male characters to play opposite Snow White and is completely undecided about which of them is the true hero or her true love. Perhaps this maybe-love triangle is meant to be a subplot that comes to the fore in a sequel. In the context of this motion picture, however, it is unsatisfying.It's rare when you can say one of these FX spectacles is carried by the performances of its human cast. That is the case with Snow White and the Huntsman. From its leading women and man to the layered villainy of Sam Spruel to the actors reduced in stature Lord-of-the-Rings style to the 8 dwarfs, this film succeeds because the people on screen will it to do so."
560,"This film was good but not great! If your a fan of Kristen Stewart you will be disappointed considering she says barely 20 words in this film I don't think she was the best choice for playing the role of Snow White. Chris Hemsworth is fantastic again! Showing his brilliant range of accents as he performs as an Scotsman in the film! Charlize Theron is also great as Ravenna! Beauty and evil at its best. Overall it is a watchable film.Good : Chris Hemworth, Charlize Theron, Good battle scenes, Good special effectsBad : Kristen Stewart, Running time too long"
561,I've seen twilight and it sucks because of Kristin Stewart but we can sorta get over that with the fact that Taylor is so hot as is Robert. In this sorry Chris but you just don't make the cut because Kristen is just that bad of an actor. I would rather watch twilight with my ex than have sex with my boyfriend while this is playing it sucks. I started to laugh less than halfway through it which isn't good at all. If you want to watch something good or that may get two stars watch twilight. If u want to enjoy yourself then watch arrested development because it's supposed to be funny and you won't throw up in your mouth. Personally I feel bad for the staff at the theater when that came out there must have been A LOT of puke because everyone did it when they got home if they could make it out of their seat.
562,"Good production design, but the movie is boring. Good CGI (nothing amazing) but it's overused.And Kristen Stewart... man, it IS annoying to see her ""acting"" - she has this ""surprised"" look all the time - yeah, she's beautiful, but it's annoying after you see the same look for the ENTIRE movie. That's her role: Giving that stare/surprised look 90% of the time, with a few lines here and there.I'm a bit disappointed by Charlize Theron - she's OK but seemed more impressive in the trailer.Good production design, boring movie and 10 minutes of end credits."
563,"Rupert Sanders' Snow White and the Huntsman is a dull movie based on a classic Disney movie made in the thirties in which the original 1937 version ends up being manipulated with a very inaccurate and dumb story. The movie stars Kristen Stewart as princess Snow White whose mother dies in the beginning of the movie and gets imprisoned in her own home for several years until she finally gets freed form her own trap. The evil stepmother is played by Charlize Theron a great actress in a very crappy performance who is jealous of Snow White. There are only two things that I do like about this movies and that is the OK casting, the costumes and makeup, and there a whole list of things that i really hate about this movie and that is the acting, the screenplay, the photography because the movie is shot like a snow white video game, and before I even watched this movie I thought that it was interesting and looked good from the time when I saw the trailers for this movie, and after I saw it it was like wasting money to see a bad movie in a theater and getting no refunds after-wards. What a huge disappointment."
564,"First the people already do not look nothing like the characters at all, the acting was just dramatically horrible like their trying too hard to act out the lines, but i cant just blame the actors some of the lines were a bit awkward and corny i do not think anyone could act out those weak scripts anyway i can imagine how difficult it is to act those out. The story line is nothing like the original too many gaps and holes with no explanation why things were happening the way the were would of been consider okay if it was a low budget movie because that's how it felt. It was so many dumb parts in the movie that i disagree with i can see why people didn't like it this movie was pretty bad i was looking forward to seeing this movie because of the original but it was just all hype to get people to watch it and trick people out of their money, this was more of a money maker move then a passionate move they knew by them having so much promotions out of millions of people some will like it and just have enough people to like it to have a big profit but this movie is bad !"
565,"I could have ended my review with just the title. I hope this movie lets people know, Kristen Stewart can't act, she has the emotional range of Keaneau Reeves, which is to say the same as a box of rocks. One reviewer asked why does she keep her mouth open all the time. She's a mouth breather, if you don't know what that means, it's an insult, look it up on the Urban Dictionary, it describes her to a tee. Chris Hemsworth was tolerable. and only barely, but compared to Kristen he was a veritable Sir Lawerence Olivier. I am a fan of Charlize Theron and thought she did a pretty good job, not nearly her best work, but still good.The visuals as so many are today aided by CGI were good, some were even stunning, but a couple of stunning visuals hardly made this movie worth wasting 2 hours on."
566,"Kristen Stewart murdered this flick, literally... And it should be buried six feet under if it weren't for Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron (she was a really believable evil bi... I mean witch). I actually enjoyed the beginning and it got me intrigued because I thought this movie was going to suck to begin with due to Kristen Stewart. But of course, my initial thoughts were correct and the movie indeed sucked because of her (and the script to a small degree).Side note: The only movies I've seen where her acting was believable are Speak (playing a high school freshman who practically stops talking after being raped) and The Cake Eaters (playing a young girl with the rare incurable disease Friedreich's ataxia). If you do watch this out of curiosity... when Snow White grows up, stop the movie. If you continue past that point, think about the movie as if it were supposed to be a comedy, because I sure did get some good laughs at all of Kristen Stewart's parts (count how many scenes where her lines were just gasps or plain breathing)."
567,"This film was boring, and had the most anticlimactic ending ever. It seemed that all the effort had been put into a few cool special effects (mainly transformations) and I guess into morphing non-dwarf actors onto dwarf-actors' bodies and different age makeups for the queen. Snow White was totally uncharismatic and the subplot of the plight of the evil queen and her equally evil brother somehow didn't stir any emotions either.Also, lots of things that one loves about the story were simply missing and others changed beyond recognition/belief without no apparent reason.All in all, there are a lot of better snow white movies out there - stick with those."
568,"I just have to register an account here in IMDb and looked for the ""add another review"" for more than 2 minutes just to write a review of this movie.First of all I don't hate Kristen Stewart but her acting sucks big time! I didn't quite notice it while watching the twilight series but as I watched this movie, I realized why people kept on criticizing her acting skills and it's TRUE! She's emotionless, cold and again her acting SUCKS big time. They could have cast a better and more beautiful snow white than her. Her manly image doesn't fit the criteria of being the snow white of the film. Her complexion maybe white but her overall appearance just lack the character of snow white. It may be an action/adventure type of movie but she just doesn't have that ""IT"" thing to draw attention to the audience.Anyways, I idolized Charlized Theron's acting here and admired Chris Hemsworth's. They both helped lift up the movie but they weren't good enough to pull up what Kristen Stewart did. They could have done better."
569,"This movie has so much potentials yet Kristen Stewart's stoned and lackluster performance sealed the doom. The direction suffers greatly especially in the action sequences where the camera tends to zoom in too closely that the action was out of frame or too faraway that you don't feel the impact of a punch, etc. Hemsworth's tried his best mimicking a Scottish accent while Charlize screams and cries her heart out at every opportunity. Then there is the case in which the director can't seem to decide if he wants to shoot a fantasy or a realistic medieval war movie. The camera seems to linger on Snow White a bit too much. I don't mind this as she is at the center of the story except for the fact that all those years in prison had made her a drone who can't quite keep her mouth closed, and walked like a tomboy. She is without grace nor innocence and uninspiring. The dwarfs are great though, and the visual effects are amazing. Dare I say Peter Jackson and Weta could learn a thing or two from it. Costume and production design are superb. However, I get a strong sense that the director wanted to make a different movie; which should have been called Princess Mononoke."
570,"Let's see - who might that be? There is no denying that this visual extravaganza is entertaining - perhaps not for the interminable 132 minutes, perhaps, but turn off the brain and turn on the special effects monitor and the movie has its merits. After making it through this SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN it is rather appalling to see that there is in production a Part II coming. That bit of information deserves and OMG - why?The story as adapted by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini from the Brothers Grimm sounds rather straightforward in its altered state: Snow White, imprisoned daughter of the late king, escapes just as the Magic Mirror declares her the source of the Evil Queen's immortality. The Queen sends her men, led by a local huntsman, to bring her back. But upon her capture, the huntsman finds he's being played and turns against the Queen's men, saving Snow White in the process. Meanwhile, Snow's childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her.Bad dialogue for a cast that includes Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane , Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson (all fairly obscured by the lack of light and gruesome makeup) just doesn't allow this treacle of a story to get off the ground. Add to that the flat monotone Twilight girl Kirsten Stewart as the lead and the spectacular special effects become the focal star. Despite the silly lines given Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna she still manages to be the only character about whom we care - or even notice. This is a great way to spend a cooped in rainy evening when the other choices for On Demand are negligible. Stay awake for the special effects and you'll get you money's worth. Grady Harp"
571,"This is my first review though,because I feel badly speak for this movie. Looking at poster,there was at least 3 big names (C.H,K.S,C.T) but the story was so lame.. everything just ""predictable"". K.S definitely ruins other stars as she was the center of the story. It looked like Xena that have herself vasectomied. I think director need to change the story into full-comedy instead of twisted lauzy- tale trauma story. Don't waste 2 hour of your precious life seeing this. My deepest condolence for K.S career. I think shes better at jumper as cameo than this. Please think before you act(ing), for your own good. Per se.."
572,"A couple of months after I saw this in the theater, it came up somewhere, and to my surprise I had already forgotten that it even existed. Visually impressive, but very deficient in terms of storyline and character development. As a result, it just does not stick. The concept seemed a good one, taking a well-known fairy tale and giving it the dark, brooding treatment. But it needed to go all the way with that by sharpening the plot and really getting into the psychological gears of the characters. Yes, there is a little of that, but not nearly enough.The cast is pretty good, overall. The dwarfs are probably the film's single most bright spot, and not just in tone but in actual enjoyability. I do not know if Kristen Stewart can really be blamed for anything; she did not seem to be given much to work with.Someone, somewhere wrote that the ending was not ""earned"", and I completely agree with that. The film attempts to end on a powerful note, but to me it feels more like it is just grasping at straws; the real drama is just not there. For all of Snow White and the Huntsman's virtues, it is just not much of a real statement...of anything. Pity."
573,"This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time in the line of ""blockbusters"". Maybe it was the relationship between Stewart and the director or something but the whole movie was terrible. It literally had me falling asleep in a ""visually"" appealing type of movie and that's not a good barometer. I sat through Twlight, better than I did through this movie. The acting, the storyline, and the fluff within the movie that didn't need to be, left me feeling as though this one a movie that left me feeling dumber for having watched it. Thank goodness for Charlize's gorgeous looks and Chris' stage presence or this would have by far been the worst movie ever."
574,"I was not able to catch this movie during its local theatrical run. However, the trailer for this film looked very promising indeed. Some people also gave it positive reviews. So when this was shown during a flight home from Vancouver, I stayed up to watch it.We all know how the story of Snow White goes already. However, this movie interpretation makes radical innovations about its setting and design. This one had a ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Game of Thrones"" feel to its story telling and overall look. Unfortunately, the set design, visual effects and costumes are the best aspects of this movie already. The human element is sadly not up to par.Charlize Theron really over-acts as the Wicked Queen. This may be the director's fault though, than hers. She does possess that queenly glamor about her, so she fits the role to a T. Chris Hemsworth still has that gruff ""Thor"" look and aura about him as he takes on the very expanded role as the Huntsman. The role his character plays at the end is the only part of the story worth waiting for.And that brings us to Kristin Stewart as Snow White. I really did not expect her to be cast in such a role, but I was willing to give her a chance. OK, she can look really beautiful given the right camera angles. However, when it comes to acting, she really has very limited facial expression when she ""acts,"" basically she has a blank stare look or the constipated pouting look. When she gets up to rally the people to fight the Queen, that was her moment to shine. Unfortunately, her ""inspiring"" speech was delivered in a very awful unconvincing voice and manner. The ending was left hanging, and seemed to beg for a sequel. We all know know what happened between Kristin and the director Rupert Sanders, so that a sequel for this seems to be up in the air now. This scandal actually raises a serious question about Kristin's career after the last ""Breaking Dawn"" movie is shown next month, especially given the dismal artistic and personal behavior she has shown in this ""Snow White"" movie."
575,"**Contains Spoilers** The movie gets a 5 - not really deserving of a 5, but purely for the artistic work on show.I honestly thought this film was going to be, if not amazing, at least an enjoyable fantasy adventure....................definitely way off the mark with my optimism.Unfortunately, much of the problem can probably be found in the female lead - Stewart. Whether the emotionless acting is intentional, down to poor direction or down to poor acting ability is immaterial - she is supposed to inspire what amounts to an uprising (and there are probably more inspiring librarians than this).It's a shame, as her character plays against a beautifully visualised world - backed up by a strong cast of actors. But rather than complimenting the cast, all too often she seems to be supported by the cast - Hemsworth in particular making strong going at keeping the movie alive at those times.There are so many bad points in this movie, that actually make you laugh - which isn't a good thing for a film that's supposed to be...........well, not sure what it is supposed to be, as it seems to have borrowed (unsuccessfully) from many other films.So, the bad points..........1) Why on earth does everyone keep referring to SN as 'pure life' or other such nonsense. Throughout the film she does nothing to justify this high praise - just moves vacantly from one scene to the next.2) Why the 'Narnia' type moment in 'Fairy Land', where the white stag bows to her ? 3) How is the Huntsman able to find SN seemingly immediately he enters the Dark Forest.4) Why are there unexplained moments like where the Troll leaves her alone and doesn't just rip her to pieces ? I guess this is linked to bad point 1............she's probably pure life blah blah blah.5) The 'rousing' speech given by SN...........this is probably the worst motivational speech ever given, and has to be seen to be believed.6) Leading an army against the castle, even though she has zero combat experience - and hasn't even been seen learning how to use a sword.But these bad points aside, the really bad thing about this movie is you don't care about the characters.Hemsworth is about the only one who gives the film any gritty realism.............the rest of the characters just appear be cowards, happy to hide away from the evil Queen.There isn't even a sub story of an organised freedom movement - the Duke in the story is happy to stay sheltered in his Castle, seemingly never doing anything.And why they re-introduced 'William' - the childhood love interest is beyond me. Nothing against the actor, but the character adds nothing to the film - although it's probably meant to be creating a love triangle with the Huntsman, SN and William. Unfortunately that falls flat, as Stewarts character is so bad you couldn't tell if she even liked them.And the dwarfs...........why waste special effects on regular actors for this ? There are plenty of talented actors who play these roles, and could have done far better.As for the 'climactic' ending - pathetic. No heart at all (if you'll pardon the pun)..............and the crowning ceremony seems unfinished.Does SN go with the cardboard William, or does she go with the Huntsman. Long, drawn out and tedious ceremony with no pay off.Honestly, there's better acting and emotional range in Shrek - this film suffers greatly from having characters you couldn't care less about.Watch it for the excellent visuals, and listen to the excellent soundtrack............but don't expect to be satisfied by the actual story, or you'll be disappointed."
576,"Haven't you wondered what would happen if you bring in an age old fairy tale, add in glitzy effects, strain credulity in sticking to the fantasy storyline, and have the lead role performed by that star from Twilight who has a total of three barely distinct expressions to her acting career?No? Well, somebody sure did. And this somebody apparently was connected enough to pull together this deucy.It's a dark, gritty retelling of Snow White's fairy tale. It brings in murder, assassination, black magic, genocide, and other elements you may find missing in Disney's version of the movie. I think they were trying too hard to be clever with the plot - to have a symbolic equivalent to elements to the classic story. However, it wasn't really succeeding all that well. By the time they brought in the seven dwarfs, it felt so contrived that I was rolling my eyes.Now, I'm not saying Kristen Stewart can't act. No, if you have a movie with a character who is perpetually in the toilet, she's the one for you. She can and does bring that expression out in the best possible way. The only trouble is that she uses this same expression while fighting, crying, running and scenes of romance.Oh, and the movie was way way too long. Overall, I give a 5/10. And that's for the good production values in the movie."
577,"I got so fed up looking at her stupid face. She only has one expression throughout the whole movie. Which wouldn't be so bad, if it didn't involve her goofy underbitten mouth being constantly open, and one lazy eye pointing at her nose the whole time. Yet we are supposed to believe she is 'the fairest in the land'? Fairer even than Charlize Theron, who frankly makes Kristen Stuart look like Quasimodo by comparison.It just didn't work. I found myself wishing they could have cast someone like Claire Foy or Anne Hathaway, who could have carried this role properly, and might actually have done some acting. I just hope Kristen Stuart never gets trapped inside a wet paper bag.That aside, Chris Hemsworth does a fine job playing a smelly drunk homeless guy. I think he is also supposed to be some kind of hero, but that doesn't come across quite so well. He was probably too young for this part. The guy is 29 and he is meant to be playing a widowed ex-soldier. This part was really crying out for someone like Sean Bean. Apparently Viggo Mortensen (someone not unlike Sean Bean) turned the role down, which was a shame, but also a good call on his part, because this movie sucks.Charlize Theron is amazing and professional as usual. Her and the special effects team carry the whole movie. If not for them it would just feel like some straight to DVD trash. Ian McShane should get an honourable mention as leader of the dwarfs, it's a shame he didn't have a bigger part (ho ho ho). Most of the dwarfs were decent in fact. Apart from Bob Hoskins who just played his usual cockney self again, but he was supposed to be playing a wise Gandalf type character, so the end result was awful.I hate to draw parallels between this movie and Twighlight, but it seems like this movie was targeted at the same demographic as Twighlight, and I expect casting Kristen Stuart was a symptom of that, trying to cash in on some of that Twighlight publicity.If you did like Twighlight, then you will already be familiar with Kristen Stuart, and you probably have no taste, so I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this too. If you thought Twighlight was stupid and annoying I'm afraid you will probably feel the same way about this.If you really love fantasy and fairy stories then you might want to check this out too, but don't expect too much. How much you are able to put up with Kristen Stuart will probably be the deciding factor. I would suggest watching the movie on something small like a laptop or a phone, so you won't be able to tell how cross-eyed she is, that could help a lot.This film could have been so much better, it is probably a 5.5/10 but Kristen Stuart makes it feel more like a 4. I would like to give it an even handed 4.5, but I will be generous and give it 5/10."
578,"This isn't as bad a film as some of the reviewers would have you believe, even if it isn't great. The cinematography is stunning, and worth the 2 hours by itself. Kristen's Snow White is fairly one-dimensional, although she certainly looks the part. Her performance doesn't really have much of a character arc, she's the same from beginning to end. Liam is great as the Huntsman, it's the best part I've seen him act yet. Charlize pulls off the Wicked Queen in memorable fashion, fabulously costumed and just this side of insane. I'm not sure what the point of her brother was supposed to be. His presence didn't really expand on the story, although it could have so easily. We all know the story, and it's nice to see this version darkened up a bit, but overall the script isn't a grabber. If you're watching it at home, you won't miss much if you wander off to grab more popcorn. There are worse ways to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."
579,"This is not your average ""Disney"" Snow White, this is a darker and a violent version of the tale which is too scary and intense for children.Seeing the bad choice of Kristen Stewart, I thought that with the small hype that surrounded the movie ""in the form of a good story"" before release would compensate any shortfalls from Kristen... I was wrong.Apart from the emotionless acting of Kristen and her bland face ""a friend who has never seen Kristen act before even noticed this"", the story was weak and felt non-satisfying and the directing felt lacking too.Even the ""good"" performances of Charlize and Hemsworth could not save this movie.Excluding the few intense thrills and action scenes, do not expect much from this."
580,"A disappointing attempt at an original adaptation of a classic tale.Poorly cast and directed. One does wonder why anyone thought this concept would work in the first place!?The only redeeming feature was the quality of the post production, but thinking how much that must have cost only appalled me further.I can honestly say i preferred the Disney version, at least snow white was hot in that.The Twilight bint is truly awful and has got to be one of the most over rated actresses on the planet. I tolerated the Twilight series but cannot imagine even the most loyal fans could genuinely say this film was worth their time or considerationI'd avoid at all costs..."
581,"what can I say. I very much enjoyed this movie. the story as we know it, with lots of twists, great visual effects, lots of action, minimal amount of kitsch equals a great experience.needless to say Kristen Stewart is a really bad actress, I remember seeing the trailer a few months ago wondering why she was casted. today, we all know why (just read the tabloids). but despite of her performance, the director still managed to create a great movie. I must also mention that Charlize was freaking awesome!. I hope Kristen watched and learned. the dwarfs part was also great. like I said, the movie takes the story as we know it and puts many twists on it. big like on my side"
582,"Honestly, I entered the cinema expecting high expectations of this film and was left quite disappointed to some extent. To start of, nearly every character portrayed had no inner 'character' or was portrayed well. For example, Snow White was emotionless, William was dull, the Huntsman was aggressive for no reason and just swung his axe at everything. I also felt that characters acted without reasoning which made the storyline confusing. There was really nothing to the storyline, it was the basic escape, hide, fight, win with no inner content or romance. Everyone had different accents for example, the huntsman was Scottish? That didn't add up... And the ending was a complete failure. First of all there was a section where the huntsman declared feelings for Snow White even though in my opinion he was too old for her (and needed a good shave might I add), but then Snow White didn't go anything about it? Plus during her coronation at the end there were 7 dwarfs even though one had died? Did the director forget or fail to explain it? It was also stated that one of the dwarfs was blind but then he fought in the battle which was confusing.How can one fight if they are blind? Overall, I was highly disappointed. x"
583,"I have watched Snow White and the Huntsman and I must say I was totally amazed and entertained by the dark and gripping approach of the said fairy tale. They really did a fine job escalating it to a new level. Many breathtaking scenes and wonderful views, the fancy dwarfs served as comic-relief for the film, while the two handsome actors did a great job Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin ‚ô•. But who really stole the show was Charlize Theron as the evil witch- queen Ravenna her jaw-dropping intense performance plus the use of realistic CGI on her scenes really emanated the evil magical darkness in her portrayal. In disparity, my only qualms here is the lackluster, emotionless performance of the leading lady KStew, whose only saving grace is her beauty much like the very character she portrays, I find that ironically disappointing. Well, nevertheless I am still recommending the movie to be watched by everyone, if you still hadn't. ;)"
584,"Fact: Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT is better than SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN. But why I just compared Rupert Sanders' (Rupert Sanders who?) take on the classic tale of ""Snow White"" with a Peter Jackson movie that nobody has seen already? Well, because of two things mainly; first is the fact that I didn't know a thing about ""Snow White & Huntsman"" (I never watched a trailer or anything from it) so I was totally surprised to find out that this is pretty much a Middle Ages/fantasy picture, with stuff like swords, archers, war horses and (of course) dwarfs (all of these elements clearly reminded me of Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS masterpieces ‚Äì hell, some dwarfs here even look like Jackson himself!). And the second reason is that ""Snow White & Huntsman"" didn't raise the bar in a considerable way for the upcoming Middle Ages/fantasy movies, so you can easily tell that THE HOBBIT will be this year's real deal. But it's certainly kind of unfair to compare this new version of ""Snow White"" with something from the director of the big and great LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy; I mean, ""Snow White & Huntsman"" isn't great, at all, but it does have some enjoyable things. I had no desire at all to check this one out, especially on the big screen, but some weeks ago I went with my family to the cinema without a specific movie in mind and this was the next movie playing so what the hell, we thought. I can't really say it was a pleasant surprise since in the end I'm not going to recommend it to you; nevertheless it was better than what I expected and, like I said, I could enjoy some stuff. What kind of things I did enjoy? Well, the Middle Age setting is quite good, with some great landscapes. The idea is having our main characters, those from the title, finding different creatures during their journey in the forest. Talking about the principal roles, well, the TWILIGHT girl does a decent work as the princess Snow White (I mean, she is not terrible!) and that THOR guy is good as the huntsman ‚Äì I liked the introduction to the huntsman character since it reminded me of Brad Pitt in SNATCH. Also, I didn't realize, until my cousin told me, that Nick Frost (yes, the same one from, amongst others, HOT FUZZ and PAUL) is one of the dwarfs! But the main problem of this film is that only after some weeks of watching it I don't really remember that much about it; I mean, it's simply not a very memorable one. For instance, there's a part when our main characters run across a troll. It's a cool kind of thing and the troll looks quite good but the overall sequence is just nothing to die for (we a very disappointing conclusion for the troll, to be more specific). Or just take the thing with the dwarfs: yes, it was sort of refreshing when they appear but is there any memorable dwarf? Not really. And I do think people remember the dwarfs from the Disney version of ""Snow White"", for example (I have yet to see that version! Shame on me!), or the great Gimli from THE LORD OF THE RINGS! So yes, is time for me to check out that acclaimed animated version of this famous tale. *Watched it on 21 June, 2012"
585,"If you are happy with a lengthy film that starts off promising, progresses slowly and ends up frantically cramming as many inaccurate and cheap references to other stories, then this one is for you.If there are hubble bubble toil and trouble ingredients for a film, this one can be compared to a new chef's idea of what tastes nice. A rushed mix of cheap tear-jerkers (unknown, undeveloped character dies and audience expected to cry while sad music plays), canned, stereotypical funny but idiotic pair of dwarfs, and some okay-ish graphics (hoping the 3d improves them perhaps).If you like this one it's just you stating that you are OK with formulaic, poorly thought out films."
586,"It occurred to me whilst viewing SWATH that director Rupert Sanders would be excellent at making music videos and television adverts; such is the absorbing and unique imagery he concocts on screen. Wikipedia would have me learn that he does indeed come from a commercial background and that this is his first feature film, with a budget of approx $170m no less. Perhaps he should've stayed in ads. For this fairytale blockbuster may boast striking CGI and cinematography, but it's mostly lost on a waffly story and unmemorable characters. Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth are passable as the titular duo ‚Äì here re-imagined as a strong-willed heroine and a drunken widow respectively ‚Äì but the collection of renowned British actors (Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Nick Frost) playing the dwarfs are disappointingly unfunny. It's Charlize Theron as wicked witch Ravenna that provides the most entertaining performance; she snarls, screams and ruthlessly murders with a vicious glee that adds a spark sorely missing in scenes without her. Unfortunately even Theron can't prevent this from feeling like a missed opportunity ‚Äì a bolstered narrative, better comedy sidekicks and 20 minutes shaved off the runtime would've done the trick though."
587,"The biggest problem I have right now is I don't know how to fill in 10 lines on a movie that was quite dull. There were many problems in this movie- To start with Kristen Stewart cant act. The movie played out many clich√©s. I almost threw up when Kristen Stewart calms the Troll by her ""warm"" gaze. The fact that Kirsten Stewart was special and had a pure heart was rubbed in again and again and again. The plot was barely believe able -> For one Charlize Theron wants to take Kristen Stewart(Snow white) alive so that she can have her heart, but for some reason she showers her with arrows when Kristen Stewart decides to attack the fort. Not much thought was given into the plot.There were many boring dialogues and chemistry was glaringly absent. Also, Kristen Stewart can't act."
588,"Now after seeing the trailer for this movie I was a bit hyped. Wasn't like ""this is a must watch movie of the summer"" or anything like that but I was expecting a good movie. Two Snow White movies came out this year, one being ""Mirror Mirror"" this one was the obvious choice. But it just wasn't good as I thought it would be. It's turns out this movie is mediocre at best, it was just dull most of the way through. I am not sure if this is a alternative telling of the fairy tale or how this fairy tale was meant to be in the Grimm's fairytale telling. The movie just feels dry and generic and very narrow all around. If you seen the trailer you can probably summarize the whole movie. The casting was good though, not a fan of Kristen Stewart but she was decent in this. And her facial expression matched the surrounding of this movie and because of what she went and goes through. Chris Hemsworth is just the right huntsman but nothing stands out about that character. Charize Theron as Queen Ravenna is probably the only interesting character in this movie but even than she doesn't stand out that much or is all that memorable. I did like how the movie sort of delve into her past and background slightly. But didn't go all that far with it either or did it in a very articulate manner. There is obvious plot-holes in this movie as well. I just didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining. It isn't a terrible movie and some of the visuals are nice but that is about it. For the budget this movie had I was expecting something a bit epic. Even the final battle is easily forgetful.4.8/10"
589,"I really, really wanted to like this. I *really* did. The trailer looked good, I was even okay with KStew as the lead choice for Snow, but right off from the start I was unhappy with the film, and I lay the entire blame on the writers.Yes, I'm biased; I admit that. I went with my boyfriend and friend; my bf and I were ready to walk, she loved it. This film is definitely a genre-based film that some will love and others will hate. My suggestion is to wait until it's on PayPerView or Netflix and watch it then instead. It's not worth seeing in the theatres.**BEWARE: BELOW ARE SPOILERS**Visuals: Probably the best part of the film. The costume design was absolutely gorgeous for the most part (gripe: Snow had grey coloured trousers on underneath her dress. Really?). Theron's costumes as Queen Ravena were beautiful, as were the differences in costume between her army and the 'good' guys.The set locations were nicely done as well, the interiors and exteriors of both castles were rustic and not overly opulent. The on-location locale was nice too. Story: This is where the film lagged. Seriously lagged. The beginning 10 minutes was a mishmash of incoherent prologue, with voice over narration of the original Grimm's fairy tale. But because the scenes were shot quickly and jittered between takes, it was difficult to really get a sense of what the film was trying to say at the beginning other than setting up who Snow White was supposed to be. Instead of a VO, we should have begun our story with Ravena as a child, then Snow White's origin. That would have removed all of the VO.From there, I counted no less than 5 other films where there were direct scene rip-offs. Okay, so it's hard to come up with an original idea in film and TV and books -- I understand that too, but when you're writing a REMAKE of a FAIRY TALE you've got everything pretty much handed to you on a silver platter! Let's add in William (who's NOT a Prince, he's a Duke's son, if we're getting pedantic), the archer a la Robin Hood; the Huntsman, whose background we don't really know and without knowing much are expected to truly connect with him as the possible tri-love interest for Snow; the Queen who wants to be immortal and eats hearts and blood; the giant stag who represents the forest and nature, like in Princess Mononoke...It was really hard to get into the story of this movie, just for the sake that I had very little interest in what happened next, especially when they changed the love interest angle, completely deviating from 'Snow White'. They might as well have called this movie, ""Susan and the Huntsman"" because there was very little Snow White references other than the 'blood/hair/skin' part at the beginning and continuous motif.Characters: Snow White: much cuter as a child. Grew up. Became religious, apparently as she said the Lord's Prayer. Said she can't kill anyone. Then became enraged, had a personality transplant, and screamed for the murder of the Queen. Yeah, it confused me too.Huntsman: I adore Hemsworth, but the writing here really sucked for him. He was reduced to drunken talented axe-swinger who had to have his character development explained. Ouch. William: Why were you even in this movie if they weren't really going to use you?The Dwarfs: See above. But even more so.Ravena: Probably the best role, although her whispering of ""evil intentions"" got really annoying after awhile. And at one point she looked like Voldemort.The rest of the cast: negligible. You weren't needed.Overall, I only give this film a 5/10 because of the visuals. I can't believe there's going to be a sequel -- what could they possibly write and have her conquer next? Unless she's the immortal one now... ooooo..."
590,"Well I just saw Snow White and the Huntsman today with one of my friends and my older sister. I had been anticipating for this movie to come out in theaters for months and it is all because I love Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron! The film started out good and I was getting really into it, until the dwarfs' part came and that's when things started to fall apart a little. I was expecting more than what I got from the trailers, but felt a little disappointed. If they come out with an unrated version, I would be happy to watch it because I know that there were some stuff edited out due to the time limit. Kristen Stewart was...well just herself, however I did see a slight improvement in her acting. Chris Hemsworth was still his good-looking self, but I don't know what kind of an accent he was trying to pull off and wished he stuck to his Australian accent. Out of all the characters, Charlize Theron's evil Queen Ravenna was pretty much the best and I wished they would show more of her. Besides hating Ravenna, I actually loved her! The guy who played Prince William was good, but he wasn't in the movie that much. On a positive note, I loved the music by James Newton Howard especially the ending song by Florence and the Machine :) The cinematography, CGI, and setting were pretty impressive. Snow White and the Huntsman was an alright film but not the best. It's still a ""see it in theaters"" movie and if parents are planning on taking their kids to see it, please beware that there are a few scenes that maybe a little disturbing."
591,"Pros: At no time was the movie dragging. The story was constantly moving forward, they spent enough time with each and every character to build enough emotion to connect. The experience didn't seem over two hours, and as they say, ""Time flies when having fun"".Fantastic acting from Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, and all the DwarfsSpecial effects and scenery were greatCons: Kristen Stewart had so few lines that you wondered if they were hiding her acting ability....Snow White Should be more beautiful than the wicked queen, and she isn't, in fact she is dirty looking and depressed nearly 70% of the movieIt was confusing having the Huntsman break the queens spell, even though his entire character was made on his love for his dead wife, making it seem that he didn't want Snow White in that way... making William, the one who did want her, not her true love.... yet the queen used William's appearance to seduce her.... They made the Duke seem weak, and they cheesily tried to have a ""Braveheart-esque"" speech"
592,"As one of the most cinematically adapted fairy tales, it is no surprise that 2012 has three contrasting versions of the same story. While there is absolutely no point discussing the third and B movie version of Snow White (ironically starring Eric Roberts), it all comes down to a showdown between Tarsem Singh's comic version and debut director Rupert Sanders' dark, gritty and grim version (excuse the pun). Even so, there is little comparison between the two as both movies are totally different in every aspect of their making.Narrated by the titled huntsman, the story begins like any other Snow White adaptation. Snow White, the precious daughter of Queen Eleanor and King Magnus, has lips red as blood, skin white as snow and hair black as night ‚Äì making her the fairest in the land. The story takes a dark turn after the Queen passes away and the king marries again. The marriage is short-lived when the king is murdered by his new bride, a sorceress calling herself Ravenna (Charlize Theron), whose magical mirror promptly announces her seizure of yet another kingdom, while also confirming her beauty par none. Years later, this delusion is shattered when Queen Ravenna is told that her beauty and powers are fading and can only be replenished, albeit infinitely, by consuming the heart of Snow White (Kristen Stewart). The new queen deploys huntsman Eric (Chris Hemsworth) to capture and bring back Snow White, thus begins an epic yet enchanting tale with a fresh new twist to a classic old yarn. Clearly, there is a whole world residing between the recent and lighter version titled ""Mirror Mirror"", and this darker and often brutal narration. Although contrasting in nature, both films are inspired by the same fairytale but share a common thread ‚Äì prominence given to the false queen by way of her destructive presence in an otherwise prosperous and happy kingdom. While Julia Roberts' characterization results in consistent levels of slapstick comedy, Charlize Theron brings out the queen's evil essence; at least in theory. This is exactly why ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" differs from all other adaptions thus far. By its nature and making, this latest version is evidently not for 10 year olds and below, and is nowhere near in narration or presentation to the 1937 animated classic. Thanks to screenwriters John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) and Evan Daugherty, the story here is captivating with first-time director Sanders giving it a visual appeal complete with generous CGI and befitting atmosphere. This is every bit the ambitious summer blockbuster with epic scaled battles, sweeping cinematography and costumes that form a detailed throwback to earlier adaptations of this story. For want of an unchartered path, there is also a twist to the original concept, in addition to minor alterations like the inclusion of mythical beasts, pixies and an extra dwarf.So why the average rating? As I said before, the story, its fresh new concept and overall production quality makes this film a worthy crowd puller; but only in theory. In my opinion, the flaws in this movie are the choice of cast and the lack of feverish intensity from said cast. Theron is a sight to behold and a phenomenal actress with some critically acclaimed roles in her belt. Yet given the overall darkness of this film and the brutal nature of her character, Theron has somehow failed to live up to her expected prowess by not injecting enough malevolence into her queen Ravenna. Instead, there is a pro-feminist message that is uniquely Theron but mismatched for the role at hand. Another mismatch is Stewart as Snow White. Yes, given the premise, Stewart fits the bill as 'the fairest of them all', with a welcome departure from the indecisive Bella Swan of the ""Twilight"" series. But armed to the teeth, Stewart lacks the heart, soul and burning rage of a warrior princess and sole heir to the throne, let alone avenging her father's murder. On the other hand, Hemsworth is the silver lining with almost single-handed efforts that holds the story together. Although this is his third appearance for 2012, this is easily his best role with the most screen time so far. Coming back to Sanders and I appreciate the overall visual quality of the world he has created in keeping with an action-fantasy epic. Pacing and editing appears to be his oversight, but as a rookie director there is definitely a lot of promise as the fact that this film stands shoulder to shoulder with some of 2012's big summer titles."
593,"Kristen Stewart is the main focus of attention in this movie, obviously because she's snow-white. However, she had no sense of expression on her face during the entire movie. She couldn't hold her British accent, and she sounded American most of the time. She didn't seem like she was really that into the position she held, either. Overall, I liked the movie. Just Ms.Stewart ruined it for me. This movie is also very Gory and doesn't really stick true to the same story-line that Disney created. Yes it was supposed to be made realistic, but I think they went a little overboard. I really liked the males acting in this movie though, they made the movie a little more alive and barleable to watch."
594,"With a running time of 2hrs, 7 mins, this movie felt like it had a running time of 4 hrs and 4 mins.Charlize Theron is beautiful. Kristen Stewart is beautiful. If you take away two messages from this movie, those might be the messages. Two other messages might be: dwarfs look like hobbits when you run panoramic shots of either hiking through beautiful mountainside; and Kristen Stewart's contract always requires that her character be caught in a love triangle, no matter how necessary that may be to the plot line.To say I enjoyed this movie might mislead one into believing the film's writers shared a cohesive sense of the tale they attempted to tell; it would also be untrue, and yet I would see it again for reasons I still don't understand.Kristin Stewart was a compelling Joan of Arc -- what? Wait, who was she playing? And that guy from Thor could hold an axe like a hammer. Seriously, I believe the actors did a fantastic job with what they had. And the direction, though consistently grossly indulgent, produced some beautiful imagery. The writing, however, was all over the place. There were scenes that seemed to stretch for eternities, and after reflecting on the way those scenes enhanced the story, we struggle to find an answer. For example, there was a scene in the middle of the story, where Snow White wanders off from her ""fellowship"" and meets a white buck in the middle of the fairy forest. The ""Doc"" dwarf explains: ""this has never happened before,"" and when one of the other characters very reasonably seeks a better explanation of what happened, Doc responds: ""She is going to meet Him."" What the...? Who is Him? The buck? God? So, she meets this white buck, who then gets shot by Snow's pursuers and turns into a thousand butterflies (of course only after throwing a tremendous tantrum about being shot). The writers clearly decided that was a sufficient explanation and never again returned to this storyline to explain what happened.In another scene, the characters host a funeral for the 8th dwarf -- a character we were only recently introduced to, who, in fairness, died a noble death, but the funeral dragged on forever. By the end, I was ready for jello. In the final scene, we are at Snow White's coronation (you know that's how the movie will end, c'mon!) and the director decided to tell a story without words. Perhaps the entire film would have benefited from this tactic, but not this scene alone. Kristen Stewart rose as if to say something and never did -- that scene must have lasted a solid 3-4 minutes of actual run time. It was weird...Perhaps the most classic example of confused writing in this film was a scene where Snow has just met the Huntsman, and he gives her advice on fighting. We all of course predict the maneuver he teaches her will be her salvation at her most desperate moment later in the film. However, at the beginning of the film, she responds: ""I don't know if I could do that"" (i.e. kill another person at close range), and the Huntsman explains: ""You may not have a choice."" However, sometime after this scene, and having received no other instruction, Snow is in a full suit of armor, marching on the queen's castle, and fighting and winning against clearly stronger and trained castle guards. So, wait, she knows how to fight now? Then she storms up the stairs to meet the queen, and then returns to her former state of incompetent fighting, lashing about and hoping for the best, before she uses her secret maneuver to win. So, she didn't know how to fight, but then figured it out, by sheer rage, but then later didn't know how to fight again, but followed through with the maneuver her Huntsman previously taught her...In short, see SWHM for the preview, because it is a beautiful preview, but just know this, that was some messed up stuff I just watched, and it felt like I watched it for a long time!"
595,"From a production standpoint, the movie was fabulous. The sets were amazing, the scenes were fantastic, costumes, lighting, hair, the whole works. Everything really stood out as quality. Even the CGI was well done, yet not excessive.From an acting perspective, everyone was spot on. I wish the director's would have given Kristen Stewart a bigger lead in the film. Even though she had more screen time, I felt like she was walking around the movie half-dazed, with her mouth gaping open. However, I thought her acting was much improved over the Twilight series, showing that this director knew how to bring it out, and show it on screen. But, I had a feeling that the production staff was playing it safe with her leading role, and required much from the supporting staff to carry her along."
596,"Contrary to the common ""Snow White"" that we know, Snow White & the Huntsman showed that she's not a damsel in distress. The movie's storyline is a matured approach to the fairy tale with a 'Lord of the Rings' kind of feel throughout the film. As expected, I see no difference to Kristen Stewart's acting of the title role to that of Bella Swan from Twilight. Most of the 'believable' acting came from the other two lead actors, Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman and Chalize Theron as Ravenna, the Evil Queen. While watching, I was seriously waiting for some Disney 'Snow White' elements like the seven dwarfs, red apple of death and the famous 'kiss of true love' from Prince Charming. In this film, all the elements were there, although some new characters and twist thrown in the story line (like for example the love triangle) was not given enough emphasis and depth.I didn't particularly liked the 'tragic' ending where I was left wondering if a victorious revenge but a true love lost will make Snow White happy ever after. (Geesh, SO MUSHY!). I'm not really a big fan of open-ended love story.My rating: 7/10 Stars."
597,"¬®Lips red as blood. Hair black as night. Bring me your heart my dear, dear Snow White.¬® This is as close of a Tim Burton version of Snow White then you'll ever see (even if Tim Burton himself directs one). The visual style of the film is pretty dark, but fascinating. It stands out in the film, but what the movie has going for it visually, it lacks story wise. The movie dragged for very long periods of time and moved really slowly. If it weren't for the great visuals I might have not made it through this original version of the classic story we've all seen hundreds of times before. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was Disney's first feature length movie and one of my favorite classics. I recall the darkness of it involving the evil witch, but I also remember the sweetness of Snow White and the playfulness of the seven dwarfs. Director Rupert Sanders does a very good job at setting the dark mood thanks to the strong performance from Charlize Theron, but he fails to capture the sweetness and innocence that embodies Snow White. As much as I like Kirsten Stewart, she really never convinced me as Snow White and that is my greatest complaint along with a lack of a better or more engaging storyline. This film was written by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini (the screenplay writer of my favorite film last year: Drive), but despite being beautifully shot and having great visuals it lacked a bit more heart in the story and a better conclusion. Despite moving so slow during most of the story, it seems to finish rather quickly and abruptly at the end. The movie does have some positive things however, such as Chris Hemsworth's performance and some of the great actors playing the dwarfs.We are all familiar with Snow White, although this film does take several liberties and takes us different places (despite having several of the same characters and lines from the original like ¬®Mirror, mirror on the wall who is fairest of them all? ¬®). Snow White is played by Kristen Stewart who's a princess until the day her mother dies and her father remarries Ravenna (Charlize Theron). Once Ravenna becomes Queen she murders Snow White's father and locks her in the towers. The evil Ravenna begins to rule and the kingdom grows very dark. She's a witch with eternal beauty thanks to the hundreds of girls she's killed. Their hearts are the secret to her youth and beauty. She rules along with her brother Finn (Sam Spruell) who is more like her servant. Once Ravenna discovers that Snow White's beauty is a threat to her powers she sends Finn to bring her in order to kill her, but Snow White manages to escape and hides in the dark forest. That is when Ravenna hires the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to go after her and bring her back, but once the Huntsman meets Snow White he decides to protect her instead. Snow White's childhood friend, William (Sam Claflin), hears she's still alive and also begins searching for her in order to protect her and overthrow the evil Queen. Along the way Snow White and the Huntsman run into some dwarfs (played by such great actors as Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, and Johnny Harris) who also decide to protect her from the evil powers of the Queen and so the journey continues.I actually enjoyed some of the supporting characters in this film. The actors that played the dwarfs brought a lot of comedy to an otherwise very dark and serious film. Chris Hemsworth was the other actor who brought some comedic relief to the table, and perhaps my favorite character of the film (reminding us as to why Thor was so good despite the ridiculous plot). The film had its entertaining moments, but I just felt it too dark of a picture for my enjoyment and really wished it would have had a better ending. Was it better than I expected it to be? Yes, but that doesn't mean it was good either. Kristen Stewart is a beautiful actress, but she didn't fit the role of Snow White, she is not the typical sweet actress, there is some darkness in her as well. This is not a kid's version of Snow White and is mostly for adults, but I still was left with an empty feeling from the theater as if something were missing. I didn't have a terrible time with this film; I would give it a 5.8, almost enjoyable.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
598,"Snow White and the Huntsman offers a very fancy and spectacular twist to this old children's story, making it a movie definitely worth seeing, even for its admirable beauty and perfectly magical world, in which it takes place. Unfortunately, due to its underdeveloped and sometimes chaotic storyline it loses a bit of its charm. Still, if you are thinking over the choice of Snow White and the Huntsman and Mirror Mirror you should definitely go and see the former.Everyone, who ever was a child, knows how the storyline must go. So there is definitely not a single element of surprise to be found in process. But there are some very nice additions to the character's portrayals and to the fairytale sphere, meaning many fascinating creatures and monsters on the road. Sometimes it even reminds of The Lord of the Rings, due to its epic music and one noticeable mountain scene (a fellowship of characters from various races? You got it).There is, of course, the Dark Forest, but it possess a much darker spirit than ever before. Particularly the hallucinogenic mushrooms provide for a rather psychedelic experience for anyone, who sniffs their poison. Mysterious creatures wander everywhere, from regular snakes, to big-as-hell trolls. There is also a village, consisting of women, who cut their faces, in order to avoid the Queen's cruel hands (and breath that sucks the youth out of anyone).Probably the greatest moment in the whole picture is the one, when the eight dwarfs (yes, eight, even though one of them dies later) invite Snow White and her protector to a dream-like realm, that looks like it's been taken straight from the Disney's version of the tale. This is a place, where the grass is greener, and the sun shiner brighter, the colors are more positive; the naked fairies sing wondrous songs. It's a very powerful use of advanced CGI, making it one of the strongest aspects of the picture.It's admirable how the producers were able to cast so many famous British actors and use their faces on the dwarfs body. This fancy procedure gives a better look at those very specific characters and, in the meantime, is able to induce many laughs (don't forget to look for the Heigh-Ho part. It's there, and it is as brilliant as ever).The main drawback of the movie is the miscast for a role of the titular heroine. Kristen Stewart isn't at all convincing. She doesn't remind me of the beautiful and jolly White from the cartoon version. She has the same facial expression for the whole time, in every single scene. After a few minutes it became so annoying that I started wondering why every man in the story is so fond of her. Her performance is very weak and colorless, in opposition to the wonderful world that surrounds her. Chris Hemsworth is decent as the Huntsman, the guy, who sacrifices his life to protect the princess. He did a good job portraying the strong and brave young fellow, who still mourns his late wife. I just couldn't dig the accent, somehow.Charlize Theron is a scene-stealer as the evil Queen. She makes the viewer hate her character, but at the same time admire her grace and beauty. From the moment that she takes a bath in the pool of strange white liquid, to the moment of her final defeat, she was able to present a person of such tremendous hatred for all men, and such shallow greed for youth, that it was almost hypnotizing.All in all, if you want to remind yourself of this classic tale (and at the same time of your childhood), Snow White and the Huntsman is a production that won't let you down. Just don't expect any fireworks and enjoy the beauty of the visual side of this re-imagination."
599,"Why was this movie made? Oh yeah, because Hollywood is retelling those classic fairy tales after that Red Riding Hood movie. I wanted to see this one because it looked very promising from the trailer. But man, it just feels like a rushed mess with characters having little to no development. I understand there's a lot of characters to deal with, but I felt nothing for anyone in the movie, and this includes Snow White.Snow White is played by the miscast Kristin Stewart looking fresh out of her Twilight movies. She does a better job here, mainly because she had slightly better material to work with, and supported with a better cast. Chris Hemsworth, who is probably now living up after the success of The Avengers, plays the Huntsman and does a fine job in his role. He almost reminds me of Val Kilmer's character from Willow. But the biggest honor goes to Charlize Theron who does a good job playing a psychotic queen. Sincerely, this chick has some serious issues. Her brother, who I don't know his name and I am too lazy to look it up, reminds me of that weird guy on that Dungeons and Dragons movie. I believe he had a blue tongue. He's not as campy, but he sure comes close.The story is where I had the biggest problem and the movie runs it all down at such fast pace that it's hard to take in the fantastic imagery and the elaborate sets. The movie begins with the king falling in love with the queen after finding her imprisoned by weird exploding dark knights. She kills him and suddenly rules the land and keeps his daughter Snow White locked up in the tower until she turns into Kristin Stewart. Then I had to ask myself, ""Is this Snow White or Rapunzel?"" Anyway, Snow White breaks free, the queen hires a huntsman, and he finds her in the dark forest where there are all these trees and probably land mass for miles with no problem whatsoever. And then they just travel from point A to point B, getting into situations that has no relevance to the plot like coming across a troll, or seeing some white reindeer thing and oh yeah, they meet the dwarfs and well, I have no idea why they are in the movie. They might as well be Ewoks.By the end of the movie, and I will try not to reveal it, but all I can think to myself is after all that, Snow White is a b****. I don't know why. It's just the impression I got at the end. Was the movie a waste of time? Almost. I wish I saw it on DVD instead."
600,"I was hesitant going into the theater, since I am not a Kristen Stewart fan (in Twilight or anything else). Have to say I was pleasantly surprised that the film was so good despite K-Stew's lackluster performance! Queen Ravenna was brilliantly played by Charlize. She was seductive and strong and perfectly balanced beauty and mayhem. She did a stunning job playing the part of tragic-lost-soul turned eater-of-souls. It's worth watching just for her.The Huntsman was charming and brutal and wounded, and seemed very real. Hemsworth was a perfect choice, and I honestly couldn't see anyone else in that role.Snow White- hahahahaha, ohhhhh K-Stew. She was stiff and didn't have much expression throughout the film. I wasn't surprised, since I saw Twilight (against my will) and saw all three faces she can make. She's really good at dying and shouting, but cannot look normal during a conversation to save her life! It's like she's guarding her spirit so closely that the audience can only catch the occasional glimpse of it.The film itself was really well done. Reminded me of LOTR in a great way. Very sweeping, epic feel, good music, interesting landscapes. I will be surprised, though, if it lasts longer than the summer. This probably won't be one that people will still talk about after it's out of theaters. I think it would have been better if they'd split it in two parts and gone into a lot more detail, let the character development happen a little slower. Would have been a great novel.Bottom line: Definitely worth the $5 I paid to go to the matin√©e!"
601,"I had mixed feelings about Snow White and the Huntsman (not that you should care about my feelings). It looks awesome, it is a beautifully made movie. Although in a few scenes it felt like watching a stage play that was filmed, but that was not very often. The acting is good. Nothing wrong with that. Kristen Stewart's range of emotional expressions is not very large in this movie, but that did not bother me. They did not want to make her a kick-ass warrior princess, but tried to bring some tragic sadness in her character. The story itself is somewhat vague sometimes. There is a love story going on, but it remains unclear who exactly is the love interest of Snow. There is the good-overcomes-evil storyline that works pretty well, although certain elements are too overtly borrowed from movies like The Lord of the Rings and The Narnia Chronicles (and even the Good Ol' Bible when Snow recites the Lord's Prayer). What made my toes curl especially was when someone said that Snow was 'The One'. Yuck. And then there are all those loose references to the original Snow White fairytale (apples, blood, prince, mirror). You could see this movie as an interesting interpretation of the original, but those references are not tied into a coherent storyline. But nonetheless it is a very nice movie to watch. Just don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great two hours."
602,"OK. First of all, Kristen Stewart was a bad choice. Snow White is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in the country, yet Kristen Stewart is hardly beautiful. She makes the same expression in every scene: that of a mouth breathing donkey. Acting is over the top, which I guess is to be expected. Effects are cheap looking, there's no chemistry between anyone in the film at all, and why the hell does Snow White become a warrior in the end? It's like the movie just changed into a completely different film. Suddenly she's no longer Snow White, the gentle princess who heals the world and bonds with forest creatures. She's Joan of Arc. WTF?Chris Hemsworth is good in it. Maybe that's because you know what o expect from him if you've seen him as Thor. The thing is, he's not bad at performing in less corny rolls. His fake drinking could use some work, but he's not bad.Did I mention Kristen Stewart is ugly as sin?"
603,"The movie could have been so good if the character of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) was portrayed with other more fitting actress. So many emotionless scenes especially the moment a dwarf was killed in a combat, the fake tears is the only indication that she's in ""total"" grief. You won't even feel there's a love story between her and the huntsman, or you may think it's her and William not unless the title of the movie gave you a hint because the acting of Kristen was so empty (the kiss itself was empty because you couldn't feel the love (of Snow White towards the huntsman), that's what I felt). On the contrary, the movie really did have nice visual effects,good plot on the twist, and the acting of other cast was either good or OK (Kristen's was terrible).I just felt disappointed with this movie because it could have been good! I really would have enjoyed this film."
604,"When is Kristen Stewart going to stop appearing in brooding, melancholy fantasy films and try something a bit... happier? First the dark Twilight Series, then the gloomy updated version of Little Red Riding Hood, and now this... Which takes the popular children's fairy story and turns into another crack at a bleak Lord Of The Rings style adventure.All the standard elements are here... The evil witch, the poisoned apple, the seven dwarfs... but the storyline is completely different. This isn't about a princess being saved by a prince charming, it's more concentrated on fantasy battles against large forces. And as for the romantic interest, it may not be as clear cut as you think...The determination to recast Snow White as a feminist icon is a bit of a joke... Seeing her lead thousands of men, armour clad with sword in hand during the finale is ridiculous, seeing as she's had no hitherto training in battle whatsoever. Apart from one trick with a dagger the huntsman showed her... he said that it ""May save her life one day"". Hmm... I wonder who she'll use that against...Basically, this isn't a very good film. Sure, it'll hold your attention while it's on, but with a surfeit of similar genre productions both on TV and at the cinema doing the rounds right now, plenty of which are better than this, why bother? EXACTLY. 5/10"
605,"Hmm... Ten lines to explain what a wretched clich√© this movie is? Hardly worth the effort really. I guess I will stick to complaining about how typecast and boring poor Charlize Theron has become, this once-great actress who was so phenomenal in ""Monster"" but apparently now reduced to playing the same wicked witch roles over and over. And yet Theron gives the best performance of a bad lot, including Chris Hemsworth, who apparently still has only two expressions in his repertoire---maybe one day he will treat the audience to a third? Not to mention Kristen Stewart, as the deposed princess who dons armor and raises her voice to exhort her army, but appears so wan and wispy that for me she manages to inspire only chuckles.However, I did enjoy some of the moody cinematography, but the camera resorts to hand-held jitters during the all-too regularly scheduled fights and battle scenes, yet another clich√©. I will also admit to liking the scene set in the fairy land, but who doesn't like fairies and cuddly animals? Unless you like your fairy tale and princess power clich√©s taken very, very seriously, I say SKIP IT."
606,"I really enjoyed the first 40 minutes of this but then a very stereotypical 'hunk' actor who I've seen massacre quite a few films recently, with a really crap Scottish accent (no excuse with the great voice coaches available these days) turned up and spoiled it for some reason the queen who has previously been smart and devious enough to steal the throne decides to send said 'hunk' guy, who in addition to being a catalogue model has also lost his wife, to bring back the beautiful snow white who escaped and is alone in the woods. yeah great idea. why not send a fat ugly huntsman to go get her? so the rest is a little bit predictable isn't it...Charlize Theron is good as always, and Kristen Stewart is better than I expected but really this film is a wasted opportunity to retell the story of Snow White in a modern way with good effects"
607,"Fist of all, to say that Kristen Stewart is more beautiful that Charlize Theron is simply blasphemy! Besides the fact that Kristen is not even close to being the fairest of them all, she is an extremely poor actress. During the entire movie, all you can see of her are maximum 2 facial expressions, which are clearly all she's got. In my opinion, she was not at all fit for the role: emotionless and cold throughout the entire movie. Clearly the director (Mr. Rupert Sanders) had other opinion, but I tend to believe he was not exactly objective in this matter... The subject had great potential but the movie came out mediocre, with great visual effects, which clearly are not enough to make you see this it twice. Great acting of Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did not succeed in saving this movie, but they are clearly the reason I rated it 5/10."
608,"It was sheer torture to listen to Charlize Theron deliver her lines in the absolutely worst British accent I have ever heard. And to make matters worse, Charlize had most of the lines in the film, so the torture was relentless. Sadly, I counted no less than (3) veteran British actors in the dwarf ensemble, so it's not as if there weren't examples of genuine British accents available for Ms. Theron to observe or mimic. And why can't Kristen Stewart close her mouth? Is an audience supposed to believe these characters or just be grateful the actors showed up? There are so many fine British female actors who could have done so much better in these roles, what a waste of film. And Chris Hemsworth...yes he's easy on the eyes, but with all the tough yet sensitive guy projection, where was the chemistry between him and Kristen Stewart? And why bother to bring back the childhood friend under the pretext that he is so devoted to saving Snow White? Where was he all this time? and suddenly he appears, yet he has a minor role and one close up that seemed very obvious. Overall, this film was badly written, badly cast, badly acted, badly directed, badly lighted, and I couldn't make out anything the dwarfs were saying. I give it 1 for the magnificent costumes and some cool special effects."
609,"Please, DO NOT waste 2 hours of your life by watching this movie! Storyline is horrible. Acting is horrible. Thor should stick to playing Thor. The only reason I actually gave this movie 3/10 is because of two characters: 1)William <3 and 2) The Queen! Who I hoped would kill Snow White in the end... but alas, she gets to see another day!And, Kristen Stewart... whoever says ""She is actually good actress..she is just stuck in this Twilight movie...but she has good roles""(I am pretty sure I read it somewhere) well, you are wrong! Please, show me where exactly was she good in this movie?! No emotions...whatsoever...Can't believe they are going to make a second one!"
610,"This felt like i was was watching Belle Swan in a different movie. She was the same girl as in the Twilight movies. Guess you would call her a one character actress. I don't dislike her, I just want to see a range of characters, Not just Bella Swan. Shes really been the same in all her movies. I just don't want her to be the female Nicholas Cage..Sorry but it seems i don't have enough lines to post my comment. It seems that posting your review has to be like a short essay into the dynamics of the certain film you review.I just checked again if i could post my comment...and the answer was no, not enough lines. So i am going to get my bottle of wine and types out all of the problems plaguing the world today. First let me check one more time..my wrist is getting tired...lol"
611,"There is so much to like here and so much that disappoints. On substances it's fleeting; on form, it's brilliant. Its ambition is nowhere more apparent than in its remarkable imagery and environment. This stylish twist to the Brothers Grimm's classic tale of betrayal, survival and friendship is a visually stunning embrace of colors and imagination, transporting the audience from one wildly rich world to another, e.g., the opening battlefield of the glass soldiers, the death of nature, the Dark Forest, the women's village and fairy sanctuary. These settings are complimented by competent performances. First, by Hemsworth and his depiction of the tale's newest character ‚Äì the Huntsman: a widowed, drunkard mercenary who is initially hired to capture and return Snow White but quickly becomes her champion. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, this character, played so effectively by Hemsworth, slowly becomes marginalized. The main course of this film unsurprising is Charlize Theron's portrayal of the infamous Queen. Her performance cannot be minimized. At times, she is terrifying, at others genuinely sorrowful but always arousing. Her performance along with the imagery almost saves this film. And despite its diversion from the original tale, the writers cleverly maintain the traditional landmarks of the original, e.g., the dwarfs, the poisonous apple and the magic mirror. Preserving these landmarks was essential because nostalgia, I'm sure for too many viewers, was the driving force in experiencing this film. What undoes this film is the chaotic way its story progresses. The narrative more and more veers away from Theron and Hemsworth and begins to overbearingly focus on Stewart. A talented cast was present here. It was just foolish to place them on the sideline and hand the baton to Stewart and ask her to carry this baby cross the finishing line. In the end, this film devolves in a cheap medieval-type fiasco, where we have Stewart hilariously leading soldiers to battle. Obviously, the conclusion provided in the original was more rewarding."
612,"SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN Chris Hemsworth rocked his role, Charlize Theron was not developed or used enough and Kristen Stewart sucked, as usual (she just can't act). Again, another film with so much potential wasted on too many CGI effects and Kristen Stewart as the lead. Everyone knows that Snow White was a victim of the mean step-mother Queen, which is never really brought to light, using a 'Joan-of-Arc' type character rather than the meek, mild, demure victim of what we all see as the early Snow White. Certainly it would be believable with a nouveau update of the Grimm brothers, even the Disney versions with a SW that morphed into a stronger character later in the film, but not as aggressive and dark as the one used in this film. I really enjoyed Chis Hemsworth storyline and would love to see a 'Huntsman' series develop his character and take him in all sorts of directions. Now that it has been revealed that the director of SW and the Huntsman, Rupert Sanders, can easily lure a curious Kristen Stewart into unsavory affairs that single-handedly ruin other film projects (Snow White & the Huntsman II or On the Road), relationships and the fans view of them and their work - both should of them should be replaced for the future of the franchise. Keira Knightley as SW and Kenneth Branaugh as the director? Just a suggestion."
613,"Two films about the famous fairy tale princess were released the same year, within the space of just a month and a half, one was a darker more teenage and adult friendly tale and the more family friendly piece of fun, this is the darker one that made the more money, from director Tarsem Singh (The Cell). Basically princess Snow White (Twilight's Razzie winning Kristen Stewart) is the daughter of King Magnus (Noah Huntley) of Tabor, who suffers the death of his wife, and after apparently saving her from the Dark Army he meets, falls in love with and marries the beautiful Ravenna (Charlize Theron), he has no idea she is a powerful sorceress, and on the night after their wedding the Dark Army kill the King, making Ravenna the Queen and ruler. Snow White has for years been locked in the castle tower, and the Queen is trying to stay eternally beautiful, and the only way she can achieve this is by drains youth from girls in the kingdom, one includes Greta (Doctor Who's Lily Cole), but from the Magic Mirror (Christopher Obi Ogugua) she uses she is told that the princess will threaten her rule, but her heart if the Queen consumes it will make her eternally beautiful and immortal. Finn (Sam Spruell) is ordered to bring Snow White to the Queen so this prophecy can be fulfilled, but she escapes into the Dark Forest where Ravenna has no power, so the Queen orders drunken widower Erik the Huntsman (Thor's Chris Hemsworth) to find and bring her back, with her promise with her power she could bring his dead wife Sarah back to life. Duke Hammond (Vincent Regan) confirms the princess is still alive, and his son and Snow White's childhood friend William (Sam Claflin), a bowman, goes to find her as well. Erik locates Snow White, but Finn there as well tells him that Ravenna does not have the ability to bring his wife back from the dead, so the huntsman agrees to help her go to Duke Hammond's castle as long as her rewarded with gold, and they pass through a village where many young women have disfigured themselves to escape the Queen consuming them, and Erik finds out who Snow White is. He was originally going to leave her in their care, but Finn arrives with his men to attack them, and after this they meet a band of brave dwarf fighters, Beith (Ian McShane), Muir (Bob Hoskins, in his last film before retirement), Gort (Ray Winstone), Nion (Nick Frost), Gus (Brian Gleeson), Coll (Toby Jones), Duir (Eddie Marsan) and Quert (Johnny Harris), it is wise Muir who sees Snow White as the hope for the kingdom and the one who can defeat Ravenna. The group encounter Finn and his men again, and Gus is killed by an arrow saving the princess, and Erik kills Finn and is shocked to find out that he was responsible for the murder of his wife Sarah, and soon enough William shows up as well to join the group travelling to Hammond's castle. The Queen is not happy that Snow White still hasn't been brought to her, dead or alive, so she disguises herself as William and fools Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, Erik and the real William believe she is dead and take her corpse to Hammond's castle, and both the men kiss her goodbye, it is Erik's true love kisses that awakens her from comatose. Her friends and those who love her are happy Snow White is alive, and she takes command of the Duke's army as they go into battle against Ravenna and her army, the dwarfs sneak into Tabor through the sewers and allow the Duke's army to invade after the gates are opened. Snow White is ready to confront evil Ravenna who has no hesitation in trying to kill her with her dark powers, and after a struggle the princess is victorious as she stabs Ravenna in the heart, causing her beauty to fade rapidly until she dies, the army are also victorious, and Snow White is crowned Queen of Tabor, and the kingdom can be restored. Also starring Liberty Ross as Queen Eleanor, Rachael Stirling as Anna and Hattie Gotobed as Lily. Stewart is a suitable enough choice to play the attractive princess with determination, Hemsworth is alright as the huntsman with a sad back story, Claflin doesn't do that much, the actors including McShane, Hoskins, Winstone, Frost and Jones shrunk down by special effects to become dwarfs are all terrific for humour, but the one who stole the show for me was Theron who is obviously gorgeous and she has no problem convincing you she is malevolent and purely and powerfully evil as the Queen. This version of the fairy tale was obviously made to appeal to the Twilight kind of audience, so the story is suitably gloomy with no frills and fancy stuff you would have in a regular good and evil tale like this, it sticks to the same traits we expect in the story, but putting a dark spin on it, obviously this cannot compare to the Disney cartoon, but it is not a bad fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Costume Design. Worth watching!"
614,"This movie starts of as a 'Lord of the Rings' type of film (who the narrator is and why he tells the story is never explained). Then there is a lot of walking,beautiful scenery, great effects ans some ""Robin Hood"" jokes... but it is all in vain. As a viewer we don't care because we don't care about the characters. Why so much money was spend on making everything look great and authentic, why not spend an extra buck on the actors? Steward is slightly less boring than in the awful ""Twilight saga"". And she is supposed to bring back life into the country?? She sucks the last bit out of whatever remains. No magic between her and Hemsworth. No matter how hard he tries. Claflins character is useless, guess he figured that out during filming and lost his will to perform... Theron as Ravenna has to carry the whole film. I was actually cheering for her! Yes! Finish them, please!! Also nice that she as T1000 in her mirror, but what is that doing here in this flick? So, 3 out of 10 for the rest of the crew who tried to make it look good, and another 1 for the dwarfes because they make it slightly less awful."
615,"I thought the movie tried to seem like an action movie, but there was barely any action at all until the very end. The end action seen was all of two minutes and it was extremely obvious how the queen was going to die/be killed. I thought Kristen Stewart's last line was the worst. ""You can't have my heart"", you have got to be kidding me I thought she was going to say something along the lines of feeling pity/sorry for the queen, as she mentioned previously in the movie. Also, what is up with Kristen Stewart having a love triangle between her old long lost friend and the new guy that saved her life?! Whatever happen to the seven dwarfs (Dopey, Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, etc.), they were one of the best parts of the original Snow White."
616,"just seen snow white and the huntsmen movie i have to say nice movie had a lot of potential but wasted on :casting :- why oh why was Charlie's Theron casted as the witch queen i mean she is SO easy on the eyes , such kind eyes ... i visualized Nichole Kidman would do much more convincing queen witch , ( the eyes ), what about Catherine zeta Jones in the same role again the eyes also the queen witch would be more convincing as brunette rather than a blond . now lets talk about Kristen Stewart !!???? what the hell?!!! her hair is not even black her figure is frail as is her acting ,no presence what so ever and whats with her double dating the prince and the huntsman ( is it her trade mark now or what?? )why was the kiss of the huntsman that brought her back to life ?!!! what message are you implying. I would have loved to see Megan fox in this role ,more presence , the looks are much more similar to snow white ( actually she might be the embodiment of snow white ) and i will be convinced if she held a sword and led men in battle than Kristen . environment and folklore : i liked the dark forest what i was confused about is fairies , trolls , the sanctuary , and the forest god . Too many miss placed fantasies . I saw a forest god in an anime movie before ( Princess Mononoke ) but not in a dark ages folklore tale before . I would have bought a dragon but not fairies , trolls and forest god. Though the movie have its heart in the right places in most of its scenes , its mind is rather scattered on many different levels , in comparison to another movie about snow white ( snow white : a tale of horror ) this movie is not my favorite among other snow white tales ."
617,"As most of the reviewers here i expected a lot from the movie and the end result was disappointing.The directing was bad,I guess he was busy with his love affair that he forgot about the movie.Kristen Stewart proves to be one of the poorest actresses i have ever seen,she was totally emotionless the only good role for her is if she played a zombie other than that she shouldn't waste her and our time.Charlize Theron wasn't that good in the movie,i didn't feel she was wicked enough.The only good performance in the movie was by Chris Hemsworth and the dwarfs.My point at the end is you shouldn't waste your time or money on this movie.Go watch anything instead."
618,Cinematography was awesome loved the way they portrayed the darkness and death of the kingdom under the evil queens rule. Really created a magical back drop for the story.Score the music was on point with the story line and really carried the emotionActing Charlize Theron was on point she was an incredible as the evil queen. Chris Hemsworth did a great job with the huntsman.... Kristen Stewart I cant even blame her for doing such a terrible job in this movie. Who ever cast this should be ashamed of themselves. She showed no emotion she mostly just looked confused. She never seemed strong or special which I am guessing should have been some key characteristics for the purest of them all. Especially when she was supposed to be leading everyone in battle no charisma or conviction. Also seriously in what world is she ever going to be fairer than Charlize Theron.The story line was interesting and kept me engaged but I wish there was more background on the evil queen so we could better understand her side of it. That would be a good movie all about the evil queen and cut snow whites scenes right out of it.
619,"Snow White and the Huntsman **** 13 June 2012It shouldn't be necessary to outline the story of Snow White and the Huntsman as we've all seen the Disney version, we've all read the Brothers Grimm story and we've all heard the story in various forms over the years. However, this is darker, though not as dark as the 1997 Sigourney Weaver vehicle, and boasts an additional dwarf. Naturally it's frowned upon to contradict the view that Disney's excellent, but sanitized, version of the story is the finest, the definitive version but, actually, this is better.Well, parts of it are.Yes, Walt's breakthrough remains a groundbreaking moment in film history, was terrifying for many children and still stands up 85 years (!) later but it didn't have the benefit of Charlize Theron on overdrive. But more about her later¬Ö Disney gave us a classic to treasure always, he gave us an entertaining and enthralling standard, with political undertones, against which all animated features would be measured in the future. And to thank him, the Academy gave him eight Oscars ‚Äì one honorary statuette and seven miniatures. Snow White and the Huntsman isn't going to match that by any means, although it could at least earn a nomination or two in the technical categories. The mirror effect alone is worthy of accolades. It slithers beautifully, is a smooth, evolving progression of liquid to solid and will put the willies up overly sensitive viewers. More beguiling, though, is the suggestion that it is only in the evil Queen Ravenna's mind. But that takes us back to Theron and I'm not ready to drool freely yet.The darkly enchanted forest is an absolute delight in its cruelty. It lives, breathes and utterly squelches with malevolence without resorting to shlock horror or petty frights. It's beautifully nasty and you really don't want to go down to those woods today. But the visual finery is far from limited to the scenery, literal or digital. A huge amount of care and attention has been spent over the costumes and the Queen's, in particular, are exquisite. I desperately wanted to hit a pause button to study her dresses and headpieces on the big screen to appreciate every intricate detail. Watch for the black dress with the tiny white animal skulls, which is particularly stunning.Plot wise, it flows well although the open-ended conclusion and rumours of a sequel are troubling. The characters are largely engaging, whether intended to be loved, hated or laughed at, and the cast is, for the most part, extremely enjoyable to watch and a very impressive ensemble. Chris Hemsworth, fresh from double Thor duties, is far more enjoyable than the traditional simpering Prince Charming we're usually lumbered with, although he'll keep the hearts pounding for some. The cast of dwarfs out does that recruited by Peter Jackson for The Hobbit and includes such British stars, character actors and comedic players as Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan and Nick Frost.For all it's delights, though, there are some fairly serious issues with Snow White and the Huntsman, that ensure it cannot hope to rise above four stars, the first of which is, conversely, the characters, particularly the dwarfs. There are just too many of them and to little time to know them and fully engage. The dwarfs are, well, dwarfed by everything else around them. It's such a waste of fine actors and great potential.By far the biggest problem, though, is Snow White and, bearing in mind she's fairly central to the film, it's a hippopotamus of a problem that is not easily overlooked. As a child she clearly does not have raven hair and cannot act. As a young adult, in the form of Kristen Stewart, she has at least sorted out the hair colour. But that's it. The Snow White we are presented with is acted off the screen by CGI animals and elves, is surly, bland and distinctly out of place. Her performance may have satisfied a million easily pleased teenage girls in the Twilight saga but is frustrating here to say the least. And in no universe or imagination could she possibly be considered fairer than Charlize Theron.And so to Ms Theron. Ahhhh. Yes, I know she's playing evil bitch number one but she looks absolutely stunning. Beauty aside, she plays the part with passion, vigour and conviction so as to be absolutely captivating and believably evil. But beneath the obvious nastiness, Theron gives us a character deeply troubled, riddled by insecurity and teetering along a fraying tightrope of sanity. Her oil-soaked transmogrification from flock of crows to hurting, flailing human is both touching and disturbing for greater reasons than mere digital effects. Theron plays Ravenna as a woman clutching at a disintegrating, soggy paper floor as she tumbles in slow motion to a hell beyond the comprehension of her fragile mind.She's so good they should have named the film after her instead.Finally, for those fellow cinema purists who refrain from scurrying out as soon as the final frame dims, there's further reward that has nothing to do with the film but is still a pleasure and all the better for enjoying it, as I did, in solitude. Breath of Life, a new track from Florence and the Machine, jarred with the first bar but quickly took root and complimented the final crawl of credits. What a way to leave the cinema with that flinging itself around the brain!Another film review from The Squiss."
620,"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, why can't Hollywood make decent films anymore? Just saw Snow White and the Huntsman, and while it's an interesting take on an old story, it's uneventful and flat.**Random spoilers throughout**Cast: Chris Hemsworth was good. He struggled with the crappy script, but at least he can act. Charlize Theron was pretty good too, but her role was a bit limited, and some of her scenes were flat too. Kristin Stewart is gorgeous, but she has only one facial expression. Luckily it's a good looking expression, and it's carried her this far, but she didn't bring much else to the role. Someone should buy her a mirror so she can practice (see what I did there?). However, nice to see two strong female leads in a single film.SFX: pretty good. Nice spooky parts and some excellent evil queen effects. The aging parts (with Charlize) were very well done. It's a good looking film, even if it lacks heart.The script: Poorly written. Weak dialogue. Terrible pacing. Rushed. Shallow. Flat. Who hires these crappy writers? The idea? Great. Execution? Not so much. To wit: an integral part of the Snow White story is the poisoned apple. That's in the film, but it's played so weakly that it may have well been left out. She eats the apple, goes comatose, and then wakes up ten minutes later. Pathetic effort, writers, pathetic effort, especially when it could have been used to much greater dramatic effect. The problem is that there's no tension. That could be due in no small part to Kristin Stewart's single expression, but it permeates the entire film, so I think it's more than that. This film cost $170 million to make, and they still couldn't get it right.Overall it's watchable, but disappointing. Yet, it could have been so much better, and it wouldn't have been too hard. Some simple changes in dialogue, a re-ordering of some scenes and making other more prominent, add a sense of something worth losing (and fighting for), and it would have been good. Ultimately that's the director's fault, so -1 Rupert Sanders.6 out of 10."
621,"Snow White and the Huntsman is the second incarnation of the classic fairy tale to hit the big screen this year after Mirror Mirror earlier in 2012. In this fantasy action adventure take on the world renown classic the Huntsman ordered to kill Snow White ends up becoming a friend, protector and mentor in her quest to vanquish the evil Queen.The film opens with a narration and a series of flashbacks in order to provide the audience with some of the back story. It feels as though the film makers tried to just feed us information that we didn't really need and it sets a very slow pace for what is to follow. The narration also wasn't filled with any kind of emotion and played quite tediously through the speakers. What follows is a lot of the Queen and Snow White doing pretty much nothing at all which forces the first act of the film to trudge along slowly.Charlize Theron plays the evil Queen and a lot of the attention in the run up to release was focused on her and her portrayal of the character, however I was left pretty disappointed by her performance; it wasn't exactly bad but it wasn't anything to shout about either. There were points of the film where we hadn't seen the Queen for so long that I had genuinely forgotten she was a part of the film and as an actor that is not something you want the audience to forget. Kristen Stewart becomes the famous princess and does a sturdy job, again though there is something lacking from her performance, she doesn't exactly ooze charisma on the screen and I'm not sure she does enough to justify the title role in a film expected to be as huge as this.This take on the fairy tale bases as much emphasis on Snow White as it does the Huntsman and when the Huntsman arrives it is as if the movie shifts up a gear; played by Chris Hemsworth the Huntsman injects some much needed pace and emotion into the film. It seems as though the Huntsman is the only character the writers decided to take their time on, giving him a very emotive back story and motives, something which other characters (particularly the evil Queen) are lacking. You get a real connection with the Huntsman because of Hemsworth's performance as he continues to make a name for himself following up three great movies: Thor, Cabin in the Woods and The Avengers.The majority of scenes without the Huntsman aren't really worth watching but one in particular is worthy of any fantasy film ever. The first time we meet the adult William is when he ambushes a royal carriage and the fight scene that follows is fantastic; the fight scenes throughout the entire movie are actually a joy to behold. William is played by Englishman Sam Claflin who is relatively new to the acting world but previously appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Based on this performance though, is Claflin doesn't get more high profile acting work then a terrible injustice has been done in the acting world.Snow White and the Huntsman is a real treat for the eyes. Everything about it just looks fantastic: the landscape, the costumes, the special effects. It all just looks so perfect and Rupert Sanders, the director, creates this incredible fantasy world so well. You never want to take your eyes off the screen.In my opinion, this is a much better film than the earlier Snow White retelling Mirror Mirror. Whilst some of the characters aren't as well developed as others the visuals and the Huntsman and William themselves are worth watching this film for alone. As the film goes along it gets stronger and stronger and climaxes very well. It's definitely worth a watch."
622,"If you are excited o see the film, go see it. Only a very pessimistic person will say it was a bad film. The film is not bad. In fact everything about it is good. The problem is that it stops at good.The trailer makes you believe it's a more epic Lord of the Ring style movie. It's not. From the trailer you can see there is a Witch, Snow White, and a Huntsman... and yes you classic evil vs good romance story is here, that's it. What you have come to expect from these Twilight like films is exactly what's in this movie. Which means general audience members will like it, but film buffs will not.The reason the movie was not great is the story is too simple, straight forward and predictable. It's not really darker or more adult if you ask me, it actually is the animated movie in live action.The second thing that held it back was the cast for Snow White. This girl cannot act to save her life. It was embarrassing how few lines she has because of her terrible delivery. If you want to imagine her acting exactly, picture Bella from Twilight in a dress, and that is exactly what u get in this film, cold stale acting from the main character. Everyone else was good though."
623,"The film is a mishmash and grandiose effort that failed grandly. Tried to be a number of movies such as Kingdom of heaven, Lord of the rings, Joan of arc and The princess bride all at once. However, these films were gripping nd entertaining and were quite the benchmark for medieval genre of movies. Four people left the cinema when I was there to watch it and a few more went out, perhaps to the toilet, in the middle of it. That's how riveting it was. Lots of scenes should have been edited, edited and edited as they were too long and did not offer anything new in the battle-clashes scenes. And what is the ending supposed to mean? A sequel? Seen better versions of Snow White. That's what comes with age ... You have seen many, many good movies. What a waste of a budget as the actors were fine although perhaps a new face would be more effective and credible in the role of Snow White."
624,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a classic fantasy movie based on the famous German fairy tale ""Snow White"" by the Brothers Grimm. The movie is loosely bound on the most important elements of that fairy tale but has not the same dark vibe as the original. This adaption rather convinces with many great images and a couple of breathtaking special effects. Especially the more beautiful moments in the fairy world are very well done and may touch your soul. A lot of animals, dwarfs, fairies and trolls appear in the movie and are all very beautiful to watch and created with a lot of inspiring details. The fantastic elements in this movie are not too childish and in fact quite convincing and mix dark with light elements. This movie can be appreciated by children as well as by adults which isn't the case for recent movies such as The Hunger Games or John Carter that approach a younger audience.The acting is quite a mixed bag. I really liked the interpretation of the huntsman by a very solid Chris Hemsworth, a charismatic antihero that suffers from the tragic death of his wife and drowns his numerous problems in alcohol. Charlize Theron is as convincing as the evil Queen Ravenna and it's interesting that the movie also portrays her struggles, her tragic faith and the reasons behind her actions. The character is very complex and profound and not simply your usual villain. Ravenna's brother Finn played by Sam Spruell is also another convincing character with multiple facets. Especially the connection between brother and sister are very well portrayed in this feature. From that angle, this movie deserves a lot of positive critics but I disliked the acting of main actress Kristen Stewart as Snow White. She clearly lacks charisma and can't convince next to all these excellent supporting actors. When she becomes the leader of a rebellion or touches the heart of a broken man, she simply isn't convincing. She doesn't have the beauty, the charm and the smartness to fit this role. Her acting was a huge letdown and I would have liked to see someone else portraying that role.The story itself is no surprise to anyone that has read the fairy tale and it doesn't come close to the dark and poetic original. One thing that truly bothered me is the ending of that movie that ended with a quite ordinary scene and no true conclusion. One would have liked to know what would happen to the kingdom and its citizens, to the charming fantastic characters and to the slightly romantic relationship between Snow White and the Huntsman or her childhood friend William who clearly is in love with her. With ten or fifteen more minutes, this movie could have been more complete, profound and even give a possibility to a sequel but the screenplay finishes on a most ordinary note.In the end, this movie is very beautiful to watch, includes many charming characters and has almost no lengths as it is very entertaining. The main actress, some plot problems and especially the weak ending keep this movie away from being a truly outstanding blockbuster and doesn't do justice to the fantastic German fairy tale. On the other side, it's another solid fantasy movie this year after John Carter and The Hunger Games and this genre seems to live a quite positive survival this year. I think by the end of the year, this movie won't be among the most outstanding adaptations of old fantasy novels but still be a quite good one."
625,"but still not good enough to be rated as a 'great' movie. in 'mirror, mirror', we got an ugly queen and a princess called 'snow white' with two jumbo thick black eyebrows, and then unfortunately, in this 'the snow white and the huntsman', we got a better looking Charlie Theron as the evil queen and the snow white princess turned out to be with nicer eyebrows but with a pair of huge rabbit front teeth and a pair of protruding lips. neither of the two princess casting were appropriate and good enough to match what we consider the 'snow white' princess should look like. then, again, the huntsman in this film, was another wrong cast job, because he got a very dumb look face. i really don't know what went wrong in our English casting agencies, why they couldn't find a better actor to play this role. the other afterthought of this film is that there are two inevitable impressions came into my mind: 1) the later part looked more like the french 'joan of arc' 2) the end looked more like 'queen Victoria' 3) the British movie industries and English people are obsessed with 'queens' instead of 'kings'. they seem to be more open-minded and more appreciated to have queens or females reign their nation, while we Americans, well, so far, still so narrow-minded conservative and male chauvinistic, respect phallus totem more than anything, even this country's female citizens are more willingly to be controlled by male presidents. the republican party's conservatism is actually more gender discriminating. but of course, this is just another detoured thoughts. ha-ha.anyway, this twisted but still heavily formulaic English version of the 'the snow white and the 7 dwarfs' is just barely enough to finish watching."
626,"Snow White and the Huntsman is a mix of the movie Troy meets Disney! My wife wanted to see Snow White and the Huntsman, and she hates Kristen Stewart! I thought Kristen did a good job acting. That's besides the point as I digress. The movie is predicable with two stories. The storyline has a hero who rescues the female protagonist. The sub story is where the female protagonist toughens up and fights her female antagonist. The movie has a mix of Gladiator types of fighting in it mixed with the old Disney story. I hate how the movie gives the viewers the same predictable C G I effects, and ends with the usual formulated ending. The movie is not bad, but the movie is not great either. I give Huntsman five or six chops out of ten."
627,"This highly stylized version of the classic fairy tale has some intriguing visuals and music, but not much more than that. The plot is a mess, and it appears they wrote many scenes simply to give a Lord of the Rings vibe to the movie, some of the scenes seemed close to direct copies of scenes in that film.I was not familiar with Kristen Stewart before this, but she is so wooden in this movie that she would have been better off playing as a tree. She looks pretty on screen, but doesn't appear able to convey even the simplest emotion, and her acting was just awful and non-existent. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron as the evil queen is way over the top, but at least she is entertaining and a strong presence in the film.My favorite part was the music, I really enjoyed it throughout, and especially the music that leads up to the climactic battle scene near the end of the movie when the good guys are riding towards the castle. Indeed, I thought the music was so good that I wanted to buy the soundtrack.There are some good visuals as well, with the highlight coming when Snow White and her band make a visit to an enchanted land, which had much magical flora and fauna and imaginatively designed flowers and animals running around. It's worth seeing the movie for these factors, but not for the story or acting."
628,"This film has style, it might lack in other areas but it definitely delivers in the visuals. The sets are grand and beautiful, the Queens palace is made up up sharp edges, dark corners, they look like the Grim Reaper would be right at home here. And the lush greenery of the fairy land is stunning also, and fantastic contrast to the darker areas.The cinematography is also brilliant, every shot is framed for optimum beauty and the lighting in every scene looks great. The special effects aren't quite the realism of Prometheus, but are twisted and Gothic, Charlize Theron turning into a flock of ravens and monsters made up of shards of black glass, look particularly good.But visuals cannot make the film alone, the story - despite being known by everyone - sags around the half way mark, even with action coming thick and fast. The reason why this part of the film drags is lack of character development and a very poor portrayal of Snow White by Kristen Stewart. The lack of character development of the ""good guys"" is fatal to the overall film, none of the leads seem to have any interest in one another and their interaction seems forced. Chris Hemsworth (despeite being named in the title of the film) is barely used and just goes through the motions with the film. But nothing is as bad as Miss Stewart, though a step up from the Twilight films, just doesn't convince and bores more than anything. Her expressions don't vary and her dialogue is just painful (especially her camaraderie speech), plus her accent is lost in the clouds, god knows where she was supposed to be from.On this front its saving grace is the ever wonderful Charlize Theron, whose performance is a tour de force of evil. But she weights the character and makes her amiable as well as malevolent. Even her voice sends chills, with an ageing depth and tone, her stare shooting daggers at anyone who dare cross her. The middle section is lost with no input from Theron, which is why the film falls so many marks.Had Snow White and the Huntsman had been more savvy in the casting of Snow White and given the film more excitement in the middle section, the film would have been brilliant. Though the film is no car wreck, it just feels like an overlong and but very pretty piece of popcorn fodder."
629,"07/10 is the best I can rate this movie. As much as I am being persuaded by my conscience to rate her in the upper ranks of 08 (4 Stars) I simply need to be true to myself and be unbiased with my review. SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN is a fairy tale told with sheer passion. The last Epic fairytale was unfolded when Lucy walked through the cupboard that stood all by itself in large room. The spell-bound land of NARNIA took the adult audience as much as the kids on a whirlwind of magical wonders until she wrapped up her tales in the year 2010. Rated as PG13 SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN will not capture the younger audience and is likely to score more with a more mature audience. Although a fairy-tale most popularly known director Rupert Sanders experiments with this debut motion picture direction. You will be taken through a little bit of GLADIATOR, some magical moments of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, the dark forests of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the evil of NARNIA and finally Rupert Sanders own creation of SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN.The casting of SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN is one of the biggest risks taken by the casting team. Why did I say that? Kristen Stewart is Bella and always will be seen as Bella if she fails to come out as Snow White, Chris Hemsworth is the THOR and Charlize Theron has been struggling with her movies for some time now. Charlize Theron did make her mark with MONSTER back in 2003 and has never been as good since then. Undoubtedly with diverse talent she is largely convincing as the step mother and the dark queen Ravenna who kills the king (Snow Whites Father) and imprisons Snow White all her life until she finally escapes the clutches of Ravenna. However it is obvious that Theron struggles in bringing out the evil in the queen and is mostly observed as screaming her lines rather than being sinister. The beauty that is Kristen Stewart is the perfect Snow White. She fits the character like a glove. Innocent and pretty although when she does suit up into armor for battle to avenge her father's death, she does look as if she is parading for a fancy dress competition and is also obviously shouting out lines instead of speaking them with emotion. Chris Hemsworth aka THOR is the huntsman recruited by the queen to hunt down Snow White once she escapes from the castle. The Avenger that turns huntsman by far is the only flawless performance in SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN.Another that I took liking is the atmosphere injected by Rupert Sanders and his team using modern day CGI. Whilst the dark forest fails to impress the land of the fairies does have a touch of Pandora from AVATAR mixed with a pinch HARRY POTTER.The positive attributes of the entire production does overpower the bad attributes overall, however if you do drop an ink to glass of milk the milk will discolor irrespective of the quantity of ink. Likewise SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN does have a few shortfalls and is tainted. Thusly one may savor the success that is SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN and appreciate it more if they consider the fact that this is Rupert Sanders debut in movie making. The writers are not widely exposed nor experienced although they have done a fairly good job with the script but it certainly isn't the best.SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN comprises of ground breaking direction for a debut motion picture, astute selection in casting considering the fragile actress Kristen Stewart is, good moments of CGI integration, above average performances with minor hiccups and a weak script that has been brought to life wisely.TITLE: SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN DIRECTED BY: RUPERT SANDERS STARRING: KRISTEN STEWART, CHRIS HEMSWORTH & CHARLIZE THERON RATED: PG 13 RATING 07/10 127 MINUTES"
630,"I gave Snow White and the Huntsman a 7 out of 10, because it's a decent movie, but definitely not great. I was honestly disappointed in the lack of climatic events in the movie.As much action as the previews show, the movie really didn't have much going on as far as fight scenes. I guess that's what I get for trying to compare it to a, let's say ""Lord of the Rings"" fight scenes. Chris Hemsworth was solid as always, he's a Grade A actor yet with only the showings of Thor and Snow White.Charlize Theron makes a perfect witch/evil queen as she is beautiful and her acting is also solid in this flick. I feel as if they got it right with picking her and Hemsworth for their roles.As for Kristen Stewert....overrated. I still don't know how she continues to get big role after big role. If anyone has noticed, many of her movies get very poor ratings on IMDb (including all the Twilight flicks) and I think she has something to do with that. There just isn't ever a lot of depth or passion in her acting. Even during a monologue where she was giving a motivational speech in this film, I felt as if a sudden bout of boredom came over me. I feel as her character of Snow White wasn't well presented in this film, but maybe I'm just being critical.Anyway, I hope this is helpful. The movie is good but not great...more of a movie kids will like but most adults honestly won't want to watch it again when it comes out to DVD....I would go see Men in Black 3 instead this week if you have a chance to pick between the two. Thanks."
631,"As I have already written (read ""Earth stood still""), Hollywood should stop doing remakes. It's not that the idea is bad, especially if it's a fairy tale because the wisdom inside it needs to be given between generations. But if the remake is finally the opportunity to rewrite the entire story with just keeping the name of characters, then it's silly and this is what happens here: The heart of Snow white is about the Oedipus complex lived for a girl: she is a threat to her mother as she can seduce her father. So, the real darkness is jealousy, pride, competition. Have you got that here? It's about witchcraft, revenge... Next, in fairy tale, you got first fairy: does those dwarfs look like the gentle seven we know? Absolutely not: they got weapons, they fight, they are even worst than Tolkien's ones! And what about having Snow White as a killer: stabbing her adversary and being hailed is surely the worst nightmare for any child or parents! Second, you got a tale: here's what i have got is not a story: it's a succession of walks, fights, walks, fights. The encounters are totally dumb, a King-Kong look alike monster, a tribe of veiled women,... So, this Sanders is very uninspired as a director because he really salvages the kind. In comparison, when Tim Burton did a poor Alice, he succeeds however in keeping alive a kind of enchantment. The cast is interesting: Theron is excellent as the bad queen because in each of her movie, she always appears like a cold, unsympathetic person. Hemsworth reminds me of a young Pitt, but with more talent. At least, having played with another young actress, he could tell us who is better between Natalie and this so talked Stewart. For me, this Stewart has none: she is soft as a slug, talks too quickly. She lacks little mannerism, some original behavior of a future big name. And what about the dwarfs! With their casting, Hollywood has now invented a new trend: the eugenic filmmaking: Remember ""Willow"", the Ewoks? Well, get rid of those real disadvantaged people to do their part and prefer full, normal people. In addition, the movie offers shamefully the only usual that Hollywood knows today: you got a problem? Well, get a weapon and kill the opposition! The more you fight, the more likely you will end as the glorious leader! There are no law, no judge, no justice, only the power and strength!Well, feeding insidiously the new generation with eugenics, the providential leader, taste for blood, America, doesn't it ring about a very, very dark time in world history? You are finally the fair beauty that has fallen asleep with a poisoned apple and really needs to be awakened!"
632,"I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this horrible film. I don't understand how it can even have a 6.something rating. I'd give it negative six out of ten if I could. Charlize Theron was absolutely terrible and her accent was comparable to a high school play and some kid trying to fake an accent. Her acting was incredibly forced and felt totally over acted. Theron is my biggest gripe of the whole thing. She made it more unwatchable than Kristen Stewart and the horrible plot did. Bad casting, bad acting, bad directing. Just horrible. I created an IMDb account to write this because it was so stupid. And they spent 170 million dollars on this pile of trash! Wow"
633,"OK, I know everyone's a critic, but I don't get it. This film is absolute garbage. How on EARTH did Ray Winstone, Charlize Theron and the guy from Tombstone and Lovejoy whose name I can never remember get persuaded to be involved in this??! The CGI is good but nothing extraordinary. This was just a shameful piggyback on Twishite, sorry Twilight...I'm completely gobsmacked. This could have been a great film, dark twisted fairy tale, but instead it's a kiss KS's ass fest. So, here comes the unsurprising critique of KS...unsurprising because there's only one thing to say...she appears to only have one character she can play...an unconvincing ""heroine"" that inspires passionate and incomprehensible love from any man that goes near her. Nice work if you can get it I guess. Anyone else think she probably needs to broaden her scope if she wants to be taken seriously...Waste of time and money. Boooooooooooooo!!!! I want my time back please."
634,"So¬Ö this movie has action, fights, cool monsters and a cute huntsman. But it still managed to be rather a bust. It pretty much lost me before I even got through the rather lengthy introduction to the story and then never really did anything to get me back. The people weren't interesting enough and the plot not compelling enough to get me to really care about anyone. Snow White is locked up all her life but within hours of getting out is sword fighting with the best of them. And I don't know whose idea it was for Charlize Theron to do whatever she was doing with her voice but it was not a good idea. I don't know what it was supposed to be and I just found it annoying and distracting. And the big climatic scene at the end wasn't climatic and the big dramatic line that was delivered wasn't dramatic and left me waiting for something else that just never came. Not one of my favorites."
635,"I give it a 5/10 for the overall acting, special affects etc they were pretty good. The story line was horrible. Nothing was given any setup. Scenes for those possible setups were too short. A movie like this needed 3 hours to make it good and it could have been soooooo much more. 1. The troll at the bridge was just confusing and had no point 2. The hero from the other side of the Black Forest somehow makes it to those pursuing Snow White in an AMAZINGLY fast fashion. 3. Somehow the pursuers make it through every obstacle in the Black Forest with no problems. They obviously never had to interact with the troll etc. 4. The forest itself never appeared to be a horrible place to be. Shaking trees and dark was about the worst.These were just a few problems. Could have been great, but fell way short."
636,really giving a 7.5 really enjoyed this adaptation of the durable snow white story. the premise was fresh and very original with Charlize Thereon playing the evil queen to the hilt and i enjoyed every minute and the movie moved well with her on screen ...the love interest played by Thor was great and the dwarfs rocked my problem with the insipid performance of kristen stewart who was simply awful compared to the snow white from the julia roberts drek mirror mirror..i was just astounded by her lack of wherewithall or her monotone reading of lines and the ending after good defeating evil was just awful. but besides a weak snow white the fight scenes the movie was terrific and keep my attention all the way through again better than the avengers which was poor..compared to the jawdropping horrific mirror mirror this is like citizen kane but a better movie overall and the best movie i have seen in a long time.
637,"Considering that this is Rupert Sander's first time directing a movie, I have to applaud his effort. How he landed some big names (Chris Hemsworth, Ian McShane, Kristen Stewart *ahem*) on his first film, I don't know. Something else that brought large attention to this curious collaboration was the good marketing. I didn't expect such a new director to have such a large impact the first time 'round. That was done well.Despite the luring marketing, there were several problems with it once I actually saw the movie. There are various scenes in the trailers that never appeared in the movie (unless they will come in future editions or alternate endings). Also, it was falsely commended for having amazing, cinematic battle scenes. However, the reality is that the battles (save one or two) didn't live up to the cute title acronym (SWATH). They were very mediocre, compared to others from medieval movies.While most battle scenes were not choreographed uniquely enough, the filming angles and cinematography were tasteful. Some scenes went so far as to make me beg for 3D, but there weren't enough to warrant the ""upgrade."" The CGI was amazing with the animals, fairies, troll, and shard soldiers. Now, the costume designers made a name for themselves. From the Huntsman to Gus, each costume was well-thought and gave each character good context.Speaking of character, there were several golden eggs. Hemsworth, for example, proves his worth once again as the Huntsman, layering grief from his wife's death with his tired, unmotivated way of battle, until Snow White rekindles his hope in something beyond the black reign of Ravenna. Kristen Stewart's acting performance, however, closely resembles the previous sentence: long and eventually boring. She seems to tell rather than show, in many circumstances. While she certainly is pale, I believe Sanders would be better off having chosen a different heroine. (Hailee Steinfeld, who's proved wrong those concerned with her age, or, dare I say it, Saiorse Ronan, maybe? She'd look good in black hair)While this is definitely not the style of Tim Burton, I still wouldn't recommend taking children to see this. There are several disturbing scenes near the beginning, regarding the Queen stealing beauty. There is likewise a lot of battle violence throughout the movie, and that is not good for young eyes. The Queen disrobes twice, showing only her upper back, so be warned.Because of the 2D, and Kristen Stewart's performance, I'd say you won't miss much if you wait until it comes to DVD. It's worth it in theaters, but much, much more so at Redbox."
638,"What can I say, just makes no sence as in nonsence and the two main actresses were miscast or having a bad day. The most frightening thing was that some producer actually thought it was worth making."
639,I liked this more than I expected to and my girlfriend really enjoyed it. Many exciting moments and some fine fights. Chris Hemsworth was good as the hero and Charlize Theron was both villainous and lovely as the Queen. The title character was nicely played but they should have picked an actress who could pass for 'the fairest of them all'. Oh well. The dwarfs were good fun and the Queen's evil brother was delightfully dastardly. All CGI of course but it looked good.
640,"I think Stewart's performance is good, the war scene in the movie is also okay, it is still worth watching"
641,"At the theater it was bad ass girls and a fair retelling of the classic story. I remember some stunning visuals and now, 6 years later I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fairytale movie fix ."
642,I did not like Stewart! Bad casting. The rest of the cast did a great job!
643,I have 8 point this film only because Charlize Theron! Kristen i dont like you in this role! Kristn didnt play like real Snow White! Snow White has ethnic and dramatic personality and Kristn didnt show this performans to me. Charlize!!! she is beautiful and amazing!!! Adorable!!!
644,"One of the best High fantasy Movies,
Stunning VFX...
Also Cast, Dialogues, story everything is just tremendous..
I really Liked the film
Best Regards"
645,"Great movie!!! Not the biggest Snow White fan, but this movie gave it all to all to like. Graphics were great, in 2012 too. They chose big actors of the time then too. Good movie if you haven't seen it yet!!"
646,"Deserve better rating than this
it has to be 9\10 or higher"
647,"the costumes, the atmosphere, the tension, the confrontation. and reasonable performances. enough for a film who gives other version to a classic fairy tale. dark, interesting, fascinating in few scenes, a film for adults more than for kids, mixing the Medieval fragments with a sort of bitter poetry of image.not a revelation. but one of films who defines entertainment and gives the chance to discover the flavor of a form of, maybe not real authentic, childhood, with its scary sides and heroic sides.its basic virtue - to propose two admirable actresses in real provocative roles. with a not bad result."
648,"When Snow White was a little child, her mother died, leaving behind a desperate King not knowing what to do with his life. After a battle with the dark forces, he finds Ravenna as prisoner and astonished by her beauty, he marries her the same day. From then, all chaos breaks loose. The King is assassinated by his wife and she becomes the cruel and dark ruler who kills innocent without mercy. Show White manages to escape from her imprisonment after many years, is found in the dark forest by a Huntsman who abandons his mission of killing her while promising to help her return to Duke Hammond from where she can start avenging her father.This movie begins completely wrong in my opinion. It wants to make you believe that a king would marry any prisoner, traitor, convict (however you want to call it) just because she's beautiful and then being killed by her so easily...it simply puzzles you. All the plot is filled with such lack of logic, I mean, how can you believe that the Huntsman can love her more than William after he abandoned her without any remorse (and then coming back to ""save"" her like nothing had happened)? How can you believe that a castle can be attacked by an army, led by a girl who knows absolutely nothing about war and battle, which has a plan based on pure luck and that it survives long enough in front of that castle (being shot at by archers and balilsta for quite some time) to fight a whole army inside it as well? Furthermore, although I admit that Kristen's role isn't very well put together, she doesn't seem to do anything to make it look any better. Everything regarding the story looks so superficial, so badly put together...makes you wonder, Is this another episode of Twilight? Even the ending is bad...she gets her crown and black screen...The End. No honors? No Party? No nothing...not even thanks to all those who helped along the way...pathetic. Lucky for this movie is that it compensates with great animations and superb landscapes. They sort of take your attention away from the awful plot. Without them, it would have been almost worthless. An average movie, just to be kind with it"
649,"Another Maleficent knockoff, meh.Good CGI, good cinematography, average everything else, plot quite warped from the fairy-tale.Quite dark and disturbing in parts.Watch it if you want to, but don't expect a masterpiece."
650,"I Should Have Gave My Money To A Stray Dog....POSSABLE Spoiler ALERT: There Is Literally NOTHING REDEEMABLE about this movie or about the Blu-Ray Pakage itself,(1= This Movies is 22 hours long...(2= The Extras are pointless and dull...(3= I tried to but a Once Upon A Time spin on it by using there the Once Upon A Time Names and faces to it ex: Snow White = Mary Marget Thacher and Evil Queen = Ragina etc... and even that is enough to make the movie experience enjoyable. Or redeemable...(4= This is the only movie that I could recall that I bought and watched once over and dumped right way just after propessly scratching both discs so that no one else well have to watch what I watched so in other words. I speared some one else from watching that piece of 'something' of movie. Like I am doing now with this dilated review. (5= After watching this piece of 'something' of a movie I had to right away wash my eyes out by watching, the first two discs of the first season of (ABC's) Once Upon A Time. In addition I had to watched the movie Enchanted (not that I think that movie is that much better) the next day.And those are some of the problems of this piece of'something' of a movie etc.I'm Surprised they even made a sequel to this 'something' of a movie, I just hope that the sequel is better. It feels like every word that comes out of the Evil Queens mouth (Snow White and The Hunts Man)she is either screaming and shouting or that it is screeching her lines. And as for Snow white (Snow White And The Hunts Man) I can't stop seeing her with that disgust/regret look in her eyes through out the entire movie. First she starts off being an innocent madden princess, then some how all of sudden she becomes a strong warrior out for justice against the Evil Queen. Where did she learned that? Huh? As for the Evil Queen her back story is broken at best, the only part that i like is when the Evil Queen emerges from that milk wax bath thing or what ever it supposed to be is. And not even that is enough to redeem this movie. The only reason that this movie gets a one star/score is because of the milk bath thing, but as I have said not even that is enough to redeem this movie or package. And you can't go lower than one on hare. DON'T WATCH IT YOU WELL REGRET IT THIS I Promise YOU, you're better off doing one of two things (1= Spending that money on something a lot better any thing Me: Yeah NO Duh Sherlock (2= (A= As I have stated giving that money to a stray dog or (B= Using it as a target practice or an art project."
651,"I was originally pretty darn exciting for this real life somewhat dark version of the classic snow white and the huntsman. But then I actually saw it lol. The visuals certainly did not fall flat or disappoint. But this is something I am continuing to see more recently, and that is films with good visual effects, but the storyline does not hold up like the effects do. I had the exact same problem with the Johnny Depp Alice in Wonderland, and The man from U.N.C.L.E., effects above storyline. I will however say that Charlize Theron gave a good performance as Queen Ravenna. She gave the role power and seemed genuinely evil, really gave it her all, but unfortunately even her performance mixed with the effects could not save the film from boredom. The middle of the movie just has no substance and falls flat with boredom. I appreciate the effort, but the effort ended up with failure. Kristen Stewart is just so-so with starring role, she seems a little emotionless at times. Chris Hemsworth was OK as well, looked good, he certainly is the correct physical type to be the huntsman. A 4/10."
652,"Actually, movie deserves a 7, but...: I liked it at first, but around midway, the dwarfs, for crying out loud, the cracks immediately showed! Okay in the original fairy-tale, but they were totally out of place in the big budget presentation then, Snow White became Joan of Arc. Once she adorns that breast plate she becomes a coldly militant femiNazi and the people who love that stuff are femiNazis themselves, and it goes without saying they'd get a thrill out of it and cheer for the movie, but from my point of view, once Snow White is the Iron Lady, the movie is scrap-yard material.I had my doubts about Kristen Stewart the moment I laid eyes on the DVD box cover. Looks so cold, so hard. But in the movie itself, especially as she lies there, with that close-up on her angelic face, wow, she sure is pretty. But for Snow White, she should have been presented in a far less uneven way.Charlize Theron was magnificent as the Evil Queen Ravenna. I was going to say she is the best thing about the movie, but in all fairness, when Kristen gets it right, she is quite the glorious thing as well. But Charlize is the one with the powerful seamless performance."
653,"When I looked at who was in the movie, Charlize Theron had me convinced that it should be worth seeing. No disappointment there. She absolutely nailed her part as the evil queen. However, I have to agree with the other reviews on Kristen Stewart (although I think they are a little extreme). I thought she was good as Joan Jett in the 2010 movie ""The Runaways."" But she is not the right person to play Snow White. I know it's not supposed to be an exact copy of the original story, and I can respect that. A lot of the differences were actually kind of cool. The dwarfs, for example, were more realistic, but still very entertaining. The end was a real disappointment. Who gets the girl, ""William"" the prince, or ""Eric"" (the Huntsman)? The movie ends while we are waiting to find out. I might give this movie a generous 2.5 out of 5 star rating."
654,"I don't know what people expect and why this movie is rated so low so I have to add my review because due to this I was almost skipping it, and I just watched it after five years of its release. Just to remind myself and to my posterity this is not a bad movie at all. It contains a long series of great actors, amazing fantasy and stunning visual effects, costumes, beautiful soundtrack by the great James Newton Howard, spectacular photography. I just realizing now it is well deserved Oscar nominated and won rightly a lot of awards.The plot could not be original and something just seen before, a sort of snow white restyling, but still, all in all, a very well done fairy tale and epic in its adventure, action, cgi and set value. There is everything inside: battles, castles, witches, enchanted woods, dwarfs, trolls, spells and magic, a feast for the eyes.As for Kristen Stewart, I didn't even saw her before and didn't watched the twilight series, they are not my cup of tea, but in this movie she look pretty. Charlize Theron still beautiful and talented as always.Just the effect and the soundtrack is a ten out of ten, so rating this movie, one, four stars it is really absurd and too severe, but overall it is presumptuous in regard to those who have worked hard, and they put their effort as is obvious in every second of the film. Great fairy tale movie and almost flawless making.9/10"
655,"There was one thing and one thing only that really ruined this movie, and that was the awful casting choice that was Kristen Stewart. Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth, and Sam Claflin were all great choices for their roles. They gave wonderful performances and only added to what would have been a great film, were it not for the casting of Stewart. Not only was she a bad choice for Snow White because she really can not compare to Theron as ""fairest of them all"", but her acting was bland and emotionless, as it is known to be for good reason. Every time there was a closeup on here face and it was clear there was a certain emotion she was meant to be portraying, it was the same awkward look. At one point it was clear she was supposed to be giving a loving glance towards another character, but the grimace she gave came across as if she was in pain. And that was only one of many instances.That said, there are good things to be said about this film. The visual effects, for one, are stunning. If beautiful fantasy sceneries and creatures are your thing, it's worth a watch simply for that one fact. The Sanctuary scene in particular was beautiful. Another is the little tidbits in the film, whether they be certain nods to the original fairytale and Disney movie even though there were many things changed, or details that you would need to be watching closely to catch and aren't gone into detail. (SPOILER: the witch is crazy and the mirror isn't magic at all.) It keeps one engaged, finding all these little extra things hidden in plain sight, and I personally loved it. And the changes to the story themselves keep the plot interesting, which I thoroughly enjoyed.That's not to say it didn't have other downsides. The film felt a little slow and there were certain aspects that could have been played with more. But the thing that really brought this film down was the a bad choice for the lead role. All in all I would rewatch this movie for many reasons, but Stewart's acting means it's not one I would recommend."
656,"(67%) With lowish expectations due in no small part to the so-so reviews I trundled to the cinema (cheap day special) for at best some mild entertainment and not a whole lot more. Though what I got was quite rare these days: a genuinely nice surprise. I have seen this twice now and I stand by my claim that this is one of the best movie adaptations of a fairy tale out there. What I like most of all is that it's a film for the whole family to enjoy, from little kids, teens, to adults, there's at least something here to keep almost anyone amused. This isn't of perfect of course, for instance the plot is a little wonky and you could pick this apart if you wanted to, but the fact remains that this is still a well- paced, action-packed, well-made, well-shot, at times quite creepy hit that I will stand by as a unloved entry into the fantasy genre."
657,"Even though I had not been a Twilight fan and Kristen Stewart's acting had bored me, I still gave this movie a shot because of Charlize Theron and the stunning visual effect presented in the trailer. Well, it turned out that that's basically the point of the entire movie. What could not be neglect were plot holes after plot holes, interwoven by the incredibly sloppy pace of the story, and that gave us, in the end, a tedious fairy tale. Nonetheless, Charlize Theron's performance was thrilling. To sum up, the way the director presents the script and a bit of Stewart's boring facial expression poisoned the whole movie. Maleficient is way better, personally speaking."
658,"I like the movie, as there are lots of actions, adventure, magic.... However, there is too little about the romantic relationship!! But I don't like the ending!!! Before the movie ends, the relationship of Snow White, the Huntsman and William was a bit complicated. I think that something should be added to make their relationship clearer to the audience, not only Snow White and the Huntsman looking at each other and end the movie. I don't mind the movie become longer, but it didn't state clearly about the relationship between 3 of them, like did Snow White loves the Huntsman or William. Hope new movie coming in 2016 will be better than this one."
659,"This was an entertaining adventure movie, but nothing more. I have seen better B-movies. (I'd rather not mention this, but I have to be honest: I actually enjoyed Estella Warren in Beauty and the Beast ten times more. This doesn't mean I have no taste. I just like to have a good laugh. This film wasn't funny at all.) It was much too long for what it had to offer, and on the other hand I expected to learn more about Ravenna's earlier life - or lives. In other words, there was too much superfluous stuff put in and essential - or at least interesting - things left out. There were only four real characters: Snow White, the nice one; Ravenna, the evil one; the Huntsman, the brave, loyal and nice one; and Ravenna's brother, the other evil one. I didn't care for anyone else. When Gus the dwarf was killed I just shrugged. One dance with Snowy and you'd have to take a liking to him? As for William, just what did he do? I was so relieved at the end of the film that at least he and Snow White didn't get married. Even in that scene when they were alone together (even though that's Ravenna in disguise, not the valiant knight) there were no sparks. But then both actors' poor acting had something to do with that.Kristen Stewart may be a pretty face, but she was totally miscast in the title role. I don't watch Twilight, or that sort of movies, but I expect a decent actress to star in a movie like this. In the 1980s there was the Brat Pack: a new generation of very competent young actors. There are lots of them now as well, like Jennifer Lawrence. Surely another innocent yet fiery young lady could have got the part? As for Charlize Theron, she has done better (and worse, like in Prometheus). She is the most beautiful actress in Hollywood (or should I say, the world?), and since ""Monster"" I consider her one of the best as well. But here I found her not convincing at all. If she's evil, why make us feel pity for her? If she's a victim herself, why not explore this theme and make her a tragical character?Snow White and the Huntsman is not a bad movie. The scenery and the special effects are perfect. The battles are realistic, though not overwhelming. It's the script that doesn't seem right. It's full a clich√©s. And of course there's the wooden acting of the main characters. You just can't identify with any of them: certainly not Snow White herself, but not even the huntsman, who doesn't seem to know whether he's coming or going. Nor can you believe in Ravenna. I'm neither a republican nor a royalist, but when Snowy was crowned at the end of the movie (without showing any consideration for either the huntsman - apart from a tear - or William) I sighed in relief and thought, Thank goodness it's all over. These nice people now have a new Queen. Good for them. End titles, please!Watching this movie is not a waste of time. But there are zillions of better things to do."
660,"I don't mind style-over-substance films, I really don't. Some of my all-time favorite films have more visual splendor than strong story; however, those films are usually doing one of two things: 1) revolutionizing in the visuals department, or 2) have a story that's good enough to keep one entertained. Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) does neither of these things.The visuals are pretty and the color scheme is ideal for the Snow White story, but the story and characters are so laughably lame. The Huntsman, with his clich√©d back story and stereotypically brooding manner, holds no interest whatsoever. Snow White has little depth and is poorly acted by Kirsten Stewart, big problems for a heroine to possess in a story which hinges upon having three-dimensional characters. The dwarfs are all forgettable. Charlize Theron's evil queen is the most memorable of the lot, but even she is unable to hold your interest for long.The plot is basically Snow White with LOTR-style battles, because CG fight scenes and moments ripped from better movies (ex. that one scene in the woods which rips off of Princess Mononoke) are all the film has to offer us.Mirror, Mirror (2012), another Snow White adaptation from the same year, is a better film. It's just as beautiful with its costumes and settings. Yes, it's fluff, and not particularly memorable fluff at that, but it's a lot more entertaining and the characters actually seem to possess inner life. It has it all over this ""epic"" and ""dark"" mess."
661,"The film starts by telling us how beautiful is the young princess, Snow White, but while the young actress is pretty enough, she isn't prettier than other young girls. She doesn't resemble a pageant winner. Kristen Stewart, who plays the mature Snow White, seems to me to have 2 unusually large front teeth. She never in this film has ""skin as white as snow"" except when she is supposedly dead, and never has ""lips as red as blood (or lips as red as rose, depending on the story version). The evil queen (Charlize Theron) is more beautiful except when she is shown as aging. The Queen's aging in this film is supposedly reversed by her sucking the beauty out of young girls, who then become old hags. But in the film she is rapidly aging in some scenes while in the next scene she is back to her original beauty, with no explanation. Snow White escapes from the cell in a tower where she has been kept for years. The Queen is distraught and orders her evil brother to find her and bring her back. But in a later scene the Queen has used magic to locate and poison Snow White all be herself. Why then did she need to send her brother and a small army to find her? Part of the story has the animal world enchanted by her, but some in the ""dark forest"" frighten her and definitely seem unfriendly, with the exception of a science fiction beast that fights Snow White's escort but then becomes docile when it approaches Snow White.While the story line is inconsistent, the special effects are very good, if unnecessary and not all particularly original. In most Snow White stories the magic mirror displays a face in the mirror that answers the ""who's the fairest in the land"" question. In this version of Snow White the mirror melts into a liquid mass that forms a man-like 3-D figure to answer the question. Clearly this was done just to demonstrate that the special effects crew knows how to do that. (The same kind of liquid metal effect was first done in Terminator-2 way back in 1991.)"
662,"Now, with a year of hindsight, I revisit this film.There are some excellent performances in this production, most especially all the ancillary characters. For example, the Dwarfs. Except Bob Hoskins (who isn't asked to act with his cryptic dialogue, ""She's of the blood!"", honestly).Each dwarf lives the part, each has an internal motivation, each has character.The major characters (Snow White, Queen, Huntsman...) are wooden and dead. Eye candy. The Motivation of each is all too clinical... but not felt by the audience. Snow White seems to stupid to be a force for good. The Huntsman is a romantic lead... then not... then again. The Queen, who is apparently a shape shifter, takes the LONG LONG LONG route of yelling at everyone to do her work.Overall, some excellent production, some very excellent performances, unfortunately not by the major names."
663,"This could have been so much bigger. Yes, the story is old and we all know the outcome, but the budget could have built an epic of this.Having said that, my biggest issue is the casting. Charlize Theron is possibly the most naturally beautiful woman of this area. Diane Lane being the crown holder from the 80's and 90's.Then we have the always sour and grumpy looking Kristen Stewart. Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the blandest of them all. Perhaps Mila Kunis could have been cast in this role. But Kristen Stewart??? I won't get into the story, that info can be found on the movie's page. But it seemed to try to be more than it was. I'm sorry, I just can't get past the idea of Kristen Stewart being more beautiful than Charlize Theron. I'm sorry, I just can't get passed that."
664,"Charlize Theron is the only reason I gave this movie a 4. Other than her, the movie is a complete disaster. Charlize is a true Oscar-winner leading actress. In my opinion, her queen is far better than Julia Robert's. The cast of Snow White is a big mistake. She looks more like a vampire than a princess. And what about the 'pure and innocent' aspect of Snow White? Who could tell me where exactly she acted 'pure' or 'innocent'? She is manipulative avenger. The cast of young Snow White is also a mistake. Don't get me wrong, the little girl is cute. But her freckles make her a bad choice for this role. (Again, I am not saying the freckles make her not pretty. I am just saying the role of Snow White needs to have perfect skin tone.)"
665,"Kristen Stewart (Snow White) the main character just ruined the pace and mood of the film with her horrendous attempt at a British accent and the equally or perhaps even far worse cringe-worthy speech she gave towards the climax of the film. I really loved the dark and edgier retelling of the classic tale and how they made the huntsman fall in love with snow white but when the main character exudes a personality as icy as that of her evil step-mother, it just all becomes a polarising hot mess. I'm giving it 5 out of 10 stars because there were many note worthy performances and great moments in the film in spite of Stewart's awkward acting display. Bob Hoskins in one of his final on-screen roles as one of the seven dwarfs being one of them."
666,"When my wife said this week's rental was Snow White, I thought ""no thanks.. not in mood for another take on the old fairy tale"".Well, this movie is NOT the kiddie version! The visuals in this movie are mouth watering, state of the art, absolutely captivating start to finish. It meshes remarkable raw beauty of scenery (the rugged Isle of Skye) with top notch artistic effects. Looking to justify your top of the line home theater? This is as good a pick as any. Even in standard def, your eyes and ears are in for a treat.But that doesn't mean you won't get wrapped up in the story itself. Theron offers a masterful role interpretation, often adorned by wicked special effects. Nice surprise!"
667,"Charlize, Chris, and the stunning visual effects are what makes this movie. The so-so plot (some parts so ridiculously cheesy that it literally makes you lol) and the terrible, unbelievable acting by Kristen Stewart are what ruins this movie. It took me forever to watch because I knew Stewart's acting was going to be bad and when I finally folded, she didn't disappoint. Why on earth does anyone want to cast her in anything? I wonder if she actually feels any emotion at all in real life because she sure doesn't ever show any form of it when she's on screen (that's believable at least.) You can decide from there on whether or not it's worth it...it's a coin toss."
668,"This movie has it all, both sides of bad acting, stupid fight scenes, and no logic at all. The first fight scene with the coal(?) knights was pretty cool, but the rest was just boring, and dragged out. Snow White was played by the worst actor ever: Kristen Stewart, escapes prison after 10 years of being locked up or something, and she can move without any problems, though her muscles should've been pretty untrained. She finds a white horse at the shore, that is there because, WHY? Then the queen's overacting brother tries to catch her in some ""scary"" forest. Then the huntsman steps in, and catches her, but flees with her instead, of course. Then they find some weird women in the forest. the enemies burn down their home, thanks to Snow White, but the women aren't angry... Then they find the dwarfs, who aren't even actual dwarfs, but CGI animated. They go to some secret place, that is unaffected by the queen's doing, god knows why. Then they meet some weird reindeer, or whatever, and a cheap jump-scare wants to join the fun! The enemies are defeated, but JUST before they retreat, one of the dwarfs is killed, so they can be 7 dwarfs, WHY have that extra one, he does NOTHING. Oh no, this guy we barely know is dead, I'm so sad! Then they join Snow White's old friends, and the fight can begi- NOPE! They just skip directly to Snow White's lame fight with the queen. The queen dies, end of story. Seriously, I saw a fight scene from Twilight in a trailer on TV, and these are almost as bad, and Kristen Stewart isn't better in this role. She smiled ONCE... for half a second, and even that looked bad. The scenes are either standard and forgettable, or simply f*cking terrible. This Movie sucked."
669,"Snow White (Kristen Stewart) escapes and the Queen (Charlize Theron) sends her men, led by a local huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), to bring her back.Let's put the scandal aside first and just ignore it. Let's look at movie by itself. I like dark look of the movie. But there isn't much more to the movie to like. Kristen Stewart is wooden. Heck everybody is wooden. There's no chemistry between anybody. For the most part, the Queen is strutting around in her castle. Other than the visual design, there is nothing magically about this movie."
670,"After a long wait, I finally was able to watch ""Snow white and the Huntsman"" . I was very excited to watch this movie since it seemed to be a darker and more adult version of the famous tale. I wasn't disappointed with how darker and sinister it was, and Charlize Theron really brought the Evil Queen to life. This being said, I only watched about 30 minutes of the movie. The dark mood was there, the tragedy of a fallen kingdom, a little girl becoming an orphan and then being trapped... it was wonderful, until Kristen Stewart came in to scene.Before I get any negative comments on why I am saying I didn't like Kristen Stewarts performance, take in account I actually am a fan of Kristen Stewart. I watched the Twlight Saga religiously and she does her part well, and I liked her performance in Zathura, but I think she wasn't right for such a part.After about 10 minutes into the scene with Kristen Stewart running from the castle, I wasn't able to watch it anymore. She lacked the intensity the character demanded, and it became so bad at a certain point, I actually gave up on watching the movie I had waited so long to watch.I'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but she did seem quite expressionless in this movie. Overall, from what I watched, the soundtrack was inviting, the rest of the actors did their part well, and the backgrounds and outfits were absolutely amazing."
671,"This movie was a huge disappointment! The positive early reviews, Charlize Theron's involvement and the trailers sparked my interests but after watching the film I felt like I have wasted both my money and time on this irritating film! Kristen Stewart was totally miscast! She cannot act and should stick on to films where she can play date with her vampire bf. Chris Hamesworth wasn't good as well. The only reason I gave this films 3 stars is because of the cinematography and Charlize Theron's portrayal of The villain! Although Charlize didn't deliver much, she is , without any doubt the best part of the movie.Don't waste your time watching this! 3/10"
672,"Spoilers due to a lot of personal opinion about what I see as parallels to stories like this one.Snow White And The Huntsman (2012) and Mirror Mirror (2012), two stories that take a common theme from different angles. Mirror as nice and fun, so why do I find it easier to re-watch the other, this scarier one? Taking them as abstract, pure fiction, then Mirror. Except that I tend to prefer to consider these as stories about the real world.England, the 1980's, I tended to wonder if the UK was redressing social imbalance by not identifying the real flaws in the old regimes, just hitting back. Not really Snow White, but it seemed so at the time.The 1990's, when I ate up travel stories about Romania I came across a description of that country having been in the middle ages. I did not know how to interpret that but England in 2013 is starting to tell me something about it. Finian's Rainbow (1968) has the memorable phrase, 'Forward To The Past'. Some supporters of the current UK regime definitely dream of returning to an England of the social structure of the time of Jane Austen. This Snow White speaks a lot to me of the England of 2013. I interpret Government frugality as creating a middle ages condition rather than solving any other economic aims, a view that stems from me knowing nothing about Economics.Different possibilities. When a storyteller talks of a big bad witch or an alien I often wonder if the bad guy is just the underclasses, the dispossessed, being given a black paint job yet again. England has many scapegoat classes these days. I distrust Occam, but the Occam interpretation that I make is of the witch symbolising the de facto power structure, supposedly Westminster in the lead but who knows how many power interests are pulling hidden strings. Does that say that I should interpret Westminster as an inert puppet fighting scapegoats? Very Huntsman and Mirror, Mirror, it would also explain a lot about modern Britain, leading politicians are supposed to be sensible and worthwhile? So, these two stories, I find that they do have a lot of scope for triggering harmless daydreaming about the nature of the modern world. Welcome To The Rileys (2010), ditto, Kristen portraying a gargoyle who was created from age four by way of a hard knock life.The modern world is getting torn apart by fundamentalist droves of a whole range of types. Slytherin is dominant. Those who still try to live by religious beliefs appear to live in a minefield that can sweep their sense away. Political fundamentalism since the 1980's appears to have been moving Britain towards the violent world shown by such as Detroit Rock City (1999) of the USA worlds, the population encouraged to get corrective with the scapegoat classes. One law for the population, another for the scapegoats. Mirror, Mirror, Snow White. I tried to face that in my IMDb review of Alexa Vega's Innocent (2009) but something in my review, who knows what?, got it bombed out. Rather than try a version 2 of that I am writing this review about Snow White and Mirror Mirror instead. Not that Kristen and Alexa are actually locked up in prisons in Snow White's world. Or are they? The UK as schizophrenogenic. Sin City (2005).Innocent, a clear part of the modern world. The police not being able to respond fast enough because of access hurdles. Two police who allowed their hungers to sidetrack them away from good practice. The bad guy, just released from prison, who is a puppet emptied of sensible ways. Urgh aarrgh.The words urgh and argh or aarrgh or aaarghh, etc, are not in my UK dictionary of 1998. My loss, but they are in some internet dictionaries. I would not be surprised to find it in this or Mirror, Mirror. Not in Innocent as that is way more serious. I mention that because of the reaction that this feature inspires in me. My general viewpoint is that English society has been mauling itself on the two fangs of how I interpret Genesis Cain. My viewpoint is near certain to be askew as it is based on the religion in Genesis and I tend to get religion wrong in a big way. The 'good' getting corrupted by such as 'vengeance culture', it is Huntsman that has clear comments about this aspect."
673,"It coulda been a contenda! Yes, this movie that was visually thrilling could have been much more, but that is not what they were after. Instead of a great film, they were looking to get the most bucks from fans of Kristen Stewart (Razzie for Worst Actress) and Chris Hemsworth (darling of People's Choice, MTV, and Teen Choice awards).Oscar Winner Charlize Theron (Monster) was magnificent. Seeing her listed third on the credits is clear evidence that they were just after money in making this film.Maybe director Rupert Sanders was more interested in love-making than film-making. Maybe he can avoid these problems when he makes Van Helsing. This was his first directorial effort, after all.What a waste of Theron's talents."
674,"I really tried to watch this movie. Made it through after 3rd time. Old saying, ""third time pays for all"". Well I paid dearly. Time i will never get back. what to say about Charlize Theron? Complete embarrassment here. Did she not see dailies? Did no one on set dare say to her ""no my dear, this is too much"". No director/direction to say ""can you reign it in a little"". One always has heard that acting is often close to making a foll of ones' self. In this instance, in that regard, Charlize Theron achieved that goal most efficiently. As did most of the cast. And the direction. OMG. So sad. Overacting and underacting. What a mess. What a dog of a movie."
675,"Seeing the poster for the movie, you know that this is heading away from the traditional fairy tale. That makes it interesting. And that is the only thing. Somewhere along the way in this movie, the plot tends to unwind. Often times, there is no link between what is happening and how it is relevant to the story. The storyline doesn't weave an intense enough portrayal of the trials and tribulations of the protagonist. What makes it worse is the acting or lack of it thereof, especially from the movie's title protagonist. Kirsten Stewart goes through the whole movie with one expression on her face (if it can be called that!). Even though her role has strength in it, she has not done any justice to it. She cannot bring out the innocence or the beauty or purity of the character that was Snow White. Charlize Theron as the Queen plays her part well. The role of the Huntsman again has not enough meat to it.Overall-the story could have been portrayed much better. Definitely a more believable Snow White could have been found."
676,"We all know the Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This production revisits the traditional story, and expands the fairy tale world to include much darker tones to the somewhat innocent setting familiar to us. The huntsman, tasked by the evil queen to find Snow White and bring her heart back, has a more developed character in this movie and is played with gusto by Chris Hemsworth, of Thor fame. A generally enjoyable fare, especially the amazing performance by Charlize Theron. She is the real anchor of the movie, creating a surprisingly complex figure, with almost mythical overtones.Unfortunately, Kirsten Stewart is completely miscast in this movie. Her pouty demeanour and emo sensibility,so appropriate to the teenage angst vein mined by the Twilight series, is ineffectual here. It is not that she is a bad actress; but her limited range is better used in other film genres. What would have been appropriate here is an actress akin to Claire Danes in Stardust, a winning mix of believable innocence and untapped strength. Still worth watching for Charlize Theron."
677,"Great cinematography, wonderful score and nice special effects. Aside from that a disappointing movie. The cast was not convincing, the plot and dialogue was weak, and the better parts of the movie seemed out of place with the rest of the story, which seemed as if it had all been done better before.There was an overall lack of coherence in this film, which left me with more questions than answers at its conclusion.It is also tough for me to see why a director would choose to make a fairytale into a darker movie full of battle-scenes. A movie full of potential, but for me not a movie to remember."
678,"This is a Dark Fantasy that is quite Removed from the Disneyesque version and is a Live Action Adventure with a Doom Laden Atmosphere and could be a not so friendly Entertainment for Small Children.But, it isn't a bad Diversion. A sort of a Grim Fairy Tale with maybe just a few too many Modern Sensibilities that keep it from being Unique or Unusual. It looks like so many other Films with its Dirty, Stark, Blue-Green and Black Template. It really does Nothing New to reach for Admiration or Respect. It is done like so much Product.There is an Eye-Fetching and Enchanting Trip to the Lighter and Brighter side of the Landscape with a lot of Cool Creatures and Winking Mushrooms. There are fluttering Cute Fairies and Animals with a few Fantastical and Friendly Critters making their mark in this otherwise Unremarkable Movie. Unfortunately their Screen Time is Brief.The Characters are Barely Engaging and the Script/Story is Unconvincing and there is a Dank and Wet Production and along with the less than inspiring Ending it ultimately leaves the Viewer with an Unsatisfying Feeling."
679,"First, there may be one or two spoilers here, but its honestly nothing too much.OK, so the movie starts of really well. The intro battle scene and the raiding of the castle are pretty awesome. The young Snow White and the other characters really drew me into the plot and I really wanted to continue.Fast forward 20 minutes: Kristen Stewart is introduced and immediately ruins this movie. Hands down.The acting of Theron and Hemsworth, along with the action, and a bit of humor from the seven dwarfs really would have made this a very enjoyable movie. BUT, the emotionless, one faced, talentless acting of the vampire wench sucked the life out of this movie faster than the evil queen did from the young women. It was bad. If this had been any other actress, I believe I could have given this an 8 out of 10. Since I could not get over the fact that she was so terrible, I have to give it a 5 out of 10 and that is extremely generous. I used to make fun of her even though I had never seen her in action in those Tw*l*ght movies. Now I can justify everything bad I ever said about her."
680,"I am writing this review from the stand-point of a movie, not an adaptation or accuracy to the fairy tale. Snow White and the Huntsman has the star cast and talent to make it a great film. However, the director becomes too focused on the fairytale aspect that the characters were given hardly any focus. The film starts off at a fast pace. The cinematography and costumes are great, immediately captivating the viewers. As new characters are introduced, the director builds a sense of suspense on the role of the characters in aiding or hampering the quest for Snow White's survival. But it was obvious that the goal of the movie was not to focus on the characters but the setting; the enchanted forest and whatever that place was with the living flowers...This becomes an issue as the setting overshadows the characters of the Huntsman and the dwarfs leaving the viewers with no connection with them and also slowing the pace of the movie greatly. I felt no connection with the characters, which is a huge flaw as it was never apparent why Snow White's survival was important. The actors deserved more screen time. I thought Theron was spectacular in her role. I personally thought it was an opportunity wasted but still deserves a watch at least for the cool special effects and costumes and of course, Charlize Theron!"
681,"Pretty much as expected, the storyline doesn't leave much space for the performers to impress us. But isn't the scenery in Pembrokeshire just wonderful? So are the white hart and everything in the Sanctuary. Unfortunately there is Kristen Stuart, who speaks and behaves exactly the same as she did ""in the land of women"". With huntsman and William around, I almost thought it was ""twilight"" coming back again. Thank god, at least in this film no one had to show their muscles or pale cheeks over and over again. To my surprise, the romantic elements are covered by a painted veil in a rather poetic way. It could've been a much better movie if they found a decent leading actress."
682,"Rupert Sanders's 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a typical Hollywood adaptation of the Grimm's fairy tale. There are some new twists and elements of darkness but it never exceeds the 'not worth more than a one time watch' value. Starting with 'what's good about it', the visuals have the desired effect. I particularly liked the look of the dark forest (and the bright one). The sequences with the seven little people were a delight. I only wish they had more scenes. Actors Ian McShane, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones and co do a splendid job. Last but not least, Charlize Theron does a terrific job. She is suitably over the top (after all Queen Ravenna is a fairy tale villain) but she also displays a human side to the evil Queen, playing her part to the T. Moving to the flaws, there are plenty. The writers really play it safe. In my opinion, they should have explored the dark themes more but given that it's meant to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster, they chicken out. Character development is poor. After spending years locked up in the dungeon (since the age of 8), Snow white still seems to be the skilled sword fighter. One will come across many such inconsistencies and plot holes. Kirsten Stewart may have attracted more popularity among the young crowd but where acting is concerned, she fails to impress. Ditto for Chris Hemsworth.As mentioned earlier, it's a forgettable film that doesn't warrant more than one viewing. However, if one does decide to watch it, I'd suggest seeing it with the family."
683,"This is a technically superb piece of film making which is unfortunately let down by a lack of character development and some dodgy acting. The weakest part of the movie is casting Kriten Stewart who is just not sympathetic or beautiful enough to convince and her bland acting makes it hard to empathize with her. Charlize Theron is a fine actress but she seems a bit uncomfortable as the Queen. Nicole Kidman played a similar type of role in ""The Golden Compass"" with silky assurance and I would have expected something similar from Theron. This leads me to assume that the director is not skilled at getting good performances out of his actors. And the fact that the evil Queen is far more beautiful than Snow White does unhinge any credibility the story may have with the audience. The film becomes more interesting when Chris Hemsworth finally comes on screen after 34 minutes. At times it seems that he is impersonating Sean Connery but he is a good fit as the Huntsman and has a commanding physical screen presence. His character unfortunately does not get enough screen time or development. The one thing the film does nail is what could have been the cheesiest part of the story and that is the portrayal of the 7 dwarfs. Using character actors and giving them the best lines helps to keep the film entertaining, apart from Bob Hoskins who has to deliver some truly awful dialogue. The amazing special effects used to film the dwarfs are a major plus. All in all, what I expected, but could have been 7 or 8 stars with a better actress in the lead role and developing the Huntsmans part more."
684,"In a twist to the fairy tale, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) ordered to take Snow White (Kristen Stewart) into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen (Charlize Theron).The film was overshadowed by the gossip surrounding an affair between Stewart and director Rupert Sanders. While this would generally bring extra attention to a film, I feel like it did not happen here and almost no one saw the picture -- but with a box office figure of $396 million, I am apparently wrong! The film was the 15th top-grossing picture of 2012.Rotten Tomatoes sums up the film by saying, ""While it offers an appropriately dark take on the fairy tale that inspired it"", the movie ""is undone by uneven acting, problematic pacing, and a confused script."" This is a fair assessment. I like the concept of making the fairy tale darker, and some attempts of that were made here (though probably not enough) with the use of ravens and plenty of action. But then you have Kristen Stewart -- one of the worst actresses ever to reach stardom -- in the title role. You get a lot of fumbling, awkward gestures and lip-biting. This is not the strong young woman who will lead a nation into battle. How she won a Teen Choice Award for this is beyond me... but then she also is nominated for a Razzie, so maybe that balances it out. (Seriously, even a Teen Choice is too good for her!)Owen Gleiberman wrote, ""Ravenna hates living in a world where men can feed on women's beauty and then toss them away. She's a fascist of feminism, and Theron's acting has the blood of operatic anger coursing through it."" This is only one of many reviews that say the film has a feminist streak in it. I must have missed it. As I said, Stewart is no leader, and Theron's role would have been better in the hands of Winona Ryder. Theron is a great actress, but somehow she comes across here as bland and anemic.Roger Ebert must have been drunk and high from sniffing glue, because he gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. He calls Stewart ""capable and plucky"" and considers the ""great film"" to be ""a ride"". Wow. I could not disagree more. While enjoyable as a fantasy film, it is little more than that... we already know the story before it starts and we are not given many surprises.This film is nominated for the Academy Awards for Costume Design and Visual Effects. I would be willing to concede costume design, as the dresses and armor look rather impressive and could have made a different movie look great. The visual effects are okay, but nothing special, with the exception of the actor-shrinking required to have dwarfs. Frankly, I would hate to see this film get the pleasure of receiving any Oscar, but if it must, costume might be something I could live with."
685,"I watched this movie with the sole purpose of watching Kristen Stewart fail as an actress - she did not disappoint. Kristen's ""motivating"" pre-war speech was beyond terrible and uninspiring. Her supporting actors, Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, are the ones that are getting such a high score. Although, I do not know the story line as well as others I thought the director's attempt to try and switch it around was valiant. Charlize was so passionate and completely off her rocker it made me do a double take. From other reviews it seems there is a back story to the evil queen that was not dug into enough that upset other viewers. As well as the huntsman background, it seemed to go deeper into his actor than anything else. I loved the graphics, others have said that they are just ""pretty"" but to me they were awesome. I think my favorite part was learning the Dark Forest fed from Snow White's fears when she first broke out of the castle. I give a thumbs up to Chris, Charlize and the graphics team but a thumbs down to Kristen Stewart. Find someone else next time."
686,"Looking forward for this version of Snow White and still afraid to watch it because Kristen Stewart was in it. I have seen her in the Twilight saga and I just didn't like her performance. She's always playing the same all over Twilight and sadly for her she does it again here. Her mouth always a bit open and whispering her words. She did it again and me no like. Luckily the movie isn't all about Snow White (Stewart). The movie needs it effects to become something outstanding. And the effects are worth watching. Some scene's gives a creepy feeling like the forest with all those deadly creatures. Furtheron we have the Disney feeling with fairies and the happy overlook and a bit of humour with the dwarfs. On that part no complain. But it's really Charlize Theron (Ravenna)that is the one who takes this movie to a higher level. She's marvelous as acting as it is for the eye.Snow White and The Huntsman isn't for everybody, I liked Red Riding Hood (2011) and I liked this one also but Kristen teared it down a bit because it reminded me too much towards Twilight. Mixed feelings about her, I know she wants to get rid of her refrigerator image and is showing her tits in On The Road (2012) made just before this flick. Youth adores her but old people like me, I just can tell, I give her some credits but here no can do. Still, worth watching for the special effects and Charlize, what an actress.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5"
687,"To echo most of the other reviews on here, Kristen Stewart almost wrecks the thing. She is a charisma-free zone, charmless and uninteresting to watch.But then there's Charlize, who seems to have convinced herself she's in an entirely different, and much better, film. Despite having some bad habits like draining the life-force from virgins, you'll actually feel some sympathy for her character. It's such a shame that there is nothing to counterbalance her performance - except Kristen - which is pretty much the same thing as nothing.Having said that, it is pretty to look at, and despite his rubbish ""Sean Connery has spent time in Ireland"" accent, Chris Hemsworth is convincing enough. It's an interesting enough adventure to keep you watching for 120 minutes and I enjoyed it more than I didn't. Just please god stop casting Kristen Stewart in roles that require her to speak, act or move around."
688,"What was that really Kristen Stewart you really cannot act if you want to see the same face pulling and the moody constipated look you got in twilight you wont be disappointed. I myself need more from an actress than that thank the heavens for Charlize Theron that is the reason this got a 5 from me, the story itself was good is this movie was directed by a better director i think it would've been much better. this director didn't have any vision and he clearly ran out of ideas. After watching it i had a thought there is 2 hours of my life i am never getting back i wont go and see the sequel and i urge anyone who hasn't seen this movie DON'T WATCH you have a life to live go and live it."
689,"If I were deaf I would have given this 10 stars, and probably would have been pretty intrigued. The fact that I was able to hear however, well I'll explain. The movie had great special effects and the costumes were on par with Lord of the Rings. The acting would have been good but none of the characters worked together. Big dramatic performances from Theron and Hemsworth matched with dull, zombie like performances from Stewart. Really Stewart brought the whole acting down. If she would have had even been up with Kiera Knightly in ""Arthur,"" it wouldn't have been THAT bad. It was like she was a junior higher thrown on the stage in Hollywood while having the flu and a case of clogged sinuses (mouth breathing). I don't even think that her looks?? could get her another big screen role for quite some time after this movie. With her acting being so...plain cornflakes.....it made the drama of the others off kilter, killing the flow and the interaction between characters. Also, the movie was very shallow. The modern X-Men flicks were Emmy winners on character development compared to this. You never really identified or could relate to any of them. Every time it seemed like we would get some background or some development, the move jumped scene...... So....like I originally said. If you were to watch this in the comfort of your home with nothing to do just for the sake of passing time, than it might be mildly enjoying, visually that is. Don't expect anything great, this will be forgotten soon, and I would not be surprised if someone else tries it again within 5 years"
690,"When I saw the trailer I was quite thrilled to see Charlize Theron in such a gorgeous look and character! But then I got the opportunity and just gave the movie a chance. In the end, it was not worth the money although I liked the scenery, the idea and Charlize Theron. The song in the end is awesome too! But the acting skills of Kristen is just destroying it in my opinion.... It's just so disappointing to see her so bad in a main role. Also, I loved Chris Hemsworth in Thor but I don't think he was brilliant in this movie. To be honest, I can't even remember how he was. I guess he was so-so but he was definitely not outstanding. Overall, I wished they could have picked another actress for the whole of Snow White!"
691,"I watched the movie last night and I am sorry to say it was a pain. The trailer promised a lot, Charlize Theron character seemed to be perfect as an evil queen and Chris Hemsworth fit nicely as a huntsman. Well, they were the only one trying to raise the movie to a decent rating, therefore my six. But Snow white was horrifying. The girl cannot play anything but a frightened teenager and this wasn't the role where she needed to look all constipated and constantly on the verge of crying. As an example please watch the latest scene in the movie, when she is crowned as queen, it is more than relevant, it scared me for life. Overall a good idea, great visual effects, Charlize did a great job except the last scene where she kind of forgot the queen act and did not so good and Chris Hemsworth played a great huntsman (he had practice as Thor ÔÅä) but with other choice of Snow white and maybe an improved scenario/maybe better location, it would have been a blast."
692,"Who did say that Kristen Stewart is an actress? Who in it's mental health, can. say Kristen Stewart is prettier than Charlize Theron? The story is good, but this 2 points make the movie atrocious. Kristen Stewart, please go back to your home and don't back never. It has more credible if Charlize Theron play the character for Snow White and Kristen Stewart play for Ravenna. Kristen Stewart don't express nothing in his face. It's like a plate. Charlize Theron play her character very nice. It's nice that the story change, for more action to the movie. Sorry Kristen Stewart, but you are very bad actress, it's impossible believe nothing that you play. I loved the final battle, but only by Charlize Theron. Please, don't see this movie if you don't want to vomit seeing Kristen Stewart"
693,"For a tale told over and over a million times, Snow White and the Huntsman retained its interesting factor. This version centered more on the dark side, and Charlize Theron's evil queen, Ravenna was awesome. She did a fantastic job.Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart brought this film down for me. On a positive note for her, she did better than I was expecting. However, she was seriously miscast if you are going to put Charlize Theron as the evil queen. Kristen Stewart's Snow White is no where near the fairest. I felt there was serious miscasting going on here.In the end, this story has been done many times, and the predictability of knowing what is going to happen is still there, even if this is one of the better takes on the story. Interesting, but in the end, not enough."
694,"Okay, so there's the beautiful Charlize Theron and some special effects used with her character. Except from that, a poor Snow White with the mono-facial expressionist Kristen Stewart : happy, in love, sad, vindictive... it's exactly the same ! Again, except Charlize Theron, the other ones lack of charisma and are just there, like extras, even though you might expect something out of Nick Frost's presence, for example (looks like some were put there just to add names). The script doesn't contain much, like the dialogs (and finally, I'm asking myself : mmh what's the story again ?). I wouldn't even say that at least one can enjoy this movie for the time it lasts : it already seems too long to endure without glancing at your watch and repressing a yawn..."
695,"****CONTAINS SPOILER**** ************************ Bad Brit accent by Charlize. I don't understand how that happened. Loved the SFX and the landscapes but other than that, not worth watching. Kristen, I feel, was less wooden although the call to arms was poorly 'screamed' out. Sad, really, cos they could have done it so much better.Chris and dwarfs were the best in my opinion. The storyline was well-crafted to turn this well-known fairy tale into a gritty show. Unfortunately, the poor performances and the bad accents really put a damper on the scenes. I wish casting directors would get their selections right."
696,"Snow White and the Huntsman was visually stunning & the cinematography is breathtaking. The costumes, set and color scheme were all handed gorgeous by Colleen Atwood. The special effects were tremendous & the best part of the movie. I really most enjoyed the darkness of the evil Queen who was phenomenally acted by Charlize Theron, and once again Kristen Stewart proves lack of her acting ability also in the role of Snow White. In fact, evil Queen was better appealing to me than the Snow White. All the other actors were brilliantly cast and gave compelling performance. Overall this is one of those movies where we all expected little more punch."
697,"I really did feel this movie is RUSHED. It's pretty hard to like the characters, and get in to the story when the plot moves so quickly! That's my main problem. The acting was decent, and the effects were pretty good. Other than that, the movie lacks real character and is pretty rushed. Directing wise, there were some interesting elements to this movie. Writing wise, it could be better. There were some stupid lines that I didn't know why they included. The story seemed semi jumbled at times, and I found it hard to understand. I also found I needed to flip on subtitles at several points. This isn't a bad movie, just not a good one."
698,"This is a much darker ""action"" version of the Snow White Fairytale. There is lots of sword fighting, monsters, mud and more. The good points: The cinematography is quite good throughout. The sanctuary is enchanting. The castle and forest are quite eerie. Charlize is good. Liked seeing Charlize Theron as the evil Queen. She is far more beautiful than Snow White! But the dialog she is given isn't great. Some of her scenes are a bit painful with too much shouting and ranting. Chris Hemsworth is convincing but his accent wasn't necessary. K Stew is a tomboyishly cute action star. A bit lacking in the romance department here but that is the fault of the screenplay.Weaknesses: The screenplay is only partially successful. It does manage to fit in some elements of the original fairytale with a twist. Eg the apple, the kiss, the dwarfs (who are quite cleverly played by normal sized actors). But the dialog isn't good. The scenes have weak interaction between characters eg between William and Snow White. William comes off as a bit wimpy. There are some irritating aspects to the plot eg the quick courtship of the Queen and keeping Snow in prison for so many years doesn't make sense. How did she learn how to fight and ride? Some tedious scenes like the dwarfs song and funeral. There isn't enough humor or wit. The romance is kind of lacking too. I know they aren't the same type of movie but in the end I enjoyed Mirror Mirror more. Who needs another medieval fighting movie?"
699,"What a jumbled mess of plot holes, bad directing, and things that just plain made no sense. Add to that the fact that the main characters is one of the worst actors working today, which makes it very hard to really get into the story at all. The story was decent, but when I'm sitting there watching the movie, and contemplating like 5 other story lines on my own that would have made the movie better, you know they didn't really think the story through enough. A lot of people said Theron did an exceptional job in this movie. I disagree, she didn't do a bad job, but it really wasn't fun to watch. She mostly just acted crazy sporadically for no reason and didn't even come off as scary crazy for me.However, all that being said, Chris Hemsworth did a great job at not just playing Thor again, which would have been easy in this movie. So kudos to him for that. And also, all the magical elements were very original, creative, and fun to watch. That's pretty much the only reason I gave this movie any stars, but it almost IS worth watching the whole thing just for those."
700,"Story line is great, nice twist on an old tale...but, as has been stated in other reviews; some really dumb goofs and just plain ""Huh?"" moments. For me though, the film was ruined by the use of full size actors on dwarf bodies!! In todays' world there is NO excuse for this..there are at least a DOZEN Little People actors who could have played the parts!!! I am also pretty disappointed that Chalize, Kristen, Chris and others let this happen. I am specifically peeved at the actors who played the dwarfs for not stepping up and supporting equality and equity in their craft!!! I can see that you spent all your budget on actors..but you would have saved money using Little People (let me be clear..the stars you used I am sure cost a pretty penny, as opposed to lesser known actors, Little People who would have loved the chance to be in a movie, like any other actor)As a woman ans lesbian, I certainly don't like when men or straight people claim to ""know"" how I feel, so I certainly am not going to stand by while you make millions from being bigoted and short sighted in you cast choices. If nothing else I think the public should be told why you did this."
701,"It could have been so much better: not the most original comment I know, but there was much to like in the film but the poor acting b Stewart, the key player, made it an effort to watch.The film was badly paced as well, with stops and starts, songs and drama, all mixed haphazardly. It was definitive, with Avatar and Rings coming to mind often.The CGI was excellent. The mirror was particularly clever, although a bit off beam by suggesting that Stewart was 'fairer' than Theron. I know beauty and beholder and all that, but really! The dwarfs all but made up for the film's shortcomings. It was worth viewing the 'extras' to see how it was all done.Holes in the plot abound but then one can say that about so many other films that one can hardly criticise a fantasy for that.Don't bother."
702,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but without the special effects, I don't think it would have been the same. Charlize Theron was brilliant as the wicked queen and Kristen Stewart was lovely but her beauty couldn't be compared to that of Ms Theron. Chris Hemsworth was great as the course, Scottish, hard drinking huntsman and the dwarfs played by all those well known faces like Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone, were brilliant. I was blown away with the white horse and sad when Snow White had to leave it in the mire. The white stag was exquisite and the fight scenes were stunning, with the army of glass breaking into shards and killing the soldiers. All in all I would rate this film highly and I can't wait to see it again."
703,"The Greatest Movie Ever Made? No! Absolutely Not! A Pretty Great Movie to someone who Grew up playing AD&D, Yeah! I would take a full rebate on my 1st D&D movie ticket investment for this film, and still end up ahead.Characters? Please this movie's premise and premier is back in my mother time. As a D&D player, however I found my friends characters in the movie.The retelling, while not to Walt's benefit or mine - no stock, is great story telling. It also was interesting enough to my 7 year old to keep his attention while rebuilding his Star Wars LEGO."
704,"Very good idea, the movie could have been a great thing to happen in 2012 if not the bad cast! Kristen Stewart is boring, unemotional. Very stiff and dry performance! Even good play of Theron did not help! The second half of the film if just he'll boring! Please refill this movie with say Natalie Portman as Snow White!!!! The pace of Film is too slow! It feels like needing action , bot Mountie long gazing of Stewart on flowers or other characters! Or wandering in the forest! The appearance of dwarfs helped to return to the movie at least some action! Chris Hemsworth played good although his play could have been much better if with a better partner! Waiting for the remake!"
705,"To begin with, yes, the young girl cast as Snow white is very good and, well, looks snow white. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, doesn't live up to the princess mark. She's very pale, but lucky for her, she got a great make-up artist who made her look fairer(but not better) than Charlize Theron.Her acting lacks the anger and fire you would expect from a queen-to-be while trying to get her kingdom back on it's feet.But the visuals are very good and the movie is well paced. Throughout, the movie entertains you and that, I think, is what really counts. Chris Hemsworth looks good and plays his part well. There is NO sensuality between the characters, barring one scene where Kristen locks lips with William, but that's not William then(you'll know when you watch the movie). I would say, if you are looking for a good movie-time with family or friends, then this one will not disappoint you. It will leave you with a smile on your face and of course, make you think of other actresses who could have played the lead role better! Good movie. Worth the money, worth your time."
706,"Don't let the title mislead you; it may have the Snow White, Evil Queen and seven dwarfs characters, even the mirror is the infamous mirror, but that is where I draw the line. The movie is a surreal genre, not unlike Van Helsing (not the anime version) by John Slowsky. Disney had done a fine job with the animated 1937 version, excellent in fact, even before it upgraded it later.There have been many remakes of one kind or another over the years; even a few months before Snow White and the Huntsman, there was Mirror Mirror with Julia Roberts, so I understand the fascination it holds over so many years. That is not however my reason for watching it. I'm a fan of Charlize Theron; that's why. How can a guy not be a fan, she is one gorgeous woman, and talented with the awards to back that up. I can say that, not because of what I read but because I have almost half the movies she has acted in and saw several of the others.The cast include a bunch of other stars, all of whom took third places after Theron and Kristen Stewart. No doubt, Stewart attracted the younger crowd to the cinemas; I'm just not that big a fan. When I say a bunch of stars, I mean the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Vincent Regan and Eddie Marsan to name the ones that come to me from seeing the hundreds of movies they were featured in.Finally, I admit I did not care for the story before watching it, while I did and now, but I could not resist all that talent; I just had to see it through. You don't have to."
707,"Director Rupert Sanders and writers Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amin offer a much different take on the classic tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Just in case you were wondering, yes, the dwarfs do make an appearance in this film, but their role as a whole is very minimal compared to the original story. I'm sure you probably guessed this tidbit of information from the title.Anyway, the movie was good overall but not great. The special effects were outstanding. When Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) transitions from young - to old - to young - to very old, it looks quite natural. You actually believe Theron is aging instantly right before your very eyes. I also liked the way the Dark Forest came to life when Snow White (Kristen Stewart) stumbled upon it while trying to flee Queen Ravenna's men. While the animation of the troll that attacks Snow White and the Huntsman looks suburb, the other animals and creatures of the Dark Forest have a decidedly CG look - not impressive. However, camera work was good, as was the few action scenes we did see in the film.My biggest issue with this film is it never really builds suspense. I never really feel like Snow White is in any immediate danger, even after Queen Ravenna poisons her with the apple, though I must add Theron does excellent in her role as the evil Queen Ravenna. In this film you will see her character as not simply a villainess of pure evil, but rather a severely mentally unstable individual with far too much power. Her fear of aging consumes her and she will stop at nothing to achieve immortality. I almost felt sorry for Ravenna. In fact, I felt very sorry for her. Again, great job by Theron. Kristen Stewart just can't hold her own against an actress like Theron, but the the two share very few scenes, so that works in Stewart's favor.The film borrows elements from both the the classic Disney version (1937) and the first prominent version of the tale that dates back to 1812 with the Brothers Grimm. Results are hit or miss. The mirror on the wall in this film is not really a mirror at all, but rather a highly reflective bronze-like dish that projects a faceless being that communicates with Ravenna, which only she can see or hear. This works, especially given the writers have painted Ravenna's character with a psychotic stroke. This film also has a darker tone than is uncharacteristic for this tale - I'm not a fan.I also feel the Huntman character is problematic in this film. While I do realize the character is in the Disney version that made this tale a classic here in the United States, I don't think replacing the ""7 Dwarfs"" in the title and reducing their significance in this film was a good move. In fact, I think the Huntsman character was useless and could have been eliminated altogether. OK, I said it. (I mean hey, there's always Prince William!) Of course, doing so would make the film fall more in line with the earlier Brothers Grimm version than it would the one most Americans are familiar with. But hey, you have to take some chances every once in a while. Maybe it's just because as a huntsman, he didn't really impress me or have the presence of a vicious hunter or protector, you know, like Mel Gibson in Braveheart. The performance was mediocre at best. For example, when the Huntsman goes to the Dark Forest to find Snow White, someplace he swore he'd never return to because it was such a horrific place, he finds her with very little effort. He just strolls right into the Dark Forest and plucks her from her hiding place under a tree! Just like that. Quick, painless, and with absolutely no opposition whatsoever. How lame! Can we get a little more suspense? A little more action? I mean, this is supposed to be the big bad Dark Forest. Anyway, you can't much blame Chris Hemsworth, who did an excellent job as Thor in the recent Avenger and Thor films. He doesn't have much to work with here from the writers. I think a plot with a more prominent role for the dwarfs would have been more interesting.Anyway, it's worth a look."
708,"This film had oh so much potential! It was beautifully shot, Theron is pitch perfect, unbelievably beautiful, and fabulously demented (per usual) and Helmsworth is also great as the huntsman, even Prince Charming is well done...Enter Kristen Stewart..andddd downhill we go! Who are we kidding, in what parallel universe is Kristin Stewart more ""fair"" than Charlize Theron? This ""magic mirror"" is obviously blind as a proverbial bat! Who's the fairest? YOU ARE CHARLIZE! Theron's portrayal of the crazy, fragile, beautiful evil queen could not be more enchanting and engaging to watch, and based on this Snow White, I was hoping maybe she would win! So now that the merely physical is out of the way, let's move on to Stewart's portrayal of Snow White..yawn..she is quite possibly the worst actress to grace the screen since..you know I can't really recall a worse actress. ANYONE would have done it better! She is vapid, vapid, vapid! There is clearly no intelligent thought going on inside her teen-angst ridden brain! She is totally one-dimensional and never plays a different character, even when the script demands it..which leads one to believe she would be able to do a better job at it..but alas..she remains a dismal, disappointing failure. The film could have been awesome with another actress in the lead. The scenery is lavish and lush, the costumes are fabulous, the other actors are convincing and vibrant, so this one is definitely worth the watch, just don't expect much from Ms. Stewart..and let's be honest..this isn't surprising to anyone is it? ;)"
709,"This was a good movie and it was really well done. The effects were impressive, the acting was really good, and the character and plot developed well. Kristen Stewart did a great job, granted this film was right down her alley. She's grown from that dorky little kid in Panic Room to become a beautiful young woman with decent acting chops. I'm interested to see how she fares outside of her comfort zone though. This character was a lot like her Twilight character... dark, dry, and dramatic. I wonder how she'll perform, now that Twilight is ending, in more diverse roles. Chris Hemsworth also did a great job as usual. He continues to impress. If he gets a few marquee roles over the next several years (no, Thor would not be one, lol), he could become this generation's Mel Gibson or someone along those lines. The only major criticism I had is that I can't stand all the magical mumbo jumbo. Obviously it wouldn't be a Snow White movie without it so I'm not holding that against the movie with regards to the rating but I really wish they would've gone for a more realistic approach to the film. Still, it was an entertaining movie that was done well."
710,"I don't think this film deserves any thing below a 5 or above a 7. It was good but not great. I rely enjoyed the music & the graphics & thought the acting was fine. The script however was mediocre with a sprinkle of semi memorable lines & quotes.Some scenes could have been cut to make room for more story line I think.Stewart was OK & Charlize was great in my opinion, sure her British accent was not spot on, but her acting was delicious as always. All in all, The writing & story line could have been way better, but worth watching this year, since there is rely nothing but crap to view in the theaters."
711,"The scenery is very good and believable. And that's it.Leading 'good' characters portrayed so weakly that do ruin the fairy tale. And I don't blame Kristen Stewart for this as many reviewers did already. Direction is very weak. Key moments that involve some miracles are absolutely out of sync with the tale. I don't want to put any spoilers here. But those key moments bring the question ""what just happened here?"".On the other hand costumes, CGI and 'bad' character acting are quite good. Sound stage is compelling.Special thanks to Charlize Theron for her evil queen. But even with her very good acting there are some holes with her part of the story. Flashbacks, that explain her motives and story are shown close to the end when they can not change impression already."
712,"Revenna, the evil Queen (Charlize Theron), needs to cut out the heart of Snow White (Kristen Stewart)_to maintain her youth and beauty. Snow White escapes from the tower prison and is protected by the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth).Hollywood doesn't know what to do with itself these days. We are subjected to re-make after re-make, not funny comedies, and now they twist our beloved fairy tales. Oh, the horror of it all!This was okay, but too long, slow, and draggy in places with nothing really going on to write home about. No real highs. It was like everything was monotone - on the same intensity level until the very end where things picked up some. The music lent itself to this as well. The cinematography, photography and CGI were outstanding. The acting also was outstanding. Charlize Theron is always good and has really nice eyes. There may be an Oscar in this for Ms Theron as the evil Queen. Did I mention that she has nice eyes?Kristen Stewart was, of course, somewhat wooden, but this was called for. Look at her situation. What would you have her do differently? Okay, near the end when she took up the banner like a Joan of Arc, we would have kicked her in the butt and told her to get with it and look more like a leader of an army about to storm the evil Queen's castle. That was the only downside I saw. I thought she actually looked petrified on top of the horse. She is not an action hero so we give her a pass. Hey, she was a Princess in this. A Princess is not action hero¬Ö¬Ö most of the time. Chris Hemsworth as the Huntsman was perfect. I couldn't help wondering when the next THOR movie would come out. He's a good Thor. Something confusing. Sometimes the actors tried to sound like they had British accents. Why? Oh, they failed miserably, but why?What was missing? Prince Charming. Was it William (Sam Claffin)? Probably, but this relationship never kindled. What else? The dwarfs (Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones and the others I am not familiar with) didn't have the names we are familiar with from the original fairy tale ‚Äì Grumpy, Doc, Bashful etc. But, they did carry picks everywhere they went. And, they never sang the work song. The biggest thing that was missing: Nothing told us they lived happily ever after. We will just have to wait until a new director gets a vision that will change and possibly destroy the fairy tales we grew up with. But, that said, this was still okay. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
713,"Okay, so there is a huntsman, and princess a queen and for reasons that I am not yet aware, there is also a prince charming? As far as I am aware, he is as useful as a Laser Disc. D you remember what hey are? Probably not, and it doesn't matter because you want remember this mans characterless character.Wat you will remember are the stunning visuals and the quite impressive acting. Charlize does a fantastic job as the queen, and despite her being tong-deep in the directors mouth, so does Stewart. Thors acting was also good, though his accent was difficult to decipher. Not sure from where it is that he comes...This movie does have a whiff of Tim Burton to it. It has the same dark aura and fascinating concepts that one would find in Burton's work, but not as refined or in-depth. It is a great take on the original Snow White story and good fun to watch. Sometimes it does drag on, but it is good.7 Stars."
714,"Snow White and the HuntsmanOh, boy! I can't wait to see some axe-wielding nimrod pursuing his prey while coked out on fresh powder.Hold on! Snow White in this fantasy appears to be a woman and not some epic nose candy.Following her mother's death, Snow White's (Kristen Stewart) father marries Ravenna (Charlize Theron), a woman fixated on youth.Ravenna's reign is meteoric and merciless. Discarding of the King, she imprisons Snow in hopes of eating her heart.When Snow escapes, a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is sent to kill her - instead he falls in love. With the aid of seven dwarfs (Nick Frost, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane), the couple helms an attack on the Queen and her magic mirror.A violent interpretation of the Grimm fairy tale, the aesthetics of SWATH are noteworthy; however, save for Theron, the performances are preposterous. As for the moral of the story: to stay young, eat young. (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
715,"Let's put the story straight...this telling of Snow White is not a bubbly live action version of the popular Disney animated movie we all grew up watching and warping our young little minds. This is the dark story that was intended to be told by The Brothers Grimm in 1812 and send chills down our spine.It's not that the younger audience won't enjoy this film. If they are okay with the type of violence found in any of the Twilight or Transformers movies then they will be perfectly as ease with this version. First time director Rupert Sanders finds the perfect dark balance to entertain the entire audience spectrum. This type of formula could have easily ended in disaster, but Sanders finds a way to pull it off with great satisfaction.The special effects are outstanding, especially in the magical woods scenes where a toxic fume released from strange plants cause Snow White to trip balls, and the troll living under the bridge and tiny flying pixies can't help but remind me of the creatures from Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth.The big time cast is strong. Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Adventureland) is her usual self...constantly brushing her long beautiful hair out of her face while giving off dead pan stares with her made for the big screen eyes, but also gets to showcase a brute force not often seen in the characters she normally plays, as she charges into battle with her army against the queen. Chris Hemsworth doesn't wander too far from his Thor persona, but tones it down in the right spots (something he often fails to do with his Marvel comic character). But certainly best of all is Chalize Theron who is delectably evil as the Wicked Queen. Theron has proved she can play all types of roles, but has found a niche lately (Young Adult & Prometheus) playing the biatch we all love to hate.Snow White and the Huntsman surprisingly kicks ass as an action flick. The kind of action that you would expect from a movie released during the summer blockbuster season, but with a constructive and entertaining story that some of the big films forget to include when showing off their expensive special effects (I'm looking at you Battleship). I say cheers to this version of Snow White, and would be interested in seeing more fairy tales brought to life the way they were truly intended...dark and ferocious.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"
716,"I had high hopes for this. The trailers looked good - and still do - but the substance of the film. Yeck! Not good at all.Biggest among my complaints is, predictably, Kristen Stewart. She plays almost every scene with an expression on her face that makes me think she is either constipated, or on a barbiturate overdose. Her almost universal open-mouthed look also made her look utterly gormless. She was entirely incapable of doing justice to any of the emotional scenes into which she was thrust. But in her defence, she did make every other actor look fantastic by comparison! Charlize Theron was not much better. Every scene over-acted to the point of ridiculousness. She can do better than that, so I have to assume that the final result we see on screen is the result of inept direction.Chris Hemsworth tries his best, but only ends up looking like the token real actor in a cheap TV movie.The movie is too long at 127 minutes. There are a lot of scenes that are either entirely needless (the troll, the lakeside village etc.) which could have been cut or trimmed. But they weren't, and so we have a bloated film that drags in many, many places. If the acting in these areas was any good, then they'd be bearable, but the acting was generally below par.There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the backstory's seemed trite and tacked on. I didn't end up feeling anything for any of the characters and that is the worst crime of all in any movie or story.The one bright spot were the dwarfs. Played for comic relief for the most part, they were generally under-used, but made most scenes better by their presence.The rest, though, was utter tedium interspersed with bewildering nonsense (Snow White reciting the Lord's Prayer, for example!) My advice. Watch another version of this tale."
717,"Snow White and the Huntsman was decent fairy-tale based action adventure which had lot of potential to turn into a must-see movie but was bogged down by weak screenplay and poor direction.After the invasion of the evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) into the kingdom , the king is killed and his daughter Snow White (Kristen Stewart)is imprisoned. However , she escapes after some years later to the dark woods. After the declaration by the magical mirror that Snow White is the source of immortality for Ravenna , she sends her men along with the huntsman(Chris Hemmsworth) to track down Snow White in the dark forest. But when huntsman realizes that he is being played by the queen , he turns against them and saves Snow White from into the trap. She along with huntsman and her childhood friend , Williams takes the army to vanquish the evil queen. Directed by Rupert Sanders , we have always heard about Snow White stories during our childhood. However , director has twisted the tale and introduced Huntsman who must protect Snow White after he discovers the truth. The opening of the movie was remarkable especially the war scene where the King finds and saves Ravenna. The escaping of Snow White from the castle into the dark woods and then Hunstman saving her from queen's men has executed superbly with use of quality special effects. However , the movies falls flat in the second half where Snow White meets Williams and becomes dragging little bit. The Climax fight scene is superb and is visually enthralling. However , I have one question for Kristen Stewart ‚Äì when she will start acting. She has same expressions in all her films I have seen and avoids having any motions at all. Direction was decent but could have made more impact. Screenplay was a letdown. Art direction was just mindblowing along with visually appealing Cinematography. The Special effects were highly driven and were eye-catching. Performances were decent by the star cast. I found Charlize Theron's acting to be engaging though she was bit over the top in some of scenes. Chris Hemsworth was just about OK . Overall , it is a film high on quality and low on content. However , it is visually appealing which makes it a decent watch."
718,"This film had so much potential and it was good, but it could've been so much better.The romance is a total fail and I really feel they cut scenes that could have make this film better.Anyway what really upset me was Kristen Stewart's performance. I know Twilight fans will read this and say that I'm just some ""hater"" that's not true at all, although I do think that she worked as bad here as she works in Twilight series. Not because she's a bad actress, but because the ""damsel in distress"" role doesn't fit her, she did amazing in Panic Room and The Runaways, but she doesn't know how to act as a sweet, innocent, and defenseless lady at all, it feels so superficial, I can almost see the director giving her instructions, then she nods and try to do what he said while feeling very uncomfortable.Also, I don't really understand why she keeps opening her mouth and doing that ""dead fish's eyes"" it's so annoying and pointless. The worst part is that you can seem to ignore it and I kept thinking that she should correct her teeth.It's not a bad movie overall, it's entertaining, Charlize Theron did an awesome job as Ravenna, Chris Hemsworth did his job well."
719,"too long dark fairy tale, it is beautiful, nice and scene for a seductive performance of Charlize Theron. the Medieval time as slice of alternative history, original story with small nuances, impressive fight scenes and exploration of old tale in new manner. only problem - image of Snow White. sure, Kristen Steward is a decent option. but not great. not the attitude , not the good intentions, not the costumes makes a credible role. her work is admirable. but the dwarfs, the savage handsome huntsman, the magnificent images, the troll, all are more interesting. and the Evil Queen is the best in the web of Theron subtle art.it is not waste of time or money. but after pink Mirror, mirror the expectations are not limited. the satisfaction - only moderated.but hope dies the last . maybe, another occasion..."
720,"And why still a 7? Coz everything else works for this movie. If you can swallow the fact it's based on a children's book of fantasy. It does hence have elements directly out of the genre. You can expect the clich√©s in their places, but I think they are kept for the purpose of the story itself. Each character is drawn out well, with, the perspective shown from all sides, not just the good, offering a further layer, adding substance to the movie. People play their characters well, but the two leads, snow white and the huntsman, are too much like Bella and Thor. Similarities to Thor are not too bad, with the weapon used as also very similar. Having a Bella as snow white though, is a bane to the movie, Kirsten Stewart just cannot act. And that's what let this movie down. It's completely worth a watch though. I'd dare say slightly better than I expected!! :)"
721,"I know my review comes a little late, but I just saw it and I need it to get it out of my system.I was curious to see this movie and to tell you the true, the acting of Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth were the only thing I really enjoy. Seriously where is Snow White's beauty (and I'm not talking about the looks of the actress). The plot of the fairytale story was the beauty of Snow White, the queen wants to kill her because of that, it saves her from the huntsmen, it gave her a chance to work for the dwarfs and finally it rescue her. I didn't see the beauty expressed on the plot, the huntsmen doesn't say anything about her looks when he first met her and the dwarfs didn't kill her because a prophecy (wich is just mentioned twice and not explained at all).I know they intend to present a stronger female character, I'm not against empower women but I never saw that character in the movie. I couldn't figure out what kind of emotion was she feeling when she was crowned. What lead her to be a strong girl who wants to fight the queen? Was the greed of revenge for her father's death, the deplorable conditions of the kingdom or the courage to stop running from the queen. I guess I'll never know.It could have been an enjoyable twist, the queen's story, the huntsmen's grief and the development of a leader."
722,"Yet another Snow White story, this time they try and add an epic story of chosen ones the same way they did for Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Evil queen Charlize Theron locks Snow White away, she eventually escapes and the Huntsman is sent after her. From there it's the typical story, only with added battle sequences thrown in. Stewart, although not quite the looker that the role kind of needs, is great in the role. She becomes the hope without ever being entitled to her royalty. She truly earns her place as a princess, even though her battle skills come from nowhere. Theron chews up the scenery in the best possible way, and really adds layers to her villain. She justifies her actions by treating the peasants better than she was treated, and she believes her own justification. This makes her understandably irate when people no longer follow her command. The dwarfs are played by some of Britain's best talent. Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray WInstone, and Ian McShane all have very small moments to shine, but work best as a team. On top of this we have the stunning special effects and designs. A lot is owed to Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki, but it was still breathtaking to see such creations realised in live-action. Even the less creative creatures held so much charm, such as the moss covered snake and tortoise. Even the demonic creatures are magnificent. The warriors made of shattered glass were exceptionally creative, and I kind of wish this could have had an R rating to show how dangerous those guys could really be. Overall it's a very predictable story, but told in a mature and stylish way that never really abandons reality. Plenty to love, but could have used some trimming."
723,"A visually opulent, but rather superficial experience, Snow White and The Huntsman never really seems to know in which direction it wants to be heading. There are some fine nods to other movies - for instance, the wonderful tribute to Princess Mononoke, my favorite Miyazaki movie, in the form of the white stag - and that's okay as long as you've got your own story to tell, which this movie doesn't. Granted, the re-imagining of the old Grimm fairytale does offer a few well-executed new ideas - the 'haunted' forest that functions on hallucinogens, the bridge which actually IS a troll - but it all leads to a pretty anticlimactic final act, and it takes way too long to get there. Also, I guess the writers didn't know how to work the romantic angle, as it's never even resolved if Snow White is in love with the huntsman or William.Strange thing about this movie is that it features an all-round excellent cast, except for the two leads. Not only does Kristen Stewart have the dramatic range of a broken teacup, for ninety percent of this film she seems physically incapable of closing her mouth, walking around like a mouth-breathing moron - as she does in most of her films, come to think of it. This role would've been done far more justice in the hands of a lesser-known, but more talented actress like, for instance, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman looks and sounds like a troglodyte, and even considering the dramatic back story of the murdered wife and so on, I couldn't get myself to sympathize with the character at all. However, Charlize Theron as the evil Queen is simply wonderful, as are the seven actors playing the dwarfs.Overall, although it is admittedly beautifully filmed, this is a movie I'm highly unlikely to ever re-watch, mostly due to the clich√©d, messy storyline and poor lead performances."
724,"As we were accustomed to see a nice character depiction, this may come as a surprise , as the single well portrayed character is the evil queen. The rest of the characters are struggling throughout the whole movie to achieve a satisfactory percentage . Yet the only one coming close to that point is the huntsman, however incomplete in the end. The story lacks insight and the long walk from a kid's story to a movie scenery was left uncovered every here and there to be filled with Hollywood clich√©. Good image, good costumes, well chosen distribution , yet a disappointing mixture in the end. Unfortunately there is no such thing as a sponge to erase whichever production fails to adequately screen a literature masterpiece. There is only the time to pass until the next production follows the same title."
725,"When I first heard about the film I wasn't that much interested. I do like fairy tales, maybe I thought it would be ""just the same again"" with new actors. The mood, darkness and difference of the trailer woke my interest though. The visual effects are mysterious and mystical. I liked that the story is not completely like the inspiration, a great new spin. Charlize Theron's acting as the evil queen Ravenna was simply magesterial. The role couldn't have been presented any better. The other acting was quite good too but hers was outstanding so I had to mention it. I always like to mention the music as well because a movie would be nothing without it. Even though it's in the back it's really important. It really matches the film and gives it more intensity. As amazing the movie was, a little something was missing to me. I'm not even sure what though. I'm giving it a 8/10."
726,"Why not more like the Disney version??Yeah I will give this movie 4/10 because Gus dies! Why would they kill him? Does he die in the Disney version? No! I will never see this movie again because of this.and Kristen Stewart that speech? What was that? I would rather have Oprah up there yelling at all of those dwarfs. One last thing what happened to the scene when all the animals are dancing? and if you are going to do a sequel please call it ""Snow white and the huntsman Gus revenge"" ByeIf you want to watch something good go watch Sand sharks or Titanic 2Im out."
727,"First of all: Kristen Stewart's mouth is slightly opened the ENTIRE movie! Very annoying. And than the casting of Kristen in the first place: she is supposed to be more beautiful (both outside and inside) than Charlize Theron? I mean: come on! I know it's hard to beat Charlize but Kristen is kind of a long shot. Many many small mistakes: - Chris Hemsworth throws down his axe in the forrest right before they meet the dwarfs and the axe literally bounces back a little because it weighs like nothing! - Kristen on her horse charging the castle without a helmet? - An entire army is storming the castle but when the dwarfs go to the gatehouse inside the castle, only a few people are running and the rest is going about their daily business??? - Why do bad guys (queen in this case) always have to tell exactly how they can be defeated? And why do they have to enter a monologue and not kill the good guy right away (or at least try)I could go on, but I find it shameful that directors with huge budgets can't put in a little extra effort to polish their work. Hope fully no sequel, and if so, please not with Kristen."
728,"I don't think that this movie is worth to watch. It will spoil your time as it did with mine.because In this movie their is no such thing that we didn't see before.Kristen Stewart as we seen her before,is a showpiece item in every movie. So guys don't ruin your day or spoil your money on this. I am sure you have seen better than this movie. this movie must be made in 90's,then i think it can be blockbuster. Some people can like this but I think they all are old fashionable. Chris hemsworth is good but not best. In starting of it I was feeling that it would be worth to watch this but at last I was wrong. I couldn't find anything new in this movie.Yea sorry to mention it to earlier the only character that impressed me in this the The Evil Queen (played perfectly by Charlize Theron).She is impressive. So finally don't go for this, I am sure we all have some other better options . Good Luck...!!"
729,"I would like to commence by saying that this movie is not bad. The overall idea of a darker Snow White is tempting, especially now that dark romance movies have paved the way. Take out of the equation the battle scenes in the end, where we have the cameo of Jeanne d'Arc and you are left with a good idea.C. Theron is great. Excellent choice: beautiful-dark and impressive she overshadows every other character.Snow White: Disaster. What the hell did these people think to cast Kristen Stewart? This woman cannot act at all, she is emotionally emotionless; honestly, she only has one expression.Finally, I know that according to the myth the mirror says that Snow White is the fairest of them all. However, when you put her side-by-side with the Queen, in the movie, you pray that the mirror alters the quote! Alas, it doesn't do so! I am sorry guys, but when you make a movie about Snow White you have to ensure that the leading role is played by at least decent actor. That said, 5/10 is more than adequate rating."
730,"It wasn't really a bad movie. It was just hyped and didn't live up to it. Yes, the landscapes were pretty but actually they didn't add anything to the story. I haven't seen Kristen Steward before as I am not the target audience for the Twilight series. Obviously the director and the scriptwriters didn't gave the poor girl much opportunity to develop her character. So her play was rather dull and she couldn't transport any emotions. Charlize Theron's performance was interesting, but actually just fulfilled the clich√© of the evil queen. Why start telling us the interesting part (her youth), but actually stop after a short sequence? And yes, we have seen blond incestuous siblings before just recently in a TV series that Snow White and the Huntsmane tries to copy so badly. Leaving an open end for a second installment wasn't a good idea in a story that is so well known. The movie is full of promises but actually doesn't work. Helmer Sanders should stick to commercials again, I am sure he knows how to do them. A few good ideas in a two hour+ movie is just not good enough. But it looked stylish and pretty."
731,"Upon hearing of this movie I was initially quite excited. Then of course I heard about the casting of Kristen Stewart and, suffice it to say, I was a little less enthusiastic. What I didn't expect was how other elements of the story almost made up for Kristen Stewart's acting. The cinematography is very well done here and certain characters are acted out beautifully, with a stand out performance from Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen. Now that was a villain I could get behind. She wasn't evil simply for the sake of being evil, she was given back-story and was fleshed out beyond simply being an old woman dreaming of youth. You understood why she did what she did and even sympathized with her in some places. Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was also given a back-story, which I would like to have learnt more of but he simply wasn't given the time. This actually leads me to one of the movies greatest flaws; the pacing.The pacing was all over the place for me. Sometimes it moved too fast so characters like the dwarfs became one-dimensional caricatures, and then at other times it slowed down to the point where I was nearly sleeping, such as the whole segment with the village of women. The whole movie is building up to the end fight scene, which was alright, but then the movie ends so abruptly that there was no real pay-off. At this point I don't expect much out of Kristen Stewart and while she acts almost identically to how she plays Bella Swann, it worked slightly better here as she has a real reason to be depressed. Seeing your fathers dead body and being locked in a tower for the majority of your life by your step-mother might just give you some issues. The romance in this movie was a joke. Am I supposed to buy her relationship with the William when the kiss that woke her came from the Huntsman? What were they even going for there?I wouldn't recommend this for theatres. Wait to rent it."
732,"hmmm just finished watching and what to say...lets begin with the good things.Charlize Theron is great, she really gets into the evil queen role and pulls it off with some wicked style. the visuals are dark and foreboding, there is a sense of gloom and despair throughout the film which is really in keeping with the gruesome fairytale that the original actually is. And while they were there throughout, it was nice to see a film not relying on special effects and cgi to tell the story, they felt just right and not overdone at all. throw in some nice bright look there is light at the end of the tunnel moments and a good score and it was a job well done.Im also not going to slate the storyline for not following the fairytale to the letter, Disney managed to totally get away with it so why shouldn't this adaptation. I really did enjoy the story as it unfolded, the pace was OK, few slow bits here and there but overall it kept me engaged.The casting on the whole was pretty good, not enough time spent exploring the story and characters of the dwarfs for my liking, would have been nice to see more of bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone and Ian McShane. and the prince charming character... well it seemed a bit of an after thought, like the director got to the end and thought, oooh i better put in a prince or people wont like it.what i didn't like was the casting of snow white, I mean really? Kristen Stewart playing the fairest of them all? unfortunately as pretty as she is (and she is lovely looking) Kristen will never be in the same league as Charlize Theron who really is stunning in this film at times, kinda makes you wanna say out loud when she is saying mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all.. you are charlize.. you are.Kristen Stewart has one style of acting, she's like a moody goth child who has been grounded and while that is absolutely perfect for twilight she does not have the depth to keep up with the rest of the cast. when she smiles it reminds me of Sheldon cooper in big bang smiling.. its just not real or right. such a shame, i found her performance dull, even the big inspirational speech to rally the troops was erm.. blah.. i didn't care. Though in saying all that, right at this moment i cannot for the life of me think of another young actress who could have pulled off being the fairest of them all competing against charlize.. so maybe.. just maybe it was the queen that should have been recast.. ooooh controversial ;-) overall its a good film. i enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it. I will add after reading back my review i feel i should say that i have nothing against Kristen Stewart, i quite liked her in into the wild and she is perfect in twilight but.. she really shouldn't have been cast as snow white.just my opinion of course and you know what they say about opinions..everybody's got one"
733,"On the whole I'd say Snow White and the Huntsman does not work properly. The role of Snow is played by the glowering star of Twilight movies, Kristen Stewart, whereas the queen's role is played by Charlize Theron, suitable for this role as for every other one. The story is heavily laden with Christian references and allegory (which is not a problem but is distracting in what would otherwise be a magical fantasy). There is also the old archaic idea that the only weapon women have in their arsenal is beauty - which can be used to manipulate men - and that a woman is nothing without stunning beauty. Positive note is Charlize Theron stealing the show as the thrillingly wicked Ravenna but her excellent performance doesn't get anywhere near to save the story."
734,"I really looked forward to seeing Snow White and the Huntsman, but didn't think it lived up to its hype. The acting was average at best; neither Charlize Theron nor Kristen Stewart were overly impressive in their respective roles as Ravenna and Snow White. The former overacted and the latter underacted. I kept wanting Kristen Stewart to do or say more; every time I thought she was about to say something, it was though she stifled and/or swallowed her words. I found her character irritating; if this is how her character was supposed to be, it was disappointing. Chris Hemsworth's role required him to say very little, so I didn't have much of a problem with his silence; at least his huntsman was more believable than either Ravenna or Snow White. The special effects were fine, but the film dragged on and I found myself looking at the time to see how much longer the film would last--not a good sign. I also found myself thinking of an earlier Snow White film from 1997 with Sigourney Weaver and Sam Neill--Snow White: A Tale of Terror (also known as Snow White in the Black Forest). It was a made- for-TV film but it was much better than this film in my opinion--better acted, edgier, darker, and scarier. If you get a chance to see this earlier film, do so."
735,"Visually appealing is the best thing I can say about SWaTH. Oh, plus Liam Hemsworth, who carried it, for me. Extreme lack of dialogue, lack of clear goal for Snow White, the terribly done romance, and the unnecessary characters would be the worst things.SPOILERS BELOW.I was right into it before Snow White grew up, and that's because she had no life about her. Yes, she was being ill treated, but Drew Barrymore's character Danielle in Ever After was a fairytale lead in a similar situation and was able to be ""pure of heart"" AND have a personality. Snow White was too perfect. Even after her long (self-discovering?) journey, her speech and horse-ride into battle did not give her the personality I was DYING for her to get because she does NOT tell the Huntsman she heard his confession that made her wake up, and she becomes queen but can't utter a word! What kind of queen is that? How will she rule a kingdom by just looking at everything fondly? AND crying when mass murders die?If only SW had have found her spirit without the attempted rape and being told she was to die that made her eventually escape. Yes, they got away with this plot-wise by the queen saying her brother had never opened her cell before, but she would've needed to have a tub brought in for bathing! I would have loved to hear a guard telling a new guard that he has to be careful with SW b/c she always tries to escape. How much I would've been on her side if she'd looked out her prison window and (instead of seeing magical BIRDS), seen her destitute people and vowed something like, ""I failed yesterday to save you, but today I have yet to try,"" and did SOMETHING to escape, already having a weapon!THEN, we would have known her goal, and known it wasn't just about HER survival to her. I had no idea she wanted to be queen. If she'd let it be known from the start I would've been so happy for her ending!Yes, she really should've ""patted the dog"" like Danielle in Ever After did (risked her life to save a fellow servant) to gain our affection instead of JUST being ill treated. I actually think the actors did the best they could with the script. The lack of dialogue drove me insane! Especially when it came to Kristen's lines, and I don't think it could be her fault. Surely. Why would they hire her if they believed so little in her abilities?It was nice to have her finally annunciating clearly instead of mumbling each line (I wondered before viewing if the English accent would make her do that, so I was happy there). Film time that could have gone toward dialogue and a relationship between SW and the H went to the dwarfs that were so freaking boring! I wanted them to die so the story could GO somewhere. It was called SWaTH, not The Wicked Queen, and yet most of the story was hers. Yet they STILL left me confused about her back-story. So choppy. I did appreciate her having deep feelings and a reason for being bad‚Äînot another 100% baddie who's evil just for kicks. I just wanted to know that reason more, since SO much of the movie directed us to wonder about her past.What was the point of William's character? Pointless! Pointless other scenes and characters, too. SW just goes along bumping into things/people and running from others, all without a plan or with those things/people changing her character/the plot.How can this movie be compared to Lord of the Rings, where Frodo had a plan from the start TO DESTROY THE RING, where people he meets CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE PLOT and ENRICH HIS CHARACTER/KNOWLEDGE?SWaTH has such a simple plot that it could be fan fiction. 3/10 for the fairy-world/set/costumes, and Liam H's characterisation of the Huntsman."
736,"I can't believe Kristen Stewart is the highest paid actress today. She barely acted in this movie and when she did, it was awful. I do not understand why she is so popular-she's not even that nice to look at. Hollywood, please don't let your standards fall so low again. I did not pay to see this movie and I would recommend that you do not either.I can't believe Kristen Stewart is the highest paid actress today.

737,"OK... Snow White and the Huntsman... I think I never seen a flick stealing so much from other movies. I counted various scenes taken almost 1to1 out of LotR, Harry Potter, Princess Mononoke, Trollhunter, Brothers Grimm, Robin Hood, Willow and plenty others. At the beginning it was funny to silently quote the original dialogues but after about an hour, by backbone was tingling with something close to shame.The acting was... well... a bit like the director put everyone in position and simply demanded them to ""act now!"". The twilight girl pretty much played her emotionless Emo-Goth-Twilight-self again (yes..I have seen some of the movies :) ). My two favourite actors? The troll and Chris Hemsworth whose physique is most definitely worth a look or two (Hemsworth, not the troll...). The characters lack profoundness and some of the leads simply play no role apart from being there! Pretty much like the guy in a P&P whose player can't join the session and who just slouches about to be remembered when fighting starts and he might have use to soak up some random thugs blows. Its better than wrath of the titans (the new one) but don't expect a Gladiator or a Robin hood. If you leave your expectations at home and simply decide to enjoy the visuals (e.g. Hemsworth), it might be a nice movie to watch. The costumes are fething amazing though."
738,"Overall I thought this film was enjoyable, a good twist on a classic fairytale which I thought worked well.But for the all the good points this film had, there was the bad and that was in a nutshell Kristen Stewart aka. Snow White the Fairest in the land? - given that Chalize Theron played the Evil Queen this was just not believable in any world fairytale or not. I went into the movie hoping that I would be surprised by her multi-dimensional acting talent but I was horribly disappointed, this is not to say that she doesn't play self-pain well but this is all she can play. Time literally stood still when she was on screen and believe me that was a lot.Aside from this Charlize Theron was completely believable as the unhappy,evil queen and was the stand out performance of the whole film. Chris Hemsworth played the part of Huntsman well but was limited with his on screen partner and their love just was not believable. I enjoyed the film overall, just would have cast a better female lead. If a sequel is made, I think the film needs a bit more humour but aside from that I would watch it!"
739,"To be honest, I didn't expect much of this movie. I've seen several Twilight movies (which disappointed me mostly because of the way Kirsten played Bella) and Thor (where Chris Hemsworth was completely unbelievable as Thor, he did a better job in Avengers though). After I've seen this movie, I'll have to adjust my opinion, though only slightly. First of all, let me say this movie has an epic story. So it was quite a disappointment this whole story was compressed into a two- hour movie. As far as I'm concerned, it would've been better with 6 hours, splitted in two parts. The problem arising from the short amount of time this movie lasted, is that character development was not quite believable. The prince appeared rather sudden and the connection between him and Snow White was not quite clear to me. The evil queen was a delight, looking stunning in both looks and performance in every single scene. While I'm at it, I'll have to say the whole movie surprised me with stunning graphics. Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly good, portraying the Hunter. Somehow, I saw a slight similarity with Viggo Mortisens' Aragorn in Lord of the Rings. My boyfriend, who went to see this movie with me, didn't like him though, he thought Chris had few expressions. I think I have to disagree - he did really well. Now, the ""bad"" part: unsurprisingly, that's Kirsten Stewart. Throughout the movie I've been watching her closely and I now realize what's the part that annoys me. It's not that she can't act. She does an alright job and I have to say I quite enjoyed her in the beginning of the movie. It's also not what other say her lacking facial expressions. She has them alright. Yet: they are ALL dramatic. Which is great when she plays the pained soul, but at certain moments where she was supposed to smile, she didn't. I actually counted 2 more or less genuine smiles throughout the whole movie. Several times when she was supposed to smile, I actually saw the corners of her mouth come up - ever so slightly! And then they fell again. I don't know what's wrong with her, but it appears to me she's just not able to smile really well? Also, I find it a huge stretch to even suggest she's more pretty than the Queen. She looked al right, but she's just not that beautiful. We discussed it later with friends, and Emma Watson would've probably done better on this one (also because of her innocent looks). Go see the movie (or better: rent it). It's not half bad, but it's certainly not great."
740,"I went to see this movie yesterday and it was a disappointment.Except for the huntsman, and maybe the prince William, the rest of the cast, especially Kristen Stewart, was so annoying. She is by no means able to perform a main character, by no means. It was sad because of the production itself, I was expecting so much, in fact I didn't get what was the loving relationship after all. Was she in love of the huntsman or not? I mean her acting was so poor that she didn't express it. I don't know. It was clear to me that the huntsman was, but what about she? I think this says it all, I couldn't understand the relationship between the characters because of her performance."
741,"Let's start with what's good about the movie.Charlize Theron, as usual is awesome. I forgot how beautiful she really is. Her acting is always good, no matter what she's in. Chris Hemsworth. Always handsome, even when scrubby. Excellent actor. Loved the dwarfs. Glad they didn't turn them into a joke like they could have. FX were excellent. Loved how the magic is fairly subtle but powerful and terrifying.Honestly, the best parts of the movie were Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth. The problem is that they had to try to play off Kristen Stewart who brought the whole movie down. As usual, she can't act in the least. Hemsworth and Stewart had next to no chemistry. Ah heck, she didn't have chemistry with anyone there, not even the dwarfs (which was really a pity since I'm betting that dance with Gus was supposed to be sweet, but just looked intensely awkward and uncomfortable).People need to stop employing Kristen Stewart to do anything. Just because Twilight ended up being a hit for unknown reasons doesn't mean she can act."
742,"The biggest flaw in this movie is (yes, you guessed right) is Kristen Stewart as Snow White. First of all, she's not that pretty specially compared with Charlize Theron. C'mmon, Snow White is supposed to be prettier than the Queen yet she pales in comparison. You have to be really blind not to notice it. Charlize is stunning and Kristen is average. Second, Kristen's acting is terrible and unnatural, and I'm being generous. She's not even believable when she tries to convince an army to fight for her. I liked little girl playing Snow White but Kristen is a no go. She really can't act. I mean you watch this movie and you end up rooting and sympathizing for Queen Raveena. Even her background story is compelling not to mention her acting is very believable and persuasive. I do like that the movie is darker than usual. As you watch the movie, you end up wishing Snow White would die instead of Queen Raveena. Now, I hear that there's a sequel with Kristen Stewart again but without Charlize Theron? That's a winner there for sure... They are going to have to release straight to DVD because I doubt anyone in his/her right mind would pay to watch that crap."
743,"Here's the deal. It's beautifully photographed, the effects are good, all the performers are all right, and it's even somewhat close to the fairy tale, at least sometimes. That said - it feels like you're watching a 10-hour movie because there is absolutely NO momentum. Despite, mind you, the urgency of the hunt and the need to get to the Duke's castle. It just feels...lifeless, and that no film like this can be made without inviting comparisons to LOTR, Narnia, Potter, etc., does not work in its favor. Seriously. The final battle scene boasted what looked like a few dozen warriors storming the castle. It was done well but, after Peter Jackson, why bother? Then, there's the Aslan-like white stag, the rebel/hero out of 'Willow', and even the blossoms on the dead bough. As I think of it, there are consistency problems too, as even fantasy has to follow some rules. As in: the evil Ravenna has pretty much nixed life and nature, yet the fairy sanctuary is all a'bloom, implying an other-worldly protection. No, because the bad guys easily wander in too. Then there's a very big why, in the odd fact that the evil queen locks up, rather than kills, the princess who is awfully likely to hold a grudge for her father's murder. I could go on, but let's just say that this might have been a great movie if they pitted Snow against Theron far more. As Ravenna, Theron is stunning and, more importantly, she is maybe one of very few actresses today who can dominate a screen like a star. And she goes missing for the bulk of the film. The best asset of all, wasted."
744,"I think that this film is very clich√© in comparison to the original snow white story line. It really doesn't show much else other than what's already in the Snow White story. There's been various interpretations and edits of the original plot, but I wasn't very impressed by this one because there just wasn't anything new. Some effects were good and the acting was very good from most characters, particularly in my opinion Charlize Theron who plays the evil queen, unfortunately I think this film was slightly pointless as it lacked any sort of originality. It was also very predictable from the start who Snow White would end up falling in love with and there was a much better choice for who this should have been to give it a little more interest."
745,"I'll start off by saying that this movie was better than I expected, but not by much. I liked the setting, the effects, and the increased realism of the final siege. It was pretty horrid on all other accounts though. The acting ... wow ... the acting. Theron was good in parts, but was an absolute ""nails on a chalkboard"" screeching harpy. Stewart showed a tad more depth than her Twilight role, but that's still not saying much. She wasn't the worst actor/actress on screen for once so she's moving up in the world. The plot was full of sinkholes a half of a mile wide. **SPOILER** So, how does the queen say she has no power in the dark forest and has to send others to do her dirty work .... yet magically knows EXACTLY where she is, teleports to where Snow is at, and tricks her into eating the apple about 80% through the film. The left the woods about 20% in. **END SPOILER** The subject matter and film-work seemed disjointed. It went from fantasy to brutal reality back to fantasy. Director, PICK ONE!!!!! Lastly, there was the whole William character that seemed tacked on after the script was written to try to cash in on Stewart's Twilight ""can't choose between 2 men"" storyline. It seemed blatantly manufactured and not a seamless part of the story. It's as if they were trying to CREATE a Team William vs. Team Huntsman that didn't actually exist. So, did I HATE this film? No actually. It was watchable if not actually enjoyable. I've seen much, much worse. The problem is I felt like I was watching Twilight without the annoyingly sparkly vampires. If you like that sort of thing, than you might actually enjoy this film. Anyone that is NOT a 12-24 year old girl .... skip it and watch something else. However ... Guys, don't be afraid of using this as date-night fodder. It's not nearly as bad as the Twilight movies."
746,"This would've been an 8 or 9 if Snow White was not played by Kristen Stewart. I have nothing against her personally.. she was cast perfectly for Twilight (though it's not in my list of good movies). But for Snow White, I expect someone who has the face of kindness and innocence. A fair lady, but with a purpose. With Kristen it's all angst.It was all good at first. Kristen plays a repressed Snow White, stuck in a tower and being strong for herself. When she meets the Huntsmen (Hemsworth) she was both frightened and cautious, and Kristen did that. But....There was a scene in the movie where she found the fairy tale land and met the fairy tale king, and I felt that every thing else, the lights, the music, the moment, very beautiful. But Kristen had to force a smile. It didn't seem like a smile Snow White would give. I'd expect Snow White to be beautiful, overwhelmed and joyful at this point, with a hint of fear and amusement. It was a point in the movie where we would fall in love with Snow White, for all her beauty and grace that the queen (Charlize Theron) had envied. But with Kristen.. there's none. There's no fragile beauty in her.. no sense of joyful adventure.. just angst, and a bit of smirk.*****SPOILER STARTS HERE******** My problem was also with the plot device of William. The filmmakers used him as the weapon Charlize Theron used to feed her the apple. I thought this character could be taken away altogether and instead use Hemsworth as the plot device. Or for that matter, any other character.The love triangle between Hemsworth and William was also confusing. I would guess that Snow White would wake up by the kiss of true love, but we were left dangling when Hemsworth kissed her and she did not show a sign of return in feelings. Does the kiss mean anything? Or was it another plot device? *****SPOILER ENDS HERE********Theron was excellent. I see a lot of Disney's Maleficent in her. But again she also showed a frailty about her, the reason why she was who she is. And Charlize just nailed it. Bravo.Chris Hemsworth was also good in his portrayal of the drunk huntsman. As do the other dwarfs (though more comedy would be nice).The CGI was impeccable. For me, this was the tipping point between a 4 or a 6 in my scales.I guess my only problem was with the script and Kristen."
747,"Cinematography was great, but story line was just really too weak to carry the show for more than 2 hours. Found the medieval times setting, combined with futuristic dark woods and happy 'sanctuary' wonderland complete with fairies all a little too confusing. Felt like show tried to do too much. Needed to be at least 45 minutes shorter. Acting seemed inconsistent. Some really well done scenes, but they seemed few and far between. Many scenes with poor acting and lines that just seemed out of place for the setting. Clearly I am out of touch with movie ratings these days...PG! You have got to be kidding! Lot of violence and gross scenes. Lot of good scenes too, but,overall, definitely would not want kids to see this show."
748,"In Snow White & the Huntsman is mostly the typical Snow White fairy-tale, only with a darker tone and a bigger emphasis on the queen and the huntsman. For those who for some reason don't know the classic tale, Snow White is a young woman that's being hunted down by the evil queen. On her way of escaping the queen, Snow White discovers seven dwarfs. They (and in this film, also the huntsman) try to protect her.I wasn't originally planning on seeing this film, but I saw it, and what did I think of it? Honestly, this is one of the most unintentionally funny movies I have seen since Plan 9 from Outer Space! But I'll go more into the funny parts later.First let's start with the good parts about it. I thought the movie was entertaining. It wasn't really boring. I thought the acting was good, although the new Twilight Snow White got a bit annoying with her Bugs Bunny-teeth and her bitch-like smile facial expressions. The huntsman was a good character. He's got some heart to him and he was overall good. The queen was pretty bad-ass. She kicked the shi...mpanzee(!) out of her brother. The dwarfs were fine, they were funny. So the characters and the action is what makes this film worth-while.As for the bad, which sometimes is good because it's bad. There's the scene where the huntsman and Snow White end up in this small village full of women, and then suddenly the huntsman out of all people asks ""where are all the men""? I may be considered immature for saying this, but I laughed my ass off at the theatre. It was so dumb and hilarious. Another part is where a couple ravens are pooping out alien-like fairy creatures. That looked so wrong! HAHAHA! But to look at the bad parts from a more serious stand-point, the movie takes itself a bit too seriously. I mean, it really tries to shove up in your face that ""THIS IS SERIOUS! This is not the kiddy Disney Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, oh no! This IS SERIOUS!"". Also, the movie is very much like The Lord of the Rings, which isn't really a very good thing. Also, there's this love interest that serves no purpose what so ever. Those are some of my problems with Snow White & the Huntsman.But negatives aside, I generally thought Snow White & the Huntsman was a good-enough film. Definitely overrated and over-hyped, but I enjoyed it for its unintentional humor, silly characters and nice special effects."
749,"So, Snow White has been given the Lord of the Rings treatment in a big budget Universal film. Unfortunately, the movie isn't half as good as the trailer was.Charlize Theron as the evil Queen Ravena is great and holds the movie together. Unfortunately she tends to disappear for long stretches of time.Chris Hemsworth as The Hunstman has charisma to spare. Ever since seeing him as doomed Starfleet commander at the beginning of the Star Trek reboot, I knew this guy was going to be a movie star.Kristen Stewart as Snow White has few duties in this movie except to wander about with slack-jawed confusion. Kristen Stewart is capable of handling this, but she has no charisma. The entire movie I'd rather be watching the evil Queen Ravena, or The Huntsman, or the CGI fairies, or the giant deer, anything. Imagine this movie with Natalie Portman as Snow White, instead. It's a better movie already isn't it?The camera-work is awful - shaky camera-work infuriates me deeply. Hollywood needs to bull-whip every director who even thinks of shaking their camera during anything but a crash or an explosion (and hopefully not even then). I got a headache watching the drunken Huntsman fight because the camera was being held by an epileptic monkey. This is inexcusable.Ironically, though, while the camera-work sucks, the film has beautiful production design from costumes to CGI to sets to location work to lighting. The look of the dark forest was especially good.Too bad it mostly doesn't mean anything. Snow White is so fair she can tame wild beats...or something. The movie never explains how any of this makes sense. She calms with wild beast through the intensity of her slack-jawed confusion, I guess.The movie falls apart though, mainly because there are too many characters and too little time. Peter Jackson is going to have to juggle more characters than this with The Hobbit, but I can guarantee I'll know the character names before the movie's over because they are going to be more than background filler.After a week of thinking, I still can't quite figure out what the character of William (or the dwarfs for that matter) were supposed to accomplish in this story. What would have been lost, exactly, by cutting William completely and folding some of him into The Huntsman? Nothing that I can think of. There isn't enough story here to carry a love triangle.I know its sacrilege to have Snow White without the dwarfs, but they aren't really given much to do and the story would have been better served on the actual title characters, Snow White and The Huntsman. Here's what the movie should have been: Snow White and the Huntsman on the run from bad guys. Instead the movie is larded up with a bunch of useless side characters.Despite all the problems, this movie has the potential for a decent sequel. Snow White is on the throne and might actually have something to do there. The Huntsman can be turned loose to snap necks and the dwarfs can be given the time to do whatever is they do. Hopefully they kill off William for the sequel (if he didn't die already, I don't remember.)"
