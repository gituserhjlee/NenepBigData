I can't believe I wasted seven whole dollars to rent it. All they did was focus on the sex because they can show it now. That's all that happened. Sex and toxicity and completely unrealistic plot lines about being an intern. Plus a bunch of other terrible stuff. It just got worse as the movie went on. Don't waste your time."
1,I wanted to like this one but everything was just rushed. Nothing built up and it just felt flat. The only redeeming thing about the whole movie was Hero Fiennes Tiffin. Watch it of you're a fan of the books I guess but if not don't even bother.
2,"Okay so during the movie I was baffled by how overdramatic Tessa, Hardin and the girl with the purple hair were acting. It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love?
And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie.
Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you.
Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point.
If I were 14 I might have likes this movie. But I'm not."
3,"One star for the main actors, for the effort and sacrifice to act in a movie this bad.
the script, the costumes, the lack of catchy music????? who the hell approved of this movie when it was made??? i actually, honestly dont get it... and im sad because i kinda liked the books."
4,"I watched it in the cinema and it really sucked. No real plot and I couldn't wait for the end which was also predicted. Boring, basic, hard to watch (u get bored easily). Wouldn't recommend."
5,"Really bad film, not worth watching. After 10mins i wanted to leave"
6,"First day of your internship your boss wakes you up and bam you stay in a luxury hotel and get drunk at the party. ü§î hmm...
Then your ex kicks the doors so he appears tough and shows how much of a bad guy he is. ü§îhmm...A little more logic wouldnt hurt"
7,"The relationship is just so toxic. There is no character development and the slut shaming is so disappointing. Tessa's coworker is supposed to be a hot distraction but there was no character development and no chemistry between the 2 actors. I really don't get how people rate this 10/10, this movie is quite bad."
8,"Sorry but this movie is really bad, iwas so excited for the trailer but then this , sorry hero and jo i really love you guys so much but the movie is so bad , and anne i have read the series and it's one of my favorite but why's the movie is such a waste of time"
9,"The first film was bad, that's just a fact, the trailer for the second one is absolutely horrendous. How is this a franchise? And there target demograph for this film makes it all the more disturbing. Young girls are gonna see this and think it's okay to be in a clearly toxic and abuse relationship as long as the guys handsome and a complete tool, it'll be fine. The first one was bad and I'm pretty damn sure the second one won't change my thoughts."
10,"One word can totally describe this ,,movie'': Trash. The script is silly and embarassing, the cast is lame. I'd rather give 0 point if that'd be possible."
11,"There are so many things wrong in this movie. I'm upset with how it turned out. Hardin is problematic, chaotic, and so toxic. He had no character development, other than the same cycle of being ""hot"", to fighting someone, to throwing stuff, to forgetting anything happened. Where's Tessa's independence? Where's the female empowerment? Where's the individuality? It's almost as if she has nothing to her other than being with Hardin. She even works in publishing, reading, and writing, and they STILL couldn't give her ANY independence and personality? This movie poorly represented diversity. I saw no plot other than s*x, and swearing. There was a bit of sl*t shaming in there, along with Hardin having s*x with Tessa TWICE while she's under the influence of alcohol. Even if she said yes while she was drunk, it doesn't follow the guidelines for consent. If you give full consent to s*x, YOU CANNOT BE DRUNK! Their relationship hadn't changed at all from the first movie. It's a shame people will see this movie, and begin to romanticize a relationship like the one Tessa and Hardin has. Although, because of the toxicity, I'm not sure I can even say they had a relationship, due to the horrible lack of communication. Please stop giving the antagonist, assumably Molly, nothing but the title of a ""mean girl."" I get it, she's the villain. But sl*t shaming her, calling her a wh*re, and giving her no personality is boring, classic, and clich√©. Oh, and I'd appreciate it if you would NOT romanticize and glorify using alcohol as a coping mechanism, along with destroying physical objects, therefore worsening the love interest, and their relationship with the main character.Oh, but it's ok, we can continue to pretend it's okay to do the following things I've just listed, because we like to ignore those points, do we?It's not a good movie, just don't waste your time on it."
12,I'm sorry I love the books but this movie didn't use major plot points from them. It barely had a story and yes it may be a bit better than the first one that's not saying much. I don't understand how anyone who read the books enjoyed this movie. Like it has no story whatsoever!
13,It was so bad. There was no plot! Hardin is terribly acted and god knows they aren't recasting him for the third movie. Dylan Sprouse and whoever plays Tessa were fine. I'm just so disappointed by the lack of substance
14,"This film was so good compared to the first one. The combination of romance and action with a bit of comedy keeps you hooked to the screen until the end. The cast did an amazing job bringing this book characters to reality especially the male lead. The actor portrayed his character with such conviction that its intensity was reflected on screen and at some point, you started to feel his pain and agony. Overall its something worthy of a watch."
15,Bad story line. Bad acting. My wife fell asleep. A total waste of money and time.
16,I loved it. Big improvement from last movie. Really want to get sequel After We Fell.
17,I was so surprised that it is even possible that anyone can seriously make a movie like this. So fake and predictable
18,I wish I never saw this movie. I've never seen such a bad movie in my life. Do yourself a favour and don't watch.
19,"After We Collided has to be the worst 2020 movie- if not worst movie- I've seen so far. And trust me this years movies haven't been too great. The whole thing is a toxic mess that is just a trainwreck I couldn't stop watching. The acting was awful and I hated Tessa more this time around. Hardin was just as terrible as before and the script had to be the worst part. This is possibly the worst script ever.
I thought this movie would be better considering all the tens, but I found myself hating the concept and movie more."
20,A huge improvement from the first movie!! Much more interesting and actually had a proper storyline. I would definitely recommend checking it out
21,"To be honest i was disappointed..not the best movie and the acting of some actors is not that good and it's just so weird like how tessa went from 0 to 1000 in like a few weeks essentially not a totally bad movie just not good there's something missing from it like something big..and also 1 hour and 45 minutes is not enough to tell the whole story i like the movie i do but overall it is not that good..now i've read a bit of the books and i've watched the first movie and the first movie is much better.
also the second film i don't like the way they shot a few of the senses just not really good. i would not recommend this to anyone..(well at least the second movie) i would just recommend to watch fifty shades lol"
22,"I was really happy with what i saw, it stuck to the book this time and i was amazed with Hardin's and Tessa's chemistry‚ù§ It was a bit rushed though but it was worth it as we got to see alot of scenes from the book! I hope the story continues and we get the last 2 moviesüòä‚ù§"
23,"Sooo i read the books before the first film came out and was low key disappointed with how different it was to them, but awc definitely made up for it. i'm not one to cry watching movies but your girl was balling her eyes out in the cinema watching the 9 days, and when tessa was in hardins nightmare ... stop. the combination between the romance and drama was amazing. anna and roger did such an amazing job, and obviously hero and jo were just as good and definitely gave us the book hessa we deserved. so insane thinking it all started on wattpad and now it's on the big screen. can't wait for awf and aeh."
24,"I personally think that this film is way overrated and I have no idea what is found enjoyable in watching two people struggle in a toxic relationship that's bad for them. Through the entire movie, all that happens is fight scene, make-up scene and then sex scene then the order repeats over again. Their is no plot or theme or purpose of the movie except watching adults yell at each other and act way too immaturely for their age. There is a lot of spins in this movie that you can't focus on one detail.
The movie also mentions Tessa going through a ""life changing dilemma""!! A dilemma that is not approached or pointed out in the movie so basically, there is no backbone or a point to the movie except the bad life choices."
25,AWC was amazing! The scenes were just like the book and nothing like the first film! 10/10 from me!
26,"I honestly loved the movie, it was 10000x times better than the first and i'm seeing forward to the next two films."
27,"After We Collided stuck along with most of the scenes we read from the book I'm so surprised on how Roger did it! Every single detail he got right from the moment Roger got to be the director this time around, I definitely want Roger to come back to film After We Fell and After Ever Happy because he will surely bring it out a lot more like he did in After We Collided I'm surprised by how much footage they filmed for the movie with only having one month to film it all, so make sure you read the book series along with the movies so far because when After We Fell comes out it's going to be even more interesting! 10/10"
28,First of all this movie was way better than the first movie and much more true to the book so it makes you wanna see it again and agian
29,"Terrible acting, one of the cringiest movies ever really this movie isn't more than just a terrible love story for teens mostly girls. If you are 14 and still watch these kind of movies you need help."
30,"If you've read the books there is no doubt you are going to love this! They so cleverly included so many important scenes even though there obviously isn't enough time to include everything. I wasn't sure I was going to like the new dynamic of adding Trevor into the mix BUT Dylan makes it impossible not to love him. Jo is absolutely amazing and the evolution of Tessa is striking in every way but Hero absolutely steals the show. His haunting looks, emotional vulnerability and insecurities completely embody book Hardin. The Christmas scene between him and Ken had me in unexpected tears. Cannot wait to go back and watch it again."
31,I love this movie! I can not see how true fans wouldn't love this film! It stayed very true to the book and the acting was amazing. Huge step up from after!
32,"This movie was amazing.
I took my partner with me.. who hasn't even seen the first movie and he loved it. He made me watch the first one once we was home.
The way this movie captures the pure emotions that are written in the books is fab!
Can't wait for the next 2 movies!"
33,"The movie is rushed and it lacks a climax. A lot of problems between the couple but none that would stick around long enough to be considered the main problem. Just different variations of issues couples go through, which is fine sometimes but doesn't really help paint a picture of a whirl wind romance. Dillan Sprouse's character provides no threat really, he was kind of irrelevant. I think they really missed the point when making the movie. All the different problems made it hard to focus on what was the main issue."
34,"Dont watch it !!!, ieksoqkdnskxbwoxnowonxbwjwkdkdkxjd w f r e g qiidiw fe"
35,"One: I felt more character from all of the actors in the first movie. The more seasoned actors in here, Dylan, Candice, a few others; they weren't as painful to watch. I actually found the only scenes I cared for involved Sprouse because of his ability to stay true to form with his character: charming, intelligent, and sensible. However, this was (hands-down) a rush job. Little to no flow. The actors can only do so much with what they are given, but come on. I honestly expected better.Two: The fault most certainly originates in the script. Why? Just why...? I admittedly enjoyed After more than this one because of the simple fact that I did not read the book series until after I watched the film. After I read the book series, I appreciated that with such an annoyingly repetitive, drawn-out storyline to go off of, the film had potential to make Tessa & Hardin's story more interesting, and thus, more appealing. But they ruined that chance with this film."
36,"This movie brings to life some of the delicious scenes from Anna Todd's addictive After series. I have read some complaints about sex while drunk--come on. Couples have sex when they are drunk- they aren't on a first date or just getting to know each other. I am probably being generous with my rating as the storytelling could be better: less planned out sex scenes, more dirty words like the book, and a slower pace to really show character growth and introspection. But hey, they took this amazing roller coaster of a book series, found two gorgeous people to act it out, and by God, I am not going to complain."
37,"As a huge fan of the books I was excited for this film is was more like the book then the first one and brought the book to life...the acting, the romance, the drama and the intimate scenes where amazing"
38,"Massive improvement from the first book, storyline is just like the book, much more consistent and reticent of book Hessa. We finally get proper book Tessa and Hardin, the emotion was absolutely amazing and the chemistry was better than the first film by far. Brought the characters to life with such conviction.Loved Robert Kumple did a fantastic job of being the book to life, with emotional moments that will have you weeping. Absolutely loved it and cannot wait for After We Fell, hope it's directed by Robert Kumple because he delivered it perfectly!"
39,This film was perfect! Yes it was rushed but it's always difficult to make large books into a 2 hour film. Praying someone picks this book series up for a tv series with Hero and Jo of course!
40,"This whole movie is glamourising and romanticisimg abusive and toxic masculinity not to mention how the writers are using harry styles' name for fame by shaming and portraying him as the opposite of who he really is. They made a whole movie franchise based on cheap fan fiction. Please if you're above 12 years old and you like this movie, you need help"
41,"The worst movie I've seen this year so far and it is October already. The acting was weak and unpursuasive, story line predictable, cringey-100x already seen scenes. There was too much of uncomfortable sex scenes, screaming and swearing. The ""bad-boy"" who is actually good and the ""good-girl"" who has a little of bad in her is just so overdone that it hurts to watch when you add to the mix slut shaming and on-and-off relationship based on jealousy, distrust and lie it just makes it under the average movie. 10/10 would not recommend."
42,"I'm so sad. I was into the books but this.. This must be a joke. Hardin in this movie was NOTHING like in the books. And I'm a huge fan of Hardin bug genuinely, I wanted Trevor for Tessa. And Mr. Sprouse was incredible in this movie. Congratulations"
43,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it."
44,"If you find this review, make sure you watch the first movie ""After"" and watch the sequel again and again because you won't regret ngl. I'm currently waiting for the next movie, After We Fell and After Ever Happy. It's kinda sad thinking that the promotion will be over in next two years. Gonna miss all the actors and the crew. xx"
45,"I was really happy about this sequel. I liked the books and watched the first movie at least 6 times. I don't know what the problem was with this one, I didn't feel any chemistry. They didn't have Tessa and Hardin vibe at all. Acting was sooo diferent, no great music, no great moments, nothing tense and memorable. It's like they ran through the scenes and had one day to shoot them. I'm sad :("
46,"I understand that the movie is not supposed to be too long like the book but everything was too rushed. The scenes weren't developed enough to make actual sense and honestly the characters kinda lacked emotion. Even drunk Tessa looks so normal you'd wonder if she was actually drunk. If I'd not read the book, I'd be so confused as to what exactly I was watching. I still love the story but if there's to be another sequel, there should be more emotions and scene developments to make it make more sense to those who havent read the books before."
47,The worst movie from 2020 that I saw....boring and again boring
48,"SUCH an improvement from After. If you loved the books, you will LOVE the second movie. Book Hessa is brought to LIFE!!! The acting is amazing, and it is the perfect concoction of romance and comedy. I will be watching this over and over and over again. Can't wait for the next two movies <3"
49,"The movie was so damn good i love it!
the combination of romance and action with a bit of comedy keeps you hooked to the screen until the end. One of the best movie i ever watch!
with love from ALBANIA"
50,"Totally worth watch i love it so much, way better then the first movie for sure, i would definitely recommend this movie but make sure you watch the first movie ""after"" first :)"
51,Really enjoyed the movie was so much better than I anticipated!! I can't wait for the other movies to follow! :)
52,"Absolutely loved it. They nailed it!
It hit all the feelings with me. I really really loved it. I recommend everyone who loves After to go see it.
We got to see more of the Hardin & Tessa and Hessa we know from the incredible books Anna Todd wrote.
I'm just about to book my tickets for next time!! I really can't wait for next time!!"
53,Absolutely loved it so obsessed with it. They did so much better than the last time.
54,I loved this movie so much. I cried and laughed a lot!
55,"Okay, this movie is absolutely AMAZING. The first one was ok, but this one DESERVES its recognition. The improvement such as the actors and the dialogues are amazing, and the scenes are more developed and beautiful. 10/10 ABSOLUTELY"
56,"First of all, great improvements on acting abilities for the main characters. Hero did an amazing job portraying Hardin and all of his issues, and Jo is the perfect Tessa.
The movie covers a lot of the main scenes from the book, however, some of the scenes felt rushed. There are times where you are just grasping the situation and beginning to feel an emotion, but suddenly something else is happening and you are still trying to process what happened before.
I loved the comedy, however, there was just too much comedy for a book that is supposed to be angsty and dramatic. For example, the shower sex scene was displayed as a comedy, and it took away from the sexiness.
I cringed during some sex scenes. The office sex scene was the worst. The way they were moving was just unrealistic and uncoordinated. Sometimes they appeared as if they didn't know how you are supposed to move during sex positions, which was a huge turn off because that makes sex scenes look too technical, unrealistic and too choreographed. Jo and Hero have repeated over and over how choreographed and technical the sex scenes are that it is palpable on screen and not sexy at all.
I still loved to see my favorite book series come to life, and Hero Fiennes Tiffin is just makes the whole movie worth it even with all its faults. There were a lot of cute Hessa moments and that's what we are here for. Also, the new cast members were spot on and made this movie even more enjoyable.
I would recommend it, if you have not read the books you may be a little lost, but if you are a fan you will get to see these characters come to life."
57,I can honestly say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The lead Male simply cannot act. Clearly living of his grand fathers name.
58,"I was excited for this movie, I'll be honest. The first movie was far from perfect but it intrigued me enough to read the books and they hooked me up completely.
After We Collided movie is emotionally charged and intense... maybe even too intense (struggled to swallow my popcorn at times :) So much was going on in this movie, it was overwhelming. If I haven't read the books, I probably wouldn't understand all scenes, because everything was a bit rushed and fragmented. On the other hand, it will be still interesting to rewatch.
Hero has improved his acting so much, I was pleasantly surprised! And comedic moments were nice for a little breath of air.However... Being a young adult, I didn't like how much alcohol was in the movie. It was unpleasant to see Tessa drinking so much, being a mess. She has gotten drunk twice and, what even worse, Hardin seemed to like it. In the books I admired her purposefulness and dedication to work no matter how bad things with Hardin were. But in the movie, it seemed like her intelligence decreased. In my opinion, this movie is very bad for teenage girls, as it sets a terrible example of unhealthy relationships and bad alcohol habits. For young adults though, it's quite entertaining to watch."
59,"Hiro's disgusting acting, his facial expressions and expressions of emotion spoiled the whole impression from watching the film."
60,"So amazing, it was such an improvement from the first movie. They really did a great job."
61,It's a million times better than the first film. The chemistry between both hero and Josephine is amazing and they for sure upped their game. God bless Roger Kumble for this amazing film
62,"Well i know it was going to be different than the book.
But it still pretty much let me down in every way.
Where are any of the emotions and so many precious moments that where pretty significant in the book.
I likes the movie kinda so, not that bad."
63,"Tessa is stupid. I watch this with my older teenage daughter and had to talk to her about how wrong the movie was. It's never okay to be in such a toxic, abusive relationship like that. Talking, cursing, yelling at one another like they did is never okay. Hardin needed to figure out himself first and be healthy enough to care for and respect himself before he could be in a relationship. That didn't happen. He didn't go through the healthy process and therefore their relationship will continue to be toxic. Tessa didn't have respect for herself either if she thought being treated like garbage is okay. Bad message for people in relationships. Highly disappointing and not a good message for teens!!"
64,"My favorite thing about this movie is that Hardin is the one telling it. Sure it's from both their POV but there is much more from the side of Hardin and they come back to his narrative near the end. I feel that while the story between Hardin and Tessa is being told relative to the book it's lacking the outside parts that make their story that much more in the books. It's much less a college romance based around navigating school, clicks and romances and more of an adventure of young adults exploring themselves in a world of ""grown ups"" and familial hardships. The movie itself seemed a bit fast some scenes not falling into one another smoothly or making sense in transition in my opinion. I will however, despite that tidbit, watch it again and again just because I'm a fan of both the books and what the team is trying to convey with the movies."
65,"I read the After series 2 years ago and it was a life-changing experience. I re-read it again recently cause I've miss the characters so much. The second movie has done such a great job bringing our book Hardin and Tessa into real life. Anna, Roger and the crew have created such beautiful and amazing storyline. Of course there are differences, but like Anna said, something is better written than being displayed in front of camera. About the actors and actresses, all of them did such a great job, I almost thought the main characters are actually in love. Hero successfully brought Hardin's love for Tessa into real life, and Josephine is so talented. Love how they give Trevor some more stories than the book, but I was still hoping for more Zed stories. Overall, this movie is better than any romance I've seen. This movie carries depth and lessons, even if you haven't experienced but can still relate to. I'm glad that the 3rd and 4th movies are in production soon, but I hope more countries (for example in Asia) can watch the movie. Also, waiting for a release day on Netflix or DVD announcement. This movie is worth the watch.
Tbh English is not my mother tongue, so I'm trying my best to express my love for After We Collided. Thank you for making Afternators' dream comes true."
66,Improvement from the first one and let me just say Roger Kumble is the man
67,"It's an abusive, toxic relationship. Not the sort of thing you'd expect to see glorified in 2020. The Hardin actor is wooden, uninspired and rubbish in all aspects. Loads of sex scenes set to dodgy music to make teenage girls who know no better think it's romantic when in reality it's not. This will give plenty of the teenage girls who see it a totally skewed perspective on what is a healthy relationship and what it means to have a life outside of it. The writers should be embarrassed by how poorly written it is. Razzies will come its way if it isn't completely ignored, which it probably deserves to be."
68,GET YOUR MONEY GET YOUR BEST FRIEND AND GO TO YOUR NEAREST CINEMA üòÇ
69,I've read the books 3 times and I waited a year for this to come out after the first one came out . I'm pretty disappointed because it was so freaking rushed ! They took a bunch of the main points of the book for this film but didn't show the build up of how they got there . I gave three stars because if you have read the books and you know the series of events it's easy for you to put it together . I'm grateful to have seen what they showed in the movie because it really drew a picture to the book but a little more of a story line would make this movie great .
70,"Hundred times better than the first movie, the acting really improved and i had so many emotions when watching this. I was laughing, crying, but it was still all very beautiful and hot."
71,"Wasn't exactly like the book but what movie is, I really enjoyed the twist they put on it and will look forward to the next two movies"
72,The movie was good. The characters were very successful.It was very funny and cute. But I would like it to be the beginning of the movie not to be so fast and to have a few more details from the book as at the scene of the accident to have the dialogue of Tessa and Hardin and some more scenes from the book. 7/10!. I hope the third move to be even better.
73,"So much better than the First. The books were just amazing. When the first adaptation was released I was just so happy and right then so disapointed by that thing for young teenager, without any relation with the book. But this sequel follows the book very well. Hoping that there will be a 3 !"
74,"This movie was just pieced together and didn't flow. It was also promised by producers to be more like the book and I don't feel that it was. It lacked details and did not have enough of an appearance of some of the actors that it should have. I was very disappointed. We waited all this time with delay after delay and paid extra money to watch it at home because not all theaters are playing it and, in my opinion, it was a waste of my time and money. I mean no disrespect to the actors. They did their part, the producers just didn't hold up their end. I thought there were several moments of brilliance in acting by Hero, Josephine, Dylan and Louise. I can only hope that the next two movies of the series are better."
75,"I'm not even sure where to start. I really wanted to Love this movie as much as I loved reading the books.
I'm literally dumbfounded. This is not the book I read. I do not want to belittle anyone in this review, so I'm going to take a deep breath and say...... take it for what it is, but I expected just a little more than what I got. Now I'm going to re-read this book (because I do love this story) so I can get this awful movie out of my head.
Uugggghhhhhh?!?!?!? WHY?!?!?!??? Maybe, just maybe it will be a cult classic like Xanadu or Grease 2 some day, But I highly doubt it üòù (and that's saying something cause those are 2 of my favorites:) hahaI wrote this review while pausing the movie half way through. Now I just have to say one more thing......
UGH! Why, Anna. How could you allow Hollywood to do this to you books?"
76,This literally saved 2020 tbh! Some of the good scenes in the book weren't in the movie but overall it was good. The chemistry between the characters was very evident and also the development of Hardin and Tessa's personalities was great.
77,"The most ridiculous movie ever made! The two lead characters are atrocious....Did they really have acting lessons? The costume designer should be hanged Tessas outfits were awful and that bad I am surprised anyone in the movie showed interest in her.....she looks like Adele and I cant stand her!
His annoying English accent and bad boy character was so cliched....dont remember seeing Selma Blair but thats good cos I cant stand her either....my USB stick now has space on it for a better movie.....so glad I didnt pay to see this rubbish!"
78,"I loved it! I never read the books but did watch the first movie After, so as new comer it was suspenseful and captivating! Hero and Josephine are both great actor/actress. They did a fantastic job portraying emotion beyond the screen. Cheers!"
79,Really enjoyed it can't wait to see what happens next. Hope we don't have to wait too long love tessa and hardin
80,It just talked about sex and just showed them having a pretty awful relationship I would say this would be for teens that are like 17-19 and adults not for young kids or young teens
81,"This movie was awful. I wanted to like it, as I quite liked the first one but it just seemed very rush, no real story line and very very cringe.Within the first 5 minutes of the opening scene there are more 'swear words' than in the whole of the first movie, it just seemed like it was trying too hard to be more 'bad' that it was coming off cringeworthy. Also there were way too many sex scenes, I feel like half of the movie was watching them have sex.The movie was basically Tessa and Hardin falling out, arguing, making up, having sex and repeat. Elements of the movie were just completely unrealistic too.I only gave it three stars because hello It's Hero, obviously - and Dylan Sprouse's character was funny. Unless you're a fan of the books (which is one of the reasons why I didn't leave my friend who is a fan in the cinema) I wouldn't bother."
82,"I read the series right before this one came out because I loved the first movie so much- I watched it so much that I had to know more about the characters. Sadly for this film, it falls flat to really build the characters into what the book did, I also think if I didn't read the book, I would have no idea what even happened in this movie it's so broken up and odd in the structure it was in. I know Anna Todd influences the film by being the writer and you simply can't make the movie as detailed as the book but it really didn't even feel like the same story or characters and I hope they do better in the next films."
83,"Is better developed than the first, but it still lacks of diaolgue between the main characters where they talk more about their relationship or feelings
I really loved in the book the part when they are in the apartament with hardin's mom beacuse it shows you how broken he is for hurting tessa and let her know it, i really expected to see that in the movie but it doesn't come out
in the final reunion of them they could have done better with more dialogue,
outside that it was really a good movie had funny moments i loved the fight between molly and tessa"
84,"I really want to see all the scenes from the book, performed by all these actors.
Little, little. I want more"
85,Honestly was really good loved it so much can't wait for it to come out somewhere else other than cinema
86,"It is terrible because we are stuck seeing the same abusive relationship and Hardin's toxic masculinity. The other new and old characters become irrelevant. The trailer makes it seem like there will be some kind of intense love triangle, and Hardin and Tessa get some time off to figure things out. Trevor did not make a huge impact on the narrative. All I see is the addiction between the two characters."
87,"I saw the movie today it was sooo good, much better than the first one, much closer to the book! Can't wait for the 3rd movie 100000/10"
88,After. Should have stopped there ! ..... this sequel is a total disaster!!!.. why make it !?
89,"Was worried about how they did the first movie which was made without the foresight of a series. This does what it needs to and fills in holes made in the first movie. No way could they fit all the drama from the books in an hour and a half movie. I'm looking forward to the movies to come.It's a fun, young film. Don't go into thinking it's a serious drama, although some themes are pretty serious. Give this series time to grow with the characters."
90,"If you're looking for a quality movie, look somewhere else because this is not one of them. The acting is nearly unbearable (more so on the behalf of Hero Fiennes-Tiffin), the plot is non-existent, and the writing is trash. I will that this is perfect for a good laugh. It's so bad that it's funny!"
91,"I've read the books and this was just appalling! No character development, no real storyline. Massively rushed! What happened?? Loved the first movie, completely regret watching this one!"
92,"I watched the first movie so I wasn't expecting much but i found myself really enjoying this one. Like others have said, AWC is an improvement. Is it because it follows the book more closely? I don't know... I read the books and i can't say it was one of my favorite series. In fact I found book Hessa's tantrums, break ups and make ups quiet obnoxious. So i personally liked that much of the back and forth were cut out.
AWC was entertaining - there's drama, comedy, romance. Was it hokey and cringy at parts? Sure, but with an easy story to follow, pretty people to look at and an escape from reality I say it's worth the 1 hr 45 min"
93,"If, as you're watching this movie, you're hoping it will get better..... don't hold your breath. It's a hot dumpster fire the whole way through and I'm severely disappointed."
94,"The After movie is special. If you watch it alone the main characters have incredible chemistry and the editing and music tie the whole thing together. Yes it's a bit hokey but what ""teen"" romance isn't.
Then came quarantine and I read the book series and found out the movie is a PG version of the R book and so many big things were changed.
Skip ahead to After We Collided having read the 700 page book first and knowing the book's writer wrote the script, and the director of Cruel Intentions was in charge I was super excited. The movie was too rushed they tried to fit too much of the book in it and the director did not pull good performances out of the actors like the first one did. It didn't have the special thing that After did. I'm not saying it was bad it just didn't have the magic the first movie had.
The next two movies have a new director and many new actors due to covid restrictions (besides the main two) so hopefully they can get the magic back!!!"
95,"The first movie was far from great but it was enjoyable. However, this one was far poorer quality. It was filmed weird with weird close ups and it jumped around which made it hard to understand. The acting definitely was a bit wooden and worse than the first movie. It did get slightly better towards the end. There was some ok scenes of acting but they were rare. Hero was beautiful as usual but unfortunately this movie did not positively show any of the casts capabilities."
96,"The first movie was quite good in the sense that the two fragile characters were discovering themselves and had real constructive time together in building a relationship via trials and error with an emotional flowing storyline in the background. It was above average, but romantically touchy.The characters had amazing chemistry together and they still do, but with the second (movie), its shallow material and the over and artificial dramatization of almost every collision scenes, even having Anna Todd as the screenplay writer and one of the producers of the movie, doesn't save it from crashing gloriously.After We Collided, is empty, toxic and unrealistic with a way crowded cast, contributing to nothing.
Even the original Writer couldn't save it; maybe she was too blinded by the sense of ""gloriousness"" of her own screenplay.Sad collision!"
97,"Boring, basic, hard to watch (u get bored easily).
Wouldn't recommend."
98,"First of all.
I loved the books, really love them.
First movie was a cute movie for teenager. Not at all as in the books.
They told us the second one would more for adults.
But really, the scene were tessa dances in a nightclub like if was a commercial for deodorant.
The ver very very bad sex scene. No chemistry, no intamcy, no connections between caracter.
U can tell, its was there to please the audience but it doesnt fit in.
Does it happen to you to hide yourself sometimes when you watch a movie/ tv show when you re embarassed for the actors?
Let me say, i did this 1 million times
HOWEVER, the actor seems fine. I hope they ll have other movies to show us how good they really are."
99,"I read fanfic as a hobby - it's my guilty pleasure meaning I have a high tolerance for badly written material but had never come across this. I now wish I had. I've NEVER felt this way about a film but it almost had me leaving the cinema.I saw the first film on Netflix, thought it wasn't too bad so decided to see the sequel. There were so many story lines crammed in - it was obvious it was based on bad FanFiction. If you had added some BDSM it would have been a knock off of fifty shades - if you have watched both, tell me that, at its basic, it's not the same story line...The only reason this got 2 stars was because even with the horrific writing and awful story line, the acting was good enough to semi redeem it. I honestly feel sorry for the actors, so many of the lines were obviously direct dupes from the fanfic that would never be said in real life.In short, if you have any form of taste in a film, do not watch this. Save yourself the cinema cost and watch the first one again, at least it's tolerable."
100,"It's always exciting watching the opening of a sequel hoping it's better then the last, with extra romance, dramas and story line. Although there were raunchy scenes that made the cheeks glow red and body run hot, there was little in depth explanation with the rival romance, only showing small scenes of flirtation.
More details or back story would have been better.
Josephine Langford (plays Tessa) did a great job growing the character into her own person, from a quiet and sturdy person fresh out of high school to a free spirited, experimental individual finding her path in both romance and career. Hero (Hardin) also did a fantastic job showing the more vulnerable and emotional side of the character in this movie. Both actors/actress did a great job bouncing off of each other, BUT the movie itself seemed to be focusing on the characters growth, which was a little bit boring, more than it did with a plot line which could have been more exciting and interesting. I do think they did not give any justice to the Trevor character and pretty much added it in like it was a forced requirement.
All in all, it was a movie that was great to watch and be entertained in certain scenes, funny and sexy."
101,"I will accept After (2019) was not perfect, but this is a great movie. A great movie which answers questions we might have had from After (2019). A perfect ROMANCE DRAMA bringing teardrops both ways."
102,"I read the books, which made me drawn towards the movie but oh my God, major disappointment. After also didn't quite show major plot points. This movie too missed it. Zayn(Zed)? Mind showing him as one of the important character? A major disappointment ‚úåüèΩ"
103,"I feel like they tried so hard to fit all of the plots in the book that it just seemed way too scrambled. They barely mentioned the conflict with Tessa going to Seattle, and Hardin ""leaving"" barely even felt like he left at all.
This entire movie consisted of them being broken up, getting together, breaking up, and then getting back together again. The books were so good and I feel like the movie could've ben good too if they weren't trying to fit all the elements of the book into an hour and a half. Overall it was an okay movie."
104,Well I quite liked it and look forward the next one
105,"I have read the book and throughout watching the movie, this one and the first, i've noticed a big differences that bothered me. The first one is the bet- the bet was the cliffhanger of Tessa's and Hardin's relationship, he took her virginity for a bet against Zed. When in the movie it was about making her fall in love with him then brake up with her and had nothing to do with Zed. Zed is not a significant character in the movies as he is in the books. In the book he, Tessa and Hardin have sort of a love triangle where the two boys hate each other. Where in the movie, they seem to be friends when Zed actually appears on screen, and Tessa and Zed have absolutely no relationship, even though he loves her in the book. The second difference is Hardin's behavior. In the books Hardin is a very violent and aggressive man, who hurt everyone around him. Where in the movie, he is pleasant and nice to others around him, and his relationship with Tessa is much better than in the book. We don't get to see his outbreaks and the way he apologized to Tessa after her mum came to their house before Christmas and Hardin's mum found out about the bet. He wrote her a letter to apologize, using the first paragraph from Darcy's letter to Elizabeth. The letter is what made her forgive him and the movie didn't portrait that properly. Also, in the movie, when Tessa is telling him about Trevor Touching her, he seems unbothered when in the book he would flip. The movie opens when we see Tessa and Hardin haven't spoken in a month, which in the book didn't happen at all, the first time they went nine days without speaking is after they got into a fight over Tessa's job offer in Seattle. Another huge difference is the relationship between Tessa and her coworkers. In the movie, they didn't build it to make it look like Tessa and Kimberly are friends. Where in the book they are. For example, in the movie Tessa answer the phone because her boss called and when she asks her to watch Smith they go to the office to watch him. Where in the book they are friend and Kimberly is asking Tessa for a favor to watch Smith- at Tessa's and Hardin's house. Where Hardin doesn't want to communicate with Smith and the little boy only speaks to him. In the movie, Hardin initiates the conversation. In the movie, after Tessa kisses a stranger in the new years eve party, she goes home and he stay's the night at the frat house. In the book, Hardin leaves Tessa at the house without her phone and Zed takes her home. The movie make it seem like Tessa does nothing wrong, but in the books she keeps her relationship with Zed in spite of the pain it causes Hardin. Another thing that bothered me is the lack of relationship with Hardin's family. Karen and Tessa don't have a relationship, and she doesn't live in their house. In the book, Tessa is particularly a family member at the Scott's and has a good relationship with Karen. Also, Mr. Vance didn't offer her a job or took her from the office to Seattle in the book, but in the movie he does and it's unrealistic. In the book he invites her to Seattle and she asks him for a job in the new office which he gladly gives her. The movie does not contain a proper plot-line and the difference from the books is implacable, I wish they stayed true to the books"
106,Why do they make movies that are nothing like the books??? People like the books for a reason!!! Plot line was way off and the turmoil between the two was hardly evident. Books are much better!!
107,"This was a total disappointment for me. This whole thing was so rushed. As a fan of the books, there are so many dynamics they are completely missing out on, which are really important for character development. So many of these scenes that people are saying were done right from the book are completely wrong. Tessa's birthday? She spent her birthday in a motel room. They also got a new apartment together, not staying in the one from the first movie. The fight with Ken was supposed to be huge as well at Christmas. And Tessa was supposed to have actually gotten home before running back to Hardin. Overall this was just really sad. I actually liked the first movie better. It's a shame that the book was incredibly written, and then so poorly represented on screen.Also, we really are completely normalizing toxic relationships to an age where this was a Harry Styles fanfiction? We gotta do better than that."
108,"Im a keep it real.. i would not add this movie to my collection. I watched it once and thats all I needed. If I could have a compilation of just Hero being Hardin and of course the scene of his wonderful bum thats all I would want. The movie unfortunately to me didn't do the books justice at all. I understand that they can't follow it to a T and fit it all in a movie but the changes made felt unnecessary but I respect the work that was put into it. With that said, the flow of the movie felt rushed making it sloppy. There was too much of pop music. It was certainly better than the first I will give it that. Not the best but support Hero and will watch the rest of the movies for him."
109,"Love watching the story of Tessa and Hardin continue, the softness she brings to his life and the edge he brings to hers. It is great to watch this love story move to an adult level."
110,"Coming from someone who read all the books watching this movie out a big smile on my face! I loved how this movie really is like the book. It's funny, romantic, sad, everything a movie needs. I loved the actors, Dylan Sprouse really made a good addition to the film. If you like a good love story you'd love this movie, it is definitely better than the 1st one!! I loved the acting and LOVE the story line"
111,"It was different. Wasnt the same, sucked sorry üò≠üò≠üò≠"
112,Best movie! Stuck to the book mostly too. The actors were great. Looking forward to the last two movies in the series.
113,I fell in love with the cast of this film from the 1st film and i was invested in the cast and the story .The 2nd movie was full of love making .What i love the most about this film is it tells the truth about how easy people can get the wrong idea or miss understand eachother it happens all the time .This movie shows you how easy that it can happen .I am so excited to see the story unfold .
114,"I felt it was a rushed film , it was good , it followed the book a bit but not all of it"
115,"Some of these reviews are quite strange, I have read the books and like many others loved it, but this movie was AMAZING. Honestly I could watch this movie a million times, in fact when the movie ended I hit replay. Love this movie, please go watch and give a great review because I really want the next two movies out so please go watch!"
116,"Closer to the books than the first movie. Although it was a bit rushed, i still enjoyed it. However, wished the movie was at least 2hrs so they could put in more details. I do prefer the cinematography of the forst movie but AWC did more justice to the books in terms of dialogue and scenes. Looking forward to the next 2 movies and hopefully its gets better"
117,"The first movie was pretty disappointing, but this one really made up for it. We get to see so much more of their story and even though we don't get the exact same as in the book, they still did a good job in giving us a better story compared to the first. The actors have grown so much since the first film and I am excited to see the next two movies!"
118,"Another film with a dyed non blonde, that doesn't like her natural look so has to change it."
119,Better than the first one but still bad storyline. Nothing against the acting skills but the storyline is so overated. Break up - together - break up - together same story over the whole movie
120,"Nothing happens, really! There's no story... we just watched it last night in the cinema, and we walked out for the first time ever with 45 minutes left of the movie."
121,"This is my first time rating a film 1 star, but feel like I have to warn people to not see this movie. It was the most cringe film I have ever seen, and nothing made sense.the acting and script was so childish and bad. Can't believe it even got out and approved. Do not watch, not worth your time."
122,"THIS IS LITERALLY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE I'VE WATCHED. I SWEAR YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA WATCH THIS especially to those who love watching romantic and drama movies, one more thing THE ACTING WAS ON POINT. I LITERALLY LOVE IT. üíñüíñ"
123,"Love hardin and tessa, so much drama and they still find their way back to each other everytime"
124,This is actually the best movie of after series. The director is the best ! It's amazing. No more words !
125,"First one was bad, this one is awful. It's the continuation of a story that simply isn't there, and it shows. The plot is stretched so thin. Most scenes are just filler. There are no deep emotions and no gripping moments. It's merely a clich√© and shallow romance.The characters are empty and the setting is laughable. Tessa gets a job as an intern, and on her first day, she gets invited to a nightclub. Her whole job is basically just drink and have fun. That is not how it works in real life. But it wouldn't even matter that much if the rest of the movie weren't so bland. The love triangle is also incredibly forced. It was there purely to provide fake tension.A lot of the characters' actions come out of nowhere. The fight Tessa and Hardin have near the third act was beyond contrived. A girl who hasn't appeared in the entire story comes out of the blue to tell Hardin: I don't kiss and tell. Then Tessa gets all pissed.
WHAT?! That wasn't set up at all. It's lazy writing to its fullest extent. At least in the first movie their fight made sense. Here it's just an excuse to have the slightest bit of artificial tension. The whole story played out like that: ""Just have the characters make decisions that don't make any sense to move whatever resemblance of a plot we have forward.""Horrible movie. Complete waste of time."
126,"I read the Wattpad books when I was younger and really enjoyed them. I didn't necessarily expect the movie to be great but I thought it would at least be watchable. The movie was terrible. There were so many cringeworthy moments, the dialogue was terrible and all of the characters were unlikable."
127,"I certaintly didn't expect to like the movie. BUT after the party scene. Well, scenes.
First with Hardin's father then at school with Steph and that miscomminication scene where Tessa kissed a stranger. ""IT WAS AMAZING ACTING"" I thought. Just like the book.can I just appreciate the team behind the scene? you all did great! well done!I don't know where I lost the connection, but after the movie, I just kind a lost the ""AFTER"" feeling when I really love something. You know what I mean? It was like post-relenting. I should be excited for the third movie series. But I'm not."
128,"Don't listen to all these pretentious ""critics"". The movie was amazing. So was the first After movie. Gripping from start to finish. Funny as well. I can't wait for the 3rd and 4th movies. Perfect teen romance movie with hot steamy scenes. I will definitely be watching this movie again. It was just a fun escape."
129,"This movie was not an Oscar worthy movie which is fine because it never claimed to be. I feel like people went into it thinking that it was going to be award winning. It was always supposed to be a feel good chick flick that you can rewatch when your bored and that's exactly what it turned out to be. It's not the type of movie that is supposed to be realistic it's just fun. I personally liked it a bit better than the first movie and think it's a decent adaptation of the book. As far as the acting I don't think it's fair to judge them from a poorly written script with bad dialogue, I think they did however do the best they could with it. I've seen a couple of other projects by the main leads where their acting was spot on. I think that happens a lot, where an actor is deemed as bad because of one movie that was poorly written (there are many other cases). In conclusion I think this movie is for fans of the books and people who haven't read it probably won't favour this movie but with that being said my friends who haven't read them love it so I guess it's all about preference."
130,"Worst movie I have ever seen. Biggest waste of time. Laughing stalk of film industry. Cannot stress this more, DO NOT WATCH unless with friends and would like to be peeved off at television."
131,"I'm going to keep this brief and to the point.I enjoyed the movie purely because I enjoyed the book (admittedly a guilty pleasure) and it was a fast, easy way to spark memories of the pages I so loved. However, all but cutting out Zed (a significant character in the novel) both confused and saddened me... Where was he? Why was he snogging a twiggy bitch? Why doesn't he love Tessa? And most importantly HOW will they make the third book into a film with Zed being struck from the script? His relationship with Tessa and war with Hardin is paramount to the events of in After We Fell.A am absolutely completely and utterly convinced that Zed was struck out due to his actor being less famous than Dylan Sprouse, as they neglected Samuel Larson' s Zed in favour of over amplifying Dylan's Trevor. I don't even really like Trevor in the books, why oh why is there more of him in the movie!?I am disappointed."
132,I loved the second movie. Everything about it Hero and Josephine's chemistry has become so much stronger and their character development was amazing. It was very fast paced but it was closer to the book and I loved the entry of new characters they were amazing as well. I can't wait to see the next two movies.
133,"I don't actually dislike this movie, because it did relax me after a long day at work, but definitely not for the right reasons lol. The whole plot and the characters are so clich√©-ridden, that I started seriously questioning whether this is some intentional meta, or just simply incredibly bland - I'm pretty sure it's the latter. The caharcters are basically cardboard-cutouts, they exhibit absolutely zero personality, I have never been this uninterested in the main charcters of a movie. They also try to portray them as having this super dramatic, passionate, wildfire romance, when objectively, nothing interesting has ever happened to them or between them, so it's just really awkward to see them screaming at each other and acting like they are driving each other crazy, when again, literally nothing has happened lol. I loved Dylan Sprouse's character though, he was a breath of fresh air, and it was nice to see the charming Candice King again (even though she was given zero interesting material to work with).This movie was OK to watch once with a coupon for the movie ticket, but it was incredibly forgettable, I have no idea how this franchise blew up like it did lol.The soundtrack is really cool though, you should check that one out!"
134,"This sequel is better than its first film in some ways, but sadly it is worse in many more ways.A good attempt in the comedic parts in this sequel, and a good choice of new casts for the new characters, especially Dylan Sprouse. I think he did a good job portraying the role of Trevor, very close to what I imagined in the novel. The returning casts were also better than they were previously in the first film, except for Hero Fiennes Tiffin. I think his acting is weird, unnatural and exaggerating at most times.In the novel, Hardin is someone who has mood swings, someone who is mysterious & secretive because he has something to hide about his past, yet charming still. I really have to give credits to Anna Todd (the author) for charming her readers with merely words, but I'm afraid Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) has failed to charm us in this movie adaptation.As for the story, some parts were different than in the novel. But like the Anna Todd said, certain parts that seem romantic when reading the novel, may seem cheesy in the movie when being acted out. I agree with that, and it's perfectly ok when some settings in the movie are different than in the novel, and/or some parts were omitted. BUT...... It is NOT OK, when most parts in the movie are being rushed through, neglecting the development of it's original story & mood in the novel, which is a huge killer for me (this explains my low rating).In novel, there are a lot of struggles in thoughts, in emotions, in decision-making for these 2 main characters (Tessa & Hardin). The reason why people loved the novel is because it carries you along to an emotional roller coaster ride with the 2 main characters (T & H). The thoughts that ran through their minds, problems that they were struggling with, were meticulously & beautifully written by Anna Todd, allowing you to feel, understand and emphatize with them.But this 2nd movie adaptation has failed to do the same, it has forgotten the importance of the PACE in storytelling. PLUS, there is a lack of good music/soundtracks in this 2nd film. If you recall, in the 1st film during the scene where Tessa & Hardin spent their time at the river, it was beautifully filmed, not rushed and given time to develop its story and on top of that, a good choice of music was used to support the atmosphere. The scene where Tessa & Hardin shared a dance at his dad's house is another good example, a beautiful scene accompanied with beautiful music. It's a shame... It REALLY IS A SHAME. They could have spent more time allowing the story to develop in the 2nd film since its runtime is only 96mins.To be honest, I am still looking forward to the 3rd film, ONLY BECAUSE I love the novel. I hope they won't disappoint me again."
135,I liked both the first and the second movie. They acted out their characters so well that I could feel every emotion of the story.
136,See I have no money at all to watch it so like if someone can let me borrow there account that would be amazing
137,"Loved this one and the first. Yes it wasn't as exciting and it was slower but it is still a good movie regardless. There are way worse movies out there but this one made me love the series more and I can't wait for the next. With all the other reviews saying it's unrealistic because of her internship, what movies aren't out of this world? What movies don't have unrealistic things happen..... ? The movie was great! Definitely give it a watch if you love the series and books. Be open minded and give it a chance."
138,"I loved the first and second part of this movie and honestly according to me the plot is perfect. Ofco I've never been a person who watches a lot of movies, but I got some recommendations and watched this on first. And I would surely recommend this to others. This is truly amazing."
139,"I've read this book series a few times and really enjoy it. I didn't mind the first movie adaptation, it was diluted, sure, but it told the story essentially. This movie though... Just nah. It feels like they started with every fight and sex scene they wanted to include from the book and attempted to connect those in the time left over. It failed. It was so disconnected. There was no plot. The main characters are unrecognizable from one movie to the next. Tessa goes from a near virgin, heartbroken college kid to a grown woman with a job, high sex drive and alcohol habit in 'one month' with absolutely no explanation. It's silly, really. The one positive thing about this movie was Dylan Sprouse as Trevor; I would give him 10 stars. I was actually watching it rooting for Trevor?! There was just no reason to root for Hessa. If you haven't read the books I wouldn't recommend trying to watch this. If you are a fan of the books you will probably watch it no matter what, we can't help it :)"
140,"The story line are ripped out of all the important events which give the story its depth and gives reasons behind the characters behavior plus the acting from hero took every ounce of bad boy Hardin character and turned him to a Pathetic boy not the strong yet damaged character Anna Todd draw for us in the books
I hate how silly the sequel is even compared to the first movie"
141,I read the Wattpad version of the book but the movies werent as good. Left out details and Karen changes from one movie to the next.
142,"Ehhhhhh. I really started to get bored halfway during the movie. The beginning was slow and the last half was too rushed. They didn't even include the letter. The 9 days was nothing. Hardly any frat house stuff happened. No zed fighting? Hardly any nightmares, they didn't get the intensity of what happened to trish, and how it affected Hardin across on the screen. They're still missing crucial information from the book that's important. Overall it was better but they missed quite a few things."
143,One of my favorite movie series..love for after.. waiting for the next after movie. Plz make it as soon as you guys can.
144,"The first wasn't so good and now the second is just worse. Too much sex scenes and the lead characters were just laughing anyhow. You won't understand if you have no idea about the books.. Anna Todd, we love you a lot but the movies are just not tallying. Very bad."
145,"Better than the first one for sure. The writing improved and the acting, if you are a fan from the books a lot of our favorite scenes is there. The chemistry between the main character improved a lot you can feel what they are felling"
146,Where to watch this ? i cant anywhere to watch this movie
147,"This movie gave me brain damage. the acting is bad, the storyline is bad, the music is bad.
i still watched the whole thing ofc but it wasn't good at all"
148,Seeing this movie really made me laugh. It is so absurd that it is hilarious to watch. But also quite sad.
149,"I hated the first film, but then i saw the trailer of this one and I kind of enjoyed it and though it was going to be good. I saw the hole film because I wanted to see it all but boy... it was hard to see!
Its trash, really bad!
The scenes were not even well acted like, it all seemed so forced, without context.. You could not understand the meaning of the scenes, the feelings of the characters. It made them seemed like people without brain, honestly. They are not even real people in this movie! Dont bother whatching it, you will waste your time, and besides, it is extra cringe."
150,"I honestly don't get the bad reviews! No it wasnt the best film iv ever seen. But if you've read the book, you get the story line and I think this film did a great job and following the book. The first film was pants and was nothing like the book but this one was so much better. I can't wait for the next one. The actors have definitely captured the characters more this time and you find yourself feeling how they would feel. (Poor Trevor! Id marry you even though I just see the kid from friends)"
151,I was emotional from the beginning to the end. It really bring the best of Josephine as an actress and her sinergy with Hardin is very strong and beautiful. I recommend this movie to all of those who believes in love. Peace
152,Its so refreshing to see a fellow wattpad writer make the big screen. Its what we all aspire for. Im so proud of her work. The movie was amazing. It kept me on the edge of my seat at times and mostly on baited breath. Don't listen to these low reviews. Give it a shot honestly you won't regret it. But please do start with movie one the title is After.
153,Just so bad. I would have given it a zero if I could.
154,"This movie has no good story, the main actors are like Tom and Jerry now are good and happy 10 min later they are not together. Yes we understand Hero is bad boy Tessa is good girl we hear that over and over, nothing new, no story only Tessa and Hero running in cycle like cat and dog."
155,"After the first movie, it is obvious to have high expectations. The first movie surprised me in a good way because it grasp the emotional story behind it, the cinematography was beautiful, the music were perfectly combined with each scene and the screenplay made from the book was a success. I am not sure if it is the change in directing, screenplay, or how fast it was made but EVERYTHING was a mess. There was no flow in the story, they sexualize the movie in such a disgusting and disturbing way, the story is completely lost, the acting in mediocre, and much more. I could barely finish it. Augh so disappointed."
156,"First of all the source material is extremely poor. The ""10"" ratings are not to be believed. A thin story, with thinner characters plodding through an abusive, codependent toxic relationship is not something that should see the light of day. The terrible novels on Wattpad started out as One Direction fan fiction to entertain tween girls looking for ""dangerous"" relationships. That anyone is attracted to this kind of treacle is beyond disappointing. Watching it will just encourage the minds behind it to make more. Please no."
157,"Who makes movies like this. This is absolutely horrible. I wondered if those actors didn't feel bad starring in this ""movie"". I skip watched it , and all the time I had the feeling that they had to do it, because they signed a contract."
158,"Fake emotions and bad story line
i am so disappointment"
159,"I felt from the first moment that it's not the same team who worked on the first movie. The first movie was okay or less but this was a disaster! Scenes that made no sense especially if you read the book. Felt like a teaser to the movie rather than the movie itself. And the intimate scenes were poorly done. No emotion, no feel. Very disappointing."
160,If you read and like the books this movie is just as disappointing as the first. It is barely anything like the books and is completely cringey and terrible!
161,Everything is forced to get to something cool but is really uncool and bad bad bad directed!!! The storry could be so well treated if better directed!
162,"I believe the director completely butchered the story and had no empathy for the characters.
The effects, the cutting of the scenes, the background music and the product placement makes it nearly impossible to watch.
I really enjoyed the books and know that the movie never can compare. But the low budget feeling, almost ironic and the changing of the main cast, was such a big disappointment. Over all a very BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
163,"I am very happy with how aligned the movie was with the book! LOVED IT!!! And I loved the cameo Anna Todd, who is the writer of the After book series, made in the club scene. I hope After We Fell will get it's own movie also!! :)"
164,Shallow characters and lame writing. Is this what the young'uns are like or the kind of movies they like?
165,"Okay so I am a big after series fan well the book at least and this movie Definetly was not what I was waiting for. The first movie After was
phenomenal. I Definetly understood it. But for this second film like why change Karen and Ken. I love hardens mom Definetly pictured her in the movie. Some parts were good other parts felt rushed. Love the ending. No where in the book did it mention the uber driver talking little throwed off about that. All in all a good movie. I wish there were more sad parts in it. The book had a lot of sad parts that made you cry and laugh. Hope the next movie isn't rushed and that they take there time."
166,"I loved the books, everything was going in perfect pace you would engross in them but movies NO"
167,The actings awful and it doesn't have a very good storyline. There's nothing to it.
168,"I'm a huge fan of the after series. I watched the first movie about a year after it came out and I hadn't heard anything of the after fandom and books when those first came out either. So I basically just watched it on a whim. When I watched the first movie, I found it extremely confusing because Tessa and Hardin had had very little and insignificant interactions with each other that the sudden jump to the lake scene and their relationship moving forward made no sense to me. I thought the ending was a bit unfinished until I realised it was a book series. I was interested enough in the movie to read the books and was instantly hooked and even more excited to learn the sequel was coming out soon given the trailer seemed jam-packed with drama and a lot more true to the books. Anna's role also became more significant in the second film that they made a huge effort to be true to the book where the first one didn't. The only problem with this was that a lot of things missed in the first film made the sudden changes in the second tasteless as they were not sufficiently thought-out. In the books, Zed had a lot more to do with both Hardin and Tessa's development and not including him in the first movie meant going into the next books/film his character was/will be completely irrelevant to the story. The fact that the ending of the first movie allowed some time between Tessa finding out about the bet and beginning to move on with her life and starting at Vance, left a huge gaping hole in the recovery process of their break up. I didn't feel the pain of their separation like I did in the books. The second film is dated a month later but their experience and emotional journey in this time is not touched on. How has Tessa been handling it? In the book she is destroyed and lives between Landons house and her Mothers and a motel. Where does she even stay in the film once they break up since she can't go to the apartment and has no relationship or screen time with her mother at all? Why does she not have any real relationship to Karen like she does in the books? Why do they never mention Hardin has a job and how will this translate to his future career as a writer? In the second book, they spent so much time adding complexity and anger to Hardins character that was lacked in the first book that Tessa lacked any substance. There was so much drama and scenes from the book they wanted to keep within the strict 1:45 time limit that there is not enough pacing and felt distress of their break ups and fall outs to make a real emotional impact on the audience. That being said, the characters are quite brought to life and the chemistry between Hero and Jo is incomparable. I think for a story like this that is so human and character driven, they should have made it into a one off TV series like normal people."
169,So... Just like the first one it tried really hard to fit in everything from the book whike also trying to keep time so it was just a blurry mess filled with music montages and JESUS CHRIST SEX!!!It was akward and weird and happened every 2 seconds it literally caused physical pain!!! the 2nd star is only for the new years party although it was much better in the book anyway I'm not gonna comment on the story or characters cuz it's an adaption anyway so yeah it was really akward and uncomfortable to watch but really depends on what you like I only watched it because I knew it would be bad and wanted a laugh which I got so really 10/10 lol.
170,"Terrible screenplay, bad acting . I liked After but this is big mess. Some scenes were ok but some- no comment. Such a waste quite good book"
171,"After We Collided is the sequel to the 2019 movie After. This sequel is directed by Roger Kumble, the director of Cruel Intentions and The Sweetest Thing.In the film, Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) and Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) are both handling their break-up in their own way. Their relationship ended after Tessa learned more about Hardin's mysterious dark side, which made her feel unsafe. Hardin retreats to a life of bad habits, while Tessa starts her dream internship at a publishing house. Here Tessa meets her new colleague Trevor (Dylan Sprouse) for whom she soon starts to have feelings.
Although Tessa tries to start a new relationship with Trevor, she can't let go of her thought of Hardin. Despite all his troubles and secrets, Tessa decides to give Hardin a second chance. The two now have to spend a lot of time and energy in their relationship to get everything back to the way they once had it together.Just like the first part, this film is again based on the book and fan fiction by writer Anna Todd. To make this film more consistent with her book, she has chosen to largely write the film script herself.For better film quality, this second part has also been given a more professional director. Director Roger Kumble has directed many other romantic comedies and dramas in his career. One of his best-known directed films Cruel Intentions was also partly the inspiration for Anna Todd's book series. If you are familiar with this movie, this second part may seem a bit predictable or copied. For a better movie, you can actually watch Cruel Intentions for yourself.The acting is better done by the cast in this film compared to the first part due to the better script and direction work. These improvements aside, the movie still doesn't come across as very original."
172,"The movie is amazing. jo was great and how she portrayed tessa. hero was phenomenal and stole the show! the dialogue is all from the book and of course, almost every scene that was in the book was in the movie. i am curious to see what deleted scenes weren't in the movie, because they covered the movie really well with book scenes. as a book reader I LOVED the movie. but, as a movie watcher, i liked it but the plot skipped around. the scenes were too rushed, the movie moved way to fast and rushed though scenes. you can't make a movie only 1.5 hours, while the book is 700 pages! i wish they would of kept the plot going more. in after it was smooth from scene to scene. although it was almost nothing like the book. if you haven't read the books for after 1&2 you will get confused. i feel anna todd (the author) made this movie for the book readers. overall after we collided was worth the wait and such a great movie. 9/10. i am excited for after we fall and after ever happy!! hero really did a fantastic job in the christmas, New Years fight, nine days, and car crash fight / scenes! real book hardin!! jo my god did a spectacular job as book tessa. she really did great in the whole new years scene, nine days, and seattle scene!"
173,"This movie was beyond amazing!
This movie should definitely get a 10 star!"
174,Loved the movie ! Their chemistry the acting everything exeded my expectations Roger Kumble did a really good job. Josephine Langford remains superior can't wait to see what is her next project
175,"It was literally so good - the chemistry, the fights, the sex, it was just like the books! Hero and Jo were AMAZING and it honestly couldn't have been better. I absolutely loved it!!!"
176,"I absolutely love this film. I've read the books and seen After and it was such a vast improvement in the first film! The acting was brilliant and so believable. The chemistry between the leads is crazy! It was really funny, emotional and the sex scenes... wow üî•
Definitely recommend seeing!"
177,"I felt so many emotions while watching the movie. Hero Fiennes-Tiffins and Josephine Langford did an amazing job as our lead roles bringing Tessa Young and Hardin Scott to life. If you have read the books then you would be pleased to see the amazing on-screen portrayal of our book Hessa. This movie went more in depth in mature themes and the strong story behind each of our characters. Dylan Sprouse as Trevor, was absolutely amazing! The whole cast and crew deserves a round of applause!
I totally loved the movie and can not wait to watch it over and over again!"
178,I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie! A huge improvement from After (the first movie)! It so much closer to the book and was way more dramatic and sexier than the first one. Definitely had the intensity aspect! <3
179,"First of all, I want to say I absolutely loved the movie! Overall I'd give it 4.5 out of 5. When Anna said it is much closer to the book, she sure wasn't kidding. Obviously the movie is an adaptation and not everything is the same but that is to be expected. At the end it felt like all the puzzles fell into one. The movie was more dramatic and sexier than the first one. The whole story felt mature and more grown up just like in the books. It absolutely had the intensity to it! Honestly if felt much longer than it was in the best way possible. I didn't want the movie to end at all. Tessa and Hardin have both changed and are just like they were in the books! I can honestly say I loved all the characters, even Trevor who was a bit different from the books but I didn't mind one bit. Dylan's performance was every bit of amazing and he brought a new kind of vibe to the story. Plus he is super hilarious! Jo and Hero did such a great job! Jo portrayed the change we see in Tessa beautifully and so did Hero. Hero's portrayal of Hardin definitely screamed the desperate boy hopelessly in love with a girl! He had the book Hardin feel to him throughout the whole movie! From Hardin's dry British sense of humor to his intensity. Jo was mind-blowing. After watching AWC and interviews with Jo, I can honestly say Jo IS Tessa in so many ways. Her performance felt super real and utterly believable. We hit a jackpot with her, no kidding. Plus I applaud them for the steamy scenes, their chemistry is off the charts. Anna is a superwoman! Not only is she a talented writer, but apparently she can write one hell of a script as well. I would say it is thanks to her that the movie was so close to the books. And Roger's directing - just wau! He also wasn't kidding about the sex, sex and more sex lol. He definitely knows how to keep the audience entertained and give them what they want. Only thing I didn't like was how they used the camera (and I guess it's an issue of editing as well) in some scenes where they would switch very quickly between the characters. But I think that's also about personal preference. I'm not a fan of it but I'm sure many people won't even notice it. Of course I do have to mention secondary characters - Inanna as Molly blew my mind! So did Louise as Trish, I fell in love with her instantly. Candice as Kim was super cute and Charlie as Vance? Hilarious. I can't wait to see more of them all in the next movies. All of them were just perfection. The talent in this movie is ubelievable."
180,"If you are a fan of After series then you are surely gonna like it but even if you are not you are still gonna like it because of the story. It's romantic, it's sexy, it's action-packed, it's fun with spectacular cinematography. Everything seems logical and inflow. The cast didn't excellent job bringing book characters this book characters to reality especially Hero Tiffin. The way he bought Hardin's darkness to the reality gave me goosebumps."
181,"I really wanted to like this movie, but omg
Why? Just why?"
182,"First of all, I'm not a teenager, I'm in my 4th decade of life. Secondly I haven't read the books.I really enjoyed the first movie and really enjoyed this second one.Yes the acting from Hero Fiennes Tiffin isn't exactly great (but his good looks are forgiving), there's some cringe worthy moments, but it's a story of intense love and passion, all be it a toxic one. But it's an enjoyable ride.If you enjoyed the first movie, you're likely to enjoy this one. It's sexier, raunchier and thankfully R rated rather it's PG13 predecessor which is much better suited for a movie like this. The first movie felt a little too tame considering the story content.Oh just enjoy it for what it is. Don't analyse everything."
183,"I'm gonna be honest. I loved After although I knew and accepted the fact that it was bad. There was something about that film which seemed to engage me. And yes, I was anticipating the sequel. I was terribly disappointed however, as, this film lacked the slight charm that was present in the first. What made this worse is that they tried to add a sprinkle of humour, which did not work.
I might have ended up liking this film more than any sane person should. That's because I'm a fan of the franchise no matter how bad it is.
Anyhow, this one is still pretty disappointing."
184,"I never wrote a review before. I've never even given a 1 star rating but MY GOD those are two hours of my life that are not coming back. No plot, no acting, no emotions. This movie has the emotion of a canned pear."
185,Amazing movie all true fans loved it i loved it it made me happy and then upset and then fun again it was amazing
186,"I think they did a good job with this movie. If you liked the first you will love this and **Spoiler*** not really, the most frustrating thing is she keeps going back when there is a nice guy waiting for her.... Also they ended it with the watcher assuming she doesn't take the job and if this is the cases then the next movie will suck*. *** end of Spoilers ***
Overall, If you like the last movie which i assume you did since you are about the watch the second movie you will like this one."
187,"Love this movie, can't please everyone, true after fans will love and respect it and see they how much they work to make this series happen for us. Always going to be haters. What matters most is the fans love it."
188,I honestly don't know why so many ppl didn't like this movie. I love it and so did many of my friends
189,I have read all the books 3 times and I love the books. The first one was fine and the second on was better not the greats in the world but I will be rewatching. I understand that you can't put a whole 300-400 page book into a 1 or 2 movie with out it getting boring so I understand they need to change stuff around which is why I'm not that harsh with it but I just which It would go as fast from one thing to another cause I know what's going on cause of the books but those who haven't read them it might be harder to keep up or understand. THE CAST IS SO AMAZING though everyone new that came in was so perfect üëå I couldn't imagine any different. Love love love the cast. Love the movie two and love the director. So in conclusion good movie I would absolutely would tell everyone ti watch it. But need to take more time with scenes but still really good. 9/10
190,"I'm not a fan of teen drama, but for some reason I love Tessa and Hardin. This movie was very different from the first one (After.) I think this one explored their more emotional sides and what the breakup did to both of them and how they handled it. They both come from very broken families and webs of lies. I really did like this movie and I will watch it again. For those that say these two have no chemistry??? You're crazy. There is obviously serious chemistry that I wouldn't be surprised carries on off the screen. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
191,"After we collided was just like the book and I couldn't be more happier. Everything was perfect, the chemistry between Hero and Jo was perfect just like the first movie."
192,"To be honest- this felt rushed, I kind of wished it was longer because they have so much of the story to tell- BUT it was good LIKE REALLY GOOD. Hero and Josephine's chemistry ARE ON FIRE. LITERALLY THE BEST CHEMISTRY. They carry the movie. You can really feel what they're going through throughout the entire movie. Also, their acting was amazing- especially in the emotional scenes. (LIKE, DAMN) Kudos to the other actors as well! I read the books ever since it got published and even though if I didn't read them, I would enjoy AWC so much. It has romance, comedy and drama. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST ROMANCE FILMS THIS YEAR. PERIOD.ALSO, THIS HAS TO BE CLEARED OUT------People say its CRINGEY, but have you seen OTHER NETFLIX/Awesomeness Films ROMANCE MOVIES? SPECIFICALLY- THE HIGH SCHOOL ONES- BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY CRINGIER THAN THIS, so yeah there's that (some examples: To all the boys, Work It, The Kissing Booth, Spontaneous- need I say more?) And I know a lot are really comparing this to the twilight and the 50sog franchise- IT IS NOT. BECAUSE, its a COLLEGE ROMANCE drama that is real and authentic- IT DOES NOT HAVE VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES, BDSM AND FULL ON RICH STUFF. IT IS ALSO NOT A 1D FANFIC (NOT ANYMORE)- Anna Todd CHANGED ALL OF THE CHARACTERS NAMES before OFFICIALLY PUBISHING IT. AND- HARRY STYLES DID NOT FILE A FREAKING CASE ABOUT THIS. (Really don't get why some are mad about the After Series because it was a 1D fanfic- BUT HAVE YOU SEEN the 1D Fanfic story (LARRY) from Euphoria? Well.. ) And A LOT OF AUTHORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, USE DIFFERENT ACTORS AS FACES OF THEIR BOOK- NOT THE ACTUAL CHARACTER- JUST THEIR FACES. I mean, some can't just move on.. But anyways, this movie is WORTH IT. AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE LAST 2 FILMS- After We Fell and After Ever Happy :)"
193,"I absolutely LOVED After, but After We Collided delivered so much more. I have been a huge After fan since it was still being regularly updated on Wattpad, so I've been waiting a long time for this, and let me tell you, it's been so worth it! While the first movie was great, this one just really encapsulated the book more so than the first film. After We Collided delves deeper into the characters, their relationships with one another, the story, defining moments from the novel, Tessa and Hardin's sensual yet rocky relationship, and so much more. Not to mention, the chemistry was sooooo much more improved between Josephine (Tessa) and Hero (Hardin)! I feel like I can say for all After fans that this film hit the mark spot on. And if anyone is wondering: yes, the Molly/Tessa fight is in the movie, and it DELIVERS- probably one of my favorite parts lol."
194,"The movie was soo good!!! Way better then the first movie and if you loved the book this movie hit alot of the fan favorites.
Jo and Hero did amazing!!!"
195,I think they did a good job on this movie yeah it was rushed but what do you expect it's not gonna be every detail I think this movie is better then the first and when it's released in my state I'm definitely buying the movie I absolutely loved it Josephine and hero did an amazing job and can't wait for 3 and 4 movie
196,"I am a massive fan of the after series, and this was sooo close the book!
I loved it so much,
Hero and Jo's acting was insane and Anna's cameo was so good also!!!
I love this film
And this fandom!!
Well done Anna, Roger, Jenny, Hero, Jo, Dylan and the others !!!"
197,"A great film adaptation to the amazing book! Funny, romantic and sensual all executed perfectly"
198,"Like any adaption they have to condense and alter the story. I really liked the 1st movie and I would say this is even better. We see much more of the character of Hardin from the books. The relationship is messy and complicated, just like real life. Anyone who says that this idolizes toxic relationships needs to read the books because this is only halfway through the story, there is much more growth and change to come."
199,"In my opinion, the movie deserves 7.5. More like the book, there are all the more important moments, I miss Zed because he was very messy with the book. HERO & JO is a masterpiece, besides, it's hard to reproduce a book in 100% of a movie. The action is a bit too fast. After all, the movie is brilliant! üòç"
200,Overall Loved it! Such an improvement from the first Movie. And I have to say Josephine Langford is an amazing actress.
201,"The film was way better compared to the first film. They tried to keep the true spirit of after series as close as possible. As an after fan, I was glad to see so many notable scenes from the book into reality. But let's be honest it could have been a bit better. First of all, the film seems to be rushed in some places. Of course, they couldn't have put all the scenes from the book but I kind of wanted a few more dialogues at some scenes. Secondly, nothing against the actress but I was kind of disappointed with Josephine's acting and Tessa's character in general. She didn't seem as into the character as she was in the first film. She looked lost and Tessa seems to lack purpose rather than being strong as she was supposed to be. Where Josephine seems to be a downfall, Hero's acting seems to be redeemed. Of course, it wasn't perfect but it seemed like he was finally started to get the rhythm of Hardin character. As a result, Hardin was only the character that kept me captivating until the end. Though there are many areas where improvement can be achieved, its an enjoyable film for young adults and worth a watch."
202,"I liked the movie because we got the real Hessa that we wanted from the books. But it was rushed and I don't think that Hero did the best jobb in this movie. Just wanna say I love Hero and this is nothing agents him. I think they didn't tell him how to do it right, that's all. But I love to se there story on the big screen :) So I'm happy <3"
203,"Loved it! However, I didn't think the similarities of Fifty Shades needed to be incorporated into the film. Rather unnecessary to have the 'F' bomb constantly thrown in. But despite that, I still love the series thus far. And I can't for the next one. üëå"
204,It was pretty good but everything was happening too fast. It's like all intense scene was shoved in a movie. The first movie had some akward silences and this one was filled w unnecessary music. Overall the movie was enjoyable. Hero ft's acting was really praiseworthy
205,Movie was amazing! So much better then the first one! I'm so happy they stuck by the book as much as they could! I can't wait til the next ones come out! Everyone did amazing acting in the movie! I can watch the movie over n over again! Anna Todd you did amazing!! And so excited for the next!
206,"As a really big fan of the books and after being so disappointed with the first movie my expectations were low but omg surprisedly I was blown away with this one. I really like how they stayed true to the books and the acting improved. There were some things I didn't but they were little things such as I wish the movie was a little longer or if next time they focused more on the relationship itself rather than the sexual aspect. Even though I wished they would done things differently, those things didn't take away from me liking the overall project. I just hope for the next two movies they make them longer to focus more on the relationship. With that being said I really did love it and it was a HUGE improvement from the first."
207,"Need more, need more
It's amazing
Thanks very much"
208,"It was surreal! I loved every small detail about the movie, although I didn't burst into tears like in the first one I loved loved loved it! Hero's and Jo's chemistry is something else that I've never seen before and I adore it! Of course there were small details missing from the books but it's totally understood! Hessa will forever be in my heart and After will always be my number one way of spending money! I wanted a little more sneak peak of the 9 days but really I am proud of the outcome of this movie. I enjoyed every second and I've already seen it two times I hope I go watch it again soon! Thank you Hero and Jo for making Hessa alive and of course everyone else who took part in this!! Can't wait for After We Fell and After Ever Happy"
209,"I loved every bit of it, even if the scenes were shorter it told more of the story in the book, and the changes they made is great I really love this story line just as much as the book!"
210,"I have read all the books and so far have seen both movies (obviously AWF and AEH aren't out yet but soon!). When I go in seeing a movie that is adapted from a book I know we are never going to get exactly the book or else that movie would be 10+ hours long which I know some people don't mind, like me, but realistically that just can't happen. I think for what they had to work with, with what happened with the first movie, I think Anna, Roger, and the rest of the crew and actors did an AMAZING job trying to give us the books as much as possible but still give the people who haven't read the books a great storyline too. Both Jo and Hero, I think, went above and beyond what I could've ever imagined, they truly gave us Hessa. And then the new additions of Vance, Kim, Smith, Trish, and the new Ken and Karen were all amazing as well. There was never a scene where I wasn't laughing, shocked, crying, angry, screaming, or in amazement that is AWC! Please give this movie a chance because I promise you will not be disappointed!!!!"
211,"The first movie was a disaster but the sequel is enjoyable. The writers build up a strong plot comparing to the first one. The romance between the lead pair and the drama and comedy that surrounds them as they try to get back together keeps you attached to the screen until the end. The director did an amazing job of maintaing the harmonization between characters and casts. Though Josephine and Dylan did a pleasent job bringing Tessa and Trevor to reality, what completely fascinated me was Hero's acting. He completely turned Hardin 360¬∞ and made up for the Hardin that the audience was missing in the previous film. The actor made it possible for us to love Hardin despite all his flaws. In conclusion, even though there is place for betterment and earning perfection in the plot it's a good film to watch if you like drama and romance."
212,"Man props to Roger Kumble because that was the book! Such an improvement from the first movie I cannot even explain it! That was the Hardin & Tessa we know & love!!! Love, fighting, sarcasm & sex! They really captured the essence of the books this time around and I'm absolutely floored. I can't believe I've seen the book come to life. Oh man I loved it so much! Cannot wait for After We Fell!!"
213,"Comeon guys!!! This series is drama and about love just love!! We shuldn't expect it anything else!!..
And its gonna be a long story so be patient!!
Every thing isnt gonna be happen in 2 episode of this movie.."
214,A decent watch that I would recommend. Some of the script is a bit outdated for 2020 and should have been rewritten. Hero's acting is superb
215,"I love this movie so much! In some parts it seemed a little rushed, BUT they gave all of the scenes I was hoping to see, so I can't complain. You obviously can't fit all of the details from the book into a 2 hour movie. We also got to see book Hardin in this one which made me so happy! Their acting has improved so much also since the first movie. I definitely recommend."
216,"Great movie, a lot of emotions... The movie is like a wave. You never know when its good or bad between them. Overall 10/10, awesome movie!"
217,"I found this movie so much better than the first awc shows book Hessa and is much like the books in my opinion. Hero did a amazing job with Hardin in this movie he showed us the book Hardin we've all been waiting for and his acting was so amazing. People make a bad name of this movie because it did start as a fanfic but it has nothing to do with Harry styles it's about Hardin Scott the movie is not distasteful and if you have a problem with it being a fanfic don't watch the movie
I recommend the movie to anyone And I can't wait for after we fell and after even happy!!!!"
218,Definitely better than the first and the pacing was well done which is what bothered me with the first. The movie had comedy that had me laughing and chemistry and acting improved. I would 100% recommend this to fans who loved the books and were disappointed with the first movie.
219,"It was amazing! obviously, as reader of the books, I didn't find everything, but the important stuff was there. I kinda thought it was rushed, but I get that you can't put 500 page book into 1h 45min. I cried and I laughed, and it was huge improvement from the first movie definitely! you should definitely check it out!"
220,It's no doubt a better movie. Can't keep calm. And really happy to hear that after we fell and after ever happy are in pre-production phase
221,I saw yesterday after and I love it. It's so incredible
222,"O filme t√° incr√≠vel, a atua√ß√£o dos atores, o tom de humor e a fidelidade com o livro t√° perfeito!!"
223,I loved every second watching it I would watch it again and again
224,"One of my favourite movies ever!!
You won't believe, hero had literally give life to hardin Scott! It was awesomeeee!!!"
225,"I'm obsessed with this movie. I'm still obsessed with the first one also. I've seen that there's a third one being made so I can't wait to watch ""after well fell""!!"
226,I'm so glad I eventually got to see this. It was worth the wait! I loved it!!
227,"Thank you, Roger Kumble for this amazing movie! Thank you for bringing book Hessa to life. H&J did an amazing job and their chemistry is awesome!! Louise Lombard is one of the best actress from the whole movie!! Shane deserved better, but overall, this movie is way better than the first one."
228,"It was amazing. The script, cinematography, the way it was shot, the chemistry between Josephine and Hero, everything was fantastic. As a passionate fan of the after books, I have to say that this movie surprised me in the best way possible. To everyone who hasn't watched it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW it's AMAZING!!!"
229,"I have read the books so I'm a bit biased but the first one was 10x better. I'm disappointed with the acting specifically, the storyline was okay but the characters acted nothing like is described in the books, most especially Tessa."
230,Idc what yall say i loved it.It was so good cuz so many unexpected things happened i just didnt like how they bring a very ugly side in each other
231,How do i watch it?like all i have its the trailer...and i really wanna watch it:(
232,"What a piece of garbage!
Maybe if some pre-teen girls are gathered for a movie night together. Busy with their phones and tablets, so the movie dont interrupt them to much. This movie would maybe be somewhat okay....
The storyline is terrible, and the acting is non existing!
Then she want, then she dont want, then she want, then she dont want and so on.... And the same for the ""bad boy"" who is just a total doll!
I want you, now I dont want you, I want you, now I dont want you!
Oh my oh my oh my....."
233,"The first movie was me hiding my face from embarrassment for most of the romantic scenes. The plot line itself wasn't super original and probably wasn't fleshed out as well in the movie as in the books. Could be wrong. I haven't read them yet. I will say that I enjoyed the second movie much more. It was less about Tessa being some fragile goody-good and more about her coming into herself. There were still many moments when I was making eek sounds because I was so embarrassed by the dialogue, but honestly if you love romantic novels then you have to be able to deal with that. Even though I haven't read the books, the film translated like a book to me in many ways. I actually thoroughly enjoyed After We Collided. I may be cynical and jaded from my own real life experiences. I may yell at them about how dumb and naive they're being, but I feel like the second movie showed them maturing to an extent. People are too critical. Like they want something to complain about. I saw all the bad reviews and that's the only reason I posted mine, because I actually liked it. The ending was weird and was obviously meant to keep things open for a third movie. I actually think this would have made a great tv series or limited series. It has the potential."
234,"As all previous has mentioned this movie is absolutely terrible and is sad because the actors ( some of them ) are really trying . But the movie has no plot at all. For the zilionth time we are watching a script of a couple fighting again and again because of mistrust and misunderstandings but from the zillion times we have watched it , some movies were good, this one it isnt. And one more thing, what is the target group of this movie? Women ? i am a woman and i hated it , men ? i doubt a man can watch this more than 5 mins , kids ? this is not a kid movie, so what remains only teenagers and actually girls, and to minimize it even more , a very specific type of teenage girls MIGHT enjoy this movie."
235,"The acting, costumes, music, the whole setting is a tragedy. The first is definitely better."
236,"For the love of all... Recasting Ken is fine but to make his wife a completely different race for the sake of trying to be more Inclusive, is beyond terrible and pandering. It all seems to rushed as well. There's no time to develop the characters into what the book make them out to be."
237,The movie did not go with how the books went. I was excited to see the movie when they said it was going along with the books. That was so wrong. I was very disappointed in the movie. They have mixed everything up and left a lot of the book out. I doubt I will want to see the next movie if there is one.
238,"I watched After and really like it. So much so that I couldn't wait for After We Collided to come to Netflix so I rented it. I didn't read the books.I'll start with the disappointments. I was disappointed with the opening to see that Tessa didn't go to Hardin on the dock. I was disappointed that she slept with Hardin after a drunk night at the nightclub. I would have liked it better if Hardin went to the hotel and saw Tessa with Trevor and left in anger, it would have set the story better for Hardin to have to try and win her back. I was disappointed at the misunderstanding at the party which lead to a huge fight. Too many fights between them.I liked the storyline with his mother. I like knowing why characters act the way they do. I like they dug into his childhood, abandonment by his father, watching his mother be attacked, etc does give you an insight into his current behavior. I love the character Trevor. He was a nice addition, I was hoping for a love triangle between them but that didn't happen either. That would have been predictable but way better than the current storyline.Overall the movie was ok, the storyline needed some polishing because it didn't flow well."
239,"Jeez, c'mon. There's no need. By the way, performances of Josephine and Hero was brilliant, whatsoever and it does paid off in box office. Wasted plotline and fragile screenplay."
240,I don't know guys but I kinda really enjoy it . I would watch it over and over again . I get all this passion and the immaturity of their age to act like that . You should give it a try !
241,"""After We Collided"" is a Drama - Romance movie and the sequel of the movie ""After"", in which we watch the same couple trying to be together focusing on overcoming the obstacles they find on their path. This sequel starts where the first movie finished.Since I had already watched the first movie, I already knew what to expect from its sequel but ""After We Collided"" surprised me even more than ""After"" since it was far worse than the first movie. I could not believe that a movie that it's also a sequel can be that bad but ""After We Collided"" succeeded on it. The plot of the movie was worse than the first movie and did not make any sense while creating some major plot holes that probably they will cover them in the next movies. The interpretations of the cast were as bad as in the first movie and I cannot mention even one that was good or just above average. Lastly, I have to say that if you have not already watched the first movie and you are about to watch this movie, make yourself a favor and do not watch it because I am sure that you will regret it."
242,"I walked in to the theater after reading several mixed reviews, a lot saying it was your basic teen drama love story. I also walked into the theater having read all the books on Wattpad and on pages multiple times and fell in love with this movie. It was better than the first. Dylan Sprouse did an amazing job playing Trevor and Hero and Josephine did even better this time around. They seemed more deep in to their characters. I cannot wait for the 3rd and 4th movies!"
243,"Awful movie, terrible acting it's just so awful please dont waste time watching it."
244,"So i watched the first movie to see how bad it was. It was honestly pretty bad. It ends terribly and it is terrible. The only thing i liked was the music choice of ""Somebody To You"" by BANNERS. But this isn't about the first cringy movie. I began seeing ads for a new movie and i decided to give it a watch, because the last one gave me so much joy in the hilarity of it (Especially if you remember that everyone is in one direction, and Hardin is Harry Styles.) but jeez this one is just a mess. I didn't know this one was R but i quickly found out. Boring, Overly sexual and down right crude. I only enjoyed the fact that Dylan Sprouse was in this movie. Don't watch this one, its bad."
245,Story is simple no matter happens the couple didnt detach. But it had many loop holes. For example she is saying she can only afford water in club but she afford Victoria secret lingerie how odd. The office guy was totally useless no role of his just guest appearance. She got a job but those guys were still having spring break parties. It seems story was nothing they thought to make movie.
246,Nibba's(indian slang) and Nibbi's(indian slang) will only love this and find it the most romantic movie. Cinematography was good and direction was again poor. Story became predictable and I lost interest in this. I hope 3 part might bring some thrill. Thank you.
247,"Before watching this movie after having countless of my friends recommend it, feigning it as one of the greatest science fiction stories of our time, I was a bit skeptical. I mean, sci-fi is a pretty unrealistic genre, but a story about an alien coming to Earth and getting back home with kids on flying bikes? It sounded absurd to me. Let's just say I was very incorrect in my assessment. This was one of the greatest movies I've seen, and I think it has to do with the pure light-heartedness of the story. I'm not usually one for movies with child actors, but Elliotts performance was simply moving. It amazes me how great the practical effects have held up after all these years, Spielberg is a genius and his hard work has not been overlooked. The pacing was excellent, the story was moving, and the performances were great. E.T. is just a family classic and my heart goes out to those who have never been able to experience the movie for the first time with their family. Moving. While watching it with my son, I'm pretty sure I shed a few tears. Part of the reason this experience was so great to me was because recently my best friend passed away, so it was nice to see the bond between Elliott and ET. Moving as hell. Let's not even get to the Halloween scene. A comedic yet moving scene if I've ever seen one. This movie is great. A masterpiece. Can not be beaten. Spielberg? Genius. ET. Amazing. My best friend? Dead. Rest in peace Paul. 10/10, peace out nerds."
248,"This movie sucks on so many levels ...Yeah its better than the first one , but if you're someone here who read the books and was so excited to watch the movie which was a disappointment and then gave it another chance and watched the second one , then again was disappointed, you my friend are like me and we are not going to be satisfied:))I confess this one was better but still bad so
Also , they omitted on the story to have more sex scenes, which doesn't make any sense , you need content to have a proper movie and this movie was lacking a lot of it , the storyline was so confusing , and I know the whole story !
And Hero's play is so fake I cant even start to comment on that ."
249,This might just be the worst movie I've ever watched. Just glad I didn't pay to see it
250,"I loved the first one, but I wasn't crazy about it because I thought it was kinda predictable at times. but i'm telling you when I watched this it blew my mind i had no idea what was coming. this one was rated R so it was a little more hot and steamy but the story definitely took off in this movie and i hope they make another one i'm so exited for what's to come next. just watch it i promise you won't regret it you'll be surprised"
251,I love this series and can't wait for the next one. Huge fan of the books and the movies!
252,I love this movie series and I love romantic books and movies
253,"8/10 - while falling into a mild sophomore slump in its return, this series continues to be perfect for a short guilty pleasure fix"
254,"The After films are brilliant, if you are in to romance movies with a twist then this is for you, ignore the critics, they obviously having read the books or got to know the characters properly! Keep up the movie making, can't wait for After we fell & After ever happy!!"
255,"I absolutely looooove the 1st movie and now I love the 2nd one just as much! I don't understand why 90% of the people rating this movie badly... I thought it was aweeeesome. I did not read the books & have no intention to.... This movie is full of romance, comedy and drama. Loooooves it."
256,Loved it. Not sure why people dislike these movies so much.
257,"I loved it, as did the first part. Hero and Jo are perfect together."
258,"I absolutely loved this especially compared to the first one
All the actors potrayed they're characters so well You should all be proud of yourselfHero your acting was so impressive i am so proud at how well you pulled off Hardin
You're definitely the best Hardin we can get and im thankful for youJo you did so well you have improved so much from the first movie
There is no better Tessa you really are a queenOnly negative would be the other characters should of had more time or no time but in saying that i know you can only do what you can it 1 hour and 40 minutes
Maybe you could of cut out some of the sex scenes and replace it with more wholesome scenes involving Hero and Jo more heart to heart conversations and them talking about they're issues like we see in the book.Landon needed more screen time!!I am so excited for AWF AND AEH hoping Castelle will be able to get the crucial parts from those books into the moviesOverall a really good Movie i would like it in general but Hero and Jo are the leads so how could you not"
259,I loved The movie but a lot was left out from the book.
260,"Watch it, ignore reviews or rating. Is very well shot, acting is great. Wow, what a great movie!"
261,I really enjpyed watching this movie and i cant wait to see the other part. tessa brings out the best in hardin and i love that.
262,"I love the whole movie. Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin are amazing as Tessa and Hardin. We can see more of their relationship, how they grow and we learn more about Hardin's past."
263,"Bring your tissues girls, you will definitely cry like I did! The movie is perfect and I have already watched it twice and I'm completely addicted"
264,"It was amazing, It didn't disappointed me at all! I even dare to say the movie is perfect, they give it all. The drama all the fans wanted is there, the romantic and the love scenes too, you should give a change to this movie. It was totally worth the wait, a big thank you to all the cast because they were exactly how I imagined, but especially, thank you to Hero and Jo for being the perfect Hero and Tessa! And finally Anna and Roger this wouldn't be possible with them and all the production behind. Everyone give a chance to the movie please and go watch it"
265,"It was so good! The books are amazing and the actors, Hero and Jo, did such a great job of bringing Hardin and Tessa to Life."
266,"Whew. People can be harsh. However, I'm not one of them.I love the books, I love the actors, I love the movies."
267,I am very happy I have finally seen it I waited so long for this film. I have to say I'm in ways disappointed. There was so much left out. There was just so much missing like college and fighting ( the Molly Tessa fight was even better than the book ) there was just so much still missing things that just seem important and that should have been added in. Like Tessa staying with with Landon more there should have been more of their friendship and things like Christmas they cut it so short shopping together was such an important part. The gifts from ken and karen were cut out the hockey game was cut out hardins birthday which was very important was cut out. There was just so much cut out that seemed more important that should have been in the movie. I loved the books and read them 3 times just honestly wished for the film to be better. But I was still excited even with the changes. I love Tessa and hardins story but the film just seems like she forgave him so easy when it wasn't at all easy for her I wish there was more of her raw emotions she didn't go back as easy as the movie seemed like she just fell into his arms so fast. It wasn't that easy for her the movie makes her seem weak and in love when really she was so strong in the books.
268,"Great movie that just takes you away. I can't wait for possibly more filming in ""Seattle"". Looking forward to the 3rd film"
269,"Hardin and Tessa are just two characters who shows us that in this generation love can mean anything.Their relationship started based on a lie,so they had to face consequences.They loved each other.but they didn't have the guts to confess it because of many reasons.they have shown us that love is everything as long as it's ""real"".Hardin made mistakes actually,so Tessa is meant to be mad at him but they both loved each other and so in the beginning of the movie, one kiss is all it took to fell in love again.That is why I loved this film.Trust me You'll love it tooooooo....."
270,I loved the first one and I loved this one even more!!
271,This movie was great. I love all the characters. Especially the chemistry between the two main characters Hardin and Tessa ( Hero Fiennes Tiffin & Josephine Langford) I just really loved the movieüíóüíó I can't wait for the next one. üíïüíï
272,"This was genuinely the worst movie i have ever seen. The first time i watched the first after movie i loved it. I am so disappointed this is nothing like the book. The acting was atrocious and i have second hand embarrasment. There was no plot, how many times do we have to see the apartment building and not actual conversions. Take out the intimate scenes and add something that relates to the story. Don't even bother making the third movie thank you."
273,"...should say enough. I got through 10 minutes of this film before frantically shutting it off. Probably shouldn't have watched after performances in ""Defending Jacob."""
274,I liked it. It moves very fast and is a good sequel. The acting surprised me on how good Hero and Josephine are. They have an acting future.
275,Great movie I loved it! Don't expect it to be like the first movie.
276,"This ia a beautiful movie
Of the day
I really like it
It
Us very
Fantastic
Movie"
277,Much better than the first movie an you fell the essence of HESSA an JOE is the bests
278,I read the books and saw the movie. I love both. Hardin and Tessa has developed their characters and maybe has matured a little bit than the previous movie. Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin has again given the fans the Hessa moments love.
279,"Having seen the After movie and read the books of the After series, I can say Roger Kumble have played his cards right in showing how sexy this movie is. Hardin and Tessa are now seemingly different characters from the first film. Tessa from being the naive and innocent goody goody to a more stronger and independent woman. As for Hardin, his bad boy and brooding attitude has shed off as he tries to win Tessa back. Though their ""toxic"" relationship is ""equal parts pain and pleasure"" they would still find themselves coming back to each other. The introduction of Tessa's dad at the end of the movie would ensure drama on the next movie."
280,"It was cringey,ofc it isn't quality movie but hey It was entertaining"
281,Its amazing... totally mind blowing..... outstanding..
282,"I loved the movie! I'm glad they made it more like the book, even if the scenes weren't exactly how we wanted them to be, it was perfect! I loved how Josephine and Hero played Hardin and Tessa and I totally loved Trevor sense of humor. I really recommend it."
283,"Honestly, I'm so so happy with this movie!.. I have read all the after books!! I love them sm!!!... this series THE AFTER SERIES has a different feelings!! I have read the books like 5 times.. honestly.. I cried while seeing the movie same as I cried when I was reading the book!!! I love it!!! I'm so thankful of roger kumble for giving us what we wanted!!! Thank youuu so much anna todd for writing them!! And thank youuu so much hero and jo for being the best hardin and tessa we wanted... for bringing hessa to life!!! At last, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ITS BEST!!!‚ù§"
284,"After We Collided exceeded my expectations. The first After movie was terrible, no story line and weak character development. This time, it was very enjoyable, it had some funny bits and also more dramatic scenes which followed the book closely. As a huge fan of the books I was pleasantly surprised to see many of my favourite scenes come alive on screen. I'm looking forward for the next 2 movies."
285,I recommend seeing it. I can't wait for film 3 and 4.
286,Gives off a completely different vibe comparing to the first movie. Would recommend ‚ù§
287,Different to the book but I did enjoy this film. I am very much looking forward to seeing what the next 2 instalments bring.
288,"The movie is owesome from the look of the trailer, , üòÄpatience is killing me though"
289,"It would be so very easy to just pan this film, for good it is not. That said, it is infinitely better than ""After"" (2019) and the two stars are perhaps, just perhaps, starting to look like they might just go on to achieve something more substantial should they ever be given some characters with more substance to portray. As it is, however, this is just a light and fluffy late-teen angst film that follows the continuing antics of feisty ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) and the erring ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The story hasn't the depth of a puddle - their on/off relationship is largely represented by sexless sex scenes; they can't keep their hands off each other for much of the film. However, he has ""issues"" from his childhood (broken home, drink problems etc.) that are creating plenty of bumps on their particular Yellow Brick Road. Hats off to HFT for not adopting a daft mid-Atlantic drawl, he is a Brit and that helps with a little of the charm of the story, for charm there is - and that's it's redemption. Perhaps if the director had given them actual dialogue, rather than just a stream of scenes riddled with profanities whilst they were snogging/shagging/showering then maybe we could have had a chance to appreciate the two young talents trying their best with this woefully banal narrative. I suspect it will only really attract those of us under 15, but I'd keep a look out for the two stars in the future."
290,"Tessa has everything to lose. Hardin has nothing to lose. - except her. After We Collided - Life will never be the same. After a tumultuous beginning to their relationship, Tessa and Hardin were on the path to making things work. Tessa knew Hardin could be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship - and Hardin's mysterious past - Tessa is beside herself. Hardin will always be - Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior - or has he been a stranger all along? She wishes she could walk away. It's just not that easy. Hardin knows he made a mistake, possibly the biggest one of his life. He's not going down without a fight. But can he change? Will he change - for love? Yes, yes he will."
291,"Amazing movie, i love after movies, all things is amazing"
292,"I saw a film was on release, no idea what is was. Just booked my seat and turned up. I know i wss late and guessed i maybe missed the opening credits and maybe another 5 minutes ie 10 minutes. I sat down opened my water and started watching. I found myself trying to work out the back story, Tessa had just turned up at the office to start her job, she connected with a young guy who knew her ex boyfriend, wh apoarently worked for the same company. She was next seen waking up after falling asleep overnight at her desk. The boss was friends with the mysterious boyfriends mother. The boyfriend is seen getting a tattoo with no pain killer. A drunken club night where our lead is commando results in a phone call and a bedroom farce. As i watched the film more and more plot was thrown at me, causing confusion. The young actors were fine in their roles though fiennes come across as too namby pampy to be a rebel, it was good to see a chunky actress as the leading actress, made a change. It was only after i got home to read up the film, i discovered the film is a sequel to the first film After (2019) which as far as im aware never came to a cineworld near me. Cut a long story short all the stuff i missed was actuallly in the first film. Makes sense to see that first. To sum up its Two Moon Junction for 14 year olds with no nudity, it could have been a TV movie without the F words. Its enjoyable hokum."
293,There is so much that has been rushed. I love the books and I love the characters being portrayed. If it wasn't so rushed then I think there could have been more that the actors could have done with their roles. I think Hero Playing Harden is such a big undertaking and he isn't given enough credit for how he actually does. Also compared to books it is not near spicy enough. Harden is a sex god in the books and this isn't even close to what happens in the movie. Otherwise I still love forward to the future! Hope it's gets more true to the story.Love this movie!
294,I'm in love with this movie. Better than the first one. More like the book. The acting is amazing
295,I absolutely love this movie !!! It's much closer to the book and overall the film was more interesting üôÇ.
296,"I had such high hopes for this movie after all the built up hype around it from the cast, the director, Anna herself... and then eventually from all the fans that were starting to see it as it slowly came out.However my hopes were dashed once I actually saw the movie.Was there more book content? Yes. Did it feel more like Hessa? To an extent. But it was still a let down.The movie was far too rushed, scenes were choppy, Causing the movie to not really flow properly. And the story didn't entirely go in the sequences it should have like in the book.Adding the Trevor love triangle actually made even less sense than it would have if they just re-introduced Zed as the other half of the love triangle.Was Dylan's portrayal of Trevor good? Yes. But as I said this whole thing didn't really go with the movie.Another thing that really bothered me was the fact they tried to make it like a romantic comedy... AWC is anything but a comedy.And the R rating is just absurd.... there isn't anything R - rated about it other than 1 bare bum. And a bigger F- word presence. The sex scenes I'd rate as PG-13 ; 14a at most.Dare I say that despite AFTERS lack of book likeness it was actually a better more beautiful film, and actually made more sense than this choppy mess.I am actually shocked, because I LOVE Rogers other projects especially Cruel Intentions. I just feel he wasn't given the opportunity to really shine here, because of other *people* holding him back and not allowing him to express his creative talent.Josephine and Hero did a wonderful job (as did the rest of the cast) their acting has really grown with them. I just truly wish they were given the full opportunity to shine."
297,"I am a huge fan of the books, the movies are okay this one was for sure better than the first but the movie did feel rushed. Also even if it did show a small amount of hardins and tessas past they should have shown more so people who only watch the movies have a better understanding of the characters. all that being said still i liked the movie and love Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Josephine Langfrod."
298,"I love this movie,hdhjdfkjfshjhshshshsgdhshshshshshshshhshshshshwhwhshshwhshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwh"
299,"Was very good it was true to the book but was very very good and the actors where spot on
Well done Jo and hero"
300,"So much better than the first movie! It made me laugh, cry and feel lots of emotions. My favourite scene was tessa and molly fighting!, jo did such an amazing job! All the actors have improved so much! Definitely would recommend watching it!!"
301,Please can someone inform me on which site can I download the movie for free.
302,This movie was so good and I never expected it to be like the first one.
303,"The books obviously go into more detail and open up more about the character feelings, but books have to be cut down to make a movie.So if you accept the above you will love the movie, I have read all 5 books and love them and I love the movies just as much. The love Hardin and Tessa have for one another is something elseüñ§"
304,Good movie better than the first for sure............
305,"With a noticeable change from the first film to the second. Actors more comfortable with their characters and with great maturity. Good soundtrack and photography. In relation to the story it had some open moments, but it was very faithful to the book, not entirely but considerable. I look forward to the sequence."
306,"I am really in love with the books and I've read them binder to binder more than two times. You could say I was a bit disappointed in the movies because they are too rushed, but please tell me how to include 19 hours of book into 1,5-2 hours movie please. I'll wait.Adore their storyline and relationship (even though it's hella toxic and nothing to long for in real life) and am too excited to see how this plays out in movie number three and four. Do yourself a favor and watch the movies before you read the books. enjoy!"
307,Again Tessa is too smart and Hardin is too nice comparing to the same characters in the books. The story and the performance is significant better than the first movie.
308,"I've been a after fan so for long, I've read all the books even including ""before"" And I wasn't disappointed at all. Some of the scenes, from the book weren't there, but you can't fit everything into a hour and a half hour long movie! But we GOT OUR HESSA! it's not even the sex scenes, it's the development of Hessa, and about their journey! My favorite scene has to be Hardin baby-sitting Smith! I would definitely definitely recommend it"
309,"This was amazing! So much better than the first one. The actors/characters had much better chemistry in this one. It's was a cheese chick flick movie in a good way. It's not a masterpiece but it shouldn't have to be. It was entertaining and had lot's of good humor and that is the most important thing by my opinion. I was laughing through half of the movie.
I really really hope the give us the third installment of the franchise.
Overexcited my expectations."
310,"I watched it twice so I must have enjoyed it or was I looking for more? In my opinion the film was rushed. The film didn't capture Tessas and Hardins emotions after their break up. In the book the author captured their pain. In the movie it was a case of ok let's go and have sex. The book was sexually orientated but there was a good story to it too. In the movie the characters were different. I didn't like it..not just Tessa and Hardin but Noah, Tessas mum, Steph, Stephs girlfriend and Molly. I feel the director let the actors down. They were all different from the first movie. Tessa turned over night from a quiet polite lady to a totally different person. Is this because of what she had endured. I don't think anyone would change so much so quick. It was like where's Tessa? In my opinion there should have been a lot more shown about the turmoil Hardin went through whilst he was in London. It was just too rushed. Candice Accola was amazing as usual and Charlie Weber was a good choice for Vance. Would have loved to give 10 for the actors but I feel the Director has let them down."
311,"Hero and Josephine really brought Tessa and Hardin to life in this movie!!! Their acting was incredible and so much better than the first movie. There were so many scenes from the book and the chemistry between H&J just got even better!!!! I love Louise Lombard as Trish, she played the role perfect and Dylan Sprouse was so funny as Trevor. Overall, the second movie was a big step up from the first and I absolutely loved it!"
312,This is the best movie it shows more from the books the the first one did
313,"I don't know what to say. I mean, movie is okay. A little bit boring. To be honest I expected more. It was all mixed and too fast."
314,Was amazing didnt think it was as good as the first one tbh but it had loads of chemistry in it which the first one didnt have much and loads of arguments which every relationship has and just shows things like this happen in real life definitely worth the watch and great acting from the main characters aswell.
315,"I expected Hardin & tessa on this to be a together & settled for whole life.
But at the end of movie tessa father entry on that last moment, that was kinda unexpected.
I love to watch hardin & tessa, but it's getting long ."
316,"Such a step up from the first movie, love it , the character were more like the book , the only thing was i felt it like was rushed"
317,"I loved it so much, there was so much drama and romance. As a book reader it was everything i was hoping for!"
318,"Hey guys,
I saw the movie yesterday and I think the movie is way better than the first!
The movie is close to the book and the most important things from the book are available in the movie.
You can see that Hardin and Tessa had a huge glow up, which is very important for their story. We finally have our book Hardin and Tessa was as perfect as ever!
One thing that disturbed me was the beginning! The movie starts with Hardin sitting in a car and Tessa's dad walks by and wants to ask Hardin a question. That scene confused me a bit because it never happened in the book and I can't understand why they put that in the beginning, because in my eyes this scene was unnecessary. I mean, they meet Tessa's dad Richard at the end of the book and not from the beginning and that confused me.
Another thing that disturbed me, was the scene after Hardin meeting Richard. Tessa had her first day at Vance Publishing and I don't know why they started directly with that! Of course, they have to find a way to connect it with the ending of the first movie, but in the time where Hardin and Tessa broke up happened so much. She wasn't at Vance Publishing at the beginning and everything happened so fast. The day they went to Seattle was so fast I didn't like it.
The last point that disturbed me, was that aftermovie posted too much scenes on Instagram!
In my opinion, they should post some pictures of a scene but not a whole scene because sometimes it ruins the movie, because you can figure out what happens in the next scene or you already know it. The scenes that they posted were a bit long and one thing that I was sad about was the meeting of Tessa and Trevor. They just posted the scene and when I saw the movie it wasn't a surprise anymore of how they met. I often knew what will happen in the next scene, because they posted so much. Of course, they didn't post so many scenes from the second movie as from the first movie but it still felt the same.
I just hope that aftermovie reads this and they will accept the criticism and implement something about it. I just hope that they won't post scenes from the third and the fourth movie, because it would be better if the whole movie is a surprise and no one knows what will happen. (Except the Trailer, there has to be scenes from the movie but I hope you understand what I meant with posting some scenes on Instagram.)
In all, the movie was perfect, a lot happened and they put as much as they could from the book into the movie. Roger Kumble did a great job and all the actors too! The chemistry was everything and the plot was definitely better than in the first movie.
I'm looking forward to the next two movies and of course I will watch After We Collided again in the cinema! The movie and the people deserve this.
I hope you agree with me at some points!
Have a good day!"
319,Very good! So much better than the first one. A little rushed but very true to the books.
320,I actually thought the movie could of been better. doesn't compare to the first movie at all. Romantic but predictable. its worth watching once.
321,"Anyone who has read the After books knows that this movie nailed it! It was perfectly done, cant wait for the next!"
322,"So, I watched the movie and I won't lie, for me, it's much closer to the book (which I read before watching the movie). The two leads, they really did bring the characters to life. I felt their chemistry. For anyone who has not seen the first movie or read the first book, the book and the movie are very different. But this movie, helped me understand their relationship from just a side character. There's a second character who was better in the movie than in the book. He opened my eyes when it came to the relationship of the two main characters. Without giving much away about the movie, or the books, I feel this franchise is giving people a view/ understanding of what addiction can do. How it affects lives and what happens when you think you can change someone or want to stick around and help them. This franchise makes people question their own relationship and possibly recognise the similarities and realise they need to walk away. This is just the second movie. I feel the first movie introduced us to the characters but only showed us the puppy love version. This film showed the characters from the books. Unlike other movies which are probably similar to this movie in terms of problems in earlier life, this film shows the audience that sometimes love may not be enough. The person themselves need to understand what the problem is and get help. Not rely on their partner. But like I said, there are two more books, and apparently they will become movies so let's just see what happens in this journey."
323,Such a step up in energy and enjoyment from the first movie (which I also enjoyed but found a bit slow). Fans of the books will enjoy seeming this one come to life. Lead actors were fantastic.
324,"I loved it, much more improved from the first movie"
