I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made."
1,"First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school ""teenagers"".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10"
2,"When I tuned in to ""The Vampire Diaries"" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, ""Supernatural."" I'd seen (and read) the ""Twilight"" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original ""The Vampire Diaries"" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in ""The Vampire Diaries."" This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed."
3,"After watching episode 4 i got all excited and started to flap my hands wishing the next episode will come out already. I admit first two episodes were bit slow and sluggish , but by episode 4 the story really starts to kick in. After watching it i have the greatest urges to go library and read the rest of series.Im sick of seeing people bagging vampire diaries at the moment. GIVE IT A CHANCE. yes it may not be as good as the book series, but I'm telling you now it beats twilight by far. Watch episode 4, of course first episode isn't going to hook you in like its best show in the world. but for those who think people who enjoy this series are brain dead, i believe their comments a rush and idiotic. Give the series a chance, but if you listen to "" the real brain dead losers "" then you really be missing out."
4,"Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; ""vampire"" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance."
5,"I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a ""Dick"" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same."
6,"I can't remember how the show hooked me in but I have watched every episode on ITV2 since the show was aired and even bought the books, and like a previous correspondent I am not a teen but a 29 year old and a male! I suppose the almost unnatural beauty of Nina Dobrev drew me to the show but the plot and unseen twists and turns made the show compulsive viewing for the first 6 months of this year, to such an extent that I found myself scanning the net to find the latest US screened episode as much hunger for the show grew.Only recently have I read the books and, with all due respect to L J Smith, my perception of the TV show has improved. Without writing a book review I felt the series did not develop the characters to any level that the show achieved. The show develops the relationships between all of the main characters in a manner that the book can only dream of, and for me, despite the constant attention to the Stefan and Elana relationship, the show is about the brothers.I do not do preachy, after all I am English, but I would say that the show grips my interest because of the brotherly relationship. The way the brothers value one and other more than themselves and anyone else, numerous examples throughout the show, is something I shall instill in my two sons and hope one day that the Stevenson brothers will be exactly the same as the Salvatore brothers, maybe except for the blood sucking but if they both can attract girls like Elena I will be a very conflicted father! :) All in all, for my money, the best show on TV since the early days of Buffy and like many others...roll on September.Thank you for listening to my ramblings, first post (I'm sure the red wine had something to do with it) so please be nice."
7,"I have never read the books, however, I don't understand how anyone could expect for any TV series to be an exact replica of a book. Just my opinion. I have been watching the show since the pilot episode and I absolutely love it. I also happen to be 29 years old and am hooked, so I truly think it's all about what each individual finds interesting, not ""this show is for 13-16 year olds"". I'm not sure how anyone can say they love or hate something after just a pilot, I never really quite understood that. Personally, I think you should give a show at least 3 or 4 episodes to give it a fair chance and to see where the story will go. I wasn't sure that I was totally in love with it after just the pilot either, as I am a HUGE twilight fan, but by the end of the 2nd episode, I found myself anxiously anticipating the 3rd, 4th and so on. P.s. Nina and Paul work great together!"
8,"*Slight Spoilers*I remember 3 years ago, I was looking for new shows to watch and I had heard of 'The vampire Diaries'.I was quite hesitant in the beginning because of the similarity with Twilight.The beginning was not that great but the acting was enough for me to continue and give it a chance.I shall never regret that decision.Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder, Paul Wesley and the entire, I REALLY mean ENTIRE cast have proved that great acting is possible. Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson are amazing writers that really know how to bring this series to another level.The thing with TVD is that it gets better with every episode. It is one of the shows with the strongest,fiercest, most passionate fans in the whole world. I love the chemistry between Ian and Nina, but nevertheless, Paul is great with her too. Elena's character is wonderful. She is deep, compassionate, adorable, balanced and mature. The writers created the perfect base for such a plot and the way they made Elena develop and influence those around her is fascinating, they made it BELIEVABLE and I think this is one of the most important achievement one could make in a TV show. Not to forget the extremely addictive character of Katherine Pierce. Nina is, maybe, one of the best actors one could watch, because of her portrayal of completely different characters which is really impressive.A scene that will remain in my mind FOREVER is the season 3 three finale,when Elena is under that bridge with Matt. I cried. so many emotions were conveyed without any characters uttering 1 word. The juxtaposition of Elena's accident with Matt and her accident with her parents was symbolical, tear-breaking, jaw-dropping and it really makes you think of all she had to go through, how this will affect the whole series and create one of the best cliffhangers I have ever seen in any series that I have ever watched in my whole life. This is one of Nina's best performances EVER. The Vampire Diaries has talked about importance of family, friends, life, love, and coming to terms with who we are. It has humor (thanks to Damon), Passion, a LOT of well-acted actions, a really fascinating history of the mythical creatures (Witches, Werewolves, Hybrids, Ghosts, Vampires, Vampire Hunters, Original Vampires). I have been watching it for 3 years,and I've seen people drooling over Damon or Stefan and fighting about who's best. Seriously? I LOVE the series as a whole, and always have. Of course, I love Damon and Elena's chemistry, it is amazing. But I think TVD is much more than that. And people have to see it as a whole picture. Else, they'll miss all the beauty of it."
9,"I always get annoyed when I read reviews where the person begins the sentence with something along the lines of, ""So I only watched the first few episodes..."" Stop. Stop right there. How could a person make a balanced, mature opinion if one doesn't give said program a chance? This is vital to a show like The Vampire Diaries, as the program is a typical case of once you get past the first few episodes, it evolves into something brilliant. It wasn't a show that had me hooked from the word go. The pilot is pretty unoriginal; introducing a misunderstood human girl who meets an even more broody, tortured vampire. Yes yes, very 'Twilight', I know. However when you hit episode 3, that's when things get interesting. The plot starts to develop and we see the extent of these characters' personalities. This is when I found myself actually really looking forwards to the next episode.Irrefutably, the best thing about this show is, and always has been right from the start, one man named Ian Somerhalder. He plays sadistic Damon Salvatore, the 'bad' brother who we get to see develop into someone much more deep and morally rooted, all because he begins to fall in love with his brother's girlfriend. Of course, he never loses the 'bad boy' persona which the audience loves, but his character is someone who we feel real empathy for and who grows as a person throughout each episode.Overall, this show is definitely worth a watch (and not just for under 15 year olds as one review stated). In fact, my mother in her early 50s loves this show probably more than I do. Each week brings something different, unexpected and completely unguessable. It's probably the only supernatural show that doesn't suffer from 'Monster of the week' syndrome like Buffy in its early years. It remains sophisticated and interesting throughout and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone :)Oh, and I suppose it doesn't hurt that every single actor is easy on the eyes... if ya know what I mean ;)"
10,"I adore this show.Its got great actors and strong character development, nina dobrev does a fantastic job at playing 2 very different characters. Each season brings a new and exciting story.It starts off a bit slow and seems like another teenager love triangle programme, but if you get past episode 6 it really gets going and deeper into the story of the vampires etc....There's vampires, witches, hybrids, werewolves, heretics and more. I have re-watched TVD 10++ times and i still love it every time....give it a go"

Its too good too watch, give it a chance awesome series"
12,It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
13,"When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to ""Twilight"", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear."
14,"Okay, so there's been an overload of vampires. 1st, Twilight, then Jennifer's Body and blah blah blah.. but Vampire Diaries is different, and definitely here to stay.For starters, it follows the basic rules that apply to vampires, unlike Twilight where Edward Cullen just goes into Bella's house without any invitation, etc.What's also gripping is the fact that it has other characters from the magical world, like Witches and all. It also sticks to its plot, so what we are seeing is actually a story which has vampires as a part of it, not the other way around.Definitely worth a try, and one of the best shows of Fall '09.And the coupling of it with Supernatural on Thursday, making it a Thrilling Thursday on CW is quite cool too! A 9/10 for me!"
15,"OK, let's all face it, when I first heard of the vampire diaries and the plot, I thought it would be another stupid twilight-esq teen drama. Blew it off as not worth watching. About two months ago, I decided to give the show a shot, and boy was I wrong about EVERYTHING. The storyline starts out as very stereotypical, but we see that it grows into something so much more. There are so many interesting back stories and characters to keep the show interesting. The show itself has many deep messages it sends out and really touches you emotionally. I personally love all the actors and actresses and they really do a great job at portraying the characters. Whether you're delena, stelena, klaroline, forwood, stebekah, or a non shipper, this show will have you hooked!"
16,"Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far."
17,"I really like the episodes, it is somehow fluent and has a taste of Twilight. Maybe it is weird but its shooting is better than Twilight because in watching Twilight you can feel the coldness, silence and a sort of pause which drift the interest of the spectacular away. But in Vampire Diaries, you can feel the hot impression of the characters, hot color of each frame of the movie. These series make you feel more connection to the reality than Twilight. The characters are involved in excellent combination with the setting and the plot. Stephen perfectly reflects his good mood through his face. Elena is another good chosen actress for the character. Because you easily see her bright intelligence and innocence on her face.Damon is just like his name demonic,attracting and tempting person. This good adaptation of the characters to the story makes the film more powerful and better than Hollywood production Twilight thought it is a TV series. I wish Twilight was shot by Vampire Diaries technical production team."
18,"In this day and age it's the time of the Vampires. You have Twilight and True blood and Vampire Diaries but don't let them keep you from watching. While many tend to compare it with the two, it's actually very different. Vampire Diaries, based off a series written 15 years before Twilight,is about a girl Elena who just lost her parents when a new guy, Stefan Salvatore, comes to town but with Stefan also comes trouble, his brother Damon Salvatore. This show is definitely the middle of Twi and True Blood. It has a romance like Twilight and the intensity of True Blood. What this show has is a lot of twists and turns that you don't expect.The only flaw may be the characters. While there is a lot of character development, it really only applies to the main ones. The supporting characters like Caroline and Matt seem flat. Even though Matt seems to have some roundness, Caroline just doesn't seem to change, she is always that annoying whiny girl;there are even times when Elena can be naive.All in all, despite it's flaws, every episode has a mystery to it; it's hard to guess what's going to happen. Believe me at the end of every episode, maybe even in between commercials, you begin to speculate what the end possibilities could be."
19,"I watch anything vampire or werewolf. Seasons 1-4 was awesome. Seasons 5-8 is whatever. Nina Dobrev leaving the show really screwed things up. She was one of my favorite characters along with the Brothers. They did not prepare an ending for this show so it just kept dragging on till kingdom come with a lot of boring plots like the Sirens and the Travelors, etc. The Travelors almost put me to sleep. I also don't think Julie Plec has the magic that Kevin Williamson had; unfortunately, he left the show and Plec took over. Elena (Nina Dobrev) should've returned back to Stephan (Paul Wesley) but that couldn't happen anymore since Nina left. I think this show should've been six seasons instead of eight. Caroline's pairing with Stephan was god awful. Like i said, Seasons 1-4 was fantastic, and 5-8 was whatever.The Originals in this show were fantastic. Joseph Morgan's acting is out of this world. He plays Niclaus Mikaelson.I would've liked to see more dimension to Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham) then just constantly saving the day. She is a beautiful actress and very talented singer. I would've liked to have seen her ship with Damon (Ian Somerhalder) at one point.I thought the finale was lackluster but Seasons 1-4 is some of the best TV I have seen. They chose the cast very well. I would reccomend this show."
20,"I read the books 15 years ago, and I was a bit excited and apprehensive about it being made into a TV series with all the liberties that are taken these days. Last night, I watched the pilot. I have a few beefs (missing character and particular character interactions), but mostly I think I was alright with it. It has been update to fit with the times a bit more.It appears that they are loosely following the story, and that is fine if they are making it into a series. To follow the books, they would have just needed to make a mini-series and been done with it. For a full-on TV series they needed to make many adjustments. I'm a little sad that they are aiming so very hard for the Twilight crowd by throwing the romance factor in right away, but it has the potential to be pretty good.The acting isn't the greatest, but I have definitely seen much worse. This felt to me like actors that had not yet fit themselves into their characters. It will smooth out with time and become more comfortable for them and it will show through in the series. They have managed to obtain a bit of balance between the almost care-free world of high school and the dark gritty nature of what they can't see and don't know about. That was actually what I was most worried about.So, from a MAJOR fan of the books (I rejoiced when I realized they were with me instead of another state and started reading them for the umpteenth thousandth time) to the CW....So far, so good. Let's see where they take this and hope they keep true to the feel."
21,"I mean, I avoided this show like the plague. Seriously. After having read the Twilight books, enjoying them, and being brutally assaulted by the horrendous movies, I am so sensitive to the vampire movement. I like True Blood and Buffy is OK, but you can't go to a book store without seeing the black hole of teen vampire books. Well guess who came way before all that? THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. These books were written quite a while ago (90s baby), so comparison to other series is really unfair. I finally decided to watch the show last fall after it kept popping up on the front page of my Netflix account. I had a friend who watched it, but I just thought it would make me cringe. Maybe, maybe, the first 5 minutes did make me cringe, and now I'm dying because season 5 won't be starting until October. Minus the supernatural topics, this show is real. It's got grit, romance, sex, violence, tragedy, and more. If you get past the first season, prepare to offer your first born child for more. If you're a heterosexual male, this show may not be for you. There are very VERY hot women though. If you're attracted to men, this is your show. If you like great television, this is your show. If you like crying and yelling at your TV and getting in arguments with other fans of the show, this is your show. Best of luck to you."
22,"I enjoyed the series for while but then it just got boring and repetitive, in every episode there's a tragic ""accident"" where someone has to risk their life to save them. Usually Stefan or useless Elena. The same thing happens every episode. Elena and Damon flirt, there's a disaster going on elsewhere, she goes back to Stefan and someone is either dying or is already dead. There's too much going on in this series, too many characters, too many supernatural things going on, it just gets confusing. Also Elena is the most annoying character ever, she needs to just make up her mind and choose, one minute its Stefan, the next its Damon, then it's Stefan, oh then its Damon again. It just makes the series repetitive and loses the storyline.Elena not being able to choose is just stupid and selfish it makes the series tacky and predictable and just pisses me off. The story is based on her and I think that's why i've come to hate this series,also because they never seem to actually kill the bad guy. They should focus on trying to keep the population of mystic falls alive because seriously how many random people are they going to kill?! This series had a lot of potential but let itself down in my opinion. Much prefer Teen Wolf!"
23,"This show is quickly becoming one of my favorites on TV..It's probably one of the shows I look most forward to watching.I love how each episode ends in a cliffhanger, which keeps you waiting for the next episode. I also like the fact even though this show is in its third season it still has a great story line. The show always keeps me guessing with all its twists and turns.. At any rate, I strongly recommend this series to anyone looking for excellent drama, romance, action and even a little humor..I will definitely continue watching this show until its time is up. :) Go vampire Diaries. you are awesome!!!!"
24,The only downfall of this show is the character Elena. She is so selfish ans self centred. She moans all the time. She interferes all the time. She has to put her nose in every ones business. She thinks the world revolves around her. She's bossy. She turns everything around so when someone is having a problem.. Elena has been there and done that. She thinks she knows everything and with every episode i watch she annoys me more. I hope now that she has turned human again that someone kills her soon :-) All other characters are brilliant. They all work so well together and against each other. The story lines are great and you're always on your toes guessing whats going to happen next. The only boring parts are the parts where Elena speaks in that whiney voice or pulls those annoying faces 😂
25,"So, a high school girl (Elena) fancies a boy (Stefan), who surprise surprise turns out to be THE vampire for her. Of course a love triangle is presented; Stefan's more demonic brother has an agenda to win Elena's affection. Elena's best friend is a bubbly psychic, there is no shape shifters (read werewolves) yet nor mind readers (yet), and Elena is not clumsy (yet), although she does feel isolated and lives in a very small town. Sounds familiar? It should because L.J Smith's books the Vampire Diaries have been around already for last 15 years. This story might have kicked in better if the ""Twilight thing"" wouldn't burn the subject to the dead. That is something to wonder, how the author of the Twilight ever got away borrowing? so direct storyline, in addition items like mind reading and shape shifters/werewolves in context of vampires from Sookie Stackhouse novels by C. Harris, a book which was also published before first Twilight. Apparently one cannot copyright an idea, only product. But wait, the publisher of L.J Smith has announced a new book to the Vampire diaries series called ""Midnight"". There is no ""Sun"" in it, but is this the finger or what?But this has to be said, that the actors in the Vampire Diaries do not look like they are in the constant pain, well at least not all the time, like in that ""other thing"". Perhaps that is the difference in these stories; the Vampire Diaries lack the certain amount of constipation.I vote for that."
26,"The background is that of a teen drama, but its much more than that for sure.Yes, its lame in many parts esp the magic and witch nonsense, but its probably the most entertaining and addictive vampire show. Its not too serious despite being about blood and murders and love the sub-plots. And the actors are the ones that make the show amazing. I love Candice Accola and her character Caroline the most, and also Nina and her negative character Katherine."
27,"Does anyone else besides myself and my sister, feel like the writers are running this show into the ground... All the other characters have grown, you see development, while with Elena, with the exception of the bridge scene with her and Matt, is still the same selfish little girl. So much for them dropping flowers off Wickery Bridge, saying, ""here lies Elena Gilbert.."" Come on writers we need to see some character development for Elena. Also, will you please choose between Damon and Stefan, or ya know what introduce a new human love interest for her. As much as I love the thought of her and Damon at this point I could really care less if the Salvatore's go on a long vacation, mainly Stefan. Frankly hes gotten a little old. He and Elena are just a lost cause, they need separation and what happened with the road trip with Katherine, I mean really pick a plot and stick with it. I like the change of events sometimes but not when you have had so many that you as the writer have no clue where you were originally going with it in the first place. I feel like you keep changing things for the fans and that's what is getting you so lost in your writing, pick a plot go with it, let us bicker and complain, but don't change everything just because we get a little ticked off, be the writer, because I know that if we keep watching it with the way you have written it without Fan influence we will more than likely Love where ever it leads the show. Now if you are one of the writers, and you have just read this, please exit this page and never look at IMDb again, and go with what your gut tells you. Be the writer. Sincerely, Thank you, T.V.D. Fan, From Griffin, Ga."
28,"OK so i just finished this pilot-it was awesome and i have high hopes for the series. I have not read the books but have heard of them and love everything vampires and this show does not disappoint. Well cast, looks expensive, legit 'this is how teens talk' dialogue. This is the age old vampire story: dark brooding vampire meets young human girl. Same story as twilight except these teens drink and have sex. Kevin Williamson is able to balance the tension of the story with humor and irony. All of the characters are good looking and can deliver the snappy dialogue with ease. Even the cheesier elements (see: fog) don't take themselves too seriously. If you like true blood, twilight and loved buffy then you should all watch this show (mostly so that i can see the second episode!!)"
29,"I noticed that most of the negative comments on this series contain horrible grammar and spelling (i cant believe they are playing up the whole twilight thing! u should totally not watch this series.) Maybe these people should spend less time in front of the television and more time reading.Anyway, I am myself a Twilight fan; I'm not entirely sure why. Perhaps it has something to do with the ""forbidden love."" I was very skeptical of this series at first; I thought it was a Twilight knock-off. Actually, the story has more depth and, in terms of quality, the actors are better. Nina and Paul have great chemistry (Rob and Kristen's chemistry has been edited out of all their scenes. The raw footage is much better).Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by this series. I am going to read the books, although I'm worried I'll turn into one of those people who are screaming, ""She's supposed to be a blonde! Her friend is a red-head! They left out characters!!"" Welcome to Hollywood."
30,"If not for her character this show would be much more enjoyable. One of the most annoying characters ever created. Which is weird cause she started off Fine and Kathrine is awesome, so it's not the actress. Some of these reviews though crack me up, smh. It's typical, unoriginal CW young adult drama, not Shakespeare people. Lets cool it with the 10 star reviews, lol."
31,I have seen it 5 times and I still love it. Session 1 is like.. too much teenage show.. but Its get better and better! Watch and and you would not regret it!
32,"Best web series ever watched,romantic,comedy,action all in one family entertainment is best must watch pls rewiev more goood thing about the vampire diaries its underated make it above 8 plzz"
33,So recently i love vampire films and i watched twilight but this movie is so dissapointed and i searched that related to vampire and this was on recomendation on the web that i searched and i watch this movie and i'm so addicted of every part of this movies
34,"10/10 show. Way better than Twilight, while watching this you will cry and laugh. Some scenes are pretty emotional :)"
35,The best supernatural show ever ! I hope there's a more series like this
36,"Although the show ended two years and I have watched the whole series, I can't get enough of it. I have watched all the seasons twice. The show consist of every emotion love, hate, drama, it's a full package. All the characters were fascinating, especially the Salvatore Brothers. Loved the character of Damon with Elena initially but as the show progressed really felt bad for Stefan. Caroline was my favorite female character in the show. Every bond hooked me to the show be it Bonnie and Damon or Caroline and her mother. The storyline consist of many ups and downs, also it has been gotten bit slow in some episodes but never lost my interest."
37,"This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!"
38,"Television meet Twilight! ""The Vampire Diaries"" is Vampires meets a soap opera. I have watched a full 15 minutes of the show, and other bits and pieces here and there of ""The Vampire Diaries"", while my wife is glued to the show. Here are my deductions of ""The Vampire Diaries"" First deductions everyone is hot or good looking on the show. Too much eye candy! Second the Twilight recurring theme of rival vampires, witches, and who is going be turned into a vampire reminds me of some sort of high school click. Romance/drama forbidden love. One girl has the hots for the other's boyfriend. The show has the usual soap opera sub plots back stabbing, infighting, lies, secrets. I miss the entertainment value of the show but my wife loves it. I give the show a 2 and my wife give it a 9/10."
39,"This show started off just as one would expect it to: not well. It was just a teen vampire show that latched on to the current entertainment vampire craze to tap into a market the WB/CW had not harnessed yet. I started watching it because I needed something to drone in the background while I did homework, and it started off as the perfect show for that job: trash. The actors were not only annoying, but also gave poor line delivery (of bad lines, at that) and did not seem to be particularly good actors (and I came into the show with poor opinions of some of them, such as Ian Somerhalder, who plays Damon), and the plot was all over the place, with no focus.Oh, how it has changed. Vampire Diaries is probably one of the most consistently good shows, from week to week, that I have seen in years. Pretty much every episode ranges from good to great. It does one of the most interesting things I have seen done with characters in ANY show: it takes characters and actors you don't like, find annoying, and just plain don't want to watch, and it makes you actually sympathize with them in some way.Here's another shocker: it has a good plot (well, after the first several episodes it does). It is not just a case-of-the-week WB/CW show. Its plots actually span multiple episodes, whole seasons, and multiple seasons - and the plots are actually interesting. This is something I never thought I would be saying about this show (or any show from this network).The show does have some problems (not a whole lot, but some). Some annoying/poorly acted and written side characters is the most glaring one, though it seems that someone in the show's production staff has caught on to this and given them less screen time for the second season. The dialogue is not great. It isn't bad any more (for the first couple episodes I would cringe at some of Damon's and Jeremy's lines), and it sometimes is even good, but it's never really great (unlike True Blood, which has some amazing writing). The flashback scenes can also be fairly cheesy, but it isn't like the show has infinite production money. This is probably the most surprising and satisfying show I have seen in the last several years, and, unlike True Blood, hasn't really disappointed me yet. This is a review I don't think I ever saw myself writing. This show really is worth taking a look at (though it will take some investment to get past the first few not-good episodes).Post Script: for those thinking this is a chick show, I'm a 25 year old male who's show interests include Mad Men, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Dexter, Community, and many others. Vampire Diaries really only lacks from those shows in two places: dialogue (which is a pretty glaring one, but you can't have everything) and production value (which is to be expected, since the other shows just have more money to spend)."
40,"This is like watching a train smash in slow motion. You know exactly what is going to happen, because this train is running on big strong tracks, with scheduled stops, and no unexpected deviations.The characters are ""teenagers"" ... that interact with an impeccable middle aged rebellion. Perfectly premeditated dialog, illogical, witty, sarcastic, yet politically correct, emancipated, well adjusted, mature, innocent, naive, but profoundly wise, teenagers.The dialog is expositional and rhetorical. In other words its a continuous and contrived data dump, which often concentrates on describing what is happening or has just happened. As a result it lacks authenticity.These ""teenagers"" party hard & drink excessively ... without getting drunk ... only to engage in a life threatening well coordinated fist fight, and an apex of exchanging heartfelt declarations of love and bedtime cuddles. The characters all have an unlimited capacity for gullibility in addition to unlimited funds for new cars.It's cliché. In every sense. Contrived, coincidental and uninspired. Like elevator music.I have NEVER watched a TV series with so many personal apologies, and absolution of fault. This is the most common dialog pattern. ""I ... I, can't do it because I am confused ... I am so sorry. I am a bad person"", ""Don't say that. It wasn't your fault, you mustn't blame your self. You did it because you really care."", ""But I'm such a loner, and nobody understands me"", ""Whatever, like, maybe you are ... sorry I'm a douche"", ""It wasn't your fault ..."" (step and repeat x 22 episodes x 45 minutes x 5 seasons)If you want to watch original ideas for this genre here are some of my favourites: LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2008 Swedish) THIRST (2009), 30 DAYS of NIGHT (2007), NOSFERATU (1922)"
41,"This show is good in the beginning where the characters who are supernatural (vampire, werewolf, witch, etc.) must hide this from the normal people of the town, constantly covering up, making excuses, etc. at the same time as they deal with supernatural threats. But as time goes, everybody either become supernatural or knows about it and works together with the supernaturals. Then all the plots are about this and everyday life of the characters is unimportant. It's all about threat A can only be solved with item B, so you must go to C to get it from D. Then a few parties are thrown in, and that's it. But season 1 to 4 is worth watching. So per season I would give: Season 1: 8 Season 2-4: 7 Season 5-6: 4"
42,"Take your average Dawson Creek schmutz and toss a few vampires into the vapid teenage drama and you've got yourself the series. Even less substantial than the Twilight series, if that was even conceivable. All the girls are débutante dolls and all the guys are GQ models with plucked eyebrows...none of which have any depth beyond their overlying makeup and impeccable hairstyles. All this being said, I'm sure the series is wildly popular. Which is more than a little sad. And fundamentally why the world will be destroyed *chuckle*...not because of our inherent diabolical evil-ness (even that would be interesting, at least)....but more because of our burgeoning and mind numbing idiocy"
43,"This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The ""Scream"" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, ""Why can't it be now???!!!"" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)"
44,"For many years, I have heard controversial things about this show. Not to say that Pretty Little Liars is the same as this, but I loved PLL, surprisingly. I am not picky. Although I don't enjoy watching vampires, all I really need is a good storyline and for it to remain some what entertaining through the seasons. This is SO long!! Every single episode is so drawn out. It's like watching the grass grow! Several times over the years, I have given this show a good try. I even got half way through season 1 by force, and just gave up at the end. Maybe I'm too old for it now? Who knows? But I know it's honestly the most overrated thing I have ever watched. The only thing I can really say is that the soundtrack is some what good. Maybe I'm just too old; and some teens just like looking at the actors and don't care about the storyline. Unfortunately, this was the last straw that broke the camels back today. Gave this a good try, hit and a miss. Overrated and so long. Why oh why. It dosent have to be this way...."
45,"It happened on Sunday, September 13th 2009. We thought we were safe. We thought they were gone. But we were wrong. So very wrong. For now, every Sunday, they will descend upon us. ItsitsTeen Angst!!! The CW's adaptation of L.J. Smith's teen vampire saga ""The Vampire Diaries"" is awful. I have never read her books so I can not say they are necessarily bad, but as a television show it should canceled. The problems with this show are endless so will just explain the weakest areas.The bad acting is scarier than any vampire. Our lead actress is some unknown Degrassi High reject named Nina Dobrev who handles her role as the emotionally stunted Elena with the subtlety of a dump truck. Her acting is reminiscent of a bad high school play. I kept waiting for her to turn to the camera and wave to her mom and dad. The other two leads, Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley, allow all their Soap Opera training to shine. That's not a compliment so stop smiling. Somerhalder reminds me of a less talented Rob Lowe and poor Wesley is more boy band than bloodsucker. The surrounding cast is all pretty much the same. So pretty, so hot, so untalented and vapid. Even the characters that are meant to have soul are annoying and whiny. It's like the producers said how many EMO kids can we fit in a scene? Of course all the blame can't be put on these poor kids. Look at the writing they have to work with. With stellar lines like ""I predict the dark times are over"" and ""Pete Wentz wants his nail polish back"" how could this show not win an Emmy award. Again, not a compliment, being sarcastic. Kevin Williamson took all his powers of channeling teen angst and shoved some fangs on it and is trying to make us eat it. Well screw that, I'm ordering pizza. The show has no reality behind at all. I've heard that when doing fantasy that's over the top, then you have to go all the away. Williamson stops half way. He wants us to see real teens with fantasy creatures. Real teens? Are kidding me? This is just bunch of twenty-something's playing teenagers who drink, smoke, party and have wild sex. Teens that are all allowed coffee for breakfast. Teens that all look like the cover of Seventeen magazine. Teens who party with beer and drugs at some unguarded landmark. And where are all the adults? The only adults are a teacher who pops in now and again to ""school"" the kids on the town's mysterious history and an Aunt who looks like she's the same age as the school kids. It's like watching One Dawson's Party of Five Creek Hill. With a bit of Vampire tossed in. The storyline of Elena's parents dying and she and her brother now being ""raised"" by her Aunt is cliché. The only thing that makes it a worse plot line is that Stefan is touting the exact same sob story. You kind of get the feeling that Williamson said ""look how popular it is to have Vampires I need to have some too"". If Vampire's are the new it accessory for writers then this show is like a designer knockoff bought on Canal Street.Now as I said I have not read the books by Smith so I am not sure if she really wrote her characters like this. I did however do a bit of cliffs notes style research and found many discrepancies. For example the town is actually called Fell's Church, a name which is very important I understand plot wise. But the show is Mystic Falls, cheese factor of 100. From what I gather Elena, who by the way is a blonde blue eyed cheerleader type in the book but a brown haired sad girl on the show, is the one who chases Stefan. He refuses for most of the first book. The show has them together by episode one. I do not know the reason for these changes, but I feel they have contributed to the many reasons this show is bad.Usually in my reviews I look for at least one redeeming quality in the show or movie. Sadly I have none. I have hopes for the rest of the fall line-up but this show is definitely strike one.No Stars"
46,"Just wanted to say how much I hate this series. My girlfriend is obsessed with it, but I just cannot suspend my own disbelief enough to take it for anything more than bad acting, terrible plot and cheesy cast. True blood was bad enough but at least that had a bit of backbone, this is just bottom of the barrel viewing. Guys I really do feel sorry for you if like me your significant other has discovered this series. Producers should get off the whole vampire bandwagon, it's been done by many and much much better. I bet the producers are probably thinking up their next masterpiece. It will probably be called the ""pencil trolls of the night"". The pilot will be about a girl who gets a pencil troll from their teacher, that then comes to life after midnight and starts writing cryptic messages. It takes a few episodes for her to discover that the messages are actually from her late great grandmother who it turns out...was a vampire!!"
47,"I watched episode 1 and wasn't really a fan. It was like models galore in a high school. Where are the normal everyday school kids. Every Buffy fan would know that they had a few attractive people in it but not the whole high school. If you are a young teenager, you might like it. I found it very silly actually, not suspenseful, intriguing, haven't drawn to any of the characters, you know in Buffy how characters had there quirks, they were funny yet very likable, It is like 90210 and Melrose Place meet two gorgeous looking vampires. One good, one bad. Oh and yes, haven't found one of the actors with much acting talent either. Don't expect this show to last long. Great concept in wake of the Twilight series but poorly carried out."
48,"This is my favourite serie of all times !
In the end I felt part of the family. This series made me go through all the possible feelings and taught me many lessons."
49,"Seriously you're wasting your time. I gave it a chance, even though it's on the CW. It takes a cool subject, vampires, and completely waters it down for young people. The actors are horrible, they're simply there for looks, and the script was probably written by a bunch of over caffeinated readers of Teen People.If you like vampires, go watch True Blood.On the other hand, if you're into soap operas, and the whole ""OMG he said, she said, she likes him, but he likes the other one who already has a boyfriend although she's been getting kind of sick of him recently so she's leading him on even though it probably won't be going anywhere and so her best friend finds out and blah blah blah"" kinda shows, then go ahead and watch."
50,"I just love TV shows or movies about vampires (the good ones at least). When I heard and read about The Vampire Diaries my first thought was ""Nice another show about vampires, I can hardly wait"".But after I had watched the first pilot/first episode I quickly changed my mind. It was way to mush of a romantic drama then I had initially anticipated. But I thought what the heck Il give it another try and watch the second episode. But that didn't help :( The dialog is quite bad and filled with so mush teen cliché that it made me sick. And who come Kevin Williamson and the network cant find actors who has the rig th look or even the right age to be playing teens. Steven R. McQueen who is playing Jeremy is to portray a 15 year old boy (IRL Steven is 22) he don't even look close to 15. The exact same thing goes for all the cast. To portray people who are 18 or 19 you cant use actors who are in the age span of 25-31. Its not right, do the network think that their viewers are stupid? All in all not a good show, Im extremely disappointed!"
51,"The worst pile of drivel I've ever watched. I love vampire stories, old style like Drac & Nosferatu, new style like Blade and Underworld, comedy vampires like Johnny Depp in Dark Shadows and Leslie Nielsen in whatever the heck that film was called but I was totally thrown by shopping vampires. My other half is a massive fan of the show and as such I've watched most of them. I don't know where to start on how bad this show really is. If it was called 'Vampires 90210' it might have made sense since no-one has actually written in a diary for about 3 seasons now. OK, the cast - I've no idea who cast the Salvatore brothers but I'm under the impression they've never actually had a scary moment in their entire life. I'd be more afraid of my 8 year old daughter than that pair. Having been forced through the various guises of Nina Dobrev I've a note for non vampire diaries watchers. If her hair has changed, she's supposed to be somebody else.Tyler, (according to my other half) - He's rubbish but he's fit.Sponsorship - Oh you've got a smart-phone that your sponsors gave you. That's nice, could you just leave it on screen and get out of the way. You might as well since it is the star of the scene normally.Also, what's the deal with killing just about every character in the show just to bring them back in the next episode? I'm guessing the 'deal' is a lack of imagination in the script. At a script meeting - ""Any ideas yet? Nope. Let's just kill someone. What about their contracts? It's OK, they'll be back next week!""Do they not get tax breaks for filming outside the U.S? All these creatures from all over history and they all live in the U.S? Don't forget the Roma gypsies from... can you guess? That's right Romania, U.S.A.!"
52,"Vampire Diaries is almost the exact same as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The story,friendships,mission, almost all of it is from Buffy. I've watched Vampire Diaries first then I watched Buffy. Might I say ,buffy was way better. In my opinion, I liked the whole originality of Buffy where Vamps are vulnerable to sunlight, can get staked, holy water, the whole sha-bang. Some examples of similarities, Buffy-Elena (though buffy can kick her behind any day), Angel-Stefan (the ""good"" vamps that likes the main girl), Willow-Bonnie (main girls bestie who happens to be both witches, Willow can smite bonnie any day), Spike-Damon (bad/good both interested in main girl) and many other similarities. I was so disappointed when I found this out. If you truly like Vamp Diaries I suggest you also watch Buffy the Vamp Slayer. You will find it very much the same."
53,"After experiencing Alan Ball's amazingly creative series about vampires on HBO, I approached this with some excitement as I enjoy vampire tales. Sad to say, based on the first three episodes, the series is woefully devoid of any originality or inspiration. It plays like any one of the CW's teen angst series. It's infantile, badly written, and dreadfully dull.STORY LINE: Very run of the mill. At least Twilight had interesting characters. The supposed teenage girls in the series are your typical lot of vacuous mental lightweights. They were obviously cast for their looks as opposed to any Thespian ability. The two brothers are better, but after one episode they are so predictable, it's laughable. And who write's this stuff. It plays like a Grade C, low budget horror movie. The lines are trite and barely plausible. The story line so far could have been written by a third grader. No, I take that back. There are third graders who could do better. Even the directing is bad; episodes drag badly and Ian Somerhalder pops of the same way every time. It's not scary and worse, it's not alluring or interesting. There's not a whit of real fancy or fantasy.ATMOSPHERE: The show really doesn't have a particularly creative atmosphere unless you count a few CGI effects and fog rolling in every time something sinister is going to happen; how cliché is that! Twilight had terrific art direction, as does Trueblood. SOUNDTRACK: I suppose the target audience (teenieboppers) like the endless and annoying soundtrack of rock and pop songs. Again, it's indistinguishable from all the other CW teen shows. This crappy music has become boilerplate with these shows. Don't bother telling an interesting story; just pummel the TV audience with a noisy song track. The sound editor should be shot! The songs were so loud in the pilot, that you could barely hear the dialogue. The music in Trueblood is inspired; in the Vampire Diaries it's just schlock and it gets in the way.VAMPIRE MYTHOS: There is nothing new, interesting, or particularly creative here. The Ann Rice novels are masterpieces compared to this. Twilight was vastly superior. Vampire Diaries has absolutely nothing new to say about vampires; Gilmore Girls meet the cute vamps. Ugh!What's truly distressing is that a network like the CW caters to the lowest possible common denominator. If HBO can produce something so rich and appetizing, why is the CW content to feed our teenagers this steady diet of trash! Very depressing! Maybe something will develop in future episodes, but unless a new writing team, new director and some new actors are brought in, I don't hold out much hope."
54,"Yes 5 star out of 10 for first 2 seasons But sadly the 3rd season ruined it all When I started to follow the TVD and saw the first season I was eager to watch next season and that too was as good as first one but After seeing 3rd season I think its time to say goodbye to TVD I am a huge fan of Supernatural series and after 8 season still this series is best series in its genre because We still care for its two main lead characters and justify all their actions But Here in TVD 3rd season 1- they just don't want to kill any one , I mean how stupid its sounds that almost in every episode there is a seen where Damon Salvatore and his brother easily can kill or let the Klaus evil sister killed but they saved her for no good reason and in very next scene she is giving death threat to Elena or someone Innocent .... and believe me there are 100 of scenes like that2- In many Situations Elena did not let Klaus die because someone innocent will die with him , I mean come on ,from the starting Every Vampire character killed lots of innocent guys and Our main Hero brothers killed them 3- The all main lead characters only care for themselves , and in almost every 30 minuets one Innocent guy or girl died by one of their hands but no one give a damn ,4-And the story in 3rd season become so self centered that don't know why I just hope that every one of them die and go to hell including Elena In the end Pardon for my cheap and faulty English and if you already watched the 3rd season I don't need to tell you this :D"
55,"Everything about this series was great love, brotherhood,anger, urge and everything seemed real!! Really sad it's over but still everything has a end. But the journey was great!!"
56,"Is this TV show Terrible? No, I have seen worse. However, the TV show will hang on to cheap emotional thrills and Hot actors and will repeat this trick for 7 next seasons. People losing their memories, who they really are, what their motives are as fodder to keep repeating scenes and repeating actors that represent themselves 100s of years ago. The show has a real rubberband effect where anything can happen for the sake that nothing can happen cause It can be fixed no matter how bad it was that happened. Unlike other shows with a realistic ground where characters leave for good, this one will find a way to bring them back. So, even though the acting is decent and the actors are hot, what good is the premise if you have to Take everything with the smallest grain of salt."
57,"For someone who has read all 5 books, and just finished the first episode, I have to say I am very disappointed. Elena is supposed to be blonde with blue eyes, Bonnie a short redhead, there's supposed to be a Merideth, Caroline is supposed to be a sex goddess type, and Elena has a younger sister, not brother. there are so many things wrong with the show that I cannot believe that L.J smith approved this. If I had never read the books i would have loved it, but having been a huge fan of the books, I was expecting more, way more. I was so excited about this show when i heard it was going to be a show, and now after seeing it I'm very disappointed. they changed everything about the books, and I'm sceptical that the series will be any good."
58,"I watched it, wanting to like it as I have been a fan of vampires and Anne Rice since 1993 (I was 10), probably around the same year that most of the tweens that adore Twilight because they have never read Anne Rice and have no idea what a quality vampire story is were born. I wanted to like it, but I didn't. The acting was horrible, the script was so full of clichés we've seen a million times in teen movies, the CW is headed towards failure. Since when is 4 million viewers for a episode a hit for a network? Ian Somerhalder went from the A-list quality show 'Lost' to this? Also, it's obvious the CW is just riding the bandwagon since as others have pointed, they changed the character of Elena to basically the same character as the lead girl in Twilight, they bought the name 'Vampire Diaries', but it was just a name, because what they did was tweak the story to make it more like Twilight since they knew that that was popular, and like gullible tweens will be gullible tweens who will follow any trend blindly since they don't know any better, it worked like a charm. I recommend anybody with a brain of any age (that means you tweens!) to read Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, and even watch the movie with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. And afterwards, you'll never like Twilight or this horrible show ever again..."
59,"This has to be the worst piece of crap I have ever seen in my life! If you have even half a brain in your head then u will not like this show. It is horribly adapted from a really well written series of books. For starters, they changed the lead character to a brunette when she is supposed to be blonde. Then there is the fact that in stead of a little sister of 6 or 7 she has a younger brother that is also in high school. Not to mention that her best friend bonnie is supposed to be a curly redheaded Irish girl. But I would have to say the worst part about the whole thing is that they have turned this incredible series of books(which were written first) into knock off of Twilight. Which by the way was not that great of a movie either! It's just really sad that people want to jump on the Twilight bandwagon and by doing so are taken what could have been a great show and dragging thru the mud. This series will be lucky if it survives the couple of episodes let alone a whole season!"
60,"After watching this show, I had to decide what audience the writers were reaching out to. Obviously, the high-school drama hell that they portray in this show is absolutely void to all those who live in the real world now. So, I assume that this is a show for hormone pumping teens. However, after watching, I was ashamed at the lack for morals in society. I was excited when I first saw the show being previewed. I thought,""Wow! Finally something I can watch with my 13yr old daughter!"" Well, then I watched the show. Casual sex, drugs, and alcohol are not normal high-school behaviors! I would not dream of portraying these as acceptable teen behavior but the Vampire Diaries sure does! I realize that most shows today have these elements. I just find it unfortunate that the barrier between teen and adult has been broken. It seems that it is not abnormal for something to be proclaimed ""teen"" but then be taken to a level where it is grossly too mature. I send extreme caution to parents: Your children are influenced by what they watch!!"
61,"This *may* contain a few spoilers. But I am doing you a favor, BELIEVE ME!OK, the first and second seasons are ""watchable"", painful, but if you are stuck high up in the mountains in a cabin with 10 feet of snow blocking your way, yeah, these two seasons could be of some use, it may help you fall asleep in that hard to sleep situation.ANYTHING after that is incredibly awful. I believe the Mafia could use this show to torture information out of people. 20 minutes watching this and anyone in their correct state of mind would confess anything. Aside from some eventual good acting guests, the acting is putrid. Worse than a bad high school play where the actors are all high on expired acid. The plot, well let's just say 5 year old children could unveil it with easy.The characters are all students of John Mcclane, and they all belong to a family of highlanders: THEY NEVER REALLY DIE. They die, then they come back, then they die, then they come back. A train smash them into pieces, then they come back. Their heads are chopped off, then easily reattached... AND THEY COME BACK. And after they die 500 times, and get their heads chopped off, and a train smash then into pieces, and they get cremated and their ashes sent to the moon, their spirits come back, and then they just ""jump"" into another body, and there they are... BACK! A 50 ULTRATON Plasma Tesseract Hydrogen bomb couldn't kill them.HORRIBLE show!!! In this show, the rain is sugar. Because of this show I now get really bad ear infections every time I hear the words Elena, Stefan or Damon, and is followed by a uncontrollable urge to puke. Don't laugh, it is not funny, it really hurts. The drinking blood from a blood bag all the time is so lame I have not words to describe it. Then there is the uber mega pro super master giga lame ""turning humanity off"" thingy. Daemon is bad, now he's good, now he's bad, now he's good, yet again he is bad... wait there is more, now he's good. Helena is good, now she is bad, now she is good, now she is bad. Stefan is goody, now he's bad, now he's good, and bad, now he's the ripper (no not the grimm one), but now guess, he's good................. SO LAME! The lamest thing I ever saw in my entire life. To give you an idea of how this is lame, well, remember the lame moment at end of the movie Rocky when Stallone started to yell ""Adria... Adriaa"" after winning the fight? Well get that lame thing, multiply by the number of atoms in the entire universe, which I believe is 10 to the 82 power and still, you'll not get even close.Also an advise to parents, people in this show are ALL HEAVY alcoholics. And they induce kids into this junk (of course kids mimic their ""heroes""). They put these characters drinking at 10AM on a Tuesday like it's OK. It's like: The dude died, let's drink. The dude got married, let's drink, I got a haircut, let's drink, I just cleaned my house, let's drink, you shaved your armpit, let's drink, I picked my nose let's drink, I picked your nose, double that! Disgusting!Resuming, a total waste of perfect good time!! Unfortunately there is no negative rate here, I just wish I could give this show a -1000 rate, or that congress passed a bill to outlaw this show anywhere in the Solar System. This show is so boring I could easy use it to make all mosquitoes flee my room at night, but then I could risk never waking up, EVER. Don't watch it. Or watch it and suffer the consequences. Just remember my ear infection problem."
62,"The vampire diaries stinks. The originals are no longer the enemies of the show. Really? Klaus had been doing horrible things to everyone in the show. He killed and tortured many of Elena's friends and then Caroline fall for him. He has his own show and he is still the bad guy. Every character in the vampire diaries keeps taking turns on who is the bad guy and it gets confusing. Everyone cheers for the bad guys in the show. You can no longer tell which one is the bad guy. Pick one and stick with it.When I first started watching the vampire diaries, the main villain was Damon. I hated him for what he had done, but then I started liking him because he is a antihero. Then came Katherine, who I want to kill with my sword. Every time I see her, I want to throw something to the computer. She began to be the new villain and then came Klaus and the originals making Katherine the heroes ally. What? Then they had to keep the originals alive because if you do kill them, all the other vampires die including our main characters. Stefan became the villain at the beginning of season 3. Then Jeremy, Alaric, Tyler, Bonnie, and then Elena. Basically, everything in this show takes turns being the villain. What is the deal here? Elena, oh my god is so annoying. When she was human, she cared about everyone and helps them fight the bad guys. As she became a vampire, she was bonded to Damon and then turned into a bad guy as her brother died. Then her humanity returned and she was still annoying. She loves Damon even though he's a selfish. Elena became selfish as she became a vampire. All she cared about now was defending Damon whatever he does and getting what she wants. The vampire Elena is such a bad guy. I loved her when she was human, but I hate her as a vampire.Nina Dobrev is still my favorite actress and I like Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder. The show has good acting, but horrible story and characters. I don't care about any of them. Actually I really do care, I wanted them all to die. I wanted the Travelers to win and all the characters would die. Then the rest of the show would blank and beautiful."
63,"I seriously thing the CW network hires brainless 12-year-olds to write all their scripts. Well, I guess it saves on the budgets. I think they're spending all their money on CGI and plastic surgery. Otherwise why would they hire 'actors' who can't act and look over 40 when they're playing 'teenagers'. I've watched about a dozen episodes of this one and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has happened except a lot of teen angst. But then that is the network specially and gets them their advertisers. The fact that all their shows appeal to the many brain deficient teenagers in their target audience. Personally I would have turned this one off after the first few episodes, except for the presence of many former gay porn stars. But then they have the 'corporate closet' to keep all the boys. I guess it's run something like the Vatican where they keep all the 'boys' hidden for their priests' consumption. Anyway, the same is true off all their shows, so I shouldn't be surprised this one would be any different. Where is Buffy when you need her?"
64,It's very addictive so plz keep distance form. if you willing watch then go for it . You are going to love it's all characters .. it is something next level of love romance thrill and etc. I am giving it 10 star but it deserves more. if in future there is an option of Infinity the I will go with I infinity of stars. It is something next level dude plz support it... Thnx baa bye!!!!!
65,"I bought the season 1 and 2 DVDs of this show and, boy, am i regretting it, big time!What is up with Ian's facial acrobatics? Is no one, during shooting or post prod, noticing how he's over-over over-overdoing the facial stuff just to try to portray his character? It's really just WAY too much. Can anyone tell me if he still does this in season 2,3 and now 4?So many scenes where they're talking about supposed super secret stuff with people just about a meter away from them? The witch friend wanting to perform some witchcraft crap IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL with so many students around!?!? Seriously?Vampires, who can be stealthy and super-fast got taken down and rounded up by 1864 townsfolk THAT easily? In an era where you can be burned at the stake for being a witch, be beheaded just for adultery etc, they round up the vampires and that's it? They don't kill them?!Good God... Just writing about the idiotic things this show has dished out in a few episodes is draining... And i have so many more still to write but i won't do it anymore.And to think i'm very easy to please. An okay story and an okay dialog is fine with me. If the characters are played by good-looking people, all the easier for me to forgive some idiocy in a show. But, this show... Oh, boy...I'm struggling to finish season 1. I'm still in episode 20. I'm really regretting my purchase of the 2 seasons of this show.This is making Twilight look like a masterpiece."
66,"Oh, God why. I was never into watching series but i gave it a try. I liked the first season, mainly because i liked Damon (THAT Damon, not the one in this current season). It used to be fun to watch, even though i don't like Elena because every main character in that kind of stories is like her. She's boring and flat. Damon was the only one who made the show interesting but the writers decided to ruin him too. The only thing i like about this season is the Original family, everything else gives me the cramps. Why 22 episodes if nothing ever happens? Seriously, make it 12 like True Blood because it's tiresome. The whole dark theme doesn't work when the lines are cheesy and the characters carry that mournful expression in every episode, especially the three main characters. Some need acting lessons too while others try too hard. It's almost the end of this season and yet nothing has happened. Stefan left, he became evil, Elena drove me insane with her stubbornness to find him, she kissed with Damon ( whom SHE WILL NEVER CHOOSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST HAPPENED TO WAKE UP THE FANS), the originals caused trouble and that's it. Boo. I don't think i'll be watching season 4. I suffered enough."
67,"I honestly thought this was going to be better than Twilight, but it unfortunately turns out the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Surprisingly, there's even some similarities between the two (Stefan and Edward look and act alike, there's a love triangle that's supposed to happen, it mixes ""vampire"" stories with high school ""drama"", the ""vampires"" barely even act like such, many girls from the high school think Stefan ""is so dreamy!"", and Stefan and Elena were dating during the first few episodes even though they knew very little about each other).The only reason I watched the first 10 episodes of this garbage is because my friend got me thinking of giving it a chance. After the first episode, I was concerned about any hope I had this show. From what was already established, the main female lead, Alena, is only interested in the male lead, Stefan, because of how studly he looks. Because of this, she, in a really dumb way, gives him permission to stalk her. Two underlying problems with this episode is not only is he not nocturnal (like real vampires are), but he also passes himself off as a teenager still in high school (despite being a 160 year old ""vampire""). The more episodes I watched, the more problems began to occur. Alena and Stefan start dating at the end of the second episode, and have sex literally in the next episode (which is disgusting to watch because of how bad of a ""couple"" they are). I think by the 5th episode, Alena decides to break up with Stefan because she doesn't feel safe being a part of his world. That unfortunately doesn't last long, due to the two inconsistently agreeing to stay away from each other, but then crawling back to one another a few scenes later. Meanwhile, Stefan epically fails at practically every attempt to stop his evil, and full of himself, brother, Damon, from biting, attacking, and killing innocent people (the only time you can even call Damon a real vampire). Really, despite everything that Damon does, Stefan could easily kill him, but there are several times where he decides to let him live. There's even times where other characters try to kill him, and Stefan ruins it by letting him live! If Damon was finally put down, a lot of the problems would be solved! There's actually a part in one of the episodes, where Stefan was able to steal the ring Damon needs in order to survive in the sunlight (which doesn't make a whole lot of sense), but rather than allowing Damon to burn in the sunlight a few hours later, he obediently gives it back. I also remember a part where Stefan is shot pretty badly with a wood bullet, and Damon saves him, telling him ""the only person who would enjoy killing you is me!"". Although that's quite cynical (I'll admit), throughout the series, he makes all these statements of him being able to kill him, but doesn't go through with doing so. (Speaking of wood bullets, should I also mention that's their only weakness in this show? Holy water is ""drinkable"", garlic is ""edible"", crosses are ""decorative"", and mirrors ""show their reflection"". What kind of vampires are these?) So when the brothers aren't hating each other and having sissy fights, they act brotherly and decide to chill with one another (completely oxymoronic). Those 3 idiots make the show bad enough, but (just to add in some more insanity) there's plenty of other terrible characters as well. Practically most of the other (20-30-something year old) ""teenagers"" do is fall asleep in class, then go to parties where there's drinking involved. I'll admit that Alena's brother, Jeremy, eventually becomes a character I can admire because of his observations on a girl he's interested in, but has a boyfriend who doesn't respect her. The only problem I have with Alena's friend, Bonnie, is she insisted that Alena and Stefan to be together during the first two episodes. She later also becomes a decent character, and learning about her background as a witch seemed interesting. Alena's ex-boyfriend Matt was also decent because he cared about his sister, Vicki, not getting hurt. All of the other girls are just annoying bimbos, and all of the guys come off as arrogant. Besides Bonnie's grandmother, the parents or legal guardians are rarely ever around, or even do anything that makes them good role models for their children to follow.On top of all of that, the acting is somewhat better than Twilight's (but still falls short), the subplots are more decent than the general plot (which is surprisingly ironic), the writing is pretty-much terrible, and Damon and Stefan, along with other ""vampires"" in this series, are an insult to real vampires. They don't go to high school, they don't go out in the sunlight or daytime, they don't date humans, they don't cry or get emotional over a recent break-up, they don't brood just to make themselves look dark and cool, and they don't purposely look like cute bad boys. They're dark, predator-like creatures who feast on human blood, operate in the shadows, and maintain a sense of power.In spite of it all, there's actually two funny things about this:1) I created a meme on Open Office that says at the top ""These are vampires"", and it shows pictures of Blade from Marvel Comics, Selene from Underworld, and Bela Lugosi's Dracula. In the middle, it says ""These are practically pretty boys"" and shows Stefan and Damon. The bottom tells you to know the difference.2) I had a dream last night where Selene was standing on a rooftop with a sniper rifle, full of wood bullets, and head-shots both Stefan and Damon. (Greatest happy ending of my life.)In conclusion, please tell anyone you know not to watch this show. They'll completely regret it."
68,"I have very violent wishes,to put it mildly, for the people and the network behind this nauseating rampant hormonic schlockfest... I think it's time we brought out the pitchforks and torches; for such an unabashed pile of Twi'blight, these cultural dope-peddlers should belly-crawl the plank off a skyscraper. Seriously, how can they live with themselves? This is tripe on glitz, 90210 with fangs, undiluted pasteurized heartthrobia in a can. The acting is putrefied at best while the plot should have 'burial' in front of it, and yet, kids will gobble it up in their indoctrinated pursuit of social bling-bling and glam-glam and bang-bang. We owe them something way more substantial, and we can start by getting the dope-peddlers off the airwaves..."
69,"I see why it's on CW,(Crap Watch)TV, it started off weak and hasn't really gone anywhere, i was trying to like it because i like Vampire shows, but this, is cheesy, i see they tried to throw some eye candy heart throbs on it to get some attention, but between the extremely poor acting, bad writing, bad location i don't know if i can punish myself any longer.. I dozed off on much of the show and reversed it back to see what i missed, and it turns out it's a bunch of useless, pointless dialog, And why the guys all look like they have the same makeup and hair designers as the one's on Twilight? is this suppose to try and pull Twilight's audience while it's hot and almost concluded? Try again.. All the females i know have went on to Tru Blood which is absolutely one of the best Vampire and supernatural shows i've ever laid eyes on. I got in on that show late because i thought it was another cliché' show made to show sex scene's with Vampires (Which HBO does try and do sometimes), turns out i was wrong with my perception glad i got into it in the first season even if it was toward the end, now im hooked..This show should be on Nickelodeon, not taking up valuable airtime on a network trying to make it in the big media market.. And they really need to change locations, OMG!! Vampires in a cookie cutter suburban town? Give Vampires more credit than this pleeaseeee! This was made to be teenie bopperish/90210ish.. This Lisa Jane Smith Novel series was OK but to write screen plays for it? What are you thinking!?? Pull this show quick!"
70,"When I started to watch it, I had a minor hope that this could lead into a fun series about bloodthirsty vampires, guess I was wrong again.The last few years have spawned numerous offshoots about the new incarnation of the humanized loving handsome undead that seem to have manifested itself as the final incarnation of the centuries old vampire myth. I am somehow afraid the genre will die with this generation of pansies dressed in black that fall in love with high school girls. Dracula would rather stake himself than watch this garbage.there where shows, books and other media that showed vampires more humanized but clearly it wasn't as dumbed down and naive until twilight came along. the movie was an awful adaption of an equally awful book series. It was a major success, oddly enough.Everything fell apart. TV producers tried to cash in on this pop phenomena called twilight. Moonlight, True Blood and this garbage called Vampire Diaries have the same premise and main story arc. A loving humanized vampire. Romance before everything, some action thrown into the mix to not bore the male viewers entirely.True, the shows vary a lot in their core themes as well, obviously they deal with vampires but that is not it. I guess the fable of a mortal falling in love with the undead is the common thread between all these story adaptations. It gets on my nerves. In Bram Stoker's Dracula Novel, the main protagonist Mina Harker was merely seduced by the dark vampiric powers of the count himself, she didn't love him because she chose too. Still, I see a pattern emerging here.While in true blood it's working because we got other outlandish beings thrown into the mix and the story arcs are actually well thought off and not so one dimensional(for the most part, the show has other problems though). In Vampire Diaries it's simply not enough.Annoying Soft rock music blasts at the viewer almost every minute.The main characters are incredibly wooden and unconvincing, bare such an awful striking resemblance to the twilight characters and on top off that the plot is also so similar in its setting(vampire goes to high school and finds the love of his life, YIKES!) its boring and redundant and i can't stand it one bit.A lousy start for a TV show if you ask me. No gripping story and certainly not enough characters you sincerely care for. The main actor is especially tedious and annoying since He is a cheap Edward Cullen knock off.The original was dreadful already, guess how bad the copy is.who am I kidding, the whole thing is almost a carbon copy of twilight in itself. this based off a book again and makes you wonder if all these novels about cheerleader loving vampires are written by the same person.dwelling deeper into it, casting aside the overall mediocrity and tediousness, there are actual fun elements that makes you least like to glance over the series. We got the eerie mist transformation, we got shape-shifting, the charm spells, that's all traditional vampire lore that I actually like though it is really not enough to save from the rest which is basically Melrose place with vampires.I don't think its gonna get much better so I gave up on it.This series might be aimed at teenagers and housewives, I just take a wild guess here. No pun intended, when i was a teenager I liked to watch that absolutely nobody dared to watch, things like Dario Argento splatter and horror flicks. Not exactly quality stuff either but entertaining and different nonetheless.In Conclusion: Vampire Diaries fails to deliver the goods and reminds me that somebody wanted to shamefully cash in on the twilight hype and make a quick buck. It's unimaginative and without any interesting new ideas. It feels you have been watching the same show for a million times and because of this you don't feel attached to it.I wouldn't recommend it and I hope in the future we can finally see bloodsuckers that we fear. Vampires that scare you, who are not nice. A show based on the characters as seen in Near Dark would be perfect. at least they were truly horrifying repentant monsters and not those pansypires that everyone seems to love now."
71,"after a decent first few episodes, oh boy does this show get bad.The reason the show is terrible is not because its characters are witless, supermodel buffy clones. It is terrible because it insults its viewers again and again - even if they don't realize they are being insulted.Let's start with this: at least 4-5 times per season, a main character will die, and this death will be played up as major tragedy. There will be emotional breakdowns, tears, sad music, the works.Here's the problem: they aren't dead. It starts as a simple explanation: She died with vampire blood in her, so she'll come back; he has a ring that conveniently brings him back to life (and, wow, this ring really makes the rounds; just about every ""human"" character in the show has been killed while wearing it at least once or twice) But over time, it becomes more and more ridiculous: The novice witch can bring you back to life! A sacrifice can bring you back! Those vampires are SOOPER vampires; you need a special dagger to kill them; Wait, we were wrong, the special dagger won't actually KILL them, just put them to sleep; wake em up later by removing the dagger if you wish. If you have a tattoo, you can come back, cuz that makes you soopernatural, woot! There is actually an arc in the show where the brother, Jeremy, who has already died I think 4 times (very tragically) and been brought back because of a ring, dies, and it's REALLY tragic! But wait! Bonnie brings him back, only to kill herself in the process. It's really tragic! There's a funeral with tears.....But wait! She gets to come back a few episodes later! Because in this show.......NOBODY is going to die! But that won't stop us from tugging on your dramatic heart strings! There's another scene (probably the most ridiculous to date), where a char has been shot, and he is dieing. However, he is wearing the ""come-back-to-life ring"". However, the ring only works if a soopernatural creature has killed him, and he didn't see the shooter, so he can't be sure if they were soopernatural or not. So the lead actress must actually take a knife and stab him to make sure that he is killed by a soopernatural creature (she is, after all, a (DERP) doppleganger!), so that they can be sure he comes back to life a bit later.I don't know if its an indication of how terrible dramatic writing is being taught in school these days, or if the viewing audience is just too slow to see these writing techniques as what they are: deus ex machinae, and fundamental betrayals of the audience. Why should we ever CARE about ANY character, when everyone dies every few episodes, but they ALL get to come back in the end?? Other easy-to-use writing contraptions and contrivances used in this show: vampire blood cures all wounds; vampire strength is tied directly to how old they are, so anytime we need a bigger badder big bad, we can just make an older one; vampires can compel anyone to think anything they want; wait, put a drop of vervane in your drinking water, cuz that conveniently stops them from compelling, or even biting you (vervane burns their tummies!); of course vampires can walk in the day! they all have rings that even a novice witch can easily make for anyone that wants; anyone ""soopernatural"", which, btw, is 99% of the cast, is able to be brought back to life cuz when they die, they enter some mystic world.And now, best of all, we have been introduced to a bad guy that can take the form of whomever he wants, AND control the mind of anyone he wants. Get it?? that way you can never be SURE who is good or bad!! Clever!! Right??? And how can he do this? cuz he's not just a vampire, like season one, or a hybrid vampire/werewolf, like season two, but he's a hybrid vampire/super witch! And even though the novice witch already inexplicably killed him by randomly turning him to stone (where did she learn that one? we'll never know), don't worry, he's back within the next two episodes. Tune in next episode, where they successfully kill him with a taco, although after he comes back for the 3rd time, we learn the taco needs guacamole on it.Avoid this show. Watch buffy instead."
72,"i enjoy almost all kinds of supernatural drama, moonlight, medium, true blood, supernatural..... and vampire diaries is one of them. i have only read book 1 and 2 but can already see that the story on TV has been rewritten and be frank, it is much better than the book. good adaption should be like this, as well as true blood.the other thing i like is the music. great choice that goes with the story and emotion. casting is great too, good acting. each episode reveals something new or an unexpected twist that keeps you stay tune. people who are making the movie of the twilight saga should refer to this, a very good example to show what works and what doesn't."
73,"I was kind of excited about this show (this type of thing is great for those days when you want to watch and NOT think :) ) but it left me feeling.. nothing, really. It is incredibly slow-paced, with poor acting (except for Ian Somerhalder, of course) and terribly boring characters (again, Ian Somerhalder's Damon excepted - though even he was a bit too much at times) - you have the morally upright, I-must-do-the-right-thing passive-aggressive heroine, the tormented hero, the stupid best friends and a bunch of adults so stupid and incapable of anything that it's really tragic. Add an illicit relationship or two, some bad parenting..and that's it, really. But even all of these ingredients that are so typical for teen series aren't so bad as to make the show impossible to watch. It's really the fact that NOTHING EVER HAPPENS - and when something does happen (like, a major discovery or the heroine being placed into yet another life-threatening situation) it's sure to last for at least two episodes. I watched the entire first season, only because I believe in giving everything a zillion chances - but I didn't bother with the second season. The way I see it, it can only get worse."
74,"So I tried watching this because I was so tired of what cw has been producing so far- rich kids being rich. Wow, I was really wrong. This is even worse than Gossip Girl. I don't know if it's the actors or the script that's terrible. Everything they say is so incredibly dry and boring. There's nothing witty or intelligent. The dialog is unbelievably cheesy. I know this isn't supposed to be funny, but must everything be so unnaturally serious? The characters are flat and boring, with the exception of the evil guy, and he's only interesting because he's evil. Maybe he should have been the main character. It's almost impossible to feel sorry for Elena because she shows no emotion at all. She should have stayed on Degrassi. If you want to watch a good quality show, do not watch this. If you want to watch something mindless, still do not watch this. I struggled to finish watching it because I was falling asleep."
75,"My score for the seasons 1 to 4 would be something like 6-7 not more not less... And that's because of the originals and the ""almost good"" love triangle (in the begging,not farther) But, oh boy...! I am so fed up with Elena's face in every scene... Elena keeps going forth and back. The situation with the dopplegangers it's really sad. We keep watching same faces and story over and over again.And the most of the times for no bloody reason. The love story became something more than boring. This show has no action,no passion,not even STORY! It's just like I am watching a love story of a 13 year old girl who don't know what to decide between 2 boys of her classroom. Totally no horror nor drama nor ""fantasy"". I am dropping it, I had enough of this bad written series"
76,"First of all i read other reviews, and took the ""watch a couple of episodes, before judging it"" under advisement. Here is what i think about it after watching the first season: The show has a few good things about it. Damon is by far the coolest thing about this show. I really liked his ""Im immortal"" arrogance, and his kick ass attitude. Another good thing about the show is... Well thats about it. The Vampire Diaries, has the weakest vampires i've ever seen. I mean come on, a human with a stake can easily take them out. A FREAKING Average HUMAN! Yes, they are fast, yes, they are strong, but they are completely lacking in that vampire awareness, i love about vampires, you know, the almost predicting stuff that is going to happen, combined with super reflexes. I found the main character Elena to be annoying as hell. She is kinda good looking but her stupid unbelievable face-expressions, makes her freaking intolerant. The show has too much focus on drama and talking, than events of the supernatural. I give this show a 3, below average, because i felt like i'd wasted time and money on this crap. Another thing, the cliff-hangers of this show, don't make you do, what a cliff- hanger is suppose to. You don't get exited and wanna watch the next episode. You just sit there and hoping it gets better, and it DOESN'T. The story is lame, the characters are annoying and weak, and as a vampire fiction lover, you don't get any satisfaction from watching this show. If you really love vampires, you are going to hate this show. If you love drama, emo-characters and general sadness, you are going to love this show. It is made for 14 year old girls, who loved Twilight and want something similar. When you are watching the show, you get the feeling that you sit in a theater, you know, the talking is like, it is being read to you. You also get the feeling that everything is fake, for example, the characters look far older than they are suppose to be in the series.I can't say that i was disappointed, cause i kinda knew that I wasn't going to like it, but hey, I gave it a shot, and it SUCKED. If anyone can tell me it going to get better in season 2, I would gladly give it a try, but if the series is as lame as before, I'm not going to watch it, Because season 1 was a god damn waste of time. They'd had to make some really big improvements for me the watch this show. For example, make the vampires overpowered, like a vampire is suppose to be.I apologize for my spelling and grammar. (English is not my native language)"
77,"I already knew everything would be wrong before i saw the pilot but i have been giving it a chance anyway. Its not good its bland! Nothing is the same from the books except some of the names. People are missing, some are added, some mashed into one, place changed, events not the same. Nothing mysterious. These books began in 1991 and are very detailed in descriptions! I don't get what was difficult to adapt? If they can make a whole season of true blood from one 200 page book and have it be amazing, whats so hard in taking a 311 page book with detailed descriptions and events and putting it on screen. Remove the fangs and its a gloomy 90210. Im only giving it a chance because the author is and i have been a fan for 18 years! But its not a great sign when an author says nothing about it but only""give it a chance"""
78,"The series could be good. It could even be amazing. But my problem with it is the fact that they do the typical American thing of having lots of popular songs overlayed onto the top of the episodes from start to finish when the episode would stand out so much more if the ""music"" was removed.We don't need to here the latest song from James Blunt while we are watching a series about vampires. I'm not watching MTV. It's just not necessary, and it's the main reason why i don't watch a lot of series which could be good otherwise.America ruins it again..."
79,I can bet all the 10/10 ratings were from either girls or 12 years old kids
80,one of the worst shows I've ever seen period.there is so many things wrong with it that i don't have enough space to talk about it but all I'm going to say is save yourself sometime and don't watch it it sucks it sucks its terrible do not watch anything but this i wish i had died before i watched this show.it sucks.it sucks. it sucks it sucks. it sucks. its terrible. its horrible. do not watch.it sucks. it sucks. one of the worst shows I've ever seen period.there is so many things wrong with it that i don't have enough space to talk about it but all I'm going to say is save yourself sometime and don't watch it it sucks it sucks its terrible do not watch anything but this i wish i had died before i watched this show.it sucks.it sucks. it sucks it sucks. it sucks. its terrible. its horrible. do not watch.it sucks. it sucks.
81,"Don't be fooled. If you're expecting another clichéd program to buy into the hype surrounding vampires, you're way off. So off, you're in another state. The Vampire Diaries started off that way though. But with time, and a few episodes, it went places that no other vampire show/movie has gone before. What happens when a whole town knows about vampires, and has done for centuries? It's an interesting premise, and a good place to start a season, and soon the show delves into not just a girl's relationship with a vampire and his brother, but a whole town's history. To say this is the best scripted program on television is being bold, but I only say it because it is the truth. While Glee runs away with the ratings, The Vampire Diaries is probably the best CW show made so far. And it's thanks to Kevin Williamson, who wrote the Scream trilogy, and Dawson's Creek. He returns to TV land in top form here, weaving each character's story around another, including tiny hints for future seasons, until you simply can't predict what happens next. Certainly the latter half of season 1 is where it enters excellent territory, but in saying that, the first half is definitely worth watching but seems more tame compared. The second half seems to know what it wants to be and goes there, adding quite scary scenarios and gruesome effects. This is probably the scariest program on the box, and definitely the most R rated in CW/WB history. Not to mention, has the best twists imaginable! If you're expecting a clichéd romantic vampire world, go and watch Twilight. This is actually better than True Blood and Twilight combined."
82,"I watched The pilot episode and have to say I was very disappointed.I'm going to watch the second episode to see if it improves but I don't care for the acting their are parts that just seem way to cheesy. The actor's aren't exactly the best that they could get.Basically, they hired for looks not skill. I don't mind that they changed some of the details (i.e. Main character has a little brother instead of a sister, or the characters don't look like what they are described in the book). The TV show fails in comparison to Twilight. Which was obviously their target audience. I hope the CW can't make a profit off this show so it is canceled."
83,"It's supposed to be Stephan. This is just bad and takes away time that you could be doing something else or watching something different. Wtf the bad guy are you serious, it's always a drama and it's always bad for the good people, it's not worth it watching it. Arrow it's a way Better show than this it has More action and the girl goes back With the guy she's supposed to be No like this one, it's lost of your time don't bother Watching this show. It makes promises and it lets you down Find something else to watch, why is Elena playing with Stephan like that when he has always done everything for her and Damon has been the bad guy and the killer and she falls for him it is not the way you want things to go but apparently the writer has something else in his mind that it's stupid."
84,"I've recently seen a comment stating that 'The Vampire Diaries' & 'Twilight' are similar..I'm going to say NO! Vampire Diaries is 100% better than Twlight. For starters, vampires don't sparkle in the sun , as they burn if they don't own a daylight ring, two, there's more of a story line and a lot more action. The actors are amazing on both sides but for the female heroine, I'll always adore Nina Dobrev much more. Elena doesn't want to be a vampire as she wanted to live out her life normally and Bella wanted to be a vampire so there's another HUGE difference. However, I do want Stefan & Elena to get back together even though Damon & Elena looked cute together."
85,"*** This review contains spoilers *** Think one of the other reviewers put it best when they mentioned this series as being the illicit child of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Twilight"", perhaps with just a small sprinkle of ""Interview with the Vampire"" to prevent this series from being a total loss. As a general rule, I always get nervous whenever a movie or TV series starts off in a high school setting, and this one doesn't fail to disappoint in that regard. What makes it ironic is that Vampire Diaries is clearly not a teen drama either... I can remember clearly any number of horror/slasher films that in many ways are much tamer than this series from the standpoint of gore and adult orientated content and yet still have an ""R"" rating.The premise itself was promising... a small town on the East Coast where the first vampires were created and having everything come full circle. Admittedly the first two seasons weren't that horrible. Yes, they were playing the teen angst and drama to the hilt, but again there was enough of a vampire story in the background and dark atmosphere to keep things watchable, at least at first. I suppose that what I was ultimately hoping for and the reason I followed things as far as I did was that elements in the story would start to come together and that the series would start living up to its potential. Alas that did not happen... if anything quite the opposite occurred. By the beginning of season three, the story was not only continuously ""jumping the shark"", I think it sprouted wings and flew off to the Sahara desert! The script writing went from mildly interesting in the beginning to outright horrible, and in the process started pulling out some of the lamest plot mechanisms I think I have ever experienced. For example, one of the characters is turned into a vampire against her will, and her homosexual father comes home after many years to use torture as aversion therapy by chaining her up in a dungeon and exposing her to sunlight. Then after that when her father is killed off a couple of episodes later, she emotionally goes to pieces over it. Good God people, is Hollywood really becoming that desperate for decent script writers? Can definitely say that after reading some of the Night World stories that I seriously doubt that this is what Lisa Jane Smith had envisioned when it came to seeing her characters and ideas come to fruition on TV. At any rate, the reason for three stars is that this series for all of its problems is still not the manure truck than Twilight is (but not by much), nor is it the worst thing I've ever seen (Battle for Los Angeles holds that distinction). Again the premise was promising, and was somewhat interesting for the first couple of seasons. After that however it took a steep nosedive into the abyss of schlock entertainment. Definitely would have dropped the whole pretense of the high school theme, and should have developed a solid narrative of where the producers ultimately wanted to take this series.Too bad... this series had the potential to be so much more."
86,"this is probably one of the most stupid and lamest American TV show that I've ever watched!!! it's like Lady Gaga in TV shows! since so many People love it and don't know what kinda sh****t it is! though gotta admit it wasn't this bad on early seasons. let me be more clear... Direction? sucks! 'Cause you don't get enough time to deal with the events that happen like A LOT!Script? Sucks in a way. Because everything happen in a cliché way! and personally I hate it! other than that script is good I suppose. nice story , nice Dialogues. Acting? kinda Good. Ian Somerhalder comes up with nice and funny Dialouges. he's got a lot of confidence which makes him act very well. it all makes me give it three stars."
87,"I understand it's a book being made into a T.V series, and I know they can't fit everything like all the characters, and they needed to change things. But why did they change Elena's character so much, yes her parents died, and she has a right to be sad, but its just too much. I never understood the purpose of adding a brother she never had, but I'm sure the producers have one, one that won't make any sense to those who followed the book. I hope this is just a one series deal because from the pilot episode; I don't see Vampire Diaries making it to another season. I was not impressed with how they adapted it onto the small screen. For those of you who like the series and haven't read the books....try and read the books. Books will never be properly adapted into movies/series."
88,"First of all, don't predict it to be some kind of Twilight crap. Once you'll start watching it there's no going back at all. This show is soo sooo ADDICTIVE that it'll hook you up to your seat. Don't go for the name. It has no cheesy lines or predictable plots. The best thing about this show is the INTENSE STORYLINE and some AMAZING LEAD ACTORS who will stick to your mind like forever. You'll feel how compassionate the directors really are about the Show and it's intensity. Vampire Diaries has done so well in genres whether it's THRILL,ROMANCE,FRIENDSHIPS or literally anything. The show contains some serious badass villains as well and they are so wonderfully portrayed that once can fall for villains too. There will be moments when you'll laugh with them, cry with them and you'll so badly connect with them that it'll feel like you're a part of it! I just wanna say :- if you haven't watched it yet then grab some snacks and binge it bcs VAMPIRE DIARIES is a show one can never get bored offff..."
89,"Everything spinning around 1 character.
Nobody cares about who dies or becomes vampire but when that 1 character becomes one or is in danger everyone cares.
It doesn't make sense and the plot is so cheap, takes zero brains to see where it fails and it fails a lot"
90,"I watched all 3 seasons on Netflix over a few weeks recently and generally enjoyed it. Things started going sour somewhere near the middle/end of season 3 though and season 4 has been horrendous thus far. I absolutely hate what they have done to the biggest, baddest vampire of all time. Klaus might as well be wearing panties now. Elena has always been mousy but now it's magnified and I just want to drive a stake through her heart. Oh yes, and the motorcycle scene with Stefan and Elena was most definitely the greatest cinematographic tragedy ever. All 5 stars I give are for seasons 1-2.5. I honestly don't know if this show can be saved anymore. The quality is so far removed from where it used to be."
91,"I am personally enjoying the Vampire Diaries series. I read all of the books, enjoyed them as the fluffy teen dramas that they were. The television series is entertaining in a fluffy teen way so I wasn't disappointed. Some of the changes they made took me a while to get used to (sure, Elena was blond, but it doesn't ruin the character that she's a brunette), some of the changes I'm still getting used to (having a band of vampire hunters using a convenient ""vampire compass"" is a little hard to take), and some of the changes are completely ludicrous (I'm sorry, I know they were trying to be multi-cultural, but a black girl as a descendant of Salem Witches? PLEASE!).Most of the characters in the books were very one-dimensional, so I give them a B for effort in character development on the show. It does seem like so many liberties have been taken, I'm wondering if the storyline of Elena becoming a vampire and eventually dying will happen or if they'll take it in a totally different direction in order to prolong the series. Considering what they've done with Vicky's character, I wouldn't be surprised.I know there have been quite a few comparisons made between this series and Twilight (which these books came first, I might add!), so I'm hoping they won't bring the werewolf storyline into the television series--which was absolutely silly in the book. But that's a little contradictory, because the books were silly. Fun, but silly, I can't deny it."
92,"I read the Vampire Diaries series as a teenager, somewhat obsessively, like the girls read the Twilight series now. I'm not saying the books were totally free of cheesy-ness, but they had 3 dimensional characters and a plot (unlike the Twilight series).The pilot did not give me a lot of hope for the series, but I don't think that I'm the target audience.Plot: - I was a 16 and had never read the books, I would be in love with this series already. As I'm 29 and a nostalgic fan of the books, I think I'll give it one more episode before throwing in the towel.Characters: - Elena - Nina Dobrey plays a decent Elena -- not that far off from the book.Stefan and Damon - The interplay between the brothers is spot on, though, in the series, neither of them is purely good or evil. I hope the show pans out the same.Bonnie - A little overconfident and not-Irish to be the book character, but I think she'll play a decent support for Elena.Vicky, Bonnie, and Caroline - Not bad characterizations.Jeremy - Where the heck did he come from?!?"
93,"Okey, please listen up this series had no story there were bad actors it was genuine bad and it made no sense. It made me go watch my toes instead and i just got mad watching it due how bad it was. I could have done the story better and I'm bad at it. Don't waste your time watching this. Summary: Bad actors no story and just cheesy as. If you read about REAL vampires this is so bad please do it because this series is all about getting money and it is really bad. 0/10 CRAP They want me to write more so i will do it. The person watching this is only watching it because they find the actress attractive and its obvious because they are hot teens actually but if you want to find attractive teens just search on it on Google.com it and you will feel much better than watching it."
94,"Im not sure if i am in the right position to judge, since i haven't read any of the books. However, this is a TV show which has the purpose to present an adapted story for the viewers. And what i saw may be a fair adaption from the book but is also extremely weak. All the chitchat seems vain and shallow to me. I felt absolutely smart. I guessed everything that was going to happen. So many clichés... The main character, Elena, is silly, dull and has no expression at all. It was quite funny to discover that she was supposed to be mourning for her dead parents. She seemed the same, in all the scenes. I'll blame the actress for that, though.The vampire (what's his name? i just cant believe i forgot that!!) is mysterious but did not make me wanna know what is he hiding. I liked the blond girl. She is a bitch and a little too easy, but honest. She cant stand Elena as well. Love her. Lets just hope she doesn't die.p.s. vampires cant get into your house if you don't invite them? just like TB? jeez..."
95,"I've only seen the previews, so I will reserve final judgment for when I've seen at least a couple of episodes, but from what I have seen they should have just said that the show was ""inspired by/based on The Vampire Diaries series"" somewhere in the credits. To name it after the series and cast that brunette in the lead role defeats the purpose of what Elena's character represented. LJ Smith approved this!?! Especially after that fifth novel...the story not only seems totally divergent from the series, but VERY poorly cast. Elena is supposed to be angelic in appearance - reminiscent of a FRAGILE young woman (fans of the series know what/who I mean); yet aggressive in personality...without provocation from her friends. What were they thinking?"
96,"Stephan Salvatore, a Vampire returns to his birthplace, Mystic Falls; a hundred and some odd years later. He enrols at the local high school and meets Elana, who has an uncanny resemblance to the Vampire who turned Stephan....Katherine.As Stephan becomes closer to Elana, Damon, Stephan's brother who is also a Vampire returns to town, with a mysterious plan.According to the 'media', Vampires are now 'popular', what they forget is that it was started years ago, by Bram Stoker, who wrote a book called 'Dracula'. In time we got a brilliant series called Buffy and Angel.Yes, this show lacks a lot of things...good strong dialogue that makes you believe the supernatural exists, a good strong talented cast who can support the writers bad writing, and obvious storyline flaws, like how come Elana just ignores Damon's evil deeds...But it does have a rivalry that is quite interesting, Damon and Stephan. Yes, both actors seem to smoulder, thinking that it will help them become better actors...But something is there.The back-story was a little disappointing..I hoped for something interesting instead of the whole 'I fell in love with a Vampire' story..But I still find this show watchable and funny at times, thanks to the character of 'Damon', and plus it's got a beautiful Nina Dobrev...Definitely not a 'real' Vampire story, just one designed for the adolescent, but still a nice show."
97,"I have seen many movies on the Vampires...But this series surpasses all... Many would differ...but i think this series is better than Twilight...WAY better than True Blood (of course)...In Twilight, I find Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson very wooden..like VERY wooden...though rest off the casting is acceptable (except Nikki Reed as Rosalie)...But the main characters lack the intensity and the seriousness of it...which is not the case with Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley...They suit the roles and make it very believable..Nina Dobrev is VERY convincing as Elena Gilbert...Paul Wesley suits the role with his young-but-mature looks need for Stefan Salvatore...and one look at Ian Somerhalder tells you that he's the bad guy and is perhaps the best possible actor who could suit the role of Damon Salvatore... And the supporting cast is Awesome too..My favorite character is Bonnie Bennett played VERY well by Katerina Graham... She makes her presence felt with so many sub plots going on in the series...In short, this is perhaps the best thing in the genre...Awesome Acting, Script, Dialogue and Special Effects... A perfect 10/10 from my side..."
98,"when i first saw the pilot, i was unimpressed. i still continued to watch it though, mostly because it was on before supernatural. the first few episodes were slow, but watchable. i must say, after these past 2 episodes, its gotten so much better! i actually want to see what happens next and now Thursday nights on the cw are more enjoyable for me then Monday nights! which is a lot to say since i am a huge OTH & GG fan. at first, Nina Dobrev did not impress me as Elena, but she gets better and better every episode. Paul Wesley does an amazing job as Stefan, and Ian Somerhalder blows me away every episode as Damon. I like how much depth and background each character has, it influences the way they make decisions just like in real life. I also love where there going with Katerina Graham's character Bonnie, with the whole witch thing. this show has a lot of potential, and hopefully the cw doesn't waste it like they did with the beautiful life."
99,"The first episode was promising. It had the plot to get us interested, nice (and handsome) characters. But as it turned out in episode 2, it lacked the premise to be able to build the story around the characters. At first I thought it would be a BH90210 with vampires. Nice. After 3 eps I'm not interested anymore what happens to Elena. Sorry.I haven't read the books, but was surprised after reading their synopsis that the story there was MUCH more entertaining and interesting.Therefore, I'd like to ask: what did vampires do to deserve this treatment on TV?"
100,"Okay, I know what you're thinking; ""How long is this vampire fad going to go on?""My answer would be ""As long as vampires remain entrenched in history, folklore, superpowers and of course the ever-popular sexual metaphors.The Vampire diaries was doing it's conflicted-immortal-vampire-boy meets cute-understanding-human-girl fourteen years before Stephenie Meyer's series hit the shelf (as if anyone could go without bringing up THAT series for comparison) but unlike Meyer's unexplained discounting of vampire mythology (which I can't get enough of) Lisa Jane Smith integrates vampire myths into hers while keeping it perfectly safe for young adults to read, and doesn't deprive people of the main ideas that make vampires vampires.This show takes a few liberties, makes a few changes, but that can be a good thing. You can tell the people making this are trying to snatch up the Twilight fan's attention to sell the show with a few similarities (Elena is now a brunette, and they of course can't go without mentioning Wuthering Heights *roll eyes), but I don't hold it against them; it's only reasonable that someone talented make money from this vampire obsession, because unlike the wretchedly wooden acting and suicidal messages of New Moon, in The Vampire Diaries Elena Gilbert comes off as a very normal girl dealing with real life as it comes, even if that begins to involve some very odd boys. Considering how Bella can't even deal with being dumped by her boyfriend of less than a year without jumping off a cliff, the lack of histrionics from Elena is a breath of fresh air. Speaking of breaths of fresh air, might I also add that I adore the casting of the Salvatore brothers; that's right people- men CAN in fact be dark and brooding without looking like someone's removing their spleen with a fork *cough*Pattinson*cough*, and oh yeah, THEY HAVE FANGS AND DON'T SPARKLE IN THE SUNLIGHT. That alone is enough to peak my interest. Maybe the rest of the world has found their own series to be in love with but since I am uncomfortable with the nudity of TruBlood (not that it's a bad show) and have had quite enough of the Twilight sexist, suicidal nonsense, perhaps this show will fill the niche, I am after all still a huge fan of fantasy/horror, and although I favor werewolves, vampires will always have a place in my heart because there's so much that can be done with them. Good, evil, ambiguous, young, old, gorgeous, ugly-they're still as interesting as ever.Give it a shot- I'm liking it so far."
101,Some of the worst ideas often make the most money. This is just one of many examples in a long line of crap that people have been forced to swallow. under no circumstance should this ever be considered good TV. I know I'm not the target audience. Although if you're 12 or younger and are a girl. Or you just like to be entertained by zero intelligence you'll love the show. I miss the days of real horror shows. I understand the need to make money. Just not mine. I can think of half a dozen other things I could be doing then watching this type of TV. I'm just gonna go ahead and say that MY vampire kicks YOUR vampires ass. Literally! And Figertily.
102,"This show has nothing whatsoever to keep you entertained. First, Pathetic love triangle which has come to my nerve now. It all started when a young high school girl (Elena) falls for a vampire (Stefan) who is a good vampire. Their relationship grows. It was good until now when his moron demonic brother comes (Damon), he wants to woo Elena and win her. (Excuse me, your brother is already in love!) Then when the boyfriend is gone, Elena falls for the second brother (You have such a lose character girl.)Twisted story (They introduce super hot villains and then they leave the show without any reason(Spin off Originals)) -Eternal life. Many of the characters then be it vampires, witches, werewolves, original vampires, travelers..they can come from dead. No assurance of being dead.-Non reliable love. This girl falls for one, then falls for two feeling bad about first and can't see or accept first to move and fall again! Doh. and this crappy demonic second boyfriend doesn't change at all. I mean what message are you going to get from all this stupidity? Nothing. waste of time and energy to watch this boring show.If you have already started watching it, then stop it right now. If you haven't started and looking forward to watch it, then please don't hurt yourself. And if you have been regularly watching it for the **** sake. then I pass my sympathies."
103,"One reviewer stated it's not a Twilight or a True Blood. D**n right! It's SO much more! This show has everything; a great plot, GREAT characters, and great acting. I'm not going to get into the plot, but I will say that the characters are SO awesome. It's really almost like you grow attached to them. Stafan (Paul Wesley) is the mysterious guy with a purely good heart, aside from his only flaw; lying. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) is one of the most charming, charismatic and smooth talking characters I've witnessed in a TV series or movie for that matter. Not to mention he is incredibly hot. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is well, I just love her. It's not only the characters though; this is an amazing action romance with some very powerful moments dispersed throughout that just touch your heart and make you cry at the beauty of the moment. Honestly, I've never seen a movie or TV series that has touched me as powerfully as this show has. And it's that particular reason why I love this show."
104,"These days (or particularly, nights), I'm completely immersed in 'The Vampire Diaries' novels by L. J. Smith. I'm also getting some of the undead creatures traits like sleeping late into the night. I also love the cool weather now, its so cloudy and rains most of the time. When the sun peeked out through the clouds today morning, I was feeling angry for the lack of cloud cover. And I'm falling in love with all the red colours around me (stupid me). As the 2nd season of 'The Vampire Diaries' is almost upon us, I thought I would give my view on one of my favourite shows and Vampires..! Read on to find out more.The look of the vampire, like an animal in TVD is what makes them a turn off for me. And these vampires cannot go out into the sunlight unless they have a special ring. This is based on L.J.Smith's novels, but takes its own creative liberties, thereby in essence changing the entire story and implementing its own version based on the characters. In 'The Vampire Diaries' TV show, there are three main protagonists: Elena Gilbert, Stefan Salvatore and Damon Salvatore. Stefan and Damon are brothers and in all outward appearances, they look like two very handsome guys who have their differences. They have a dark secret which has its origins in the latter half of the 19th century! They were born in the Aristocratic family and both loved Katherine, a beautiful vampire who loved both of them and wanted them to journey with her into immortality. Yes, she was very kinky and she toyed with both of their feelings. After her unfortunate death, the brothers blamed each other for her death and Damon swore he would make the rest of Stefan's immortal life a living hell.Stefan upholds chivalry, honesty and justice; and he is weak by preying only on animal blood. Obviously Damon is Yin for his Yang; Damon doesn't have any respect for human life, he upholds debauchery and is the poster boy for strength, charm and wickedness. Oh yeah, everybody is hotter than the surface of the sun, there is so much eye candy that you have to wear sun glasses to protect yourself!!In the fall of 2009, Stefan bumps into Elena, the resemblance to Katherine is very overpowering and he loves her, but not because she looks like Katherine, but because she was the exact opposite of Katherine in everything she did. He had known for a long time that Katherine never wanted either of the Salvatore brothers and was only toying around. Damon wants to destroy Mystic Falls, but ends up falling for Elena as well. Ultimately, the question is who will Elena choose? The ending of the first season hints at a bigger picture and that is mouth-watering (lol) for fans like me. The Vampire Diaries starts off as another spin off wanting to make it big with the help of the Twilight craze, with its settings in a school and the obvious romance between the vegetarian Stefan and the vampire doting Elena, and Damon being the third wheel. But after a couple of episodes, you know things are starting to change with hints of True Blood's debauchery and sex thrown in. Of course, everything is PG-13, parents don't worry too much.Don't bother with their ages. Everybody love them for their hotness, doesn't really matter what their ages are. But still, the real ages are; Elena - 21, Stefan - 28, Damon - 32!! The kissing scenes between Damon and Elena make me uneasy, she looks so much younger than her age. But Damon has the most amazing one-liners and quick quips! I love everybody and everything in the show!"
105,"In this newly created vamp romance flick, an amazing cast along with incredible screenwriters and a talented directing group, portray the fantastic novels of L.J.Smith on the big screen. In each episode, tension builds up and nothing ever goes as planned. Who would have guessed Katherine wasn't in the tomb? Or Elena was adopted? Stefan(Wesley) does a fantastic and believable job as the good, moralistic, unorthodox vampire and falls in love with former Queen Bee Elena(Dobrev), who, surprisingly, does a rather perfect job as being Elena. We see how her character reacts to each situation with just the right amount of humph and amp. And Damon,(Ian), with his snappy comments and witty sarcasm, has shown that he can in fact, act with a deeper side. Bonnie( Graham) showed us in Episode 14 that yes, despite some if her flaws in previous episodes, she can act... very, very well. Caroline(Accola) is perfectly shown as the I could not-care-less-about-anyone-around-me but I-am-not-such-a-bit*h-intentionally. She falls for Matt, but hurts him in the process because of her... stupidity. And Matt also does a great job reacting to her. Jenna and Jeremy both do great as the supportive family members. Jeremy is a recovering Druggie, showing a turn since he bonded with Alec Saltzman, the caring and cunning vampire hunter, who Jenna happens to be falling for. Even Anna, Pearl, Grams, and the smaller roles ,like Jonathon, Tyler, Ben, and Bree were portrayed fantastically. KUDOS to the show, and I hope it keeps on being so great. * I would love, love, love to see Stefan+well. I just want to see how they would do it. Maybe Jeremy could take Meridith's place and come along to get him out? And who would have thrown him in? Maybe Jeremy could have- found out he was a vamp, though Elena didn't know, shot him, dumped him in a well, finds out Elena knew and Stefan was good, and then comes along to fish him out. Something along those lines. Or maybe Jeremy didn't come. Maybe they didn't even know it was him until he admitted it."
106,"Okay, I'll admit. The first time hearing about this series I thought...no not another vampire show...but I tuned in anyways. Just to see what the hype was about. The show started off with a stumble, like any new show, but as the story progressed, i'm so addicted. I never missed an episode, if i did i'd try to find it online.Sure, it's easy to compare this to twilight. I used to be a fan of Twilight. Yeah, those days are over. Compared to the movie, TVD has better graphics, better plot, better characters and sooo much more chemistry between the two leads. Twilight makes me cringe just thinking about it...The Vampire diaries is amazing, and if you love these types of shows, watch it! And stick with it. Sure it's one of those teenage love things, but the supernatural quality makes it even better. Sadly, I have to wait until march for the newest episode -_-"
107,"I am absolutely in love. If the rest of the series is anywhere as good as the pilot, I'll be thrilled. I normally work evenings, and have actually changed my work schedule so that I can be off on Thursdays. (I know, kinda sad. But, it's also CSI night. :D) As for the other person's comment that this show is like the Twilight series, I believe the books for this were written before Twilight. Besides, I really like the idea of vampires being able to walk around in the daylight. If nothing else, they'd be a little harder to kill. I also like the idea of him being young enough to pull off being a high school student. Who wants a vampire that looks old. All in all, a 5 so far."
108,"""A high school girl is torn between two vampire brothers."" That pretty much tells you of how pathetic this series can be and I can tell you that the series themselves are as bad as the description. High school girls brings the boys and the two vampire brothers are there to bring the girls to a standard and boring story that is mostly a remake of any other vampire story, that also have no red line in it. They just jump around like little children in the playground. And when you thought it couldn't get worse. I tell you the acting is worse than what any kid does in elementary school. So.. Long story short, standard and boring story, rookie acting , overrated by baiting people with lightly-dressed men and women. Sometimes I just don't get why people keep creating stuff about vampires and love when there already is twilight which sums it all and shows us how overrated these kinds of stories are. Please forget about this series and move on to something new and innovative that ain't a remake of something that's already proved to be worthless(TWILIGHT).Peace out!"
109,"Firstly I have to say that I have not read any of the books and to some that may not validate me as a good enough reviewer. But here is my opinion; From what I have seen of the teasers, the show has a lot of promise. After seeing the pilot, I stand by my point. I liked it, a lot. Some thinks that it's ridiculous to even place a mythical creature in such ""normal"" conditions, like school and reality, but that is one of my favorite things. I like mixing it up. Who really wants the über cliché vampire story of burned by the sun, sleeps in a coffin or turns into a bat? I sure as hell don't! Some also says that this is the ""next Twilight"" or something and there I have to disagree. This is nothing like Twilight. Sure there's a mysterious vampire (who, btw, is completely gorgeous!) and a girl for a heroine and the story takes place in the same ""time"". But that's it. Don't compare them and don't compare the books to the show. That's the reason many shows and movies ""turn bad"" because you analyze it so much you miss the whole point. My advice is to give the show a chance... this was only the pilot, people! Many great shows have had some ""eh"" responses. But think of the possibilities!"
110,"I just don't understand how every season, a promising show gets canceled but this waste of money keeps going. The plot is very predictable, like going in a circle for 7 seasons. The dialog also is very bad. They have a few words that sound ""smart"" and they keep repeating them ten times per episode, I only forced myself to watch until the 3rd season, but I remember the word ""doubleganger"" was very annoying. And the way they all forgive each other for the worst things, and everybody hooks up with everybody at some point... There are a few acceptable actors in this show, so It's curios to me that they agree to be stuck in this sinking career show for the last 7 years."
111,"I was a huge fan of 'The Vampire Diaries' (TVD) after my mom introduced it to me whilst season 2 was airing. I fell in love with it and became hugely invested in the characters and stories. Unfortunately, it went increasingly downhill as the series progressed to the point that I stopped watching. Even back in its prime, TVD was nothing particularly special. It racked up a huge fan-base because of the hysteria surrounding vampires at the time, its young and pretty cast and the lure of a dark romance between vampire and human. Beyond that it was never particularly insightful, intelligent and from the inset was essentially a rip-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However, the early seasons had promise and were entertaining. Unfortunately, after season 3 (its strongest season, in my opinion), it seemed to take a very sudden dive off a very high cliff. There was a complete lack of creativity, unimaginative and repetitive plots, zero character development, huge inconsistencies in the mythology and too much unnecessary drama and romance that was played on to distract attention from the absence of anything even remotely intelligent or interesting.The show suffered further when the show-runners decided to continue for another 2 seasons without the lead, Nina Dobrev (Elena). Despite the show having a rather large cast and other main characters to fall back on, to continue the show without Nina was a very ill-advised decision to make and was the final straw.The only reason I've rated 3 stars is because the early seasons weren't THAT terrible and there are some good elements of the show that managed to keep me watching for 6 seasons."
112,"I mean, legitimately what is happening. I have never seen a show where so many characters go from being the antagonist to the protagonist. It starts out portraying Damon as this Satanic psycho evil vamp. And that ""he must be stopped"". Then he is substituted for another villain...who is substituted by another villain. And everyone so easily forgets the evils committed by all of the above. I mean, Damon literally kills Elena's brother and Stefan's best friend and does all kinds of horrible stuff and then it's just forgotten. And now the Originals aren't even the bad guys? It's just a rabbit hole."
113,"Vampire Diaries started good, became excellent and for the last couple of seasons it keeps getting from bad to worse. One of the things i like about series, is that unlike any movie, in a TV show you have time to connect with the characters and feel that you know them. So when a production starts killing one by one every character you have come to learn and love, the show takes the downfall. And if 9 out of 10 of these characters are killed in order to help one single person (Elena) then it gets irritating. We get it, Elena is torn between the two brothers but does the whole town really has to die in order for Elena to live her romance? Everyone gets his life in danger in order to help Elena but if God forbid someone has his one plans (see Tyler's plan about Claus) the two brothers take matters into their one hands. I will continue to watch the show, specially for Damon since i like him very much and because i want to see how the story ends, but they have to bring some new faces on board cause everyone is dead or leaving for another show..."
114,"This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now."
115,"Now that the series has ran for one and a half seasons, and fans have to wait seven weeks for the next episode, I think this is as good a time as any to voice my opinion on this series. And just to be clear, I have both seen and read all the books of Twilight, True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, and I'm not here to bash on any of these. The Vampire Diaries is an extraordinary TV series. It follows the life of Elena Gilbert, a teenage girl who has lost her parents and lives with her aunt Judith and brother Jeremy in a little town. One day a handsome boy, Stefan Salvatore, (and with him his 'evil' brother Damon) enters her life and everything changes (or, rather, comes into light.) Sounds corny, I know, but the story that unravels after that sucks you into the world of Mystic Falls, a seemingly normal town, where not-so-normal things happen. The Vampire Diaries has your basic characters: the 'good' protagonist, Elena, who is faced with challenges no other normal teenager is; the boyfriend, Stefan, with who's arrival the aforementioned challenges arise; the 'bad boy' Damon who raises all manner of hell throughout the series; the vengeful ex-girlfriend of both Stefan and Damon, Katherine, who, by the way, looks exactly like Elena; the best friend, Bonnie, who helps Elena through thick and thin; the preppy blond cheerleader, Caroline, and countless other secondary characters. ...But that's only one dimension of these people that many have come to love and hate and love again. We see a good Elena, we see a stubborn one. We see the default setting of Stefan, which is a tormented, often depressed, martyred 150-year-old teenager who feeds on animals, not humans, and we see a blood-thirsty Stefan that'll lie to his girlfriend without flinching. Then we see Damon, the ""evil twin"" as it were, but the development of this character is outstanding. Damon jumps rope with the line between good and bad. Just when you think he might permanently stay on the good side, he goes and snaps Jeremy's neck, and then back he goes to saving Elena's always-in-trouble behind. The Vampire Diaries has it's love triangles (yes, plural. Throughout the series we not only see Stefan and Damon's fight for Elena, but also, in the first half of season two we see another triangle forming: Caroline, Tyler and Matt. We'll see how that goes), it has it's challenges, rich history and backgrounds, amazing chemistry between actors.. in short, everything a good series should have.The Vampire Diaries might have started out slow, but it's definitely worth your time. Every episode will have you at the edge of your seat. You'll laugh, cry, hyperventilate... and you'll go around quoting Damon's famous one-liners."
116,"""Twilight...has got it all wrong,"" said Damon Salvatore, and I completely agreed.The Vampire Diaries is, yet again, a vampire-based series in the young adult genre. But don't be discouraged. I admit, it has romance, excessively beautiful actors/actresses, teenage issues and girlie giggles. But they've managed to not let these control the way the series goes.The characters of the TV series stay true to the books, even though the plot does not. Nevertheless, the plot itself is a gripping tale, filled with rich history and various strategic turning points. It's interesting on its own, even without the book, so no one can truly compare the TV series with the novels. The characters develop very, very well and the viewers are given a chance to delve into each of them.The gore in this series is just enough to display the truth of the darker world of vampires. But it isn't overloaded with blood and organs to turn it into an obsessive blood film. There is a wonderful balance between the horror, fantasy and romance. And it works. It definitely does. It even made me tear up at one point (when...something something, insert spoiler here. LOL.)Though, admittedly, the opening seemed like, ""Ugh, another Twilight"" with how Elena was introduced and how Stefan became part of the plot. (And admit it, when you read twilight, you imagined that Elena and Stefan would've been perfect for Bella and Edward. I mean, look at Stefan's hair and body! Elena's skin! Okay...enough.)But the moment supposedly evil brother and secret master plan comes in, oh wow. And when you think you know where the series is headed, you're wrong. Yet again. Which only makes the series righter every time.The direction is fantastic. The actors and actresses were expressive, though not exaggerated. None of that whispery crap we hear from Twilight (or that five hundred blinks per minute from Bella). The smallest twitches and most unimportant moves made everything seem believable and realistic. Down to the last details of how they speak, how they look at each other--perfect acting. Especially for Ian Somerhalder, Matthew Davis, Candice Accola, Malese Jow and Sara Canning--all performances were impeccable.Watch it."
117,"I've never read the books but am a very huge fan of the show! It's SOo addictive!! And the ending that we were left with before the holiday plus break was unfair! Of course it's hard not to compare it to Twilight but I would say in comparison to the movies much better. The graphics: them fighting, the eyes when they're all hungry or passionate... And definitely not lame in relation to some of the cheesy aspects or dialogue. The cast is pretty cool too. It's nice to see Ian Somerhalder back on TV again: he's a fox. And pretty witty sometimes too. And Paul Wesley is a great Stefan (glad seeing more of him too since his very brief character on the ""O.C."") and wow holy abs! It also comes equipped with a pretty fantastic soundtrack. Can't wait for its return, I've probably watched all the reruns like 4 times. And I'm curious as to what's going to happen when Ian is off in Hawaii for LOST."
118,"I can't help it. I'm a sucker for vampire stories. I started with the Twilight series, but the movie was an epic failure, bad casting etc. Luckily for me, the disappointed and still hungry for more type, I decided to give this show a try. It was so much better than I imagined it would be. I went in thinking it will be just as bad if not worse than what twilight brought for us, but to my good surprise, it was exactly what I was looking for. The characters are likable and can actually deliver their lines realistically, not 100% of the time, but at least they are interesting to watch and listen to. Elena, is truly beautiful, and Nina Dobrev is fit for the part. Nina and Paul look like a fantastic on screen couple, and with each passing episode, I'm beginning to like Damon all the more. Give it a look-see. I'm an instant fan."
119,"So I'm a huge vampire fanatic. And I was a big big fan of Twilight. But I would never say that The Vampire Diaries is ripping off Twilight because, SURPRISE, The Vampire Diaries was written in 1991. Wayyyy before Twilight was a book/ movie. So if there are similarities maybe the finger should be pointing in the other direction. I just think people should get their facts straight before mouthing off in a comment. And this is coming from someone who's dog's name is Cullen. I just think credit is due to the right people. Now on to my actual review. I liked it. They did change some stuff especially with the looks of people but plot wise it seemed pretty on so far. I'm glad that they picked people that aren't necessarily ""big"" names, and I was always a Degrassi fan so the pick for Elena was fine by me. Can't wait for next week, hopefully there is more vamp action. BTW Stefan didn't return to find his lost love. She actually loved both brothers, turned them both into vampires, and then killed herself because she couldn't handle loving them both. His entire purpose for returning is because Elena is her double."
120,Worst series I have ever watched. Couldnt bare to watch more than season 1.
121,"Characters are poorly written, like the whole show. The actors are god awful. The plot is hardly a plot. It seems like something that should be for kids only, but all the horny torn between brothers bs won't allow that, so I guess its just for stupid girls??? Also, no two brothers would fight over a stupid chick like that, I'm sorry. Two vampires, who will presumably live forever, would be way smarter than this. This is really just a pathetic show for chicks to watch and wish they weren't too scared to go and try to meet a real boy. I'm sorry, but this show being successful is just a good example of how awfully stupid everyone is. Give me a break. You people need to grow up. The fact that this show won any awards is beyond me. it's like an audience of Kanye West's watching Beyonce, while Beck is on another channel displaying some actual talent. I really cant stand the people that make stuff like this popular. Please go away."
122,"Where shall I start? Okay....those 4 stars I gave to this show can be thankful to the first two seasons of this show. They were not brilliant, but at least they had some story and the episodes that followed were worth the watch.I read all the books. First thing that struck me was the fact, that Elena is blond in book version - which Nina Dobrev apparently isn't. Stefan and Damon - too sweet, but okay I could cope with that. In fact Ian Sommerhalder is a one hell-of-a-good-looking guy but that's it. Acting in the show, well I think calling it acting is an offensive word to say, considering other actors who actually CAN act and not just hit it with this weirdo dramatic expression held on at all times, just watch it closely! even when they smile, they seem depressed! Nina Dobrev - just plain boring, tragic and pessimistic girl with no goals, just overdone mouth articulation whereas her eyes still remain in the same expression (quite similar to Kristen Stewart's Twilight version). Then Stephan - he acts in this show just like the guy who I could just carry around for his good looks but I wouldn't rather allow him to speak anywhere and then Damon with his permanent facial spasms which are the cause of trying too hard.... Well yea worthy for the Oscar nomination really (LOL) Now the story...as I wrote before - first two seasons were okay....but what continues now, it just goes on and on, nothing happens in the whole episode when you sum it up, you could just see a 5 minute cut from the whole bullshit and would end up with the same result as when watching it for 40 minutes. Then all the decisions that need to be done...Oh come on! It's not enough that I have a lot on my mind. I even have to watch these people trying to make the right decision - which usually ends up in a disastrous scenario or it doesn't end up in anything because the decision was too difficult.... blah...Then all these killings that happened - really? is killing a character the only thing that you can think of to make the show more interesting? Perhaps adding some plot would do just fine. But that never occurs to anyone because violence is just cool and it is IN among the generation I belong to. Anyways....I stopped watching the series because it was all too much crap for me to handle and I'd rather stare into eyes of a mouse which is scared then see those Elena-tragic ones. Just watch Dexter and that will change your point of view on the quality of how a good show should look like. Cheers and Peace!"
123,"I am (or maybe used to be) a huge Twilight fan,'till i saw the first episode of ""The Vampire Diaries"". This series kind of opened my eyes! As I was watching it I was thinking that this is an exact replica of Twilight,but then I read that these books were written 15 years ago! It has everything that Twilight doesn't: good cast (although Paul's acting is resemblant to Robert's,but definitely better),good story, realistic teenagers,the true myths about vampires apply, Stefan can actually kiss Elena without killing her and the most important thing: there is no Kristen Stewart! (who I might say in my opinion is the worst actress ever!, she ruined the whole Twilight series). That been said...great TV series! :)"
124,"What I like about Vampire Diaries is how the writers have taken a slower pace to allow viewers to really get to know the characters. It is very well written and not just aimed at teens. The acting is good - sometimes cheesy, but done in a way which makes you love the show even more. Also very funny at times (Damon Salvatore has the best lines), but that's once you get to know the characters, so make sure you give it a chance and you'll be hooked just like me!! A lot of people are comparing Vampire Diaries to Twilight... please don't. Yes, both are about vampires, but the stories and very different. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed reading the Twilight series but Vampire Diaries is a lot darker and leaves you in suspense wanting more!10/10"
125,"I watched the pilot today and I have to say it was impressive. It has a good plot line, great characters, and a lovely soundtrack that I'll start hunting after posting this, LOL. What we know so far is that Elena lost her parents and is raised with her younger brother Jeremy by their aunt. At school, she meets tall dark handsome stranger, Stephen Salvator who turns out to get her, and also, to be a vampire... By the end of the pilot we find out that he had returned to Mystic Falls to look for his lost love, Katherine (spitting image of Elena, by the way). Also, after a series of ""animal-caused"" murders happen, we see another tall dark even more handsome stranger, who, surprise, is Stephen's older brother. And a vampire. Who, contrary to Stephen, is not ready to give up his blood-sucking habits. Basically, we have a basic conflict between two brothers, good and evil... add the familiar conflict between human (Elena) and struggling vampire (Stephen), and you get a really nice, angsty, dramatic, romantic teen-vampire show. Ian Sommerhalder is absolutely lethal in the role of Damon, the evil vamp-brother. Paul Wesley delivers nicely, too, and Nina Dobrev is pure enough to taunt any vampire, good or otherwise. I'm giving this show ten stars out of ten. I really hope it will live longer than ""Moonlight""..."
126,"I read the books before the series came out. I'm a huge fan of the books, love them so much. I have also read all the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse (True Blood) books. I am also a huge Buffy fan. I was really excited for this show to come out, but I was a little worried. I wasn't sure how I would like how they aren't really following the books (I had a hard time with the second season of True Blood). But, I have to say I really enjoy this show. I think they are doing a really good job with it. They are sort of following the books, but are changing it up too. I like that because really if they followed exactly how the books go then it would be pretty boring, as we would know what was going to happen every episode. I know a lot of people were complaining about the cast. But, I think they did a good job. Even though Elena isn't blonde hair and blue eyes, I think that Nina does a good job portraying Elena. Damon and Stefan are great too. Ian actually makes an amazing Damon, he plays the part perfect. The actor playing Stefan is exactly how I imagined him in the books. I know people say he doesn't look like how Stefan is described in the book, but I was looking at the cover for The Awakening and The Fury... and it looks just like the actor. I think this show is great and I look forward to the rest of the episodes.I don't see how people think that they are making the show more like Twilight... I just don't see it. And for starters The Vampire Diaries came out before Twilight, so you could say Twilight is copying it (just like it's very similar to The Sookie Books). As for the actor playing Stefan being like Edward (in personality and looks) I have to say I don't see it at all. I think the show is well cast and does it's own thing. They may have changed a few things from the book (such as Elena having a 15-year old brother instead of a 4-year old sister) for the good. I find that Jeremy adds a new element to the story. I think that this show has a lot of potential and it is getting better has the series goes on. I think that Twilight fans need to stop saying it is a rip-off of Twilight... if anything Twilight is a rip-off for The Vampire Diaries. And, people need to get over that Elena is a brunette (I personally couldn't think of a better actress to play her. Nina is doing a great job).I just wanted to comment on people talking about the drugs, drinking, and sex. Someone said that, that isn't what goes on in High School... I don't know where you went to High School, but that was exactly what my school was like (and all the other High Schools in my town). I am from a smaller town, and well they way they party and stuff is exactly how it is where I am from (except for the vampires). I also wanted to comment on someone talking about how they changed the name of the Town from Fell's Church to Mystic Falls. From what I have heard is they had to change the town's name due to legal reasons. The name Fell's Church doesn't really have a significance in the books. The founders (the Fall's) do, but they can still tie that in."
127,"OK so i have not read the books and therefore cannot justify the pilot episode by it, but i really loved it. The book is meant for junior highers mostly, o you have to remember that the writing and dialogue isn't too complex, but it is nice to just be able to watch a show without a dictionary. I really loved the show. i thought it was great. Elana was wonderful in my opinion, she is trying to hide the fact that she is still mourning for her parents, she's being strong for her brother, but she isn't completely healed. While she is quiet and somewhat foolish and innocent seeming by personality, she is showing to be a rather strong and complex character. As for the male cast...they are all extremely fine. Damon and Stefan were phenomenal in my personal opinion and i think they will go rather far with this series, their chemistry alone makes for an entertaining and thrilling show and throwing in the elements of a sick and murderous love triangle, and the vampirism and rivalry of feuding brothers, the show has great potential."
128,"Just terrible. Plot stolen from Twilight (not that that was a good movie or whatever). Basic stupid characters, basic EVERYTHING. How can people like this garbage.."
129,"After having read the books that this show is based on, the show falls awfully short of the books. The characters are nothing like they are in the book. Have we forgotten that Elena is a blonde? And that she is supposed to look exactly like the woman that Damon and Stefan were both in love with so long ago? That her coloring comes in to play with the white tiger, being called ""an Ice Queen"", and when she is forced off the bridge, and into the water, freezing to death? Or how about Bonnie? She's supposed to be Irish, and from a long line of Druids. I'm sorry, but there is no way the actress that portrays the role looks like that. Once again, Hollywood ruins a good thing."
130,"So as above, the first 4 seasons are worth a watch - but then it just becomes repetitive and loses its spark. I just skipped to the final episode on season 8 after that lol."
131,"It is overall an okay series. You're not missing much if you haven't watched it yet. The worst part is that it gets really difficult to get on with the series as Elena's (female protagonist) character gets really annoying. She is always crying, worrying, gasping.*Do not start if you have an obsession of finishing things up or do I say if you need closures like Sheldon Cooper.*"
132,"I watched it without reading reviews and it was cliche, boring, unoriginal, ridiculous acting. Theres so much going on all the time and people die constantly. Its so unrealistic even if you try your very hardest to suspend your disbelief it just doesnt work for me. It is more geared towards teens for sure. You wont be missing anything at all if you skip this series."
133,"Let me say that i have read the main series of the vampire diaries book series ( the awakening , struggle and fury ) and they were good not king Lear and Hamlet level of good but still good enough to read . 500 years prior to the main events of the book a noble girl from Germany comes to stay in Italy for a visit no one knows but she is a vampire , she is kind and sweet but not without some traits of selfishness , at the same time she is impulsive , naive , angry and manipulative but that is the art of the writer to make you relate to her , the family whom she is staying with has two sons , Damon and Stefan , both hate each other both fell in love with the girl ( Katherine) both are chosen by her and resent it and eventually her , this drives her to fake her suicide ( remember that she is selfish and manipulative )brothers kill each other and rise as vampires ,Now after 500 years they have found a girl who looks and acts like Katherine and both are obsessed with her .This is the main plot of the book series as you can see has zero similarities with the show as for the characters they have the same names but that's it , Elena and Katherine are both blond Damon has black eyes and from what i have read he would have snapped the show Damon in half , also these are vampires both Damon and Katherine live in cemetery they can shape shift , control the weather ETC they don't party and have wild sex , they don't go shopping they don't act like human beings Katherine wears a centuries old wedding dress and hasn't cut her hair in like decades , Damon does not interact with people and even Stefan doesn't act like a teenager see what i mean the author knew what she was doing the writers of the show didn't . The show Elena is whiny sad little girl who has a depressed look on her face wears ugly clothes and does not look like book Elena , show Katherine is evvvill that is she wears black leggings and dark clothes has curly hair and smiles a lot, the story itself has nothing to do with the books either instead of a sad story of love turned into obsession we get a war zone with hundreds of characters from ancient Greece to Vikings ( all of whom speak English )fighting over God knows what , all these aside the script is cringe worthy , the acting is over done or plain annoying , the cinematography is murky and unpleasant and the over all silly concepts like humanity switch and hybrids is vomit inducing . Bad show even for the fans of undead lore ."
134,"This was one of the few shows to channel the storytelling of earlier decades with the production standards of today. It has now finished as, despite a weak seventh season, a coherent serialized show with a full circle ending. The character development of the principle cast was outstanding between where we started and where we finished. Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) managed to avoid the trap that many of her contemporaries like Sookie and Bella fall into. The brothers were more than romantic choices but with their own story and redemption arc where Stefan and Damon as brothers were every bit as important as who ended up with who. An outstanding supporting cast- a storyline that started as a small town girl who lost her parents to the literal destruction of Hell.It's responsible for a spin off (The Originals) that eclipsed it in terms of maturity and pacing and was one of the defining, best parts of the vampire craze that has faded. The Vampire Diaries will survive as an enduring example where serialized storytelling can create a show and that good things can come out of the worst fads, I'd recommend this show to anyone who likes the genre and wants to watch something different than the regular conventions it usually follows. The Vampire Diaries did it better."
135,If you are a fan of Buffy the vampire slayer don't watch it.This show lacks story.Situations are repeated again and again. Same thing someone is dead and than revived. After season 3 it loses almost all the main theme there are only new characters.This show has more than enough characters one can bear.I didn't understand what the hype and rating was about.I think only teenage boys and girls watch this because its mainly a romantic soap opera.If you think you are mature please don't watch it.As far as actors are concerned they did a fine job.But there was nothing they could've done to save the show.The Vampire Diaries is a show you can watch if you have ton of free time. May be you'll enjoy first few seasons but after that it is just a disaster.
136,"Honestly, this show is so repetitive and the 'big bads' are getting annoying. I don't have high hopes for the final season, but I'm sticking around or my favorite characters. I miss Katherine a lot, Elena, not so much. Caroline and Bonnie deserve better! Their story lines better be great this last season. But honestly, I'm way over brooding vampires. I don't know why I keep watching the show, I always do this to myself though. When I like the last few seasons of a show, I stick around even when it goes downhill. (I'm looking at you gLee). Comic Con promised us that it would be better, going back to the roots. That's what they sad last year, so I don't know if I buy it. But I'm still gonna watch though."
137,"The first 3 season of TVD were truly breathtaking. Each character had a unique personality, that you could relate (eg. Caroline Forbes) and the storyline kept you at the edge of your seat because of the plot twist. But after season 3 and its touching ending, the chaos came. The storyline stopped making sense,the couples that was created afterwards don't have chemistry, the characters were ruined and they took away from me the ONLY TWO GOOD THINGS i had left; the originals and Klaroline.I truly believe that it should have ended after season 3. The only thing that this show gives to the viewers is headache and disappointment. And honestly, the actors deserve better roles."
138,"When the series started it was quite good, a lot of action, blood and Fighting . It's now in season 7 and I believe it's getting worse by the episode. It's just seems to be repetitive :they kill/get rid of someone bad and someone else shows up and they start all over again. What's worse is that the main characters Salvatore brothers which lived for 150 years act like they were born yesterday. If you are an immortal magical being which spent more then a century on the face of the Earth you would know a bit more about all this all powerful others in your back yard. Every new season it's exactly the same, just the bad guys change. Watching this series became a waste of time because it's so predictive."
139,"I like to this kind of stuff. I would give 8/10 for first two season's, then till 4th season it was good. After that it looks like total crap, All the vampire logic they build for 4 seasons looks had lost the way. 6th season is the height of exaggeration. Anything can happen. Moulding story line like anything. Meanwhile I started watching The Originals. Its quite good but When I gt sick watching vampire diaries I also stopped watching The originals. & repetitive face making scenes by demon, Seems good at first. Huh... man stop it. Its overacting. I hope they will come back to the track or stop directing such kind of stuff, Its affecting The Originals. Over all Disappointed!!"
140,"I really liked this show before, but this season is getting worse and worse. I have a feeling the writers have no idea where to go with the script and directing and music score is getting quite sloppy too. I think the actors are doing what they can, but there is only so much you can achieve with a weak script and lack of direction. And the plot holes start to pile up.. Bringing in Damon's and Stephan's mother as a vampire(who by the way ""died"" and left forever when Stephan was 8, but has a picture of him as an adult on the table)does not really seem plausible when you consider their family history in the earlier seasons. Also if Damon and Stephan have a living relative (Sarah) all this time wouldn't they need her invitation to be able to live in their house? And is Candice Accola rehearsing for some musical? There hasn't been a single episode since 15 where she wouldn't sing..."
141,"*SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* I have been watching this since DAY ONE! I don't know what happened to the writing, but somehow, they managed to forget how the relationships ACTUALLY work in this show. Caroline wouldn't just forgive Damon after sleeping with Klaus, it would still take time and she wouldn't feel bad for him. Not even close. She would think that he DESERVES everything that he's getting lately. Stefan would NOT just throw his brother out. He would try to help him. How the hell had no one realized that Elena is not Elena? SERIOUSLY? You would think these people aren't her friends at all. I would have noticed the changes right away! Especially the switch from Damon to Stefan instantly... No one thought that was sketchy? Yea.. Something has got to give.."
142,"So, Matt turned out to be the one who matters enough to have Elena's humanity turned onBut just moments before that didn't Elena the mighty blood-hungry emotionless vampire attack and feed on him, probably trying to drain him dry?She had been so stubborn that Stefan and Damon tried everything in their power to ""provoke"" her, desiccation, hunger, sunlight torture... yet nothing worked. Then, a childhood playmate douchebag named Matt is the answer to all the puzzles!But what about logics? Wasn't she emotionless? She was! She couldn't feel a thing at all! When Damon threatened to kill Matt, Elena the emotionless bloodsucker should have given a shrug, saying ""He's just a bag of bones, a meatsack to me. Go ahead. Kill him. Whatever"" Yet when Matt's neck got snapped, she was acting like the end of the world.Let's just forget about logics. Even if he really matters so much, and Elena and Matt's childhood memories are so heavenly important as to stir her emotions when she was utterly emotionless, then why not give the audience a hint earlier in the episode, depicting the beauty and glory of their past romance, foreshadowing the scene of poor girl Elena's epic humanity switch flipping? If it were up to me to direct the show, I would make sure there's enough hint at the beginning of this episode, looking back a little on those happy peaceful days when they were kids.Instead, the actual show is too rushed. Since we certainly didn't realize Matt was so greatly essentially life-threateningly vital throughout the whole show. Sure Elena and Matt have a history. However, ""The Vampire Diaries"" only mentioned a tip of iceberg on that aspect, while mainly illustrating the relationship between her and Stefan.Therefore, I believe the story would be more convincing if Damon drives a stake through Stefan's heart in front of Elena who becomes epically humanity-back-on as she watches Stefan's face turning grey and very dead"
143,"This Show has slowly started to loose its charm as the same concepts are bieng used. Even the humour of Damon isn't there anymore and the love triangle is getting boring. The unnecessary crying funerals just isn't interesting. I find Originals quite Interesting and find Klaus simply amazing. Plus Jeremy and Matt are quitee similar in terms of character. Both are out of place as they don't have any attachments to any one and seem like baggage to the other characters. The Last Episode was the worst. WHo the heck are travellers. Vampires, Witches and WereWolfs is enough. Stefan kept on moving from the university location to the house quite fast. Losing his memory is just another setback honestly."
144,"The first four episodes are disappointing. You hear people saying great things about this show, but then you start watching it and realize you're different than everyone else who thinks The Vampire Diaries is great. Well, I suggest you make it through the first four episodes and start watching what's from then on.This show takes a while to take off, and it's likely that you won't find it addicting right from the beginning. However, once you make it through the first few episodes, you'll see what everyone else means. Elena is not a very interesting character right away. Nevertheless, her true colors start showing as the plots advance, and we find ourselves rooting for her to find happiness. Stefan and Damon Salvatore, the vampire brothers, are too different, yet they're the same. There's an inner essence to them that makes their differences utterly interesting to watch, because you can understand exactly why they are who they are. They are what got me through the first four episodes of the show.The supporting characters have unique story lines of their own, so you'll see something happening at all times. This is not one of those shows that ends with a cliffhanger every episode, but the plot, the characters and the mystery that runs through the veins of this town, will be enough to keep you interested. Will you find some things too far fetched? Probably. Are some scenes truly cliché? Definitely. Still, you'll be so interested in this story that none of these things will seem to matter after all. There are some flaws in this show, hence why I can't bring it myself to give it a 10, but it's still really, really addicting, really interesting and I can't help but recommending it to all of you, even if you normally don't enjoy supernatural things. This show is not simply about supernatural activities. Rather, it talks about feelings, differences, prejudice, history. If you haven't watched it yet, do it. You won't regret your decision."
145,"Yes Meyer took the ""best parts"" of other authors and created a ""vampire utopia"". Yes this story was written 15 years earlier. Yes the series has many differences from the books (which series hasn't? and what's the point of the series if it is exactly the same as the books? See it if you are bored of reading???) So please stop comparing! The story started out very weak and the acting was average at best, apart from Ian Somerhalder (Damon). Add to that the changes in the hair colour of the heroine (Elena) and the style and appearance of Stefan to the point that you wonder if they are twilight Doppelgangers (pun intended) and the pilot on itself gets about a 2/10, forcing you to think that this is going to be ""Twilight the series"" if you haven't read the books. If you get passed the first few episodes and Damon comes into play the story becomes better and better. Season 2 plot improves even more but the acting remains average (in some cases I'm being polite). The only annoying thing for me in the story is all these parties and gatherings every second day for the whole village!!!! Please find another way to get all the characters in one place! Other than that keep it up!"
146,"Although the first few episodes are painful to watch, I stuck with it. I think that the actors and writers got into the groove fairly quickly. I like that they take the time to develop the characters and find myself able to identify with them despite the idealized looks.The relationship between the two main characters is annoying at times. I can only take so much cutesy fluff in these shows and they seem to pack it into every episode. There is a dip of the typical drama you see in a lot of vampire stories as far as tortured star-crossed lovers go, and the plot device gets old fast.Unfortunately the character I like the least is Stefan. He is probably the least developed main character on the show. His actions are predictable and I find myself praying they'll either kick it up a notch or give him less screen time. I like to judge a show on it's own merit, however the actor is clearly emulating David Boreanaz in Angel, and as a long time fan of the Buffy-verse, this grates at me.I'm saying a lot of bad things here, so let me say that this is one of the better things to emerge out of the recent vampire trend. Why? It's addicting. In spite of all the irritations, I enjoy it overall. This is mostly thanks to the writers who throw curve balls and cliffhangers and keep ""Vampire Diaries"" genuinely entertaining.I'd like to note that my attempt to read the books that this show is based off of ended quickly, I thought the characters were obnoxious and the plot was simplistic. Since the book is typically touted as the better half when a show or movie is made, I wasn't expecting much when I started watching."
147,"i've followed the vampire diaries books for 9 years and this show is an abomination to the story. the actors are horrible, and so many things are just wrong with this. this show should have never been made, it does no justice for the story. Elena was a blonde and the guys playing stefan and damon... why? these guys are nothing like the characters except they have dark hair. this show needs to be stopped before it goes any farther. anyone who is a real fan of the story should agree with me. if you don't then im guessing your probably fans of the twighlight series (which is rediculace) and don't really understand the story. please for the sake of this story just stop making this show before it completely ruins the beauty of this story. from a loyal fan of the vampire diaries........"
148,"I started watching this as I had nothing else to watch, honestly it's pretty crap. 
All this crap about wanting Damon to leave or die and then all these opportunities to make that happen and it never does- kinda drives me insane and all the inconsistencise that happen in the story line. 
This show is a sad version of True Blood. Don't waste your time"
149,"Review of the whole show: This show started pretty solid. Yeah, it was teenage drama at times, but the plot and new character additions were nice and interesting. This show's downfall started after season 4. It became a sob fest, concentrated on who is going to romance who... It was so pathetic at times, that I fast-forwarded most of the running in circle dialogues. non- stop repetition. I'm a male, so withstanding this was pretty tedious to me (but I simply wanted to finish it, no matter what. Blame the OCD), but I know some girls that thought this was overly pathetic. In the end, I really don't recommend this show to anyone. Maybe if you are a Twilight fan, and like watching soap operas in general."
150,"No fence to Twilight but Vampire Diaries is by far better than all vampire stories. If you compare Twilight and Vampire Diaries, the one thing Twilight doesn't have is great actors. just saying. I love me some Kellen Lutz or Taylor Lautner, but still doesn't bet Vampire Diaries. I bet you if Vampire Diaries was a movie instead, people will love it even more than Twilight. Every actors and actress in this show are wonderful to watch. And the story line keeps you up on your feet. Ian is great playing Damon, better than his role in Lost. Where his acting skills was blah. As for Paul and Nene they make a great couple on screen, they have a great chemistry and i am loving the whole love triangle with Ian. If I was Nene I would be jumping up and down, upgrade from the guy she was with at the Degrassi."
151,"The Vampire Diaries starts out as yet another teen-drama. The main character is a 17 year old girl named Elena Gilbert, who's parents died four months prior in a car crash. She's now being taken care of by her aunt Jenna and lives with her younger, 15 year old brother Jeremy.Elena quickly meets a mysterious new boy, Stefan Salvatore. Immediately, they find themselves drawn to one another. Their romance blossoms while the two swoon over each other, and they become an item. Cue Stefan's older brother, the bad boy Damon who has returned to the Virginian town of Mystic Falls with a secret plan. He too, finds himself drawn to Elena and a love triangle starts to unfold. However Damon & Stefan hold a secret-they were both turned into vampires by an ex-girlfriend back in 1864. The ex-girlfriend, Katherine, happens to have Elena as her doppelganger. Add in a witchy best friend Bonnie, the comedic, sometimes shallow, relief Caroline, Elena's ex-boyfriend Matt, the history teacher Alaric who holds his own secrets, and Tyler, and you have an amazing supporting cast.The first 2-3 episodes are very average. They have their spectacular moments, but none of it really stands out. Don't be so quick to judge the show, however. Once you hit the sixth episode, the show really starts to get going. There's blood, romance, passion, betrayal, revenge, humor, everything someone could possibly want in a TV show. Some people write this show off as yet another teen-angst or a Twilight-wannabe (which is untrue, seeing how The Vampire Diaries books came out almost fifteen years BEFORE Twilight) but they are wrong. These vampires don't sparkle for one, and the characters don't run around acting constipated."
152,"I started watching this show and immediately became hooked. The season started off alittle cheesy but got better with each episode. Every episode left me wanting more. I gave this show a shot because I am a Twilight fan, but soon realized that they are completely different and in fact, I enjoy TVD much more. I enjoy the chemistry between Nina and Paul. They do a fantastic job of portraying Stefan and Elena. And then there is Ian. He is a great actor, he brings Damon to life- (no pun intended)- with his charming good looks, his evil ways and his sense of humour. He gets better and better as the season progresses. He does a great job of switching between the evil brother who uses humans and throws them away, to the charming, sensitive guy who would do anything for Elena and her family. It is not just another teen love story, it is packed with action, werewolves, vampire battles, and witches. Speaking of witches- Bonnie's character is developing extremely well, I can't wait to see more. The show is intriguing, addicting and fun."
153,"At first I thought this show wasn't as good. But after comparing it to other new shows, and watching the second season I have to say this is almost a vampire classic, right next to Buffy.Every episode is clever from start to finish, the cast is great, and they keep adding more characters. It has it's occasional cheesy moments but so do all great shows, and here it's subtle.This is way better than Twilight and I hope it stays around for a while because I haven't watched one bad episode yet.What makes Diaries great is the writing/story which is never flawed. An example is that they've been bringing back a lot of my fav characters. Gives audience what they want."
154,"A big no from me. I will never understand the big buzz around Damon and Elena. This couple failed to deliver any sort of emotion to me, no passion, no chemistry, absolutely nothing, zero! All other relationships from the show were far more interesting than this one. Her's with Stefan, Alaric and Jo's, Bonnie and Enzo's, even the thing between Matt and Rebekah. Why on earth the writers made Elena love both Stefan and Damon, both real loves, is beyond me. I didn't buy it. And how everything happened only for Elena, and around her, or for her, it was suffocating to watch. Given 3 stars because of Caroline's character development, and of course for the appearance of the Originals, which was like a fresh breath for the show. And for me, Klaus stole the show, that type of villain that you absolutely hate to love, and how beautiful was his crush for Caroline, that's chemistry folks, not Damon and Elena. So, the only good thing about TVD is it's actual spin off - The Originals."
155,"Here's a list of what I liked and I didn't
Liked- Damon's humor, his friendship with Bonnie and Alaric,his bromance with Stefan. Character development of Caroline and Bonnie, Everything about Katherine and everything about Mikaelson family. And ofcourse Kai Parker.Disliked- ELENA GILBERT, people die but still they come back to life, hundreds and thousands years old vampires falling in love with teenagers, toxic relationships (Damon and Elena to be precise) and unnecessary drama"
156,"My favorite show to ever exist. It has drama, passion and great music. It really helped me get out of a depressing time in my life. This show is really amazing. I highly recommend to watch."
157,"I started watching it in 2010 and it was fine back then. Vampires were relatively new to the mainstream media after Twilight's success and the show was actually created well, comparing to other supernatural films or shows. But the things that started to happen later... Good God, people will come up with the most stupid plots, just to milk as much money from a show, as possible. The only reason I wanted to finish was that I hate leaving shows unfinished. Please, don't even start."
158,"Season 1 - 4 : 10/10
These seasons are one of the best seasons i have ever seen. Nina & ian did the best they can.Season 5 -8 : 7/10"
159,"If not for her character this show would be much more enjoyable. One of the most annoying characters ever created. Which is weird cause she started off Fine and Kathrine is awesome, Does always the female lead in vampire movies/shows be confused, irritating & annoying. I really felt happy with the initial Seasons but from S03, started hating Elena and it went to the core in S04. Just wanted to get that character killed so the show would had been fun.Request, all the story writers not to create any character like Elena. She is just disgusting,irritating."
160,"First off, I can tell you that this is not just a story about a love triangle involving two incredibly good looking vampires. I'm sure lots of people may assume it's just a rip-off version of twilight, but in reality it's a lot less glamorised and a lot more believable. Twilight shows unhealthy relationships (romantic and parental) and an unrealistic take on supernatural creatures. The vampire diaries includes a lot of romanctic relationships, but emphasises what's ok and what's not ok. Although the main character lost her parents before the pilot, she has a strong bond with her brother and other family and friends. Also, she often sacrifices herself for others and puts others needs before her own. This show isn't all about romance and sexy vampires, it's about family, friendship, loyalty, forgiveness and so many other things. During the 8 season run, there are countless things explored in TVD, and although the last couple of seasons weren't amazing, it keeps your interest throughout. This is definitely a show for teens and young adults, and probably wouldn't appeal to an older audience, but I think Julie Plec and the rest of the writers have done an almost perfect job in adapting this show from the book by L.J. Smith."
161,Give it a couple of episodes and then BAM it has been and always will be my favourite tv show for the rest of my life. The show definitely does get better and you go along! Producers and Actors have really outdone themselves this time. Every single person I have recommended this show to has come back to me saying that they are so glad that I told them to watch this. START WATCHING NOW!
162,"I'm not going to tell you what really got my attention (I hate spoiliers just as much as you ;) but this show really started to come to life half way through season 1! I was super excited to see that this is what was waiting for me. I honestly thought it was just some dumb teenage show but this deals with bigger issues. I never thought I would say this, but I love it! Please give it a good go! If you still don't like it at the END of season 1, than you can obviously move on. But it does get really good!"
163,Season 1-4 of TVD was the best thing I've watched. I LOVE it. But season 5 started going downhill straight away and there's something about S5-8 that just aren't the same. They're bad. Just my opinion.
164,"The Vampire Diaries .. alright , this show got me hooked since the first episode aired in my country; I started watching it frantically on the internet and I finished the first 2 seasons in 2 days. I totally adored it! It is the story of Elena Gilbert , who meets Stefan a handsome young man , but who isn't what it seems . He is a vampire, a pretty old vampire actually. He has a brother Damon , who is the ""bad"" brother and there is a love triangle. It seems a bit of a cliché but that changes. Having watched all the episodes that have come out until now , I see that the show has had its ups and downs . Till the 4th season , it was an amazing TV-show that you could not foresee what would happen next. However , in the 5th-6th season we have a downfall in the insterest of the storyline, and the TV- ratings fall dramatically and it is said that the show will end in its 7th season. In the 7th season though, we see a bit of ""the good old days of the tvd"", the storyline starts getting more intriguing , with the new characters and it is announced that the show will have one more season so as to finish the story properly. It is a really good TV-show , that has milions of fans worldwide , with an amazing cast and story (most of the time ). It deserves 8 stars even 9 if it wasn't the downfall , and hopes up that it will make the fans happy with a decent what the show deserves end."
165,"The vampire diaries is one of my favorite TV-shows.i think the first season was perfect and also second season got an excellent idea, i mean involving Werewolves to the story, but in third season there was a serious problem: (Stefan sired by Nicklaus) was very bad idea, and about 4th season i should say, changing Elena to a vampire (after 3 season) was very smart idea and finally in 5th season involving travelers to the story was good but i didn't like it so much. and about Elena Gilbert and she's boyfriends i should say breaking off with Stefan Salvatore and sleeping with Damon Salvatore wasn't good. and about doctor Maxfield i should say vampires are supernatural creatures, created by witches and there is nothing scientific about vampires."
166,"This is a vampire story which takes place in Mystic Falls, USA. After losing her parents in a terrible car accident, the main character Elena Gilbert meets an extraordinary handsome newcomer at school : Stephen Salvatore. She immediately falls in love with him and discovers that him and his brother, Damon, are actually vampires. As a result of that love against nature, she will have to face a lot of problems and losses, discovering a horrible truth about her own family. I strongly recommend this series full of mystery and passion. It is the best series I've ever seen. I found it impossible to put down. The intrigue never ends, there is always new surprises that the team has to resolve. I would suggest you to start watching it."
167,"Let me first warn you to not judge the show after watching only the first 2-3 episodes. Those first episodes give the impression that this will be a crappy romance series like Twilight. After episode 4 though, you start to realize that it might turn out pretty good. Well unfortunately, it doesn't turn out pretty good but it turns out decent and watchable.This show includes Twilight-like romance but unlike the crap that is Twilight, vampires are actually vampire-like(although still not as dark as they should be) and it has decent action and mystery. In addition to vampires, it also has some other usual supernaturals like werewolves and witches. I think this show can be best described as a Twilight-True Blood hybrid that is not as bad as Twilight or as good as True Blood. It is also sort of like Buffy as the main character has a witch-vampire support team but unlike Buffy, this show is more serious and lacks the humorous charm and originality of Buffy.All in all, I give this a 6/10. Certainly watchable if you like vampire shows and have already watched better ones like Buffy and True Blood."
168,"I find it unbelievable that this show (while it can get tedious at times) continues to be good, while that Twilight garbage rakes in millions at the box office, even though the movies get sub-par ratings. I've watched parts of the first two and they are awful. Stephanie Meyers is a hack writer, and I cannot believe they are making ""The Host"" into a feature film (I've read it and New Moon, and both are juvenile at best). Nina Dobrev and Kat Graham act circles around Kristen Stewart, and the actors portraying Klaus, Elijah, and the dear departed Alaric are all amazing. The show's weak points are Jeremy, Matt, the iffy Tyler, but the absolute worst character is Paul Wesley's Stefan. He was a bad actor in the soap operas and he's a bad actor now. Like Robert Pattinson, he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. The shining gems are Ian Somerhalder as the perfect damned-angel (I knew he was a star when he was on Law & Order), not really looking for redemption, but with a wonderful good streak, and the surprising Candice Accola, who is just perfect as Caroline, and wish she was a bigger bad-ass (she is when she shows up!) and a bigger part of the story."
169,"This show has all of the stereotypical vampire bits -- the moody, wealthy, impossibly romantic and gorgeous hero who instantly falls in love with a girl who reminds him of his Dead True Love, the teenage girl forced to grow up too soon because of tragedy, the vampire who revels in his inhumanity who nonetheless shares a past with our hero that makes it impossible to kill him, the spooky manor house, the complete stupidity of everyone in the town, etc. It's all been done before -- this show is a mash-up of Twilight, Angel, Buffy, and Dark Shadows. Everyone is very pretty, but no one here is more than a passable actor, and the scripts are laughable. I've lost count of the times a purported teenager says, ""It happened a very long time ago."" Please, they're supposed to be 18, tops. Nothing happened to them a very long time ago. None of the actors look remotely like high school kids, and having a black girl playing the descendant of Salem witches is ridiculous. I was really hoping for better."
170,"OK so I'm a huge vampire/werewolf fan. I love almost everything in that genre but honestly Twilight ruined it for me... Stephanie Meyer destroyed the way vampires are supposed to be, there not supposed to sparkle, etc...I don't want to get started on that but anyways back to Vampire Diaries.I saw a preview and I thought ""oh goodness a twilight show"". But I decided to give it a chance and I really enjoyed it. The vampire brothers had the original vampire characteristics and it had a dark eerie feel. Paul Wesley is an amazing actor and I think he plays Stefan well, Damon does a really good job as the ""evil"" brother but I'm hoping they'll show a different side to him so it won't be so predictable. And to all of you thinking that it's a twilight rip off, the books were written a decade before twilight so lay off.The only thing that slightly turns me off is the whole ""Dear Diary"" thing but I don't think there's much we can do about that. Overall I loved it and can't wait for the rest of the season."
171,"I thought the pilot was really good. The acting was scores better than twilight. Nina is really good. The special effect also seemed better than those in twilight (the vampire running scenes in twilight look crap). The dialogue was believable and didn't seem forced and in general it was really well done for a TV show. Way better than I expected. I agree the characters are almost ridiculously good looking (I mean why not throw in a few ugly people just for good measure). I didn't find it a big deal there are some differences from the book, there almost always are especially when you consider this was made with the intention of being a weekly television program. Nina is such a good actress her hair colour really doesn't matter. Just take the show for what it is, its inspired by the books but obviously if its going to be on every week the plots are going to have to be a little different . . . It's not really like say the twilight movies which are recreating the twilight books it was just inspired by the Vampire Diaries so just relax and enjoy it for what it is, instead of whinging over what it isn't.better than I expected, not too cheesy considering how badly it might have turned out."
172,Omg I love this show I thought I will hate because of twilight but I was wrong. The acting and storylines are decent.I will rate it perfect if it didn't go downhill after season 4 and if elena was not being stupid half the time
173,"If you're looking to the reviews we give, I would say stop it and GO start watching the series. This is THE best tv show I've ever watched. It teaches us alot about friendship, love, brotherhood. As compared to twilight saga, this tv show is completely underrated. Since I've watched both of the series, I find TVD way more better. I definitely recommend this show to everyone who watch TV Shows.
Exceptional!"
174,It's a masterpiece you can't miss watching it it's so dramatic and emotional and heartbreaking
175,"I first started TVD when I was in high school and it first came out. I remembered it being okay but I kind of forgot about it after season 1. I had heard good things so decided to come back and give it another try and I can only say that I'm so glad I did. The least believable thing about this show is that most of these people are suppose to be high school students but other than that it does an amazing job of pulling you into the life of the characters. They are all just as complex as the world which they inhabit. When you look past all the supernatural and dramatic elements of the show it is, at its core, about humanity, friendship, loss, and love. I'm half way through the series and can't get enough. Also totally rooting for Damon and Elena!"
176,A story filled with action and emotion . The characters are growing and evolving each and every episode. Everything is just perfect and above all nothing is expected. Amazing plot twists which make it really interesting and addicting .
177,I can't tell specifically anything because every scene of TVD placed in my heart . Season 1-6 is the best period. Season 7 was okay. I watch season 7 only for Stefan and Caroline. I can't say anything about season 8. You'll find it yourself 😊
178,"Hello, brother. (Sorry, I had to.)First of all, here's your daily reminder that The Vampire Diaries books came YEARS BEFORE TWILIGHT. Also, I'm sorry, but Twilight is just... no. There's literally no plot line in that movie other than cliches that have existed wayyyyy before any of those books were written.Despite starting off this show hating vampires BECAUSE of the Twilight craze, here's my take on it:After season one (especially the first few episodes, which are annoyingly cliche), the show only gets better (ignoring the season five and eight big bads. we don't talk about them). It tells the story of ""the good brother"" Stefan, who we learn isn't all rainbows and glitter (looking at you, Edward), and ""the bad brother"" Damon, who's sarcastic and literally amazing despite his murderous tendencies (yeah, they're both toxic, and yeah, I don't care because LOOK AT THEM). It gets less and less cliche as the story goes on (we stan character development) and new characters- even villains- add more and more to the show and end up (even after generally killing a couple secondary characters) becoming beloved by audiences. The one character, unfortunately, that does NOT develop- like, at all. He literally goes backwards- is the token human, Matt Donovan (if you've watched the pilot, you're probably thinking, ""how could the quarterback who asks if his ex is asking about him despite her parents having JUST DIED go BACKWARDS in character development??"" yeah, I know, right?)Despite that, TVD is filled with amazing actors (including Zach Roerig, though Matt is still a moron) for all roles, evil yet hilarious characters, and non-repetitive plot lines (shocking for the CW, I know). So even if you're hesitant, or you despise vampire shows and movies with all your soul, or you live under a literal rock- give it a try. You'll be hooked once you reach season two, I promise. Even with stupid Matt Donovan (seeing clips of him crying is the highlight of my day)."
179,"TVD came out from a 2000s fantasy craze with shows/movies like Twilight, Teen Wolf, LOTR, Harry Potter, Supernatural, New Blood, Charmed, etc gaining popularity and its own niche of fans. Quite frankly, even though after over 3 years since the show ended, i can barely remember the plot of the show, but the writers did a nice job with the material that made me stick with it from 2010 till the show ended.The history induced with the show gave the show a ""larger than HS life"" outlook which i loved and respected. Season 1 was the only season with a somewhat HS predominant vibe, but after it became part of the background. Probably the best part of the show was it's character development with the introduction of the oroginals in season 2, and the most interesting arc being Damon's, Katherine's, and Nicklaus'. The main character, Elena Gilbert, is very bland and probably the worst recurring character in the whole show. She is a stark comparison to Bella from Twilight and her most special feature is that she's a doppelganger.As for the plot, it had its high and lows. S2-S4 were the best imo. S5-S6 had it up and downs. And S7-S8 was not that good. The show could have easily ended after S4 after Elena graduated high school and the originals left but the ""Show must go on"" mentality usually ends up milking these good shows. Surprisingly, even at its worst, it wasn't that bad but by S7 I think most viewers were done with the show. The romance is a huge factor in this show and it controls character development as well as the plot but its nothing cheesy like Twilight. After S1, it becomes more complicated with a more adult outlook and we see revolving doors of romantic entanglements and much better matches as the show became more seasoned.TL DR: Solid show but tbh, it's nothing great. Definitely has its moments tho but I cant recommend the show because of its 8 seasons. If the show was still going on? Maybe. But now that the show has ended? Definitely not. From the highest viewership pilot debut in CW history, the ratings definitely dropped over the years and by S5, it was mostly the fans that started the show in 09-10 that wanted to see how it would all end. But in all fairness, it was a really good show that i dont regret watching. The characters in this universe are amazing and will have a special place in my heart forever. Damon, Nicklaus, Elijah, Stefan, Bonnie, etc. Damon and Bonnie's friendship was definitely was of the best features of the 2nd half of TVD. The Originals being spinoff of TVD carries the torch and a similar quality that we last saw in S4 of TVD."
180,"Addictive show. Love Ian somerhalder
Cant stop watching it"
181,"I watched this since it came out, but i stopeed watching the 3 last seasons because the story wasn't the same as the beginning but with some time now i rewatched again and i love it, of course some seasons are better then the others, mas it's a good series. The only thing i don't agree is with stefan, he deserved so much more!!!"
182,"The first 6½ season are REALLY good but it then downfalls into a sad ending. I think it all went downhill once nina dobrev decided to leave and the producers had to change the script. So we can't blame them, but still the ending could've been way better.
The ending didnt do justice to the characters. Other than damon and elena none of the other characters got their happy endings. And I also think that damon and elena wouldn't be that happy with each other. Stephen WAS the right choice. Damon is just not right as human he should've lived for eternity living his life to the fullest giving love chance and staying away from darkness.all of them should've.
Stephen dying was sad,unnecessary and downright awful. Bonnie deserved the best ending out of all the characters and got one of the worst. Stereline was not a good couple not good enough to end up with each other (until Stephen died).
Am 8 year series should've had an epic ending but it didn't and its very sad but that cant let is forget the very good 6 years it ran for.
In the end tvd was a good show with lots of twists and turns and I do believe that If nina hadn't left this could've been one of the best shows ever but whats done is done. All we can do now, is watch the originals."
183,"The first few seasons are pretty amazing, atleast until season 4. Things start going downhill after that as the same trope and twists are repeated over and over again with nothing shocking the audience anymore. The relationships are amazing and the characters are great. The last season and the ending was a huge letdown for me as I was rooting some of the characters to end up together."
184,This is an epic vampire show! So many twists and turns and I love all the characters. So well done. This will always be a favorite!
185,It is one of the best web series i have ec=ver watched
186,I am not joking this show is just best.the best vampire or supernatural tv show.whatch it and see yourself.
187,This is the best show ever. Although ending wasn't fair at all. But is really good show. It just attaches the emotion.
188,"I didn't watch the vampire diaries 2009 but have seen it now. I really loved the series, it nearly ever got boring, it was always something new. To my dilemma, I really really hated the way everybody treated Damon. Everyone had always something bad to spit in his face. I couldn't like the other characters just because of that (except for Stephan and Elena who grew under the time).
This never ending nagging about how abhorrent and repulsive he was and how glorious they were.
In the beginning I didn't thought of that but after a while I was almost furious about it. But overall this was a super great serie and I'm glad that I watched it 👍😊"
189,"Amazing show. Definitely number one on my favorite shows list! Romance, mystery, adventure, action. Everything I personally need in a show"
190,"TVD is, to me, the best example of a well-made long-running show. 8 seasons, 171 episodes, and yet absolutely no arc felt boring. So many series just go downhill after two seasons and lose themselves in nonsense plots, but TVD kept on being interesting and well-made.It starts as a regular teen drama, and for me who's used to British series, seeing 25+ actors play 17 year-olds felt weird. But TVD switches very quickly from teen to young adult, and overall, the whole series is way more mature than you'd expect. The whole universe and lore is super developped and interesting, most of the characters are neither entirely good or entirely bad, and you get attached to many of them.It's a bit difficult for me to review TVD, because it basically became a massive part of my life. But I think that even this fact shows something about it...The Vampires Diaries in one word: fascinating."
191,"TVD was a beautiful and interesting series as long as Damon and Katherine were in it together.Unfortunately, as soon as they 'forgot' about Katherine by whatever silly reason that was in their head, not understanding her superb potential, awesome character, poisonous beauty and strong acting and got rid of Elena as well, who was sometimes flat but always contributed to the core of the series, it went downhill like a jet.
After that they never managed to lift it up and it ended miserably after 8 seasons.A word about Damon (Ian Somerhalder), his eyes are the most magnetic eyes in all Hollywood and maybe in the top ten of the whole world.
As a user put it correctly and I tend to agree with it, he is the living proof that vampires exist in real life. He doesn't age, he is crazy handsome, attractive and can mesmerize you with just one look.May destiny reunite Damon, Katherine and Elena together for our bliss..."
192,This show has been my favourite for years. I've seen it so many times that I even know the lines. Season 1-6 are strong. Season 7 and 8 are okay. Still love this show overall.
193,"I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a ""girls"" show. man was a wrong. i got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying ""1 more"" when it ended. the characters were fantastic, had great development, and were just overall badass. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional.through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorites. in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development. bonnie was a bad guy, and rebekah(the original sister) never seemed as evil as the others and was the first to want to change her life for the better.during season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. and alaric said ""i miss you to buddy""., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. i never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me."
194,"In the Factual Errors of this page it states that one of the reasons that the actors are actually older than teens is because it gives young teens someone to look up to. I would NOT say this show is a good example for teens to refer to. These actors are anything but role models. This show may have a fantastical theme with Vampires, werewolves, and witches, but beyond that the material is adult themed and parents should be wary. Loose morals runs rampant on this show.Aside from that, I like this better than Twilight. I read all the Twilight books and watched all the movies in an effort to connect with my daughter at the time and it was agonizing. The only redeeming quality of Twilight were the special effects in the movies. Stephanie Meyer is a one hit wonder of the literary realm. Vampire Diaries, the spin offs The Originals & Legacies are much better. More grounded and not sappy."
195,This show is slighty teenager based to start with. But if you give it a chance and get past episode 6 then the story takes hold. Its got vampires witches werewolf hybrids originals the devil and heretics. A great mixture of supernatural beings. The acting is really good with drama and comedy and of course ian somerhalder his portrayal of damon is excellent
196,This show I've been watching for more than a year and I'm deeply in love with this show especially with damon and klaus... This show has a perfect mixture of love horror friendship sacrifice important decisions and the grief of losing your loved ones... I simply can't explain how much I love this show and considering it's the first tv series I've watched... I may get better series but it will remain my favorite for my whole life
197,I rewatch this every 3 months it's just so amazingly perfect and it led to the spinoff the originals and then the spinoff legacies which all are amazing like I'm rewatching it know
198,Excellent série Julie Plec ensures serions travel in this worldIt's really good!
199,One of the best shows I've ever seen it's original and addictive when started this show I was expecting it to a regular teen drama series but the creators really out did then selves I was impressed
200,"6.5/10
I loved the premise of this series and it was totally satisfying...it gave me exactly what I wanted. But a few seasons in it was borderline ridiculous. But then, it was just plain ridiculous....people dying and coming back to life, witches, Originals, werewolves, ghosts, and a main character that just cannot seem to pick between which brother she likes more. It would touch on serious subjects and then fall right back into teeny bopper jealousy issues. I became bored and I gave up around season 5...and that was pushing it :/"
201,"I definitely loved the development the show got on each season and on each episode ... Each season TVD turnt being more mature,darker and deeper. That's really the best Vampire Show ever, although the most successful too. Thanks a lot CW Company ..."
202,"The show os very good, mature, dark and very deep. TVD of course got something special in people who watch it. Congrats for CW Company."
203,"When i first started watching this show a few years back i thought it would be some kind of rip off from the movie ""Twilight"", but it turned out to be so much more. Some people, those who are tv series addicts specifically would understand how it is to start watching a show and getting so attached to it and the end you have to say goodbye to it. Personally i loved ""The Vampire Diaries"" and i still do, and i still sometimes think about it even if it ended about an year ago, because this show was that good. There are some things in life that just grow beside you, and there are some things that unfortunately come to the end, no matter how much you don't want to. This show follows a simple girl next door Elena Gilbert, who struggles to get her life together after her parent's death and tries to make her life good and happy in a town called Mystic Falls who is filled with creatures of the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Witches. Enter Stefan Salvatore, the guy who will make drastic changes in Elena's life, he is the new boy at her school, mysterious, and a vampire. But there is no Stefan if there is no Damon, enter Damon, Stefan's also vampire brother who has his own personal agenda and totally pulls off the bad boy look. This show will make you laugh, cry, you will feel so many emotions while watching it. It will be kind of overwhelming. This show will never disappoint me no matter how many times i watch it and i hope you will feel the same, because in the end you will feel epic."
204,"Like many tv series that stretches out for many seasons, the start to the series was interesting as we are introduced to the characters and the backstories. it's fun to understand the setting and the newness of the premise of the show. i really did enjoy the earlier part of this series. for those who are inclined to enjoy teen romances and fantasy, this is a good series!but as the seasons roll along, it become repetitive and quite boring. there is either too little character development or simply just illogical choices that characters make. what makes the series interesting essentially dissipates and there is little newness tot the series."
205,I have to say this is the best TV series ever. I haven't read the books but i really find it enjoyable. Paul Wesly is a great actor and so god looking. The only problem i have with it is the whole murdering thing at the beginning of Vampire diaries. All the actors are doing a really good job and hopefully there is going to be more episodes as i am looking forward to them. I can definitely say that this show is a lot better tan twilight. I mean twilight was OK but Vampire Diaries makes people actually want to watch it more and more and i know i would watch it over and over again............... This is such a goo show and i really hope that they don't stop it from coming back to our screens.
206,The pilot for the vampire diaries was great. They chose good new actors and the way they set the story up works very well. They establish the background for the main character as well as some of the background for the vampire. It also establishes the villain of season one. So far the pilot seems like a great start to a great show. I recommend that everyone checks it out at cwtv.com if you missed the pilot.It also seems like they did a good job scoring the pilot episode as well. So far everything about the show seems like it is right up cw's alley. As long as kevin williamson and the rest of the writers on the project continue to deliver I think that the vampire diaries is going to have a good run on the cw.
207,"I must strongly disagree with the previous comment. I thought even just the pilot episode of The Vampire Diaries *worlds* better than the Twilight movie (and I use that last term loosely, indeed). Granted, this is a program coming in late on the whole vampires-sell bus, but from what I've seen (as I have *not* read any of the books on which it is probably loosely based), it still carries enough difference in mythology and character development to add something to the genre. It's redundant only if you're a fan of Twilight. If you're not, then it's an improvement.It's not True Blood, and it's not Twilight, or Moonlight, or Buffy, or Forever Knight, or any of the other countless vampire-centric stories. If you go in expecting something you've already seen, or some kind of exact replica of the books, let's face it, you're already setting yourself up for disappointment. Look at it for what it is. I did, and quite enjoyed it (cheesy moments and all).The characters are somewhat stereotypical, but that happens quite often in the beginning of a series. At least we get motivations and some depth to these people. There's room for them to grow. Elena has a reason to be sad. Stefan (who no way looks like a teenager, but maybe you can chalk that up to vampire glamor, or something) is believable as someone who's been ""alive"" for a very long time. Even the best friend, Bonnie, is unique and not the clichéd sidekick.I'm looking forward to seeing where this series goes. It's a CW creation, and their sci-fi/fantasy shows are usually pretty decent, if not downright brilliant. (I'm looking at you, Supernatural.) So enjoy, or don't, but don't say nobody warned you. It's called The Vampire Diaries, and it's a television program. Either get with it, or get over it."
208,"When i first hear about this show, i got really excited. Since i have read the books, and i liked it, even though its a vampire genre, the book was pretty good. I expected it to change the story around, but not like what they have done now. Some important characters are missing, characters are different from what they are based on in the book, and events have changed that are also very important with The Vampire Diaries series.Also the acting is horrible. Every single one of them. The script is horribly written. I don't think it'll last for a season, but it might because it so closely related with Twilight, that screaming Edward Cullen fans will also scream for the Salvator brothers.So basically don't watch this show, unless you liked/loved Twilight, because Twilight was excruciatingly painful to watch, and so is this."
209,"I didn't expect much going in. I mean, a teenage (wait, are they teenagers?) vampire love story that I've read/watched so many times I can predict every turn of the plot from a mile away. And it's on CW. I guess that was also fair warning of the shower of a show I was about to dive headfirst into.I must admit to watching only one half hour of the program, but that was enough to give me a proper assessment. Banal characters that fall flat on the screen, hackneyed dialogue existent in most dramas, and the plot- well, it came late to the party.Said plot happened to pop up near the end of the episode, with a recent development in the series that was more-than expected and less-than-satisfying.The show is The Vampire Diaries, right? Well, about five minutes before the ending credits, we get a glazed over display of some blood-sucking and a brief mentioning of cadavers drained of blood. 'Vampires' didn't seem to come up at all.I know that I only watched thirty minutes, but that was because I was waiting for that mention of vampires, all the while listening to the whining of characters whom -as far as I can tell- have nothing to do with the story this show claims to possess.In summation, I give The Vampire Diaries a 'meh' accompanied with a roll of the eyes."
210,"Initially, i must say that i was bored with the pilot episodes of this great show and i admit i fell asleep one too many times trying to watch it but then i managed to see through to episode four and there it was, the real drama began, i was hooked.I must say that this show doesn't try to impress twihards or true blood fans, it is on a class of it's own,exploring the myths and folklores of vampires,werewolves(lycanthropes),witches as the supernatural forces that thrive in fictional Mystic falls. By the end of the season One, i had become an addict and when the doppleganger,Kathrine was introduced, i was just blown away by the sheer genius of the scripts.The acting is indeed great,Ian Somerholder retains his mean ass looks as does his affectionate brother Paul Wesley and Nina Dobrev,remains enchantingly sweet.I highly recommend the show to anyone who is guilty of Vamp-tastic loving,twilight and True blood not withstanding and i give it a 9.5/10 rating,my best indeed so far"
211,"SPOILER ALERT: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS AND DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM DON'T READ THIS. THIS POST TALKS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THINGS CHANGED ON THE SHOW.After seeing the series I decided to read the books and we are talking an entire world of difference. I love the first three books and had a really hard time reading the other 2 because of the 3rd book ending, but well worth the time. The adding of a brother didn't bother me so much because I see the advantage of having the interaction with his character. I don't understand why they cut out Meredith which plays a pretty important part of the book. Now after seeing Episode 9 it seems that they are going to merge Alaric(who is not a vampire) with Klaus(who is), which I won't go into. If you read the books you know what I'm talking about. But it looks like the series is setting up to make Alaric a vampire. I really hope though that they head towards Katherine again because that's what made the books get really good... but I don't see them doing more than 2 seasons... 3 tops. But to anyone considering reading the books... fair warning: After book 3 the series gets really weird and kind of stupid. I have to admit... normally the book is always better than the screen, but in this case... The Show Is Waaayyyy Better Than The Books."
212,"I was so impressed with these programmes that I just had to write on here and rave about it. I had read the books long before it was released and was sceptical at the idea but now I follow it on facebook, re-read the books for my daily dose and re-watch the shows! Don't get me wrong the programme has many differences from the books and they have not kept to the story line but the way in which they have executed it has been done very well and so you will find you forgive them on this.The casting has been done perfectly and although the characters may not look exactly as those in the book the way in which they act, they way they relate to each other and even the twang to their voices fits with the original books to begin with.I would and have recommended this to countless people and the few friends I have persuaded to watch it are so glad I did. I would recommend to anyone who loves the Twilight Saga or any vampire romance novels for that matter. I also think fans of Gossip Girl, 90210, Dirty Sexy Money and Privelleged will love this programme. It has all the elements to be a success and I think with the right advertising and backing this programme could be a huge success."
213,"So let me start that i'm a huge Vampire fan, love the genre, i love the chemistry between the brothers, Elena has a very likeable start, you even feel bad for her, this is nothing like Twilight, there's no glowing bodies and that sort. Ian somerhalder plays the bad vampire that truly is a monster. Throughout the 8 seasons you will see amazing character development for the brothers.A must see show."
214,"I thought that this show might give an alternative to the normal hum drum; however, I was more and more disappointed as the series progressed. first, Jeremy and Rebecca's poor immature performances, esp his hunter crap. then Klaus, and Elena's change, then the prissy shewolf and the professor. Bonnie is a poor excuse for her character. really? always choosing and betraying friends and then being sorry you did it?the final was Elena and Damon's paring. really? brothers fighting over one girl? she is so pathetic as a character and actor!!! so stale!!!everyone has an ulterior motive, no matter what! everything about the show is devious and underhanded. its no where near believable!!!!!!!"
215,"Not as bad as Twilight (The last movie really sucked) but still very predictable, First time I saw this show I knew that bimbo Elena would become a vampire eventually.It has become totally cliché with these vampire TV and movies nowadays.That's why I liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer true she fell in love with two vampires but that show was still superior and it had way more depth.How people keep falling for all these Pro-Vampire shows/Movies is beyond me.But I guess there is some morbid charm in the girl (allways some moronic girl for some reason?) that meet and fall in love with some undead bloodsucker.Why can't script writers come up with some originality for once?"
216,"This is my first review ever on one of my favorite shows. I remember watching TVD years ago and really grew up with these characters. Most of the life lessons are here, love, family, friendship, trust, loyalty, betrayal, etc. I love all of their characters especially Jeremy, Alaric, and other more people that died. This show has almost been a part of me. The house has so much story and memories to it that when Elena burnt it down, I feel like it burnt a whole in my heart that used to carry all these characters with me. I feel so sad and I know this is a new chapter in the TVD. I understand where the writers are going with this and they are definitely going deep and further away from essence of the Vampire Diaries that I used to love. I'm sad to say this but I feel like I lost so much and I might not feel the same way I felt about TVD years ago. Goodbye friend, Goodbye love.."
217,"i have been watching lots of TV shows past few years.but this is the best i watched so far.few reasons to say so.the story arc is splendid,i like it as same as the plot and twists in prison break or 24.and the element of fantasy is best,vampires is the best of legends, and in that respect this in same league with game of thrones(in my opinion).and cast and acting is marvelous,specially Nina Dobrev. Most episodes are action packed,most episodes are as intense and full of action as a season finale in another TV show. No one with a true sense of suspense and entertainment can refuse this after even the pilot!!!and as the story goes on the plot become more intense and deep. with its element of fantasy anything can happen,there is not a moment we could get bored.and i also haven't seen episodes dedicated for just having fun,so the season can have a few more episodes.every episode contribute to the plot.and i really feel like complaining that some episodes contain the plot that could easily occupy at least 2 episodes."
218,"The premises: The Vampire Diaries (TVD) centers around Elena,a high school student that has just lost her parents in a car accident. Soon she finds herself falling in love with the mysterious new guy in town, Stefan, not knowing what is in store for her...What i like most about this show is that every character has a story of his own and in time you find out every perspective relating to the events. You are constantly made to change your mind about what you thought about someone and you are made to understand the motivation beyond the characters' decisions and actions. You will at some point realize that even what you thought as being good and evil is relative..Besides, I am not a fan of vampire movies and series, but I really like how they are depicted in this show.On the minus side, what ruins this show's credibility is the fact that most characters are supposed to be in high school. You might get passed that in the first season, but it can become really annoying in later episodes as you can clearly see they are older than that and some things just seem out of place.Anyway, I really recommend it to teens that want to be entertained every Thursday evening."
219,"I am currently in love with The Vampire Diaries. I do admit that the first few episodes of season 1 were slightly pointless and boring but somewhere in between episodes 3 and 4 the show really hit off. It proved all those people who bad mouthed it wrong. It has great characters and even better story lines. Definitely worth watching. If you are a big fan of the show read the books. They are very different but are definitely worth a read. I love the series and can not believe how much it has separated from Twilight, despite the obvious comparisons. The vampires are scary (and don't sparkle) and it can be very gruesome when it needs to be. Over all I would say it started out as a 6.5/10 and is now a 10/10. I can not wait until season 3."
220,"Based off the best selling book series by L.J. Smith, The Vampire Diaries takes place in the remote town of Mystic Falls, and follows one 17 year old girl, Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a girl crippled by the death of her parents and forced to come to terms with her devastated brother Jeremy (Steven R. Mcqueen) and eccentric but incapable Aunt Jenna (Sarah Canning) attempts to rebuild their broken family. Through it all, she falls in love with the new, mysterious boy in town, Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) who holds many secrets of his own. Stefan is a 154 year old vampire, returning to his home town in hopes of getting to know Elena, who bares a striking resemblance to the girl and vampire he fell in love with in 1864, Katherine Pierce (also played by Nina Dobrev). Close on his heels though is his diabolical and at times viciously evil brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder), determined to ruin Stefan's life in return for Stefan turning him in 1864, and stealing his love, Katherine. In this love story with a twist, Elena finds herself torn between her immediate love for Stefan and her curious budding friendship with Damon, and is forced into a world of secrets, past events, and mystery. With every moment, she begins to learn more about the terrible fate of not only her town, but herself, in this extremely vividly told story of life, love, and loss. The story itself is set in a quaint, seemingly innocent town filled with secrets, haunted by the supernatural. The Vampire Diaries sets itself apart from those vampire love stories before it with its cinematography, which is dark and mysterious, and compels the watcher into this vivid world. The script is extremely well written, full of twists and turns that keeps the watcher on their feet at all times and always thinking ahead, and the Salvatore house is brilliantly set up. The show is unlike those popular stories such as Twilight, and is deeply rooted with vampire folklore. In the Vampire Diaries, vampires can't walk in the sun without day rings, they are killed by a wooden stake to the heart, they are poisoned by vervain, they can compel humans, and they don't sparkle. Unlike the cliché's of such movies like Twilight, The Vampire Diaries follows true to vampire history, and is backed up by impressive special effects that will make you shiver in your seat. By far the best version of vampires i have seen portrayed yet, vividly real and believable in their history. It is perhaps though the acting that sets this show even more apart. Nina Dobrev is brilliant as Katherine, the evil, selfish, and truly deadly vampire who holds many secrets. It takes major chops to pull off the stone cold bitch with hidden passion and pain as well as Dobrev does, and she has undoubtedly set herself apart in the young Hollywood community with this performance. Elena is just as well played by Dobrev as the sweet girl next door with a hard backbone. Perhaps the most amazing scenes in the whole series are those between Katherine and Elena, as Dobrev manages to play polar opposites in the same scene to perfection. Ian Somerhalder also plays his role perfectly as the evil twin brother. There is no better actor for this role as Damon. He takes the killer role to new levels, developing softer undertones that make you both hate and love the character. It can be said that Dobrev and Somerhalder ultimately lead the show.Paul Wesley lends a strong performance as the good brother trying to hold on to his humanity. Although sometimes a little dull, Wesley shines in the emotional moments with Dobrev, and their chemistry binds the show together. He is very likable, and his emotional turmoil helps shape and round the character. Aside from the main characters, though, the story is built up just as well by the supporting characters. Sarah Canning plays the partying Aunt trying to become a responsible parent quite well, and its a shame she was killed. Michael Trevino is quite good as the werewolf struggling to come to terms, and Zach Roerig plays the sweet, caring Matt well. Kat Graham is very strong as Bonnie Bennett, Elena's best friend and a witch who struggles to differentiate right and wrong between her own destiny and her love for Elena and the vampires. The dark horse in the show is definitely Caroline Forbes, brought to life by the very talented Candice Accola. In the first season, she fell flat, but when she is turned into a vampire in the beginning of season 2 by Katherine, she evolves into one of the most lovable, witty, fun and interesting characters the show has. She is the perfect release the show needs, and lends interesting side stories that prove very addicting too. Insanely twisty, The Vampire Diaries is never the thing you'd expect. In the second season, stories evolved and characters developed as the writers stretched the possibilities to new limits. The flashback scenes of the brothers in 1864 are very effective at providing information, and specifically the England and Transylvania flashbacks of the 1400's are extremely exciting to watch, with great costumes and sets, and provide empathy for Katherine, once Katerina Petrova, who we begin to see suffered great losses that caused her inhumanity. This show defines addictive, and never disappoints in its promises. For those who think the previews are not what you get, your wrong. The Vampire Diaries is so full of new plots and stories that the action in the previews are nothing in relation to the actual thing. Compelling, addictive, very well acted and exciting to watch, the Vampire Diaries is one of the best shows on television. Though the first few episodes of season 1 lulled, the show quickly picked up. 9/10"
221,"I am a little behind on my TV watching and the DVR is getting rather full, so I decided to get caught up. I was only two episodes back on Vampire Diaries, and I have to admit I had seen some buzz on Twitter and was itching to know what was going on.If you watch the show and you have not caught up yet, you may want to save this article for later, because we are going to be discussing some serious spoilers! In a snapshot, Elena revives Elijah and finds out that he is Klaus's brother, and that Klaus wants to kill Elena to break the curse. The curse has been revealed to be specific to Klaus. He is a vampire-werewolf hybrid. The curse suppresses his werewolf side, which he wants to unleash to make him the only vampire werewolf hybrid in the world.In the big climax of the season, it is revealed that to break the curse Klaus must kill a vampire and a werewolf before he drinks Elena dry. This prompts the return of Tyler and his cohort Jules. Tyler and Caroline disappear and Damon assumes that they will be the sacrifice. Elena gives herself to Klaus, despite Stefan's objection. Damon goes to rescue them and ends up getting some unexpected assistance from Matt. Tyler and Caroline are freed, but due to the full moon Tyler begins to turn into a werewolf. Damon leaves to help Stefan, leaving Caroline and Matt to deal with Tyler.Back with Klaus, we discover that Caroline and Tyler were a distraction. The real victims are Tyler's werewolf friend Jules and Elena's sister Jenna, who was turned into a vampire just to crush Elena. Stefan offers to replace Jenna as the vampire sacrifice. Klaus accepts, but then turns the tables, and after staking Stefan, kills Jenna anyway. Klaus kills Jenna, Jules, and Elena, but believe it or not John, Elena's biological father, trades his soul for Elena's and dies. Despite the plan to take Klaus out, Elijah betrays Elena and Stefan, rescuing Klaus at the last moment.Ack! Well it only gets better in the final episode of season two. It turns out that Damon was bitten by Tyler and is now dying. Stefan finds Damon attempting suicide and locks him in the dungeon, vowing to find a cure. There are several revelations in this episode. Fist off, Stefan was not responsible for turning Damon, Katherine turned him before Stefan. We get closure for Caroline when Jeremy is shot by Caroline's mom. Bonnie and Rick take him to the witches to save him, while Caroline's mother realizes her daughter is not evil. Bonnie manages to save Jeremy's life, but there are consequences. It is not clear yet, but it looks like Jeremy can now see the dead.In the final an ultimate twist of fate, Stefan discovers that Klaus' blood is the only cure for Damon. Stefan makes a deal. He will work for Klaus as his ripper in return for the antidote. Klaus frees Katherine, who delivers the message to a terrified Elena and a dying Damon.Wow, this was a great season two end for Vampire Diaries. The writers did a superb job in keeping me on my toes. There were several revelations that had me yelling ""No way!"" in complete gleeful surprise! Awesome! They have hooked me for another year. I cannot wait for Vampire Diaries season three!Amy Romine BellaOnline's Prime Time TV Editorhttp://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art45898.asp"
222,"This Show is Great in the meaning of the word, new Era of vampires shows, nice story line and brilliant execution.Actually, what makes this show great is the brain wash ability which makes people forget what happened and in the other hand makes this show an untypical vampire story.This ability is the corner stone of this show and without it the whole story can be finished in almost Three Episodes !!!Handsome and Sexy crew also makes this show irresistible.The scenes and places also were in a very suitable and complete environment.Well done :-)"
223,"I am loving that movie! Nina Dobrev is a great actress! She is so young and already proved and successful. I am waiting with impatience every episode. Do you know how many are the episodes of The Vampire Diaries? Are they only 22? I would be very grateful if someone could advice me with such vampire moves. The Vampire Diaries's plot is very romantic and exciting, very interesting and thrilling! I would like to compare with pleasure the plot of True Blood and The Vampire Diaries. These two movies ""turnes"" me into vampire's movies fan. :-)))"
224,"This is the reason I started watching Vampire Diaries: A randomly stumbled-upon YouTube clip of Damon insulting Twilight and commending Anne Rice. I thought to myself - this show must think highly of itself. Now I have been an avid Twilight basher for many years (solely my opinion), and I know everyone tends to compare the two - but how can you not, with the vampire overload in the last few years? That being said, I had very low expectations of this show and watched the first episode out of boredom. What have we got? Human girl meets mysterious vampire guy in high school (this seems to be the trend). Lots of clichés, cheesy dialogue, generally a pretty bad pilot. I watched the second episode and it wasn't as bad, and the third could actually be called pretty decent. By the fourth I was hooked, and watched the first 10 episodes in 2 days (I was home sick in bed, haha). I really have to commend this show for having a strong-minded female lead that doesn't cry and try to kill herself when her boyfriend dumps her. Some people have called her naive, but she's 17 for Christ's sake! It's good that the show has moved away from a high-school drama to focusing on the town's history and it's supernatural roots. I think that some of the supporting characters (Matt and Caroline) need to either get interesting, or get out. As for the Salvatore brothers, their scenes are amazing and they have great chemistry, whether they're fighting or teasing each other. Damon rules, and is definitely the main reason I watch this show.Overall, this show is worth watching. It's probably one of the most entertaining PG-13 rated shows this season (I'm used to HBO, and any show that doesn't have tits and dongs flying all over the place and can still keep me interested has something going for it). This isn't True Blood, but it'll do until June."
225,"I watched the PILOT earlier tonight, and I must say I am not impressed. I wanted to like this show as I like Ian Somerhalder, but I cannot get past having vampires walking around in the sunlight. Also, why is a vampire spending so much time in high school? There is nothing new he can learn, and it makes for a bit of a pedophile storyline. I know this is an attempt to cash in on TWILIGHT, but if you like TWILIGHT, you will probably enjoy this. I, on the other hand, have decided this show is not for me and I will just be tuning into SUPERNATURAL on Thursday nights on The CW. Hopefully SMALLVILLE will return to Thursday and give a good line-up worth watching again on Thursdays."
226,"OK, I know what you're thinking. Ugh TWILIGHT. No. The Vampire Diaries is an entertaining, funny, dramatic show with lovable ( except Elena... dear god don't get me started on that girl.), complex characters and interesting story lines. The three main characters, Stefan, Elena and Damon and a number of secondary characters like Caroline all battle loss, curses, addiction, supernatural beings and foes in order to keep themselves content and safe and learn much more about vampire and supernatural history as the show goes . Although, I do find the love triangle TEDIOUS and I think it takes away from all the characters. And my only other problem is I think characterization on this show needs to be better. Damon, Stefan and Elena all need story lines that don't revolve so much around the love triangle in season 4. HOWEVER, if you can make it past some of the ridiculousness.. you'll love it and it to be a fun, entertaining show!"
227,"The plot is simple; been there done that type of scenario with two Vampire siblings fighting over that one perfect girl. Yet, for those who are tentative about giving this a viewing, I have to admit, you are missing out.Forget Twilight, this series, based on books by L. J. Smith were released more than a decade before Stephanie Meyers phenomenally successful high school vampire love fest and though the series differs from the original books, the foundation is the same.Kevin Williamson, the guy who inspired me to want to become a writer, thanks to the fantastically well scripted SCREAM, has seldom failed to deliver. Well, okay, you may remember CURSED but that will be a distant memory once the episodes of this TV series begin to filter in. And to add some spice, we have Julie Plec on the scene as co-creator and writer and seen as though she helped Wes Craven with certain aspects of SCREAM, you know this is destined for success, surely.But with a good writing team and a good channel backing this up, can we really expect to find a replacement for some of the fantastic series we have just witnessed? LOST is over, FLASHFORWARD was cancelled, HEROES turned out to be disappointing and so the cycle of TV series goes on. Thankfully I have SUPERNATURAL to keep me entertained. Well, the answer to my initial question is; definitely.Some may say this is like True Blood, and you could not be more wrong. A lot of people admire True Blood, me included, but where that series is crude, rude, foul and shocking, TVD turns out to be far more entertaining, enticing and mind boggling thanks to great writing, and a far more interesting plot and better characters.So to the real reason TVD is so appealing to me, a thirty year old Asian male; the cast. Yes, each episode gets better and better and I have to admit I have not had so much fun at a season finale since SUPERNATURAL season 1 finale or the LOST season 1 finale, but this array of brilliant yet virtually unknown actors is what makes TVD work.I could go into the plot a bit more but you'll have to watch the series to appreciate each and every surprise.Nina Dobrev is not only beautiful in a very modest way as both Katherine and Elena but a really good actress and an obviously perfect choice to play the feisty high school sweet heart and the murderous Vampire Queen. Though the character of Elena is written well, its Nina's sweet expressions and stunning beauty that help this character along throughout the series as heartache after heartache is thrown in her direction.Candice Accola is one I didn't take to earlier on. Yes, she too is very beautiful and a good actress but her typical, bitchy, heartless blonde character was initially far too stereotypical. But as the season grows, so does she and you can't help but fall in love with both Candice and her cute character Caroline. Katerina Graham however is by far the most impressive. Though her portrayal as Bonnie Bennet, the witch, is excellent, Kat Graham just has something in her eyes, a sparkle maybe that draws you to her. Bonnie does get a little confused when tragedy strikes close to home and for a period I didn't like where the character was going but all is forgiven towards the end and the threat she leaves for Stefan should provide some tasty powerful moments in season 2.The two vampire brothers are also excellent, though I do think that as the bad guy, Ian Somerhalder's Damon is far more interesting than the goody two shoe's Stefan. And I think I'll put that down to the actors themselves. Yes, girls love these two, but Ian has a come a long way from LOST's annoying Boone and developed his acting skills immensely and therefore Damon is a sure hit winner.The list goes on and on for the characters that appear. Tyler turns out to be a surprise package but Matt is somewhat predictable and though he's the typical nice guy, he's just too human. And isn't it strange how in a book, film or TV show about magical beings or beings with certain powers, the humans are too boring? Aunt Jenna is awesome and really cute and Alaric is yet another mysterious yet intriguing character.Vicki Donovan and Jeremy Gilbert however are two characters I just do not like, and the actors that play them are fantastic, therefore they portray their annoying avatar's with perfection. But an emotional teenage boy with issues just doesn't impress me. Get a life, grow up, leave Elena alone etc.Kelly Hu and Arielle Kebbel play some excellent brief characters and the entire history of Mystic Falls is very morbid yet ghastly, and both of those are actually positives.I may never forgive Kevin Williamson for what happens to Maltese Jow's Anna but I have to admit, I did not see that coming. The production on the show is brilliant as well and simple camera angles and special effects also help to make this a very intriguing show.Obviously, there are more characters, Isobel, being an extremely pleasing to the eyes beauty and there is far more to the series than just the actors, but whoever casted these guys should be congratulated. Let us hope that Kevin, Julie and their team can re-create the magic and give us a show that will stay around for a few more years.All the show needs now to top this off is for me to be cast in it. Ah, what a dream that would be. But apart from that, you have to give this a chance. It really is a very great show!"
228,"first of all if you don't want spoilers don't read this , because it might have !okay , so you decided to read this , well in my opinion it has a lot of similarities to twilight but it is much much better in the plot( oh and if your wondering i didn't read the books for twilight or for this so it doesn't bother me whether they made it the same) even though it has similarities , the similarities are so much more interesting in this show , like the fact that the main girl has two guys wanting her but here in my opinion i think Elena would never date Damon , she is sympathetic to him but does not feel for him in that way and the Damon isn't a werewolf of course ! the plot is really cool , I'm not going to give away too much of it because it would be much more exciting if you found out on your own! so go ahead , watch this show, if the first few episodes don't reel you in then don't mind , its like that at the beginning , my friend told me once "" don't make your mind up on a book before you've read the first 30 pages "" considering this , you should see at least 5 episodes before you get ""reeled in "" to this show , and if you still don't after that then you can go ahead and stop watching it"
229,"Since the release of Twilight, fans have been under the perception that vampires have marble hard skin and sparkle in the sun. Although I am an avid Twilight saga fan, the Vampire Diaries brings with it an accurate characteristics of vampires with crazy twisted plot lines and a star studded cast. Although it strikes similar comparisons to Twilight, it has originality where Twilight does not (sorry to disappoint Meyer fans!), and does not just feature some weak damsel in distress falling in love with a vampire.In this series you get to know Elena (Dobrev), the golden girl who seemingly had it all until her parents died. Enter Stefan (Wesley) and later Damon (Somerhalder), causing mysteries deaths in the town of Mystic Falls. Unbeknownst, Elena falls in love with Stefan and falls in trouble when she finds out he's a vampire (in Lost Girls). Episodes 1-6 deal with their budding relationship, and problems surrounding her friends, from witchery to love triangles (Caroline - Damon - Elena, Matt - Elena - Stefan), and is an excellent start to Episode 7, where vampirism escalates.This series surprises you by killing off Vicki in a cliff hanger episode from Lost Girls, and is the standout episode of the season. To further complicate the whole vampire issue, Damon kills Lexi, Stefan's long time friend. Alaric is introduced, with a hidden agenda, and in Episode 10, a whole new mystery plot in introduced whilst Elena and Stefan reach a new point in their relationship. However, things take a turn for the worse when Elena discovers the truth about Katherine (Damon & Stefan's ex).All the episodes are very well executed, as there is always something to be surprised about. Once you're hooked in, you can't miss a single episode otherwise you'll just get lost. This series proves you can integrate accurate vampire lore (and not be afraid to scary up vampires' faces!) with a mysterious love triangle (we all know it was Bella & Edward) and still have enough going on to include the subplot of Elena's friends (Mike, Jes & Ang get about 5 minutes of movie time right?). And the best part is, Elena has the emotional strength Bella lacks, so it doesn't look as pathetic.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed at first that it doesn't follow the books' events, but the directors and writers compensate by creating and excellent series!"
230,The cast is great! I'm not complaining. They act pretty well. They have nothing to do with Twilight as somebody before that wrote. When a movie is made of a book it's totally normal to be different. It's always like that. If it's exactly the same it would be just pointless. I really enjoyed watching it and probably other people did too. Well.. it's not perfect but it is definitely worth watching. I've noticed that people are always critical about all kinds of stuff and I think they're not right this time. This really deserves watching. The cast is great! I'm not complaining.

231,"The storyline sucked me in from the start. It's not easy to do that. The characters are developing nicely, especially considering it's a new show and it generally takes time for the cast to gel. Vampire shows are the rage right now and this one takes on a bit of a twist. The plot contains the usual school-age challenges and weaves in supernatural elements. My only complaint (as with most shows) is that they always hire extremely skinny actresses, once again perpetuating the body image issues that face a lot of our young people. How about hiring a lead actress who doesn't disappear when she turns sideways? Other than that usual issue, the show is very entertaining. Keep up the good work!"
232,"In the frenzy of the recent vampire craze, I could only assume a TV show (and a TV show on the CW, no less) called ""The Vampire Diaries"" could only be total bull, chock-full of teeny angst, dumbed down plot lines and, worst of all, terrible acting and dialogue. Now, before I continue, I'll mention I've never read the books, but I do not think having an understanding of the show or its characters should require me to read the books. A well-grounded show should be able to stand on its own. While this show isn't the greatest vampire-themed show out there, it surprisingly isn't the worst and actually held some redeeming qualities. As a vampire story lover since I was probably around 4 or 5 and saw Bela Lugosi portray Dracula, I've appreciated the many themes that various story tellers bring out in vampire tales. These days, pop culture seems to be veering more towards what I think of as the humanistic vampire, which is okay to a certain extent but when you rip out their fangs and make them sparkle under the sun it becomes a little too much for someone like me. (I'm referring to the Twilight series, of course.)While there is a lack of the horrifying vampire I'm more accustomed to in The Vampire Diaries, it's by no means on the same level as a series like Twilight. As I mentioned earlier, there are many themes with vampires, especially when you begin to make them more like us, the humans. And one of those themes is time, or in their case, being frozen in it, and that seems to be the most prevalent them in this particular story. If I had to sum up the premise of what I see so far as being the overall story, I'd say this is an example of history repeating itself and being trapped in the past, which can be a problem for a creature who is physically dead and unchanging. This was also a theme in Twilight, but the ultimate message there, as I saw it, was, ""Love is only good when its young, so die and freeze your body now so that you can have the best part of love for all of eternity."" We'll see what The Vampire Diaries ends up saying, but I have a hunch it won't be that ridiculous. (I'm hoping, anyway.)If I could change three things about this show, they would be 1) Setting. I hate the high school setting. But I get who this show is aimed at, so... 2) Soundtrack. It seems like they just take the 10 most popular songs on the radio that week and stick them in random areas of the episode. The music can make or break a scene, and in The Vampire Diaries's case, it usually breaks it. Some entire scenes are totally ruined because of the careless choice of music and, for that matter, poor editing. 3) I'd find some normal people for the show. Everyone is unrealistically good-looking. Another trend with vampire stories nowadays seems to lean more towards good-looking vampire leads. Okay. Fine. But does every kid in that high school need to have perfect skin, good facial features, nice clothes, well-groomed hair, etc? I don't remember everybody looking like that in high school. Let's bring in some realism here. Even the main character's aunt looks too young, and in some scenes I swear she looks like she should be going to high school along with girl lead character!Bottom line though: The Vampire Diaries is entertaining. It's still at the point where it can either go good or bad, and if it does go bad it will go that way real quick. For vampire fans, just know that there are two main kinds of vampires -demonic and humanistic- and these undead creatures are most certainly of the humanistic sort. But, hell, at least they don't sparkle."
233,"This series portrays the typical love story between a vampire and a human.
Despite the visible cliches, the series follows an interesting course of events.
I must say I quite enjoy the acting between the two Salvatore brothers and their relationship along with its backwards and forwards is probably the most interesting thing in the plot.
I didn't really appreciate the first two seasons along with the last two. I dare to say that I would easily live without the two last - the series would have a better ending with season 6.
In my opinion, seasons 7 and 8 were just about adding new characters and developments, leaving the end only to tie some loose ends.All in all, the series is a good entertaining show for those drawn to supernatural theories."
234,"I've watched this show through all the series probably around 10 times now as I'm an all time lover of it! The romance, the action, the storylines, EVERYTHING!! If you haven't hopped onto Netflix yet to watch this then I suggest you do so"
235,"Started off pretty great. The overall movie is not so bad, gets addicted a little bit in the middle of all. Drama between the two brothers and Elena gets so annoying, just choose one already! On every episode Damon and Stefan fight over/argue/discuss about Elena, would kill each other over Elena but in reality cant rlly let each other die, after 3 seasons it starts to feel too boring, tiring! Elena always cries, worries and convinces, cant choose between two brothers, always says she's trying to protect someone but when someone else tries to protect her she doesnt let them. Is she too selfish or selfless, i have no idea after all! Bonnie too always cries, pretty much every character in the movie is so selfless, it's unrealistic sometimes. EVERY TIME someone tries to save/do something, someone gets in danger/gets in a hostage and all gets thwarted. When everyone tries to save everyone, it gets in the way and in the end nothing really accomplishes, the villains usually win. Ugh... Just what im trying to say is the movie gets boring and boring. it could have been 5 seasons without some annoying teenage dramas."
236,Clever and sexy...but after season two it's nothing but nonsense...
237,"The whole point of being able to give feedback is to do just that. give positive or negative feedback about a show, in this case vampire diaries. the whole point of the show is that is it so unrealistic that is a sad impression of what could have been a great show. this show has been over since 2017 so it shouldn't be a big thing writing about the show.Jeremy, Rebecca, Katherine and Klaus characters are immature. the fact bonnie is the most unrealistic character makes her character a farce. there is magic in the world and her terrible abuse of showing what it could be is just terrible. she has gone crazy as does Elena's character just makes them probably the most unrealistic part of the show. yes, killing was part of the show but the killing of 36 innocent people to bring back all the evil, supposingly innocent people, makes the storyline just so much more unrealistic. having Elena go back and forth between brothers and the eventual paring with Damon makes the show clique and then having her turn off her humanity is just unrealistic because she burns everything. Bonnie's unhinging along with the professor supercrazy aka Silas, allowing so many deaths when she should be killing him but being so hellbent on her grandmother and always being so gullible to influence. it could have been a great show had it not been so fraught with violence, hypocrisy, and unrealistic stuff. Supernatural can be portrayed in a realistic way but not this one."
238,"Now the craze is going for The Vampire Diaries the last season has come to an end and it has gone straight to number one for the most views of a T.V show to date. The Vampire Diaries aired its last episode ever last night and many can't believe it has come to an end so why not watch it from the beginning all over again.After centuries of quarrelling, Stefan and Damon Salvatore return to their original hometown, of Mystic Falls Stefan, who gives off an intense and mysterious aura, instantly falls in love with Elena Gilbert but he has a substantial secret which he needs to keep. With his brother Damon returning to town he knows that it won't be long until his own life and other people's will turn upside down. Knowing that he has been at war with his brother since 1864 he is willing to do anything to protect his home, friends and family. After 171 episodes The Vampire Diaries has finally closed its doors to an eventful eight seasons. Spreading over eight years the show has been a part of many people's lives and will be missed dearly by fans. The last episode had many fans in tears as some people you have not seen for a long time like Elena (Nina Dobrev) and Jo (Jodi Lyn Okeefe) returned for the finale to say their final goodbyes to the fans.It is clearly shown that the last episode was delicately written by Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson to show what life was like after all the drama had gone and how the characters had changed from season one through to season eight. Even though the fangtastic T.V show has come to an end it will never be forgotten and it will go down in history as one of the most iconic T.V shows ever made and aired across the world.So is The Vampire Diaries the best T.V show ever? Well the only way to find out is to watch all of the season and yes I mean all eight from start to finish. With its compelling way of drawing people in, once you start watching the show you will be hooked and will not want to stop watching it. So what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? You should be watching the iconic T.V show now. So go!"
239,"At first glance the show looked like nothing more than a teenage overly dramatic drama, but it got better. The first season felt like a first season, not to complicated and not to boring. At this point I thought this is going to be just another mediocre show, then it suddenly got way better, and kept getting better.Now, you might be thinking this had to get bad, well it did get bad, very bad actually.So, how is this a great show then? Well, lets just say that it was weird, the show just got to a whole new level after a main character left, that's just weird right?"
240,"I love the vampire diaries starts off slow but every episode gets better and better. I am totally addicted! Definitely worth a watch First few episodes are OK but stick the first couple episodes out and you will love it. By the end of season one you are hooked... Im only on season 3 at the minute but its just getting better and better. gets more intense and bloody as the episodes go by with some good twists. Great storyline to all of the characters - Vampires, Witches, Werewolves, Hybrids, So much better than twilight and true blood. I love the twists and turns in this series. Its original, exciting and each episode has something unexpected"
241,"There is just something so appealing in the story to me. I just can't stop loving and watching the Vampire Diaries series! Whenever I'm finished with all the seasons, I give it a 2-3 month, if no new episodes have come out and I watch it all over again! The story is excellent and this is hands down my absolute TV show ever and I have watched many different TV shows! I really hope that they will continue for one more season and that they bring Elena back, I heard rumors about Damon leaving, really hope that that won't happen. I forever will adore this show!!!!!!! Some have said that the story is getting more and more boring, even more after Elena left, but I think that the producers and everyone behind the making of the show is still doing an excellent job at keeping the fans intrigued and excited! :)"
242,"A very good TV show which takes you away in an fantasy world of Vampires, Whitches and Werewolf's. The show is about some teenagers living in a small town in America and there (ab)normal lives filled with love, pain, school, and dead.. just like your normal life only with blood lusting vampires, killing werewolf's and brewing witches.. When you are watching this show you can imagine how it would be like if you are one of them and what you will do to help your friends or loved ones. This TV show will definitely take you away like no TV show did before. You don't have to like vampires or other fantasy creators to recognize yourself in one of the characters. It just could be your neighbor or schoolteacher.. Just watch the show and you know what i mean"
243,"I loooooove The Vampire Diaries. It's my all-time favorite show. Yes, I'm a big fan of vampires and I used to be that before also - but this show, it's so much more. The story lines never get boring (to me at least) and the production is so amazing. The cast and crew are so amazing. Everything's amazing! Couldn't get any better than this.Everyone complain about the writers being stupid (which is awful) and that the story line is too complicated and they're not happy about the ships (the couples) - this is season 5 I'm referring to now. Sure, the ships may not be what you want right now, but that's not the whole series. It's not what it's about. It's about the stories around Elena, Mystic Falls, the Salvatore brothers. And yes, the story line is complicated if you compare season 5 with season 1 and 2. But that's the whole point of a show - to keep it going. In order for things to happen, you need to get it moving. Nothing would happen if the story line stayed the same throughout all seasons. They need to have a new villain for each season just to keep things going. And that may complicate things, sure, but it keeps going. It's moving forward, it's not stuck in the same place (like Pretty Little Liars for example - sorry not sorry).It's hard to please an audience, the writers are doing the best they can and I love them for that. So I really don't see the problem here!Xoxo"
244,"Engaging, strong, great. The Vampire Diaries is one of the best shows in recent years. Great characters, perfect characterizations, excellent actors (especially Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev) and improves from season to season. Each episode ends with a twist, and it's impossible not fall in love for the characters, each one capable of transmitting emotions and ambiguity at the same time. It's a powerful TV serial to look every week and not to be missed. This is not ""Twilight"", but a true, real serial about the vampires, adult, cruel and mature."
245,"I started watching this show after the third episode of season one had aired, I automatically fell in love with the show.every episode has a twist.If you don't watch the show,you need to watch it from the start to get some story lines.The show started of quite boring with the same things you would expect from another story: a baddie(Damon) a goody(Stephan) and a damsel in distress(Elena) but as the series carried on it started making more sense by the end of the season I was jumping around the room every Thursday. Four seasons later I've cried and laughed hysterically. To be perfectly fair the show has out done its self it's nothing like any other cheesy vampire shows, that the vampires sparkle. They die. In the vampire diaries it always shocks you, with couples that you can't help but either support or hate ,and then people you least expect die.the show start with a car suddenly hitting something that turns out to be a vampire and killing both people in the car. Later on it tells you about a girl and her brother who's parents had recently died, the teenagers live with there young aunt Jenna, who has no idea how to raise them. The two siblings took different approaches to there loss. The younger brother Jeremy hooked up with a older troubled girl and started taking drugs while Elena blamed herself and mourned for the whole holiday. On the first day of school Elena puts on a brave face for her friends, bonnie Caroline and ex Matt.when she gets to school she meets the new mysterious boy .who she soon starts to date and fall in love with. The show is based around the troubles that Elena comes to face when she finds out that her best friend is a witch her boyfriend is a vampire and so is his older brother Damon(who is killing many people in mystic falls). The show revolves around a love triangle involving Elena Stephan and bad boy Damon. By the end if season 4 the only main human is Matt. The show definitely lives up to its reputation of death,love,passion,hate and sex. Recap: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfXXNfPTxw"
246,"First of all . I am not a sitcom freak but this one is special . acting, cinematography, visual effects, storyline, drama, thrill, love, passion all at very best. love the character of DAMON. he is mind blowing. if you start tho watch this show than no one will keep u away from this even not yourself. so beware from it Vampire diaries will blow you away. At first I thought this show wasn't as good. But after comparing it to other new shows, and watching the second season I have to say this is almost a vampire classic, right next to Buffy.Every episode is clever from start to finish, the cast is great, and they keep adding more characters. It has it's occasional cheesy moments but so do all great shows, and here it's subtle.This is way better than Twilight and I hope it stays around for a while because I haven't watched one bad episode yet.What makes Diaries great is the writing/story which is never flawed. An example is that they've been bringing back a lot of my fav characters. Gives audience what they want."
247,"its one of the TV series i cant resist ...i recently watched season 4,which is no less than previous series.The two Salvatore brothers,both vampires fall in love with the same girl, Elena,who is a doppelganger.Elena has 2 best friends,a Bennet witch- Bonnie and Caroline who later turns into vampire.There's also a werewolf family of Lockwoods.the vampire hunters,Originals and many more exciting characters added in different season to spice up and twist the story.The latest season(4) ended with a gasp,there's a doppelganger of Silus,the great wizard.overall its wonderful,mind-blowing,thrilling,romantic and certainly you will fall in love with it.waiting for next season to be telecast.A must watch. tvd fan forever!! <3"
248,"Finally no more sparkle-faeries! Vampire Diaries...were to begin: i have been looking for a series that might still my hunger for fantasy and I have found it. What I like is that they have a combination of supernatural creatures: Vampires, Werewolves, Hybrids, Witches and so on. I was amazed at how good the acting was and the CGI was brilliantly done. The love is heartwarming, the action thrilling and you find yourself on the edge every time you watch it. At some point you wonder who's gonna die next (considering the fact that only Jeremy remains as Elena's family).I really hope it doesn't end soon, because Vampire Diaries...Rules!!"
249,">>> This review does not contain major spoilers, but some of the main characteristics of the show is lined up and may annoy some. <<<I thought I was going to hate this show. It stands for everything I don't like about teenage movies: vampires, werewolves, love-triangles etc. but I came to like it despite of all of that. This TV-series constantly tries to turn the way we view our world upside down. The good guys become the bad guys, the bad guys become the good guys, and the moral of it all, always seems to be that it is difficult to fight your ""animalistic"" side, but it is very important that you do it. Turning the bad guys into lovable characters makes for a REAL experience. It shows us, how everyone is human - even the evil vampires with their lust for blood and vengeance. The only thing wrong with this show is it's endless mania to keep everyone interested - by killing at least one person in every episode. It is not necessary and does not make the show any better or more exciting. But if you can get over that, then lean back and enjoy how the romantic view on life is played out in its finest form, here, in the 21. century, and with themes drawn all the way back from the middle ages, like urges, our inevitable sexual drive, vengeance, honor, innocence and the troubles of growing up."
250,"To sum it up, The Vampire Diaries is basically the one thing that my life revolves around. I know it might sound pathetic, but that it how much this show means to me, and I know that there are many other people out there who watch the show that think and feel the exact same way as I do. I know I have ever seen a Television show like this before and ones that means so much to me, and I probably never will. The only other TV show that comes close if Falling Skies. I am a big Sci-Fi/Fantasy lover and I watch many TV shows that consist of this genre, but I also love a bit of romance that can be written into a show/movie with this genre. I am also really looking forward to the new upcoming Sci- Fi/Fantasy TV show The Tomorrow People. I think it will be another huge hit for the CW channel.My advice to people who haven't watched The Vampire Diaries it to definitely watch it, especially if you are like me and enjoy that type of thing and the Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Romance genre. It is one of the best, if not the best TV show on television today. I would also just like to announce my admiration and appreciation to the actors and writers/directors/producers/creators of the TV show. The actors for their amazing acting and for making the show what it is. It wouldn't be the same without any of them. And to everyone else who made this show possible: I thank you so much. I really don't know where I would be without it. It has certainly influenced my life. The show also wouldn't be what is is without the amazingly talented people who create/write/direct/produce the show."
251,"Since this show started I thought it would be the stereotypical teen vampire show. I really just watched the pilot because one of my friends begged me to. When I saw it I was quenching for more. Like blood-lust for a vampire. It is not afraid to show lust or to show blood or skin for that matter, and it's fulfilling if you're a Stelena fan or a Delena. I can say that every season finale makes you stand at the edge of your seat. It gives you passion and sadness and happiness. And for a teen show it is very well done. It surprises you when you least expect it to. Makes you laugh,cry, get mad and even want to scream. The characters are well done and the special effects are great for a TV show. RECOMMEND 100%"
252,"It's worth watching. It has enough episodes already so you have what to watch because you will get hooked 100%. And it's still going as it just got renewed for a new season. The story, although sounds cheesy is very nice and there is a nice combination between the characters and the setting. The story in a definite 10 in my opinion because even though vampires are a really expired subject this one is different. It has it's good and bad but overall it is a very nice show and is worth giving it a try. I didn't meet anyone yet who gave it a try for a few episodes and stopped watching and the people i know aren't fans of vampires and hate the Twilight movies. My advice is just give it a try I think you won't be disappointed."
253,"Love, love, love this show. It has everything that a good show needs. Sexy characters, romance, danger, and supernatural twists and turns that are gut-wrenching, beautiful, sad, and mind blowing all at once. I've read every book by . Smith including the Vampire Diaries and loved them all as well. I like it when a book and show/movie have a completely different outlook and direction. It is fun to see how different people change the arc of a central idea and what kind of ending there turns out to be. I also cannot stand it when people are Team Delana (Meaning Damon or Elena) or Team Stephana (or whatever Stephan and Elena are called), and grip, bitch, and moan anytime Elena shows her feelings for the opposite brother. Helloooo people, the love triangle is at the absolute centre of the entire show, so get over it. I love the tension that it creates between all of the characters and how one girl's choice effects everyone around her. Julie Plec Kevin Williamson and all of the other genius, brilliant writers who work on this show, keep doing what your doing. Your ability to constantly send me on an emotional roller-coaster ride with every new episode and keep all of the twists and turns fresh and mind blowing make this show what it"
254,"Normally something that belongs to teenage fangirling isn't my thing, and I'll be honest I started watching this because a girl I liked was in love with it. But even after initially getting over that girl this series had an appeal. The production values are nothing short of excellent and considering the small town setting it's got a very ""epic"" feel to it. Ian Somerhalder's the real breakthrough of this series, as soon as his devious Damon is introduced he sizzles with a sinister edge and you know he's going to be a problem. As the series progresses, however, he grows into an anti-hero who it's very easy to sympathize with, Damon's easily the most interesting character in the series but they all have their talking points. Especially Jeremy, the drug addicted brother of the leading lady, Elena.All in all it's well worth checking out and outstanding for what it is, if you require a scale I would say it sits somewhere between Twilight and True Blood, not quite as miserable and soppy as Twilight but not quite as extreme as True Blood, either."
255,"This show is brilliant, simple words, but they sum the show up, the drama that has unfolded in this series is amazing, its whole story line is the best i have seen so far, the show has amazing actors that make the show believable. I started watching this show out of curiosity, and quickly feel in love with the story, the actors make this show special and despite having to stop watching season 3, once I heard about season 4 i quickly researched season 3 and was able to catch up in the matter of days. I do not believe I can stop watching this show now, it has me hooked to the actors the drama and the love triangles within it. the show has defiantly made the TV more interesting and now season 4 is nearly finished next week is it, however I do believe that the season 5 is commin, I researched and looked and finally found proof of season 5. I defiantly will be watching this show in season 5 to see what is going to happen and what drama can unfold. I do hope for the actors to all return and for the drama to continue :), this series would not be the same without the hard and continued work of the actors and writers. Without the writers amazing story line/ plot the vampire dairies, dare i say it, would not exist. I hope season 5 will be as good as the last seasons, tho I have no doubt it will be. Cant wait for season 5 :)"
256,"Now I'm one of those who repeatedly slag of Twilight etc, and when I'd first heard about the story being ""high school girl falls for two brothers"" I immediately hated it and wanted nothing to do with this show, until my cousin said ""you like True Blood, just try the first 4 episodes out"" So I did...The show admittedly starts of slow and I had to trawl through the first few episodes; which I usually forgive because building characters, plots and sub plots isn't always entertaining, as much as we'd like anyhow. After watching through the first few episodes I was genuinely hooked. Each episodes gives you enough answers to not leave you annoyed and confused, but leaves enough questions to 'compel' you to watch the next episode.I suppose it helps having Nina Dobrev and Candice Accola as main characters essential to the plot line, as they happen to be the epitome of ""DAYMM"".Overall, don't let your hatred for vampires stem from the disaster that is Twilight, give this show a try and I assure you, you will be hooked!"
257,This TV serious is gripping to me so I prefer to watch everyone however last episode was awful because Elana's brothers his names is Jermy died I guessed they didn't found his treatment.My favorite character is Damon and I like his performance besides his deserved Elena.Elena burned to her home and this event so effected to me.I thought this event all night even I had never watched again.Klaus is perfect actor for me and I think His accent perfect for me and His not bad person only he is want to be.He loves to Caroline but she is not aware of it.Bonnie is witch and She always helps her friends.She is close friend of Elena.Elena is vampire but She's not used to drink blood
258,"I must be a romantic sod cause I like the series. Yes it had it's ups and downs and there were episodes that I got bored watching. But in the end I am still watching, still intrigued and still wanting more. Give it a shot, open your mind and make a little guilty sin out of this show! The love triangle is something that could have been used more. But on the other hand, it runs like a red line through the plot and always tying it all together without becoming the main focus. The troubles they encounter can be worked out more. It is becoming a bit like knightrider. You know they have to fight off some evil vampire and they all get in together. Someone gets hurt or dies and Elena cries. I know, this doesn't sound like loving the show but once you get into it, it doesn't matter. Each episode is worked out to be not irritatingly obvious and therefore it keeps you entertained."
259,"As a fan of Anne Rice I did not have any hope for this series. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the normal rules for vampires were applied. Although I consider the day rings quite a bit of a stretch, it's a fair and decent alternative to the glittery skin (which was in my opinion a mind blowing stupid idea).Another indecent remark would be that all the leads are very good looking. You cannot say and be in your right mind that Damon isn't a hot dude. And I guess most of the success of the series is owed to this fact.Character development is present. At some more than others. Damon and Stefan become more complex characters as the series unravels. In Elena's character I don't feel that much of a change considering all the events that seem to put her in the center. But than again, she is 17 and with all that it's happening I guess she can go very well with dazzled and confused.I could not help to notice (but this is my subjectivity and background) a hint off Louise in Stefan. He dislikes being a vampire and for that he despises himself. Not all the time, but it there in the back of his mind. I cannot compare Damon to Lestat- simply because he is just another kind of animal. But than again the hints are there.In the end, I can say the series is a decent way to spend your time."
260,"I admittedly started watching this skeptically. I thought ""Oh God, it's another teen vampire flick."" Which it actually kind of is. But it's so much more. The character's develop over time. You warm to characters you don't expect to. Like Caroline, by season 2 I loved her. The plot starts off pretty basic but then it thickens and becomes intriguing. I literally spent days just watching Vampire Diaries because it was so good. I'm now re-watching it's that good. Beware of characters that sneak up on you. Damon, for example, I'm completely in love with. But in the beginning I never liked him. I actually didn't like Elena at first but now I do. I thought she was weak and pathetic and really whiny. However as the series go on she becomes stronger and more resilient and at times she surprises me. As far as relationship's go it's pretty realistic, putting aside the vampire side of things of course. It shows that love doesn't spring up right at the first glance. It shows how easily love can be broken. And it also shows that you can love more than one person, either at the same time (it may not be the right thing but it can happen) or in separate time frames. As far as casting goes it's brilliant. I haven't read the books (I do intend to) but each character is really strong and the person who's plays them fit into the character. I feel like each person is cast brilliantly. Especially Damon. Ian Somerhalder is a fantastic actor and really gets Damon to the core. He gets the quick-whit and mean exterior but also the sweet, gentle side to Damon. All the characters are really strong and each have a great role to play. OK I could go on and on. But I won't. Just watch it and you'll be certain to enjoy it no matter what your age is. Just give it three episodes and you'll be hooked for life!"
261,"After twilight I was kind of into vampires. So I had the chance to watch the vampire diaries. I didn't followed a lot of series before TVD but after that it all changed. The beginning of the pilot was very good. Directly you felt what kind of show it was and was planning to be. After two or three high school episodes the show really started to be good. This show has everything a vampire or any fantasy lover wants. Witches, vampires, werewolves. The actors are good. One by one and the storyline even better. Season one is not one of the best seasons but I can guarantee once you've watched the vampire diaries there's nothing else you want to see more badly. I really like all of the characters. It's definitely not a high school teenage vampire twilight thing. Also the vampires are credible. Their teeth and eyes. Make up, set, special effects it's all great. Every episode the show surprises you with another revealed secret. For those who love vampire love stories, witchcraftI really recommend this series! Also the band between the girl and the two vampire brothers is exciting!"
262,"Excellent casting, acting, writing, filming.... Excellent everything! One of the best series I've watched and one of the few that has compelled me to watch every episode.The storyline is fast moving, full of twists, and leaves me wanting more. It is not cheesy, in my opinion, at least, and is nicely balanced to suit a wide range of audiences. Each episode shows their efforts to produce quality work. There's plenty of action mixed with a classic love story. The background and community is well developed, and there is a great range of characters who are all on interesting journeys. The sibling bonds throughout the show is touching, and scenes feel genuine. A good sense of humor and irony help lighten some of the heavier and darker times, and there are events that will make people used to ""blood and guts"" in reality (like me) squirm and cringe. Naturally, with a supernatural subject matter, there are scenes that make me sit on the edge and/or cover my face with a pillow. Add to all that, gorgeous, talented actors and actresses, and this show is a winner.To be honest, I watched some of Season One when it aired but not faithfully, and I only recently decided to give the series another go this past week on Netflix. Let's just say I got a ""little"" obsessed and can't believe I didn't appreciate everything it had to offer sooner. When Season Two ended I ended up buying each episode from Season Three through Amazon on my TV until I got to the free viewings on Hulu and CW. Perhaps it's my way to procrastinate studying for upcoming finals, but I finally am up to date and will try not to think about the yummy Stefan/Paul Wesley too much between leasehold estates and strict scrutiny. (Yes, of course, I went there. Who could resist him?!) I've thought about whether my opinion of the series is biased by how bored I am of studying this week, and I would at most attribute just one of those stars to it. Truly, there is not one thing I don't like about The Vampire Diaries."
263,"This show is AMAZING!! At first I hated it and wanted nothing to do with it but after watching just one episode, I was hooked. Its so dramatic and is filled with love and horror. Every episode contains something shocking and ends with a cliffhanger. Everyone is saying that The Vampire Diaries is just like twilight, with the whole two people loving the same girl scenery but there wrong!! The Vampire Diaries is completely different for so many reasons. 1. Elena only loves Stefan and not Damon, she only kissed Damon because she felt denial- Says Julie Plec. 2. Unlike Bella, Elena wants nothing to do with becoming a vampire, and 3. Elena knows what she is and what she wants, to keep everyone she loves protected.I honestly recommend that if you haven't already seen this show than please do!! It's just so thrilling, full of suspense and the only thing bad about the Vampire Diaries is that you have to wait week to watch the next episode."
264,"This is my absolute favorite show. I don't have basic cable even and every Friday I buy it on amazon as soon as I get up.. I KNOW it comes out on Monday or so on cwtv.com but I just can't contain myself!!! lol I have tried over and over to wait but I always watch it as soon as it shows up on amazon. Seriously I will have CW if they cancel this show!! I get through my week knowing I get to watch this on Friday!!!!!! Awesome show, love the action and drama, love the new Stephan though I've always been a Stephan fan! Love the new Damon too, ah heck I love all the characters! but of course, Damon and Stephan are my favorites. :) THEY BETTER HAVE A 4TH SEASON!!!!"
265,"It is very addictive! I enjoy watching the series with potatoes on the couch. The good thing about the vampires here is that they have most classic characteristics about THE vampires: the whole invitation thingy, the stake, the seduction etc etc. They are powerful in a normal way, not like super vampires we see in Twilight. I love the plot. It's running in a normal phase unlike Heroes or Supernatural. The story is unpredictable.I am watching some TV series now, but this is definitely the one I am going to stick with.If you like vampires, witches, and action, you should watch this show."
266,"This show has unfortunately been cast in an after era where the public is starting to mock and hate on the Vampire genre probably because of the hopeless ocean of crap written about them. If anything, this show has three things that make it one of the best TV shows I have ever come across in my life time; an excellent story-line (with just the most shocking cliffhangers that will make you want to jump into a well because the wait for the next episode is too long, beautiful acting (there is room for improvement in Elena's role but everyone else is just pure genius) and last but not the least, character development. Every character has a story, a flow, a place and great timing. I'm not an expert at critiquing the direction or editing but I like what I see, the effects are simple yet very natural and believable. It might start off as a love story since every synopsis available says so but its way more than that. Three seasons in and it never ceases to surprise me with more awesomeness in every subsequent episode."
267,"Its just too good to resist. The plots,the characters and the balance in the story is just great.You might not find it that interesting for first 4 episodes. But every story needs a buildup. But once it takes a grip I bet you just cant resist it. Compared to whatever vampire series or movies I have seen so far this is the classiest one. It beats True blood and Twilight by a long way.Characters seem to have good chemistry. Lots of twists that keep you holding. I have not read the book but its a very good effort to convert it into series. To stick with the book for a long time wont be possible for a series, but the way have carried on with it is wonderful.I would highly recommend this series."
268,"Every time I watch this it gives me thrills and excitement. I love Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev's acting. Paul Wesley is a great actor, the other cast, without them the show will be not that exciting anymore.It's sad that a lot of vampires and characters dies. Lexi is one of my favorite characters but well without killing her Damon and Stefan will be in danger and Damon always save the day even though he's mean he will do everything for Elena.In season two, vampires, werewolves and witches all together is awesome. In the book there's no witch and there's no excitement. I even stop reading the book because the series is better. I love how the writers, producers and director did in the series and it makes me excited and hungry for the next episode.I love vampire diaries!"
269,"I honestly can say that this is one of the best series I've ever seen. Every week I'm waiting to watch a new episode which I do not have often with other series. Although it's fiction due to the normal and common environment I feel like it's almost every day life. I even started to discuss the series with my friend like we discussed politics. Moreover, the story of this series stays exciting and unpredictable which makes it even more amazing and irresistible. I think Alena is a good actress who is improving herself as the series continues. I'm in love with Damon, how angry and full of hate he is but also the sweet and honest part of him makes him so unpredictable and incomprehensible, and that is exactly what makes him a great actor and a great addition to the series. As his brother, Stefan is more the soft and sweet guy in the series. The differences of Alena, Damon and Stefan is incredible and enjoyable. I really love this series and can't wait for the next episode this Friday!"
270,"I borrowed the first season's DVDs from the library. During the first episode or two, I thought this series might not be worth watching. Teen angst, etc. Bleah. I gave it another episode or two and was hooked. The plots kept getting better and more complicated. Usually, it surprises me in some way in each episode. It is scary, but not too scary for me. The music is perfect for each episode, and adds a lot to the story.There is still some teen angst in each episode. That is the main audience. I think. It is no longer the focal point, however, and that widened its appeal for me. I'm learning more about the vampires' back stories, as well as Elena's and Bonnie's past. I'm very glad I borrowed it."
271,"When I was watching the first episode, well I thought it was too Twilightish and I really didn't like it. Elena is quite nice , I can't say that about Stefan, annoyingly boring and dull character ( AND looks like Pattinson). Didn't see any chemistry between them. So here I was completely disappointed, until Damon came along! This character is the reason why I watched the whole season. His skin doesn't sparkle, but his eyes do in every scene. And he's like Jack Sparrow for this movie, I mean when I was watching, no looking at Elena and Stefan couldn't wait for Damon to appear and do something. And he's even better-looking than Stefan. Enough Damon, the plot improves soon after first episodes unexpected twists and lot of different, interesting characters humans, witches, vampires and God knows what else. So, it's quite enjoyable and worth of watching."
272,"OMG i love vampires, though i have never read the books, as of right now, I started watching the series, because I did read all the sookie books, true blood, and was crushed when I saw the hbo series, it sucked so bad, but after watching a few episodes of vamp diaries, i hated it, than watched a few more and loved it than hated and than loved, and so that is my relationship with this show, I hate it one week than love it the next, it is something that keeps me coming back. It is by far the best vamp TV series out there, and that is why i will keep watching it, and no i am not a teen i am 26 years old. True blood needs to be canceled and put to rest, because that show is a load of crap"
273,"I started this show a while back and I have to say it remains one of my favourite shows ever. The intricate love triangle between the three main characters, supernatural elements, and varying plots made it an extremely interesting watch. I even got my boyfriend to watch it and he loves it as well. Highly recommend!"
274,"Me and my friends watch this show all the time and have a great time. It has a very captivating story and there is minor blood so people like me can still watch it! Towards the end I was definitely less interested in the plot and was just watching to finish the show. Additionally, most of the characters I grew to hate over the 8 seasons with the exception of a few favorites. However, the first 3-4 seasons were incredibly fun to watch and I was totally hooked. Try it out and if your not interested after a few seasons skip to the very end. Happy watching!!"
275,I love this show!! I Will properbly watch it all over again
276,"4 season are great, interesting and everything male sense. From season 5 it is terrible. Some of the main characters are gone from the show, too much plot holes is happening and nothing make a lot sense. But still better than Twilight."
277,"From the first time i already liked delena, and damon such a good character, but the epic things it was nija can played many many doppleganger with different charming, that's amazing, i love nina dobrev."
278,Love the show but make another season VERY weak ending
279,"My all time favourite show. I can go on watching this show all over again every time it ends and I never get bored. I get hooked as if its my first time to watch this show. Wish there could be a season 9 with the same cast. It wouldnt be the same without (Damon, Stefan, Elena, Caroline, Bonnie, Enzo, Alaric and Matt all together). My everyday happy time!"
280,"My evergreen series mostly I love brotherhood I love you my little brother,and😀don't look at me like that😁.i love this series always"
281,"First 4 seasons are great 10/10, but the last for seasons are just too much, i could barely concentrate how boring they were. 1-4 seasons worth watching, 5-8 you'll waiste your time."
282,The best ever the whole universe 😍... I can't get enough of it ever
283,The story line is really great and full of surprises and characters are so talented to even play as they own twin
284,This was indeed a worth watch. The entire setting of the series was great. All the characters were equally important to the series.
285,"I have watched the entire series 3 times, and have to say that I love it! Plot twists, love drama, sexy vampires and teenagers facing unimaginable responsibility. The acting is not the best, but the story and the characters are impossible not to fall in love with!"
286,"I just can't get past Stefan's eyebrows, haha.
The series towards the end wasn't as good as the earlier episodes though."
287,"The vampire diaries is the best show for many reasons and I could talk about them all day it's about family, friends, romance, drama, it's has a little of very thing it's in total tho the best ever I've watched it over 7 times cause everyone I finish it I just need to watch it again cause I can't live without it. I'm in like be with the characters and actors it's all just amazing and absolutely the best!!!!"
288,"The vampire diaries is the best show. PERIOD. This series makes me cry and smile at the same time. The actors are playing so good and you have to give a chance to this series! I hope season 9 will come soon, because THE VAMPIRE DIARIES is one of the most wonderful, amazing, fantastic and perfect series i have ever watched! This show deserves better than 7.7!"
289,"All I need to say is the Salvatore Brothers are the reason to watch this show. From Damon's slick, funny jokes to emotional and heartbreak scenesPlease watch this if you're into fantasy, romance and mystery."
290,"Just finished watching the vampire diaries and honestly have no words to describe how INCREDIBLE and AMAZING this show is! Every episode had me at the edge of my seat, can not wait to watch every single episode again from the start!!"
291,"My favorite serial. Cant find any better. Watched already many times. Unfortunately, the first three seasons are the best - for me. After this three seasons the serials' plot is getting more and more inappropriate, in my oppinion. Nevertheless, a masterpiece in my eyes. Season 4s' plot is still interesting, season 5, well... it starts getting worse. Season six, ""the thing"" with Elena completely destroyed the serial. Season 7 and 8 are more or less good to watch if its the first time."
292,"The Contry of origin is Etats-Unis
The Original language is English
There is eight of seasons
There is one hundred seventy one of episodes
The mood is dark and be afraid.
The characters are well-written and well-acted.
The actors are serious and good.
The storyline takesplaces in the high school Mystic falls High there are

293,"My best series till now cuz it has it all : horror, thrilling, drama, romance n even comedy n most importantly A LOT OF HOT GUTS :3"
294,"Very entertaining.
Great story.
Great balance between action and drama
Great casting.
Almost Great everything.
The Ending not so great but still good enough"
295,"The vampire diaries is by far the best series ever! It has so much passion, the actors have so much chemistry! The storyline is pretty good and every actor has amazing acting. I 10/10 recommend! You see the show and you feel like you are living it,too. It grows into your heart and you truly fell in love with it. I'm glad i watched the show and I am about to watch it for the fourth time!
I adore tvd and it will forever be my favorite!"
296,"I started out thinking I wasn't going to like this show whatsoever, and ended up loving the show wanting to watch more and more. Only problem I have is the lack of acting of certain characters"
297,"The Vampire Diaries reinvented the way you look at vampires in the media. It is not the classic vampire love story. Each episode seems like its own movie. If you like romance, action, drama, and supernatural occurrences this is the show for you. Be warned this show is very addicting and you will want to binge it."
298,"One of the best Vampire Tv-shows ever made.A show that captivated the world!
A show that still captivates, still has millions and millons of fans!Its dark, its funny, its deep, the acting and production is emmyworthy and the storylines goes beyond everything you can imagine.An addictive show that I have watched over again many times and I will love this show and its universe 4ever."
299,"You can enjoy watching this series if you always skip elena and stefans drama. Im on my season 6 now and enjoyed watching, just remember skipping elena and stefans part, it helps! Enjoy watching😊"
300,"Euphoria,enchantement, curiosity and enthusiasm are feelings caused by The Vampire Diaries desenvolved by Kevin Williamson.
There are eight seasons reporting Elena Gillbert's life after an accident which killed her parents. She fall in love with the vampire Stefan Salvatore, and his disturbed life has many secrets and adventures that envolved the viewer, causing a felling about know more about what's going to happened in the next seasons.
It's a fantasy that inconsequentially takes the viewer to another world, making imagine how the world would be if we lived it in these sobrenatural situacions, and at the same time, relates the reality about the real life. After all, it's not possible trust in another person even don't know who is in our side.
In the 7th season, Nina Dobrev's absence causes an impact and disenchantment to the lovers of her character (Elena), and this fact made the audience fall.
It's nice to watch the firsts seasons for who like mysteries and romance."
301,"I love this show,the characters and the plot has never disappointed me."
302,"The Vampire Diaries first book came out in 1991 and Twilight first book came out in 2005.
>so, For the haters, that's 14 years before Twilight.
Google before you rant nonsense."
303,"It took me a minute, but I fell in love with the townspeople of Mystic falls. Sometimes cheesy I still loved it. 
Only wish there was a little less unbelievable chaos and a little more time dedicated to wrapping things up. Wish we saw a little more into the remaining characters lives. 
Now onto The Originals!"
304,"It's the years of my puberty, at home eating junk food and watching tvd insanely..."
305,I was a fan of Nina Dobrev from the Degrassi series. So when I saw she was announcing the start of Vampire Diaries I was so stocked. I still think my favorite episode was the very first one. It seemed like Damon and Stefan had more powers. I mean Damon created fog and the bird he had he controlled. As the season progressed it seemed they lost more and more of the vampire lore powers at least the show keep a few. The characters were so driven and the story keep progressing. Last thing I can say give this show a chance and give it a watch it will not disappoint you at all. And be ready to cry at the last episode it will really get to you as the show start to end.
306,"OK so I'm not really the type for teen dramas, I'm more of a Game of Thrones/Breaking Bad type of girl. And I still remember rolling my eyes pretentiously when this show first cam out. Still, after getting Netflix and randomly binge watching most of the seasons, I have to say I quite enjoyed this show. I think what makes this show great, at least for me, is the sex appeal. This is one of those unrealistic shows where the characters inhabit a world comprised solely of attractive people. The protagonists are attractive, the parents, the teachers heck even the mailman. If you're looking for some mind-blowing show full of complexity and puzzling twists, this is probably not the show for you. But if you're looking for a show where you can just de-stress and mellow out after a particularly intense horror movie or a harrowing day at work, where you can just stare at attractive people, then definitely watch it. Bits of humor and the chemistry between Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalden make this a really fun show to watch."
307,"So I was near the ending of season 2, and I kind of thought it was starting to get stupid. Like how stefan can catch shooting wood stakes so easily, yet Pearl couldn't. Forget the shooting, Elijah was suppose to be an original yet he couldn't even dodge a running vampire at 1/10th of his age? I thought bringing an original was a good twist but its pretty stupid showing how they killed him 3x, 2x in 1 episode. I liked the show until they started showing someone from being godly and unkillable to slower reflex then a human. Also one thing, how can Stefan catch a football coming at his head from behind him, without it touching him, while Elijah cant dodge something in- front of him?"
308,"I was a big fan of The Vampire Diaries book series as a teenager, and so I was intrigued by its metamorphosis into a television series. The books actually weave somewhat of complicated story, and they have definitely changed key elements for the show. Overall I think that the show is not bad, the acting and chemistry between actors is pretty good. I'm interested in seeing how they will continue fashioning the story from the novels. I've always been a big fan of Vampire films/shows/books as well, and I honestly do not think that this show disappoints horribly. I hope that the cast becomes more comfortable with each other and the script as there are more episodes, after all... the show has just started and there should be improvement as time goes by."
309,"After watching Jacob and Edward compete for the love of their live: ""Bella"" I was blown away..... :O what the f**k where they thinking! It blew the genre! Vampires suck!! The misses told me about an new show: ""The vampire diaries"". After watching the first episodes I thought ohh my god!! are we gonna do Twilight all over?! Lucky they din't!! When they hit episode 5 the plot changes: Witches, vampires, old vampires, Deamon trying the get Elena and Lexi..Season one blew my mind. It was very good. Loved the acting and storyline. I had dreams about being abducted by good looking vampire chicks!!! I call it the ""The avatar 3D syndrum"". They really nailed it. A must watch!7/10"
310,"this show was good.I love everything vampires.At three I watched lost boys 6 times everyday.to the people that did not like it then do not watch but leave it on for the people that did like it.I am not saying its the best I have seen cause its not,but it was not bad and who knows it might get better.i loved twilight both books and movie but i read the book before watching it.I have not read the book but i am going to get it to read.At lease this show is more like normal teenagers(drinking and partying)unlike twilight where there is none of that.I also enjoy true blood a lot it is a good show and i have been watching it since it first started.All I am trying to say is give this show a chance."
311,"Look it wasn't so bad at first, seasons 1-4 were pretty good except for useless Winey Elena. But after the originals left the series just went to poop. Each bad guy they end up getting close with seems like less and less of a threat. They befriend them or frenemies, whatever is going on it's a blue print on the show. I thought after season 6 when Elena left it would get better but they constantly make Damon go back and forth instead of a solid development. I'll save you the trouble don't even watch season 8 lol. Im only 8 episodes in and it's pretty bad"
312,"Where do I start, oh I know the beginning from the first episode, Stephen was suppose to be the main character from the start literally in first scene he says something like this is my story but then the writers flip it and say no it's actually about an annoying teenage Girl just like Twilight. These writers are just so annoying honestly it would've been nice to have something new but no how about we do something exactly like Twilight. Next thing why doesn't any body give these teenagers therapy whatsoever but no a teenage girl says she's handling it after she just witnessed her parents drown. This girl honestly needs help which probably explains she's dating a blood thirsty vampire and all of the annoying crying scenes. Her Aunt is an idiot to think her niece is fine after witnessing her ""parents"" die. What's next, none of the characters change Stephen who is about 100 years old still can't stand being around human blood. Come on this is so stupid after all those years he still couldn't have met anyone who achieved some sort of enlightenment. Stephen is still a whiny teenager he is not heroic nor is he able to make up his mind. Now Elena it may sound heartless to call this girl annoying but no it isn't she had all that time to try and grow up but no she has to cry and whine. When she has the power to try and seek help which she never does. Damon man this guy is just crazy and is perfect for what a vampire is Evil and manipulative. All of these characters just don't change they say oh Damon change but he still kills people. Also I am so sick of shows that try to make vampires seem good when obviously their not I mean they feed on us humans. Which is definitely cannibalism. Also I hated the ending when they have her fake parents come back so stupid, I mean why not the person who sacrificed him self for his daughter that part was heartbreaking.This is where I say stuff they should've done differently for instance keep the blood thirsty vampire as the main character and do his back story first. Do not make him seem good and also make him seem like a strong villain. Have Elena seem like a smart, and strong heroine because of her experience having lost her ""parents"". Also make her a vampire hunter and maybe have her stop crying so much. Have her aunt actually care about her kids well being like have her meet with a therapist for once and also her brother too. Also writers please stop trying to please everyone this show could've been amazing if you gave it more depth of what it means to be human like I know you guys talk about having a family that's great but maybe give it more. And stop trying to please everyone. Maybe give it more comedy relief because of how many times people die. Also please expand on the supernatural world or maybe give it your own twist. Maybe have the vampire's instead use Sunscreen instead of magical rings that would've been more believable and may be have a secret Vampire hierarchy since they've been around for so long. This show could've been amazing if only you just used common sense and have the characters make smart decisions. The writers of this show really need to think about what they are writing period but at least this show finally ended. Hopefully someone saw how ridiculous this show became."
313,CW has a habit of making bad shows which teens love. From Riverdale to Gossip girl they are all genuine trash with the exception of a couple.Yet the vampire diaries has always been a strange one for me as though most of their shows are trash but watchable and sort of addicting I struggled to get through an episode of this show. Everything about this TV show is so unlikable. There isn't a single likable character (or actor) all the acting is shockingly awful the pacing makes it seem like hours have passed when its been one episode there is hardly anything to like. it is beyond me why this show is so popular especially as it appeals to teens who seems to have the shortest attention span. The plot line is so cookie cutter basic yet the producers feel the need to try and make it smarter which never works.nothing on this show works and will ever work. there are a few good performances from Nina but that is it. i am glad this show got cancelled
314,"To put it simply, ""The Vampire Diaries"" (2009-Present) is what ""Twilight"" (2008) should have been. This show is leaps and bounds better than ""Twilight"" in terms of acting, vampire folklore, writing, and direction.The love/hate relationship between the three leads Elena (Nina Dobrev), Stefan (Paul Wesley), and Damon (Ian Somerhalder)is a refreshing and less cheesy take on the ""Twilight"" relationship between Bella, Edward, and Jacob. These characters are more complex, and having Stefan and Damon be blood related brothers adds great drama and character interactions with each other.The supporting cast shines as well. Throughout each season every character actually develops and grows into something new. You will see relationship dynamics constantly change, as well as who is good and who is bad.""The Vampire Diaries"" is bloodier and darker than ""Twilight,"" but not as bloody or adult as shows like ""True Blood."" It is impressive, however, that for a show that airs on a teenage friendly network, it manages to still shock you with intense violence and blood from time to time.I recommend ""The Vampire Diaries"" for anyone who is tired of the ""Twilight"" franchise and other similar takes. This is a show that has great character development, suspenseful and addictive storytelling, and an amazing cast. You will always be hungry for the next episode.My movie/T.V. recommendations: If you like the show: ""The Originals"" (2013-Present), ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" (1997-2003), ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" (1994) If you don't like the show: ""Twilight"" (2008), ""Pretty Little Liars"" (2010-Present), ""Gossip Girl"" (2007-2012)"
315,I have never read the books and never watched the show until a friend made me. I didn't want to watch at first but reluctantly sat down and watched it. After the first episode i was totally hooked. At first i thought it was going to be one of those cheesy love stories but i was surprised. Though my friend introduced me to the show i was the one who enjoyed the first couple of episodes so much that i watched 5 and a half seasons in just three weeks. This show doesn't mess around with the stuff you see in other movies but rather it deals with issues which arise in the lives of the main characters. It has a great story line and i for one cannot wait to see where there beginning to take the show. Each week the cliff hangers get more intense to the point where sometimes i am crying or laughing hysterically. Nonetheless this show has one of the best vampire story lines which i have seen in long time (better than twilight ha ha)
316,"PLOT: The plot is half-bad, but will probably appeal to very small teen demographic.The entire plot could be summed up as marketing pitch: High- school, Vampires & Love Triangles.The show tries to compensate for it's weak plot with cliffhangers.ACTING: The side character acting is bad. The flashbacks lack in authenticity.The Verdict: The show will be forgotten as soon as the vampire craze is over. It has many awards, but if you look more closely none of them are respectable, mostly it is just people choice, which doesn't account to much."
317,"Not sure where it does contain spoilers but just in case.Although at the beginning I feared it would be like twilight as Elena seemed to be like Bella, Edward like Stefan and Jacob like Matt. I have grown to really love this series as it moved forward. Although the plot started out slightly week,as it moved on and we saw the true colours of Damon and we met characters like Jeremy, Tyler,Jenna,Caroline,Alaric and Bonnie, things really started to pick up. With people missing and people finding out shocking results you won't want to stop watching. The plot started to pick up the pace and we met some interesting vampires that proved that some will always be evil yet others can change. With Elena starting to become a serious character in the plot and not a damsel in distress and the minute Matt stops acting like a jerk, the series starts to go somewhere.With all characters hiding things what will be the end result. With shocking twists and turns in the plot and mesmerising kisses this is surely not a program to miss."
318,"Reasons Why You Should Watch This Show-- 1.while the show has a mythology and a back story, it's also ridiculously easy to jump on board at any point in the narrative, thanks to crystal-clear storytelling and how exciting the series makes everything in the moment.2.Part of the reason the plotting moves so well is the very specific act structure the show has established. Almost always, it begins with a teaser to pique interest for the hour to come and ends with a cliffhanger that sets up conflict for the next episode. These cliffhangers aren't just ""Elena (the show's main character) has a hangnail but just saw Black Swan and is afraid to cut it""-level stuff. They're shocking, they're unexpected, and they do exactly what a cliffhanger is supposed to do: Keep you hooked enough to come back next week for more. Other shows do this, and do it reasonably well, but no other show's endings have made me say ""OH DAMN"" in my living room (out loud, while alone) more than The Vampire Diaries. There's something to be said for ""OH DAMN,"" people.3.The best thing about this show is that it moves. It doesn't meander through plot, stringing reveals out as long as possible. It introduces a story and then tells that story at a breakneck pace, all while folding in several other side-stories to keep things entertaining. The sheer amount of plot the writers have ripped through in one-and-a-half seasons would make The O.C.-era Josh Schwartz hang his head in shame. In the season two premiere alone, all of these things happen: Someone gets their fingers chopped off and a knife in the gut, a different someone gets stabbed in the gut, an evil doppelganger shows up in town and does evil doppelgang-y things, a new mysterious maybe werewolf is introduced, someone almost gets turned into a vampire, someone else actually does get turned into a vampire, and someone gets their neck snapped but comes back to life. On top of all that, they also manage to squeeze in at least 11 conversations about feelings and junk. It's impressive not only in its ambition but especially in its execution, as nothing feels rushed, and no one story is slighted. The overstuffed, haphazardly plotted True Blood can—and should—take a few notes.4.The common thread throughout all of these points can be distilled down to one word: fun. Yes, television can be art. Yes, television can spark volumes of debate about character motivations and narrative symbolism. Sometimes, however, it's nice to just turn on a show and have it simply entertain. That's not to say the show isn't smart. It is, in its way. It aspires to be exactly what it is: top-notch, edge of your seat genre programming at its finest. It aspires to be fun, and on that point is a resounding success."
319,"This show rivals True Blood. They have different supernatural creatures. True Blood shows a lot of blood and gore, violence, and sex. Vampire Diaries has less of this due to being on regular TV channels. If you miss an episode, it's always nice that you can go right to CWTV.com and watch what you had missed! :)Damon is SUPER handsome. You can google images of him as ""Damon Vampire Diaries"". I have watched this show since the beginning.It started out to be obviously aimed at the teen vampire-loving audience.However, after season one, all of that has changed, and it is aimed more at the adult audience and teens now.The plot lines are EXCELLENT. The woman that writes this show is amazing for having thought of so many twists and turns!Now, we are in the middle of Season 3. Every week when this show comes on, I am glued to the TV.If you have not seen this show yet, you must! Simply go to your local library to get seasons 1 and 2 and then catch up online at CWTV.com, or buy the seasons if you prefer. Most libraries carry this as it is in such high demand!The plot is amazing! I cannot believe that one woman comes up with all these ideas herself!All the actors are wonderful at their jobs. Very believable. Some episodes have actually made me cry. You really get sucked into it the longer you go on with it. Season one may seem a little ""teenage-ish"" for you, but I promise you, keep watching it, and everything will keep coming together!I really hope this show lasts many more years, altho I cannot imagine where else the plot can really go now. However, I thought that same thing last year, and was quite PLEASANTLY surprised again! The imagination of the writer is only rivaled by True Blood, and now, in Season Three, I believe it may be a little BETTER than True Blood! :)CWTV.com is a wonderful choice for catching up on all your shows on that network. However, they only do streaming video. If you have an old computer, this may be a problem for you. If you need to download the episodes you may have missed, I would suggest stagevu.com first, or megavideo.com second. Both allow you to download their videos.This is a MUST SEE vampire/scifi/fantasy drama and thriller! You get very emotionally involved with the characters, and the changing plot is constantly reeling you back in for more!Not recommended for younger children. Please check for the TV ratings as for as appropriateness for different ages of children. I *think* it is probably a TV14 show, altho I am not sure. I can tell you, that there are some scenes that contain sexual innuendos and violence. However, nowhere near the scale that True Blood does. The reason I like this show better than True Blood, is that they engage you more into each character. You also cannot figure out the upcoming plot twists and turns. True Blood has placed too much emphasis on the violence, blood, gore, and sex. Those things are not necessary in a TV series if the audience can strongly relate to the characters.HIGHLY recommended! I hope this show goes on for years!"
320,"Right, so after Twilight ruined vampires for me, and made me think they were a bunch of wimps who sparkle, sing/hum lullabies and are basically angelic beings... I was completely off vampires. Edward Cullen from the movies makes me want to kill myself and Bella makes me want to kill myself even more. Anyway, I was definitely not into vampires when I started watching this and in all honesty I started because I had nothing better to watch. And I was very pleasantly surprised.Nina Dobrev as the female lead Elena is tolerable (which is such an achievement considering how most vampire related shows are reducing women to pro-vampire groupies just begging to be turned), Stephan (Paul Wesley) is very (very) easy on the eyes, albeit a tad too brooding at times. Still, when he looks like that one doesn't mind, plus he is who he is, no piano virtuoso with a velvety voice and all that nonsense. Good solid boy who plays football and happens to be a vampire. Damon, his brother, is the real star of the show. Not only is he similarly attractive, but is also the snarkiest vampire to hit TV after Spike from Buffy, who I miss greatly. His lines are witty, his character is deliciously flawed and he is the perfect antithesis to his good boy brother. Ian Somerhalder has obviously brought something from Sawyer's character in Lost and he's done a commendable job.The supporting characters are alright, nothing spectacular nor do they interest me very much. Bonnie is sort of eh... could have been made into such a brilliant character but so far, she's left me cold and at times I prefer the supremely annoying Caroline to her. The boys (Matt and Tyler) are mostly part of the scenery but one doesn't mind them too much, hopefully their characters will be further developed because both the actors aren't half bad. Elena's brother and aunt are nice additions and usually interesting to watch.The plot itself, while not something to rave about, flows with a steady pace and always keeps me waiting for the next episode. The music is fantastic and the general atmosphere of Gothic, high-school romance is greatly appealing. I'd recommend this show to everyone who likes CW shows, needs to start appreciating vampires again after the travesty that was Twilight, and anyone who appreciates good looking people who manage to act too! Really, give it a shot and if you don't expect much out of it, you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment from it like I did."
321,"The content of the show is not new, everybody can guess about how is gonna be, the quality you know is impeccable and the cast is young and beautiful, so you know what are you going to see; but, I what I can see is that here are relationships, darkness people with suffer that I can related and one path to cross, I think that is why I like the show. I know I am not the most objective person to say this, but I love vampires, undead and mystery. I haven't read the books and I don't care about that because it seems like they are not very good and the characters of all the TV shows are always better. It is a gender and everybody can decide if they want to watch it or not... I like it."
322,"I really don't mind it. Of course it is going to be very close to Twilight, as that is what is attracting teens, (young lust). It is sexy to want something you ""can't have"". they are good looking characters and yes the acting could be better but I think in time and a good storyline I think it could do very well. if you have read the books it is probably not as good but even in Twilight they missed on some things. The producers have a budget they have to work with until they get more viewers things are going to lack. they have made 5 episodes and need to make more to see weather or not the writers are taking the story in the right direction."
323,"Not for younger teens. Here in our house we Love Scifi, Vampires, Fantasy and the like. We can't wait for New Moon to arrive, and we were eagerly waiting for this new show. But after I watched it, I couldn't believe the amount of drugs,sex, and alcohol abuse there was! Did Bella and Edward get drunk and do drugs to get our attention? No. This show should not be on during prime family viewing either. Of course, that pertains to a lot of shows that are at this time too. I'm only writing this because I have a 14 year old who has been waiting for this to come on, and now I won't let her watch it because it's so stupid.Pretty disappointed that they had such a great concept and turned it into a teen soap opera. I'll stick with my favorite show, Supernatural!"
324,"I've read all the books in the Vampire Diaries series. I found them to be really good books, L.J. Smith was always a favorite writer of mine. So when I saw that VD was going to become a television show I was really excited, and couldn't wait to see who they cast and the story on screen. First off, Elena Gilbert is supposed to be blond and have blue eyes. Now I'm not opposed to giving the role to someone who can actually act, but I was surprised they didn't find someone to met her description. While they didn't get the Salvtore brothers' looks right, they got the right actors. I think they are the only characters that make the show OK. Secondly there is supposed to be a character named Meredith Sulez, she is as important as Bonnie and Elena. She is supposed to be in a relationship with Alaric and provides important input and is a valuable character. Why they would leave her out is way beyond me. Elena was never Katherine's ""doppleganger"", it doesn't even fit into the story well. The resemblance was all that was there. Elena and Caroline are NOT friends in the series at all, they hate each other. That Rose girl, I stopped watching the series after the first episode so I have no idea who she is, she does not become a werewolf she isn't even in the book. Caroline is supposed to become the werewolf after 'mating' with Tyler. Elena has a younger sister, not brother. And by now Elena is supposed to be either a vampire or dead. They made a mockery of the books, it's ridiculous what they have done with it."
325,Fun Fact: Stephen and Elena are the most boring couple on the planet. Glad he died. Sorry to break it to you.
326,This is an insult to the vampire-era and i will not support this crap i am really disappointed and i think that they try to renew the Twilight-era but that was a big misstake
327,"Not too long ago, I snapped out of my confused haze after the show finale of True Blood, and decided that I needed more. The ending, personally, was disappointing as hell. I don't speak for everyone. But I needed more vampires, more werewolves, more witches, more supernatural things in my life because I didn't find the closure I wanted. Before, I always made fun of vampires and found it incredibly cliché. Just saying. But after True Blood, I discovered that I was hooked into anything and everything vampire related. Then, for a split second there, I thought I'd try ""The Vampire Diaries"". It's funny considering how I used to make fun of this show and supposedly ""trash talked"" about it without even having watched a single episode of it. I mean, I did skim through the summary of all the seasons on wikipedia one day, and found it quite interesting, but never received the motivation to watch it. I went into this show knowing I'll probably stop after a couple of episodes in. The first episode was bearable; I thought the acting was a 'joke', but that's probably because I had programmed into my mind that this was just another cliché television show about vampires. After the second episode, I thought ""Hmm, this isn't too bad. I'll try a couple of episodes more, since I have nothing better to do for fall break."" Little did I know, that after at least four episodes worth of my time, I was completely HOOKED. In CAPITAL letters. HOOKED. It was like I was high on crack. I stayed up all night watching episodes of it, until I realized that it was 5 AM in the morning. As the show progressed, the more the actors were getting comfortable with their characters, hell- they even became their characters. The plot is always unexpected, and they have the craziest plot twists in television history. Also might I add, painstakingly awful CLIFFHANGERS each episode. They really know how to feed their audience. ~ The Verdict ~The Vampire Diaries is an exceptionally well written, and well acted out television series which will leave audiences craving for more. The show had a slow start, but gradually evolves into something far more than just a cliché vampire show, or a regular TV series. It really makes a title for its own, and outshines plenty of other shows out there today. I had an hell of an amazing roller coaster ride with The Vampire Diaries, and if you're hesitant about checking this show out, you have my million thumbs up. Word of advice, if you find this your cup of tea, check out The Originals (the prequel series to TVD), because your addicting journey doesn't stop here."
328,"There are just so many people around screaming: ""Tihs vempire romancee drama suck a**"". But I doubt they have neither read any of the books nor watched any of the movies. Just because a certain story is used often it does not mean it is any worse than a rare storyline (actually most of the time it is the opposite). But enough about general vampire dramas. Vampire Diaries is NOT just any vampire drama because most people aren't watching it for the endless love between the main characters, but the intriguing plot and believable acting. It may even have seemed to me in the first episodes, that it is just another romance story playing at high school, but with time comes wisdom and the more episodes I watched I the more I see now how exciting and compelling the background of this love is, which may be the main focus but definitely not the only party of the show they focus in.So if you do not only want to watch another love story, but also want a mystery like show. I can only warmly recommend you Vampire Diaries"
329,"The actors, the story, the plot everything is just PERFECT I just watched it for the first time and I finished it in less than a month I totally recommend watching it"
330,I've watched this twice now and I still love it. I obviously love the vampire plot. It was a little slow and boring at times when she was picking between stefan and damon. Of course the highlight of the show is when Klaroline appears to be honest my least favourite characters are the main cast
331,"The Vampire Diaries is an incredible, beautiful TV show of all time! The acting is fantastic, the story, the action, and the romance! Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder are brilliant actors, and all the cast members of the show, Kat Graham, and Candice King are excellent actresses, and this show is beautiful, and far more better than The Twilight Saga!!"
332,"I'm currently on season 5 and it's been really good so far. However, all the repetition is getting to me.
I love Elena and Damon together but they keep leaving the door open for her and Stefan. Just choose already.
And the fact that they were about to kill Katherine off and then brought her right back. It would've been a good end to her story if they just let her die.
Hope it gets better after season 5."
333,This is my first Hollywood tv serial and i love all the characters. This serial helped me to improve my english so much many times i watch this series again and again and miss all the characters. I request you please come back again with new season i really love this serial so much please come back 😭😭😭😍😍😍😞😞😞😞😊😊😊😊
334,"1 Star for Worst Acting i have ever seen of Zach Roerig (Matt Donovan),Steven Mcqueen (Jeremy Gilbert) and Kat Graham (Bonnie Bennett)."
335,"I read these books as a teen and loved them which is exactly why I hadn't watched the series lol. As a 37 year old woman, I didn't think I would have enjoyed this at all. Then lockdown happened and I needed a new TV show. Really good TV show and the characters are people you end up caring about. PS Damon.....lol"
336,It's really amazing I loved it contains emotions and every season is very catchy ✨💯
337,"It is such a well thought out show with SUCH immaculate continuity.
8 seasons and I didn't get bored once."
338,"I watched this show when it first came out and was IN LOVE with it! It used to be my favourite. Due to quarantine, I'm rewatching it and am finally realising how bad the character development is for every single character. Everyone is annoying me at this point - Elena, Damon, Stephan, Matt. At this point the only character that doesn't grind my gear is Bonnie. Also, after Nina Dobrev left the show, it just becomes rushed and even worse. Don't get me wrong, the plot itself is quite interesting and there's always twists that I enjoy but it's the characters themselves that make me want to stop watching."
339,"Even though I was sad Nina Dobrev left in the last seasons, I finished the series and BOY, the last episode ever (S8E16) is the best of all, so emotional, I cried. This is a long series to watch but contains a very good story."
340,"I should first mention that I haven't read the books the show is based on, so I have no idea how far the story went and how much the show strayed from the original content, but I feel in the show the writers dragged it for too long and this created problems of inconsistencies in the mythology and plot holes which are difficult to ignore. I really enjoyed it until season 3, but then the show started going downhill for me."
341,I love this show. It's the best of the romance genre❤
342,"The first two seasons are good as one keeps finding new things about the vampires and witches. The third season is annoying as hell. It has a very bad writing. The characters are unable to decide what they want. Not only this, not a eingle person has a strong opinion about anything. Good ones are siding with the bad ones. Lead actress has a feeling about two of the vampires and became the most hated character. So, as I said it trick you in to watch , don't fall for it"
343,"I absolutely love this show! It may take place in a high school setting (and I'm way past high school lol), but it had me hooked from the start! I was so sad when it had ended. I haven't been able to really get into ""The Originals"" spin-off, and I've watched some of ""Legacies""... but neither of them got me hooked like this one did. I've watched it a couple of times over the years."
344,Idk why but it feels uncomfortable every time i see even a picture tvd...the first season was promising but the love triangle just killed it I think ...the casting was wonderful ....I think they should have narrated the story from the other brothers point of view and he should have earned simpthy from the audience...
345,"Love, loved it! I wish they would come back for another season"
346,"Clearly thought out as the new Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but ended up being Dawson's Creek with vampires, werewolves and demons. Also following late 2000s trend led by the Twilight saga movies. It even borrows some of it storytelling evolution aspects. And almost created a franchise of its own. I remember having that old WB show feeling when I first saw the pilot episode. Mostly Roswell and Smallville. Which I loved, because it reminded me of my teenage years. And it soon became my new favorite show. With everything I loved about teen dramas (relatable characters, dramas and a killer soundtrack). Logically, I was sold for the whole run. This, counting out these idiot writers/show runners who took the shipping trend a little too far. A trend that almost destroyed the show through the middle of its run, making some episodes/seasons extremely frustrating to watch, let alone rewatch. As far as I'm concerned, things really turned for the worst after one major death. Too much too soon. And obviously not for the right reasons. After that, it was just a matter of time before the series self destroyed. Which it did, with big off screen departures from the most talented crew members. Maybe you'll enjoy the change, but I didn't, so much so that, to this day, I still haven't watch the finale season. And skip most of season 5 to 7. Season 2 to 4 being the most « epic » ones, even though the first one has a special place in my heart. Without a doubt one of the best teen dramas of that era, but plagued by too much emphasis on shallow details."
347,"Thrilling, entertaining and super sexy characters. Loooooved it!"
348,"The story is great, last season only sucks, but top end"
349,When I first started watching this show I wasn't too sure about it at all I hated true blood hated twilight even but I wanted too give it a chance and I'm so glad I did it started getting real interesting with the story line was great when they go in full details with vampires is very interesting it's a show that will keep you on your feet you dont know what could happen at any moment with stefan or damon what they were getting into I will say one thing tho only thing I didnt like was after the 6th season it got alittle boring but other than that it's a great show
350,Vampire Diaries has got me hooked. Every episode leaves you off of watching more. Also if you like Teen Dramas and Romance this is the one for you.
351,Really good TV Show liked it and makes you excited to see what's gonna happend next . and what going to happens never expected
352,"When it comes to this series , I can't speak enough about it! I just love the way it made me feel all the time I've been watching it. It's full of different yet deep emotions ..it teaches you the real meaning of love, friendship, family, humanity, sacrifices, hate.. & many more other morals.. If only you watch it smartly , you will realize that it isn't just a typical stupid vampire show ! It's way deeper than that !
The first 5 seasons are The best , the 6th and the 7th are a bit boring , maybe because Nina left the show , which was really disapointing to be honest ..because her leaving caused a huge emptiness in it.. The 8th (the last) season was just wow! I'm really speechless to discribe it! I cried for days after I finished the last season, I needed to re-watch it more than once ,still I couldn't get enough of it.. I didn't want it to end, yet I was so excited to see how it ends!
We really need more of this kinda deep shows ! 🙏"
353,I loved the main characters. Was a fun and entertaining romp through high school in small tiwn American with some very hot male leads.
354,"The Vampire Diaries (TVD) is a Vampire romance about Elana (Nina Dobrev), a high school girl who meets and dates a vampire- horror and mayhem ensue, and the earliest seasons were fun to watch, almost addictive.TVD was hard for me to rate- I am conflicted. On one hand, I really liked the show and never missed it: it could be addictive and I really enjoyed most of the characters and story lines. For those reasons I wanted to rate this show an 'A.' However, the show's constant focus on Elana seemed too much. At times Elana became annoying to watch frankly, partly due to average acting by Dobrev and partly due to how the Elana character was written.
Bottom Line: If you like: 1) Young Adult TV shows 2) Urban Fantasy 3) Romance as part of the main story line, and 3) Have the ability to suspend disbelief and just watch a wild show: You will like TVD.P.S. TVD had some great guest stars; for example, Season One includes appearances by Malese Jow as 'Anna' and she really stood out to me- I forgot she starred in the Vampire Diaries: she completely stole her scenes. If you liked Jow's work in 'The Flash' you should definitely check out season one."
355,"The series had a strong start and it was interesting till the story based on Elena ! but after season 4 which means after elena turned in to a vampire , the series became repetitive and boring , Elana weren't acting like she used to be and the story line based on one specific person in each episode !! like our childhood cartoons :D
after season 4 , the series bacame weaker and weaker and it got worse when Elena left the series !!!
oh ! you know ! Vampire diaries supposed to be a story about Elena and look at it at season 7 !! Omg ! there's no Elana !!!
the series could be better !
I've just watched season 6 , and i don't wanna move on , because i know the end and Vampire Diaries without Elana is not our popular drama triangle series!"
356,"I loved the vampire diaries when I saw it the first time, the cast, the vampire faces were amazing and scary,the fights were cool, It got more interesting when Klaus and company joined, but then it got boring because it was to much drama, and I got tired of Damon who was evil first, then good, then evil, then good. It got annoying in the end and predictable. And the ending was just meh, like they wanted it to be over fast. Lazy writing. Could've been better. The originals was a much better show than this."
357,"Honestly this was one of the best shows I've ever watched. Gonna miss this show so much!
Definitely worth a watch"
358,"I have rewatched the show multiple times. If you love romance ( especially love triangles) this is the show for you. You might have to wait for your couple to end up together but it's worth the wait. Full of drama, Romance, and adventure. 100% the best show!"
359,"I keep writing the wrong review. What I mean to say keeps getting lost in the sauce, but I have it narrowed down, and this is gist of it. The only thing, or shall I say person(s), that make this show float is Damon...and Elena...and Damon's relationship with any given character, especially dear Bonnie. Damon isn't perfect; in fact he's quite flawed, yet wonderfully heroic and far more selfless than anyone on the show will admit! He's gorgeous (with the most stunning, blue/green eyes I've ever seen) stubborn, determined, and, ok, manipulative. He's also a hilariously AWESOME smart ass. He kills people from time to time. Sad, but he's not without guilt, nor is he any worse than any other ""murderous vampire"" on this show. What irks me the most is his brother. Stefan. No matter what horrible acts he commits, the other characters grant him a pass and pretend he's the ""good brother."" Why? I say it's because he's a smooth talker and likes to ""help people."" So? Damon helps in his own way. In fact, Damon busts his BUTT on numerous occasions FOR his loved ones. Stefan is PIOUS. SANCTIMONIOUS. And a RIPPER. I'll tell you one thing Damon NEVER denies: he is a sinner, oh, what a shocker, and he never claims to be anything other than a ""monster..."" because even HE doesn't give himself enough credit....but Super Damon keeps popping through this so-called monster, while his brother styles his ""hero hair"" and horribly fails to make me feel anything but a yawn rising in his presence. OK, sometimes Stefan makes me feel a little warm and fuzzy, and sometimes I like him. But seriously? SPOILER ALERT.....In season 7, Stefan's ""Personal Hell"" is DAMON? And Damon must learn to face that he is A MONSTER? Whoever wrote this crap needs to remember that the audience isn't stupid. We remember Stefan's BS, and we know that Damon is not just a monster- he is so much more and we love him for it! Ian Somerhalder, AWESOME performance!"
360,For me this is the best vampire series ever! I am kind of a fanatic of vampirism and I watch with much interest every movie or TV show with vampires that worth watched at. And The Vampire Diaries and The Originals are from far away the best in my humble opinion.
361,Watched all seasons multiple times!! Soo engaging!! Brilliant storylines and brilliant actors
362,"This is the best serie in the world and I really advice to watch!
To many seasons but watching all of them makes us want to see more!
WATCH PLEASE SERIOUSLY!"
363,"The first 3 season were great, great story line , actors everything! As soon as the forth season started the whole show was a mess! No story line, they went too far from the books! The script was confusing and not interesting.It seemed that the story was rushed and not well written! The only good thing was the cast , the were amazing. But I still can not believe that the rating in this show is higher than other shows which are much better!"
364,Well I got to give it a 5 out of 10... reason being I do like the story but over period of time just couldn't take the additional nonsense they portray in the story with the main things going. Ya for a show to be running they just can't reveal everything but with all the other crap and non story related talks I couldn't convince myself to give a higher rating . Overall the show keeps you entertained but gets boring way too many times and the only reason I watched it is cause I started it and I really loved the initial stage of the show .
365,"wow, i loved this show so much. I was obsessed, the relationships were amazing! (stelena and klaroline) the plot was awesome, and actually pretty violent for the cw. The characters are awesome, katherine pierce is one of the characters i stan so much, and klaus mikaelson is amazing too.sadly, sometime in s4 it all went downhill. the plot got boring, the villains anticlimactic, and the writing grew boring. It is definitely worth a watch though, and the spin off is pretty good too!"
366,The first 3 seasons are the best. The writers ruined the show with Elena being a whiny selfish vampire and Katherine's death. Did I mention the Travellers are one of their worst ideas? Season 7 started out good with the Heretics Family but it was dead after the writers killed off the Savaltore brothers' mother. Season 8 was unnecessary. All they did was talking about Elena the whiner. The series finale was annoying and unexpectedly touching at the same time.
367,"This show wasn't great and got old like Buffy after a few seasons of the same story lines. The creator's idea to keep the love triangle going on forever is just the dumbest idea ever. I really hope she doesn't have that much control over The Originals. I think she gets the hots for the male actors and just wants to stare at them all day. I can bet that Ian just flirted with her non-stop to get a lead role in the series. He seems like the type. But, it didn't get interesting again until Elena left. Although, some of the writing and story lines fell a little flat like the death of Stefan's mother, I really liked the heretic story line in the end and was sorry to see the lesbians get blown up. I like the Raina character too, but I'm not going to spend much time going into detail. I'm sorry that Kai and Katherine never fully redeemed themselves. I don't know why Katherine was still angry. It doesn't make sense to me. Her daughter died. She loved her daughter. The whole reason she became this evil Bitch destine to survive was because her daughter was taken from her. Shouldn't her goal be to be with her? Shouldn't she want to be loved and to love.? That seemed to be her whole purpose and in the moments where she strove for those goals, she was human. They stripped that from her character when they brought her back and made her weak. It's just ridiculous and a huge example of how they take something, a piece of the story and make it fall flat.A lot of responses I've seen are critique's of Nina's acting in the last episode and honestly, she actually did a better job of making Katherine and Elena two different people in this episode than she's ever done before. I wish she had better guidance and direction in the first few seasons. The Elena in the end was childlike, calm and had a wash of peace over her. All she ever wanted was to be with her family and live in peace. I think anyone can say the same and I'm glad she got her happy ending. So the ending gave me a little bit of what I wanted (more Elena, depth, happiness) and a little bit of what the creator wanted (boys, an Evil bitch that every fat chick hates and more boys)."
368,"I used to really like watching this show. Now, I feel like the show has lost a bit of its focus and has become too gore. Gore and viciousness seems to have taken over any attempt at a decent story line and character development. At the end of the day, a TV show that is all about blood, blood and, oh, more blood gets pretty boring. I miss the nuances, character development, magic, and spirit of the earlier seasons.That being said, the actors are pretty great - I felt that, especially in the earlier seasons, they were all able to showcase their talents and developed their characters in very interesting ways. There is also something to say about Nina Dobrev really owning her different roles and being quite magical. It is a shame she is no longer on the show. I think she has the talent to do really amazing acting in the future and hope she will go far in her career. Shout out to the rest of the cast as well for making the Vampire Diaries so real and, for lack of a better word, 'individual'!"
369,"The first seasons were amazing, but then it turned kind of boring with the whole Elena and Damon thing going on, and it just seemed stretched and plain. But now when Elena is gone and you really see Bonnie and Damon's relationship blooming I'm back following the show! I honestly think they are so good for each other since Bonnie can take Damon on in a way Elena can't. In the books it is hinted they are soul mates and I do think they are since they have amazing chemistry. I do hope they end up together since they are so good for each other. Can't wait for next episode to see if Bonnie forgives him and moves on from Enzo. Please please put them together!"
370,spoilers a head so if you didn't watch it then don't read this the first 5 seasons were the best very good story too it then season 6 started off good but it just went downhill from there if your a fan of vampire diaries then keep watching if you want but the worst thing about the show is they keep making the same mistakes again and again trying too bring back a lot of overused story lines the whole baby thing in season 7 and the hunter story line again and there making a season 8 the reason the first 5 seasons were amazing was because they just did things that no one saw coming but now they do something and 5 minutes a someone comes back to life or someone almost dies or someone who actually was good dies never comes back anyways if your a fan keep watch if not and never seen it try it and see what u think of it
371,"Its a good show and fun to watch. Its darker than I thought it would be. At least the vampires don't shine when in light. The idea of the daylight rings is pretty cool. Just a few things with the writing that come up that make me slap my head and question ""Why""? All in all though the story is compelling and works.I keep watching it because the character development and overall story is good. It and the Originals are both guilty pleasures that I'll continue to watch as long as it keep my interest. I'd like to see more cross overs with The Originals though. You see cross overs in other shows pretty often, but this one not as many as I would think."
372,"the series started on a very good note and even got better when it got to season 4. season 7 is awful. we need a villain. i mean what are they doing without an exciting storyline? maybe a crossover with the originals may be necessary to save this show. at this rate i doubt it will make it to season 9 and that hurts because I'm so in love with this show. we need to see more of bonnie's power, Damon's arrogance must be put to good use instead of talking about Elena all the time. maybe what is needed is to merge the vampire diaries season 8 and the originals season 4 or something like that. it would be a treat for everyone, tension between Cammy and Caroline, klaus trying to prove he is boss, alliance between the original family and bonnie, maybe a little bad blood with Davina. spice it up, we're bored"
373,"One word: WOW.This show took me by surprise and hit me like train. I'm not normally one for the whole mystical and supernatural films and television series, but this show was nothing like how I expected it to be. The three main characters, Damon, Stefan and Elena are the one's to blame for my obsession with The Vampire Diaries. I believe that in order for something to be considered ""good,"" the characters have to draw you in. You have to be attached to the leads and your eyes should be glued to them when they are on screen. With Damon's sassy, bad boy approach and Stefan's innocent, yet brooding approach (not to mention it isn't bad on the eyes), I can guarantee you will fall in love with these characters. Elena has this innocent glow about her and she leaves you wanting to be involved in their twisted lifestyle. Although it is a show about vampire's attacking a plethora of creatures (human or non-human), the show goes about it in a way that doesn't make you want to laugh at the TV and make fun of the plot line (unless you're laughing at Damon's egotistical remarkswhich is very likely). Nevertheless, you're left with these feelings of love, anger, happiness, sadness and curiosity. The show's main characters and supporting cast contribute to the brilliant television show that is The Vampire Diaries. A+ to the casting directors.PS I highly recommend this show for anyone who enjoys a good cry with some action involved."
374,"Overall the last episode had way too high expectations. I was slightly disappointed, seeing as I expected the finale to end with a massive BANG!!! It ended with more of a poof... like a rock landing on a pillow!!! Most people probably expected a huge finale but it was very expected and slightly on the predictable side. For example, Jeremy: it was obvious that he couldn't die, also Damon: if they took him out then ratings would fall so he's obviously going to survive!!! But there is the element of surprise in the episode. I was shocked especially to see Anna and Vickie back, but i wasn't as blown away as possible!! I was expecting it to be WAT?!?!?! But it didn't have the desired effect that the director had probably intended. The other surprise is Stephan leaving, which after you know it you can draw your own conclusions to figure out that Stephan will leave and then Damon and Elena will go after him to try to help and convince him not to leave. While i call this episode predictable and a delicately falling rock on a pillow episode, it was however enjoyable and not as disappointing as it could be. I was mild impressed by ""all the stops that were pulled out"" I think that the episode could be less predictable and that it could have ended with a Huge bang such as intensifying the strength of whether Stephan is leaving or not.. They could have made it more intense. A cause for this could be that the director action packed it so much that each new event/scene tromps the previous scene, thus making it seem as though the episode is too packed and too rushed. You get slight dips into Stephan's situation which could be the cause of why i wasn't feeling the intensity of his ending. They could have ended it with Stephan killing the girl and then saying something or doing something to show that ""the Ripper"" is back!!!! This would make the ending more Dumb Dumb DUUUUUM!!!! The Jeremy thing could have started the first episode of the third season. The 3-1 episode could have made it scary and an OMG i watching season 3 and I'm already hooked!!! Overall all, it was enjoyable for those who enjoy the show with a passion and take the show for what the outside layer gives us. If you just accept it and enjoy and get enticed in the show, then you'll love it, if you're a predictor, all the tense stuff is easy to resolve!!!!"
375,"I was watching Vampire diaries until fourth season when suddenly I was vomited out from this teen BS. I have noticed almost everything that happened in HBO's True Blood which was started year earlier was followed by this TV show almost exactly. Waitress was changed by some dumb high school girl. The main vampire character was copied to some problematic vampire that looked The Twilight Saga long-lasting eye ganders.Also, end of seasons was so drawn-out with BS and one of character's scream that took more than minute, that was the last straw of mine of these idiotic ""teen drama"" series. I have put TV show into trash. Also, no people (creators) behind this almost copied story listed. In my humble opinion it clearly shows no name wants to associate with this piece of ""work""."
376,"CONTAINS SPOILERSOkay, I know that this show is supposed to be based on a series of books... that I have never read. But it's sad how much they knocked off twilight. I am a huge fan of twilight, and I knew that they were trying to target us twilighters, but come on!! Though I haven't read the vampire diarys, I know that they changed the characters. They tried to make the main character more ""bella"" like. There are differences of course (otherwise... lawsuit alert) These vampires have fangs, their eyes go all crazy when they see blood (hard to explain), they can't turn people just from the bite.. other than a few other things that is about it. The main character stephen, has the same brooding walk as Edward, he talks like Edward, he has the same stare, the same eyes. My DAD, who doesn't even pay attention to Twilight, but because of my addiction knows more than he wants too, took one look at the main character and said ""these people look just like those people in Twilight"", YES it is that obvious. Stephen even DAZZLES a secretary at the desk. There was this one part I even finished his sentence with a line from twilight. The girl goes... ""Your eyes"" like bella did, and then he starts muttering and I'm like ""its the fluorescence."" Seriously... its sad. They even have the speed thing going on from Twilight. There is a psychic girl like Twilight. It takes place in a highschool, there is a vampire going after the main character... I could go on and on and on.Was it bad? No! Was it great? No. But it was only the first episode. I will continue to watch it and see what happens. I don't like nor dislike it really. I'm probably going to read the books and watch the series, so I guess what they wanted to do worked. I have no problem watching something that is similar to twilight but I started to feel like it was a little too much. I'll review again when I know what i really think....."
377,i have never said this about a season before but the vampire diaries has it all the drama romance and suspense i love it and if anyone is looking for all that in a show then watch the vampire diaries this show has great talented actors that i love!.this show i know will end soon and i wish it didn't cause i look forward to every episode they air.also when it goes i hope the originals will stay because they were linked from the vampire diaries.there is no other season that will ever be like the vampire diaries ever this show is one of the kind no other season could beat.also if there were any show that would copy this magnificent show they would fail horribly !! :) :)
378,"Everything is mentioned any drama , films whatever
But when we open it there's nothing other than description written nd short clips n trailers n promo
Not impressive at all👎🏽"
379,The knock off Twilight with bad actors and poorly written script... you lose braincells just listening to this show.
380,"Why is this series so bad, how can a series be this bad"
381,"Great show. Elena is annoying. She tells all secrets, ruins all plans, sleeps with both brothers. Annoying."
382,Terrible this is the show is dumb and the story is bad. But most idiots don't understand good it is
383,"I own the entire series and I watch this show at least once a year if not twice a year on Netflix and will use my series of it ever disappears from Netflix eventually. This and The Originals I watch once or twice a year. Enjoying Legacies but I still miss Damon Salvatore and Bonnie Bennet the most. And The Originals all of them except Ester, Michael, and I didn't like auntie Dahlia. Miss Haley from this one I didn't care for her on TVD but loved her character on The Originals. Especially when she turned into a hybrid!!!"
384,"Dear diary, there are no good people in this world.
Vampire Diaries could not find a balance between good and evil to make any of the characters or the story compelling. There was no basis for why everyone is following the bad decisions of an emotional teenage girl or the appeal of this town when it all goes to hell. The only redeemable aspect of this show were Damon's friendships. All of them so unlikely but the only part of the show that made me feel."
385,"The series gets boring, repetitive,lame.
Same stuff again and again and double role of Nina Dobrev made me sick . I am not a hater but I couldn't bear to watch after Season 1."
386,"The first few seasons were not that bad at all. Interesting, kept me watching, fairly well done. But as the seasons go on, it gets worse.The number one problem is continuity issues. So in the earlier seasons we are told that if a witch brings someone back from the dead then that witch needs to either fix it or suffer. Well in later seasons, a witch brings back like 20 people in 10 minutes and there is 0 consequences. Again. Vampires are unable to enter a house unless invited in. So they find out a group of vampires are hiding in a mansion that is under Bob's name (Not the character's actual name but trying to save spoilers.) Well Bob is friends with all the main characters and instead of getting Bob to say ""Hey, come in my house."" they work out this elaborate way to KILL HIM and then bring him back so that the vampires can enter the mansion. I mean...What?In later seasons, one character after another comes in and out of the show. And with each, HUGE plot opportunities and character development comes and goes. They had dozens of chances to do something that'd make the show immensely interesting but just kill the person off because they wanted another tragic moment to make the audience feel bad, yet again.There is no emotional roller coaster. Shows work because we go from lows to highs. Characters die (Low) to the villain loosing (High.) Well Vampire Diaries doesn't allow any high's to happen. A villain will be conquered but we don't enjoy it because a main character has died. Someone will come back from the dead only for a relationship to break up. It keeps the show in constant low and almost depressing to watch.The show tries so desperately to shock the audience. They introduce characters, have a twist with them, then kill the person off at random moments. (Literally people have been standing in the park smiling and ordering ice cream when they are beheaded.) It makes the show horrible predictable. Any character that isn't Caroline, Stefan, Bonnie, Elena, Damen, or related to those people will be killed off. There is 0 character arcs because the show doesn't give it time for an arc to happen. We will see a character get PTSD only for next episode have them recover and act like nothing happened. Characters who put stress on the main characters and force them to make difficult choices are quickly killed off. Meaning there is 0 chance for the MC's to mold and shape into something new. The earlier seasons were great and watchable but anything past 3 is a bit difficult to watch."
387,"I was hooked to the show at the beginning. I was a die hard Elena and Stefen fan. The story started about their love story. I was very disappointed it didn't end that way. I lost interest when Elena and Damon became a thing but I hung in there for several more seasons waiting and hoping Elena and Stefen would find their way back to each other. By the sixth season I realized that it wasn't going to be that way and I skipped 6,7 and 8 right to the last episode. It just seemed completely useless to pair Elena and Damon considering the story didn't start that way. It should have revolved around ELena and Stefen. So in the end I was very disappointed and found the show to be a total waste of my time."
388,"Okay, so I'm a huge fan of the show, I've been watching it for 4 years now, and it never failed to impress me. I read so many reviews and many of them said that they didn't like it because the vampires are different, the actors are too old for their roles etc., but you know what these are all things that make the show better, because why would the do a show of a normal, well known idea of vampires it would become boring, they have to make things different and more realistic, instead of vampires sparkling in the sun, they burn in the sun, instead of just giving us some vampire crap without any explanation of how they came to be what they are on the first place, they gave us history about everything, how vampires were created and why. Yes the series had it's ups and downs, it's bad episodes and things that can't be understood, it also had it's amazing episodes, with very nice turns and twists; and what makes this series so special is because you never grow bored of it, because it's not repetitive, it's not predictable, there are a lot of plot twists like main characters dying, old enemies coming back etc. and please don't watch the first few episodes and then say its bad, no watch at least the first season, or better pretend that you just met a new person, what do you usually do when you meet a new person? you get to know them and then you judge them or say whether you like them or not, do the same thing with the series, get to know it, watch at least the first 2 seasons and then go judge it and say whatever you want about it to other; but don't just watch the first 5 episodes and then say it sucks and keep warning people about not watching it. Just give it a chance!"
389,"So I am a late bloomer. I would not consider myself a lover of vampire stories, just barely made it through the Twilight movies, but I have just been introduced to Vampire Diaries by my husband no less - thanks Netflix. I am half way through season 4 and I have become obsessed with this show. Yes, at times the story line wavers, as it does with every television series, and to be honest I just wanted to slap Elena when she couldn't make up her mind which brother she wanted (a girl should be so lucky) but thank you to the writers for keeping us hooked with other story lines as well. I am completely infatuated with Paul Wesley (Stephan). He oozes charm, charisma and most definitely sex appeal. A very talented actor and looking forward to seeing more from him. Ian Somerhalder(Damon)also most definitely fits into those categories but unlike Elena, my vote definitely goes to Team Stephan. I would recommend this show to anyone I come in contact with and although I still have a lot more to watch, I am most definitely a huge fan and to the cast and crew I wish the show every success."
390,"It's Twilight on TV but slightly better. Considering that Twilight is terrible, that's an accomplishment. Of sorts. Pretty much the same story. At least they can act. Have to say though, Stefan is NOT a good looking guy. I'm finding that I hope the other vampires are more beautiful and handsome after this first episode. FX aren't bad for a kiddie show that's not as good as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I'll give it a chance so we'll see. Still not ruling out just shutting it off."
391,"I'm currently taking a break after watching True Blood. I did give this a chance to grow on me and it sort of has but the script is quite awful indeed, like some said, it's for 13 - 16 year olds? is that possible? Some of the script is really awful and thinking that young talented actors would actually agree to saying these lines makes me shudder, its akin to hearing a blackboard being scratched very violently (lol) They (vampires) eat, have bodily functions, DRINK, walk in daylight, cry real tears?!(how accurate this is, is up for debate), back stab no less than ordinary humans would do! Wait, there's really no stopping them from adding more incredulous actions for these so called 21st century vamps!I thought real life teens were annoying enough, but not until you see how really annoying they are on TV in America, or is this the world trend!All said I think they should rename it from the Vampire Diaries to The Dummies guide to Teen Vampires!How does this justify allowing scriptwriters free reign in letting this detritus attack us from the safety of our screens! Really I would expect more as some of it really sucks (no pun intended here)but having said all this I will await the arrival of Season 3 and better lines, if that's not too much to ask?"
392,"I read the books years ago, and thought they were kind of excellent. I WAS 12 or 13 at the time. Now, being a student, with incredibly little to do, I and some friends have started watching the show, which at first I didn't actually realize was related to the book at all. It has some really good things about it, the Damon casting is actually a really good choice, I really am quite fond of the actor (very easy on the eyes, is that young man), and the supporting cast (especially Jeremy, who I fully expected to be really rubbish) are all really good. BUT SOME OF THE DIALOG!? Dear god, its sometimes so contrived! And Elena has the emotional range of a teaspoon facially.. She's such a drip!I do enjoy watching it, but always with friends, so there is someone to mock the silly bits with. Also, it is advised that one has a few drinks before watching the first couple of episodes, it's a little boring to begin with, it needs alcoholic beverages to sustain it's momentum.I don't think it's anything like twilight, to be honest, Twilights the one where the all just sigh at each other with gloomy brooding faces in the rain, right? VD (though perhaps a little unfortunate in it's initials, is a bit more racy, and a lot less boring.All in all, it's a good show to watch with your mates and have a giggle to."
393,"This Series drew me in right away and always had me wanting more!!! Hated waiting for new season to start because they always left you guessing, on what was going to happen next!"
394,"I got addicted to these series, loved it! And ofcourse you should watch because Damon is too hot."
395,"I wish this show was real life, i'd love it! I am obsessed with vampires or at least the thought of them! I would like to meet everyone but Ian Somerhold and Paul Wesley I would like to you know haha (not sexual, you dirty minded folks, more on the lines of spend a day with) And I love this show, I mean it's not my number 1, but it is my number 2. I like the fact that it seems never ending and that is how a show is suppose to be. People/Directors don't understand that when a show comes to an end most people have nothing to look forward to and they have to search all over again for a show that is semi-good like the one they were watching. That is why I hope my favorite show(s) don't come to an end."
396,"While i will admit to never reading the book series, I have seen the first two seasons of this show including some of the beginning for season three and I was not impressed. The show follows the life of Elena, who lost her parents in a tragic accident, and her life suddenly changes when she meets Stefan, who is latter revealed to be a vampire (why does this sound familiar) and then his brother, Damon is introduced and both fall in love with her. I myself am getting quite tired of both the teen drama and love triangle in modern day television. I watched both this show and True Blood to compare them and i can honestly say i enjoyed True Blood much more, because of its story and the well acted characters. Do not get me wrong, the actors in Vampire Diaries are great, my favorite was Damon, played by Ian Somerhalder, who does a great job as the conflicted vampire, and had a previous but brief role in the hit series, Lost. All in all, if you want something that is LIKE twilight but NOT twilight, then by all means this is a 10, no brainer, go for it, you wont regret it. If you are looking for something a little adultish or mature without too many romances, this isn't really the show. Its main audience is young adults and teens and it shows."
397,"Hollywood will never learn that too much of a good thing is exactly that: TOO MUCH. There' so much vampire frenzy out there that now everyone's trying to join the party. Even from watching the commercials I could tell that this would be a mediocrely acted, slightly sappy vampiric series, but since I only have basic cable (and i love vampire stories),I hoped they were saving the good stuff for the show. No such luck. There have to be stronger vampire stories that can be made into series that aren't cheesy clichés by the time they hit the small screen! I didn't think the acting was bad, but it was really predictable. Vampire comes to hometown. Evil brother threatens cover. Falls in love with girl. I imagine it all made a much better book. Next week when the other shows in that time slot start, I will be elsewhere. Maybe I'll catch future episodes on rerun, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
398,"Why...whyyyy Damon died.... Whyyyyy???!!!
I'm going to cry right knowwww
God bless vampires"
399,"Jeremy, Rebecca, Klaus, so many unrealistic characters which make it a very unbelievable plot."
400,"Definitely started out boring and slow but after a while it picked up the pace and the plot became really exciting. However, after the first season everything became so complicated and random, so many new characters were introduced that it became hard to follow. Aside from its few flaws, the characters are portrayed very well and there is a sense of excitement in the episodes that is relevant to any age group.Also this show makes you think which is different from many of the immature and meaningless shows out there today. And although there are many shows and movies about the new ""vampire"" craze, The Vampire Diaries shows a little different take on this subject that is innovative and addicting! (And let's not forget the gorgeous guys!)"
401,"Un final de tot cacatul , care nu merita nici doi bani , o atrocitate de final ."
402,"this is one one the best series i have ever seen...this doesn't mean it rules over all others.But watching the vampire diaries makes me move into a different place.It may not be the same for you guys.But this series is app laudably superb.The Damon character is the real thing that gets me going through this series.All others are also excellent.I think this doesn't a less than 8 rating...the school,the place and every moment in this is like a special one.Even though some parts of the episodes seem lagging and a bit over exaggerating, still its watchable.Anyway keep up the good work(for the guys behind this series)and bring some newer stuffs.Love to see more other series like this one...hope the vampire diaries never end."
403,"At first I thought this show would just be Roswell with Vampires, but I was pleasantly surprised. There is plentiful eye candy for both male and female viewers (which is important for any vampire show!), and the characters are interesting and not 2D cookie cutter characters, and there are some interesting mysteries going on.My only real complaint about the show is a moral ambiguity, well, not even a moral ambiguity, a blatant amorality by Damon. While I can understand that vampires kill people, Damon in several instances has just killed a human in cold blood, and there is no repercussion in the story. He doesn't feel guilty, no one really calls him out on it, and the viewer is then left with the impression it is a-okay and we should still feel sorry for and like Damon. While I get feeling a little sorry for Damon due to his back story, I really have a problem with the way his character is portrayed, and the message it sends to viewers.Also, in my opinion some good characters get killed off too soon, without having enough time to really develop. On the bright side though, most of the ""drama"" is not drawn out unrealistically - the plot moves forward enough with each episode to stay interesting. So I'd rather have character arcs move too fast than too slowly, but I think they could take their time a bit more with certain characters."
404,"After knowing that I have to write ten lines of review for it to be submitted, I decided to expand my one sentence review to something more meaningful. However I don't know how to write so many lines of review for such a crappy series. I know, I might go to some other reviews and just copy and paste the most relevant parts of their reviews, and build my own ten line review. However I can be banned from writing reviews in this website. I jut need to focus and think. How difficult can be to write a review of a blond guy in love with a brunette girl. But then, the girl falls for the other main character in the series. The brunette girl is a girl next door with a blond BFF. The blonde guy is a deep philosophical guy with lots of anger. I know I'm getting to something here and I haven't talked about Vampires yet. I know, why they didn't call the series Dawson's Creek : Vampire Edition?"
405,"This seems/ed like it was an unnecessary cash in on a horrid premise. compared to other shows and movies who have tread the idea into the ground, such as the elephant in the room twilight, this series is a cheap imitation. the effects are pathetic ranging from unneeded to laughable attempts of an inept crew. the characters are equivalent to dental surgery without anesthetic. high school student films are preformed better. and it all feels like it's been done before and better. seriously. skip this series.I wish there were a 0 star option. watching the one episode i saw was absolutely insulting to me. perhaps it's because i'm not a girl in junior high, i don't know."
406,Surprisingly good for a TV clone of the horrible Twilight Movie series.In fact it is way better than Twilight: it has suspense and great characters - and a good story. Everything that Twilight lacks.Only the lead actress really sucks.Even when she just asks someone for directions or goes shopping - her husky voice always sounds like she is moaning in a porn movie.Apart from the fact that she cannot act at all.Who cast her ??? All the other main actors are really great and the show is fun to watch.But please next season: get a better lead actress - Nena Dobrev is just horrible !!!
407,"OK, I just view the first episode of this TV series here in Australia on our digital TV last night and I am seriously hoping that it is only ""BASED"" on the books by LJ Smith!!!I'm going to point out some ""TWISTS"" that the show had that didn't match up to the books, well the first book at least!1. Elena has a sister in the book called Margaret, not a brother who is a drug addict. 2. They live in Fell's Church not Mystic Falls or whatever it was called! 3. Meredith walks to school on her first day of school not driven in a car with a friend. 4. In the book, Elena is BLONDE not brunette. 5. She came back from France not from their parents funeral or anything like that... OK yes Elena's parents are dead in the book as well. 6. Bonnie is meant to be short with curly red hair, not some black chick!! 7. She also has another friend called Meredith and her and Caroline are sorta enemies.And well that's as far into the first episode I saw because I couldn't stand watching it any further. Please if you don't believe what I have just said sit down and read the books for yourself.Books in order of reading:1. The Awakening 2. The Struggle 3. The Fury 4. The Reunion"
408,"That shows made me not believed in love. yes you read right cause at one moment the writer shows the lovers are soulmate and next moment they turned on to be just friend, I mean there is no way Love feeling turned off like it never happened, and also the writers made love an Excuse for cheating, they can avoid that with shallow story or lust story not love story, or made Damon and Elena loved without intersection Stefan at all ,so we can accept at the end the true love story ,I know most of reviewer will refuse my words but I write what I believed. My question is why the writers made Damon fall in love with his brother girlfriend Elena which also cheated her lover Stefan with his brother ??, that killed their love story before it began no matter how the writers tried to grace and decorate their beautiful love ,cause nothing would cover the cheating ,no matter what ,I mean it's not only that is so gross and unethical ,but the shows big mistake (for most of love triangle love stories especially Damon/Stefan/Elena) was making love is so cheap and easy thing like an on/off button in your your heart ,so the writers used Love word used as an excuse to do anybody can sleep with anybody- ,but actually the right word would be -Lust- ,that is why I liked the most seasons 1,2,7&8 cause they not included Damon /Elena Lust story and all of that gross love drama. the show could made Damon any other girl instead of his brothers love ,and the same with Elena if she must break up with Stefan ,also I was pleased when Elena slept taken all her bad drama life with her ,cause if Stefan was anybody else he could cut his relation with his brother whos tried to fix him for more than century . So again why the writer did that?
I know that most of watcher would be get bored if the love story still the same that is why the creator of the show exchange lovers for each character like a dress ,one moment you think the lovers will not separate at any circumstances but we found that it is so easily to forget and not only that but also most of the Exes still best friend and talked about the new lover with each others (wow) !!!!!!!!, especially the brothers relationship.
For me I skip every Damon/Elena scene. Simply I Can't accept it."
409,"I am on season 2 nearly season 3. Honestly, it is just a lot of teenage drama surrounded by one girl.,,"
410,"You start the first season it's great then as u continue... The logic keeps on decreasing season by season. Like here every body is immortal, the producers showing anything to continue the series. First series which I left in the middle. DO NOT GO FOR IT. Waste of time."
411,In a nutshell its basically a series about 2 brothers who are obsessed with one girl for the entire 8 seasons and she plays them both.Dont watch this series its a worst of time.I gave it 1 star only because i can't give it a zero.
412,The main character dies stefen in the end why? what writer was thinking seriously? all screwed up.. i hate the show.. first his girlfriend fall in love with his brother then again his wife caroline lost his husband.. demon must die he was the evil one.
413,"I don't know how did it get such a good ratings. It is the most boring series I ever seen. The whole story is between three characters Elena Gilbert and Salvatore brothers (vampires). The show is mainly teen triangle love story. The salvato brother were vampires, mostly vampire human triangle love story. Later she become vampire. But again this triangle love story.Hate it , same story repeated again and again for 150+ episodes . After few seasons it becomes unbearable to watch. I strongly recommend don't watch it."
414,"This series is simply epic, I love every season of this show, Damon's character was really great one of the best written characters in TV history, I loved the characters of Elena Stefan Bonnie Caroline Enzo Alaric and everyone else, I lovedthe finale I felt it was more than fitting despite when the final season started I was worried about the ending but was super pleased, i plan on reviewing every episode at some poiny , I truly believe it belongs up there with Buffy, the originals was amazing spin off and legacies has its flaws but just needs to find and focus on its strength and core characters and bring back the dark mythology"
415,"Ok so there is soo much I want to say! But I can't I don't have the time or space too! Man oh man is this and incredible piece of work! The actors storyline screen play everything is point to perfection! My personal favorite would have to be PAUL WESLEY who portrayed Stefan Salvatore and Candice king who portrayed Caroline Forbes! And my favorite ship has to be STEROLINE without a doubt! If u have not seen this show what the hell are you doing, watch it! I completely 10000000% recommended it to alll living and dead souls! It's the best thing that ever happened! And no I'm not exaggerating and yes I am crazy and obsessed behind it! I mean each and every line, each and every character, every scene every song! Every thing stays with u! Now stop wasting ur time reading this and join me in my fun!"
416,"I never got into The Vampire Diaries, not sure why as I LOVED The Originals, especially Klaus. I'm currently on S01E07 and finding the story a bit slow and the chemistry between Stefan and Elena is absolutely ZERO. Maybe I was expecting a Bella Swan and Edward Cullen romance. However there are 8 seasons to get through, so for now, ½ way through S01 - it is only 4/10 for me. I'm happy to revise my review and rating once I've watched all 8 seasons"
417,A few things did wind me up. Its very repetitive which is annoying and the coupling of something of the actors just don't work.
418,"I started watching THE VAMPIRE DIARIES 4 months ago and I just finished it... it's awesome.
The story is so good and it's not just about teenagers and highscool drama; it's also about LOVE, LOST, FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY, FIGHTING, HOPE AND SUPERNATIONAL CREATURES.
If the supernational stuff is your tipe then you're in the right path, 'cause TVD has so many creatures and each creature is special and has it's own story. Also there are lots of characters; and each character is special than the other and trust me, you're gonna love more than just one character.
In addition, the VILLIANS in TVD are literally the best and I bet you will love them more than the main good characters... they showed us that people can change, and bad people don't just born evil; life makes them like that...
Shortly, don't hesitate watching this show. You're gonna cry a lot but I dare you finish it and not feel any change in you're life 'cause you will !!."
419,"I've watched this like 3 times and it's permanently on repeat, between other shows. I can't help but feel that, after Elena becomes a vampire, the entire storyline changes too much. She changes too much, comparing to who she was when the show started. I also have mixed feelings about how she switches between Stefan and Damon. With Stefan, her relationship was cute and safe, and I like her relationship with Damon as well, but it's just weird. I would've loved to have more of Katherine on the show - she truly performed ""the role of a lifetime"". She's charismatic, thinks fast, figures out a solution everytime, although she's selfish and unable to genuinly care for other people. I think I petty her more than Elena, because she never truly had anyone to teach her and to care for her.
I don't know, I just would've loved another ending for things. I would've given Caroline a life with Stefan, skipped a few seasons that were not that interesting etc.
A good show nevertheless - but first 4 seasons are the best of the entire show. Originals is better than TVD (in my opinion)."
420,"This show is always gonna be one of my favourites,it beautifully shows the love stories as well as about meaning of friends and families,the thrilling adventures they have,the show is big and the more you watch the more you want it,it made me have such life and such friends."
421,I recommend watching everything on netflix before watching tvd because once you watch tvd nothing will top it. Amazing characters so interesting
422,Didn't really like it Teeb wolf is way better.
423,"Awesome show....i have watched it's all season twice.
It is a very great show and i loved to experience this.
You should experience this too"
424,"So many story lines ripped off from buffy..elana caught between good vapire and bad vampire..just like angel and spike...witches, warewolves vampires oh my..buffy get body taken over by faith and elana gets taken over by katherine...bonny gets all bad witchy same as willow..diaries have the travelers and buffy has the slayers...buffy has scooby gang, diaries have their own sidekicks with special powers except fot matt and xander...xander also had a doppelgänger..."
425,"The series is incredible. I thought I was not going to like it because I do not usually like The CW series, but in the end this has become one of my favorite series. As such The CW series, I tend to like them but have never been hooked like this. If you haven't seen it, you have to see it as soon as possible. I just adore her"
426,"Just completed all the seasons, can't say it's a great show. Many characters were unnecessary and drag, few love stories looks forced and unconvincing. I felt writers lost the plot after 5th seasons and played on public demand?Last and ending season is disappointing and wrapped up horridly, most illogical and unconvincing way.
Character like Ellena and Bonnie, given most screen space are shellfish and revengeful. In later seasons, their characters become so irritating and annoying that you hardly bare their presence, dialogue and whining.
However enjoyed till 5th episode, hence given the good rating."
427,"Great show considering the usual plot, perfectly casted aswell"
428,"I seriously don't like Bonnie. Like stupid decision after stupid decision. Granted she is a kid so being stupid is natural.Over all a decent show, pretty predictable but enjoyed it so far. 4 seasons in."
429,I really loved this series. This series have all in it. The entertainment which people need. Butvit is really vey emotional at end of this wonderful series which shows the beautiful bond of bothers and love and friends. This is really a beautiful series i never seen. This is to be one of the best series in History. I loved to watch this series.
430,"At first, I started it because I was bored but then I got ADDICTED. A-D-D-I-C-T-E-D. I would spend all day in my room watching it and sometimes not sleeping and I just love how it spins off with the originals and legacies. I have watched originals twice and I'm on my last episode to finish my second time on TVD and I'm going to watch the last episode of season 2 in legacies. I can't believe how far I've gotten in the past year. These series are all amazing and I don't know how I will survive when legacies finishes. I plan on watching V-Wars after I finish it because it has Ian somerhalder as the main character. I encourage everyone to try to watch these."
431,"In my opinion, only Season 1 was great! Damon was such a brilliantly evil character with a proper introduction and lots of twists and awesome quotes (About Tyler: ""'Dude', really? 'Dude'? Come on, nobody´s gonna miss this idiot"")I loved how he mocked the clichéd Teenage-Drama-characters and relations in this village. I think, the scripts ruined it all later with the start of next season. A lot of the characters´ cores and relations were overdone and they took it all too far.
By the end it felt like only Matt was the last remaining human being in Mystic Falls.Still, keeping S1 close to my heart."
432,At the season 1-6 were excellent but the season 7 and 8 so much bored
433,"I watched it when i was a teenager and it was alright for me back then, but it's not the perfect series and has some bugs"
434,"Season 1 to 4 worth watching. 10 rates for season 1 to 4. And litterally i love stelena. Stefen is the most amazing character of the show. I am not happy with season 5, it is boring without originals. Looking forward to season 6,7 and 8."
435,"When I started watching the show I had really low expectations. Surprisingly, I got addicted after the first season. The story line is unpredictable, which got me glued to my seat. Although a little plot twist here and there is necessary in order to keep the audience interested, I feel like the script writers really overdid it. After finishing season 4 I got tired of it and stopped watching. If the show was shorter I would have probably rated it a solid 9."
436,"Best tv series so far, obsessed with it. It actually contains everything."
437,"Or killing time, I was reluctant to watch this but thought I would give it a go. With eye candy like Damon he kept me watching, however I'm nearly at the end of season one and Elena is getting on my nerves already. That 'poor me' innocent girl act gets old quickly who's clearly an attention seeking flirt with both Damon and Matt whilst with Stefan is even more painful. She's an attractive girl but plain, I think there would have been much better options out there to play her part. In the book it was a blonde and blue eyes, so I'm thinking they should have stuck to that. I can't explain it but she really is annoying and given she left the show to seek fame and didn't get it kinda goes to show she's not as talented as she thinks.
All the other characters were perfectly cast. When she plays Katherine geez hardly looks like a vampire In the 1800's hence why I thing wrongly cast and a blonde that can put on an accent would have been more believable. Too bad Jodie Comer was too young as she would have been ideal. Worth giving it a shot as Damon is so damn good looking!"
438,"Great, addicting, hardcore story line just draws you in."
439,I got through a few episodes but did not like the dumb blonde story for Caroline The actors are too old to be in high school too.
440,This series is a complete love story. Boring script and convenient screenplay. The same thing they hate people for doing they do it to others. They kill by mistake and give a justification. If the same thing done by others they kill or restraint them. The lead character Elena is selfish one. I hated her throughout the series. And people die and comeback as they intend. Evil characters in one season leave in other like they go on vacation. The most wise and powerful beings fall for dumb plans. Same as teenwolf but better.
441,Vampire Diary's is life. It's amazing and just amazing and also just amazing
442,A wonderful binge series! Its worth watching!! If you are into Supernatural.. this is the right choice!!
443,"A bit choppy in the acting and the dialogue, but hopefully will improve in the later seasons!"
444,"I've watched all of the seasons since day 1. I love the story line between the Salvatore brothers and Elena. I really enjoyed the flash backs scenes as well. I fell in love with all of the characters, my favorite was Damon as well as Katherine, Caroline and then after I really enjoyed Rebecca. This show is about vampires, humans and witches trying to co-exist in mystic falls. Near the end of the final two seasons it got a bit boring for me because I expected more or a different story line but overall the show was still my top choice. If you enjoy vampire movies and shows, this one is a great one to watch!"
445,Been watching for the last six months and it's been great. There's been some downs but a normal amount for a show of this length. It achieves exactly what it set out to achieve and is perfect for its target audience. Actors also great and everyone's chemistry is great. Just finished the whole show like an hour ago and I'm genuinely upset over the thought of not watching it New ever again.
446,I think there is a big mistake in the episode because of the converted history teacher who was locked inside the school because he can not get out because of the sun even though he had three vampires carrying rings so how can he not go out and save the girl 🤔where the director and the author of this show I want a ring.😅
447,"Such an amazing tv show would totally recommend, no need for the ending though it's to sad"
448,"In the first six episodes of the first season, they were very loose but little by little the plot became interesting. The characters began to have depth as well as history, with tender and toxic relationships, friendships, fights and even take into account issues about problems in society. In the series can conter this type of cliche toxic relationship but at least admit it in comparison to other series or movies. In my opinion, the villains are better developed than the same protagonist, since they have reasons to commit their atrocities. Finally what I want to highlight is the good that this series attributes to friends, that is the main value, of course we can see betrayals and deceptions but they teach us the value of forgiveness. I really recommend this series."
449,"If you love vampire stories, this is a MUST! Every single part of the plot is well organised and developed during the show, noting's left behind. Every episode is intriguing and makes you feel strong emotions, especially the love stories between the main characters. Loved it so much. It's the third time I'm watching it !!!"
450,Have seen a lot of good shows but TVD always stays in my top 3 favorite. When I watch other series about Witches or movies about Vampires I start to miss The Vampire Diaries. The cast is great and they keep it intetesting from S01-S08
451,Genial hasta las 6 las dos ultimas temporadas no tanto
452,"I really love this series, but for some reason I've always liked stefani from the beginning of the film. And I still can't accept her dying in the end. He deserved a truly beautiful and happy ending. I still feel sorry for that. :("
453,"Through ups and downs, deaths and undeaths, The Vampire Diaries kept it wild, interesting and mostly fun."
454,I watched all the seasons soo many time....damn...miss it alot....watched so many series but none can beat this...hav a emotional connection with this one..everything about this series was amazing starting frm the casts to the storyline to the direction etc. One of the best series of all time... <3
455,"This show will always have a place in my heart.
Just finished watching it all and everything was just so perfect. 100%
The storyline, the cast, every single thing!"
456,This show is honestly my absolute favorite. I love almost every character and the story is just so interesting. I watch it over and over and I just can't stop! I strongly encourage everyone to watch it! I also loved the Originals and I'm watching Legacies now. Watch all three and you won't regret it!
457,"When I was in season 3, I began to hate elena because of her ""it should always be me and all about me"" character and the stefan / elena scene, since then I
always skip elena and stefans cheeesy scene together and it helps! I manage to watch alllll of the season by fastforwarding/skipping their scene together., You guys should try it 👍👌"
458,"The Vampire Diaries was a show that got me hooked after watching only the first few episodes. Only one season stuck out as not-so-good, but that also means that 7 of the 8 seasons I really enjoyed. Very compelling, suspenseful and full of twists, this show will leave you in shock almost every episode. Please give it a watch; it might take a little while to get into."
459,"My all time favorite show, probably because i started watching it at such a young age. i am rewatching it for the forth time now (yes, forth time) and i still cry, laugh, or get mad, even though i know exactly what's gonna happen. 100% recommend if you like vampires, werewolves, witches, etc. you'll fall deeply in love with some characters (cough cough damon and klaus cough cough) and believe me, you won't want it to end (i refuse to accept that it's over). love it!"
460,Not sure which was first but after few episodes i find it pretty much same as twilight. Loved twilight so i find this boring
461,"""teens"" (that are adults..clearly not high school..freshman...:/)
CONSTANTLY drinking...promoting drinking..normalizing drinking....as if every teen just always drinks ...
even teens (&everyone) drinking liqours from crystal...CONSTANTLY..
i get that it's an easy way to have actors be busy doing slmething while they say lines...i've acted..my son is an actor...i know how it is..
.but did the directors need to SO lazy?...
...what else didn't work?
..so much cheese..
luckily netflix lets us fast forward through cheesy moments..like every forced ""love"" moment/dragged out conversation between elena & stephan... ...or all the whining ..she or caroline do...
at least i think they realized it wasn't working (stephan maybe could have some acting lessons & learn to pretent some emotions..the stoic blank face got old real quick)
loved the plot twist to have her leave stuffy stephan for the bad boy & actual actor who is Damon..he truly carries the show..him & a few others...
loved that she gets to ahow actual acting when she is a vampire...
i love/hate this show and just resolved to watch it with the remote in hand to fast forward through the cheese.. forced non working relationships & filler crap..
i highly recommend doing that..it & the actor playing damon save the show"
462,I love it so much and its definitely worth a watch trust me you'll be obsessed with it by episode 2
463,"Loved this show but My God, could Nina Dobrev's character be more annoying and more of a pain in the... There isn't one episode where her character Elena is flattering. 
However, she redeems herself when playing Katherine. 
One HORRIFIC character which the show is so (too much) centered around and the other character was truly great. 
Still I give the show a 9 out of 10, as it's one of the very few series I can stand for 8 seasons. However it is definitely not as good as it's successor The Originals."
464,I'm a huge fan of vampires so I really loved this show. At least the first 6 seasons. Once Nina left things went down hill just a little. You can really see the difference in chemistry between Elena and Damon after their real life breakup. The season finale was a disappointment. I enjoyed how the characters developed over time. Caroline became the strongest (IMO). Damon was my favorite of the bothers. He had some great one liners in the show. Enzo had the best one liners though. I've watched the show 3 times already. Although I stop after season 6. No sense in wasting time watching the last two seasons over again.Definitely watch The Originals if you watch The Vampire Diaries. The Originals are just as awesome.
465,Best vampire show even created. The way that the script writters told us this story was notoriously thorough Good job CW Company.
466,"It's a dark and sexy show that got me amazed with the very gorgeous and talented cast. Each season that show turnt being darker and deeper but it was also portraying about friendship and love with the more thorough way. I really think 8 seasons were enough to tell this dark, sexy and cult story called The Vampire Diaries."
467,"VAMPIRES. The first thing that comes to ur mind when u hear of this word is TWILIGHT. Most people think when they hear the title of the show and the very goodlooking characters they tend to assume its just another stereotypical teen romance about vampires and i dont really blame u, i myself believe the name of the show could use some improvement. when i started watching the show i was very skeptical and presumptuous of it too but as i progressed my wold was changed forever. The show is so much more than two brothers fighting for the love of one girl. The plot of the story is what gets everyone hooked on it. the show has drama, romance, violence, character development, unthinkable plot twists that leave u in awe and so much more. It is one of the best shows i have ever watched and i would recommend almost everyone to watch it. Trust me u wont be disappointed"
468,I didnt like episode 1 or 2 at all but I started liking it around episode 3 and it's very interesting and intriguing and makes you want to watch more I would definitely recommend this but try to get past the first 2 episodes if you don't like and then it gets better
469,THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SERIES! GREAT ACTORS AND STORY!
470,"This show is soooooooo much a rip off of Twilight and True Blood, but I can't stop watching!"
471,"Ok, so I willl very honestly write this review and say that the show started out amazing. The story seemed a typical highschool drama in the first few episodes but then it improves with every episode and honestly speaking , I think season 2 and season 3 are perfection. The character development of all the characters, especially Damon and Stefan, the blend in of the originals and their plot twists, Katherine pierce and her badassery; all these things come together and make season 2 and season 3 perfect. I think the reason the show started going downhill from season 4 is because of two reasons, A) a vampire turned Elena honestly changed the story dynamics and the story became more revolved around Elena and her love life rather than the thriller vampire adventures the audience looked forward too, and secondly they honestly made this recipe of introducing a new supernatural villian backed up by an ancient historical tale who is attacking mystic falls every year and Elena and her friends end up fighting them. Season 5 was literally a ripoff of the earlier seasons, they conjured these stupid creatures called Travellers who needed the doppelganger blood to break the curse. Season 6 was much better though, I enjoyed the new relationship of Damon and Bonnie, Kai was an intriguing villain and the story took pretty unexpected turns. Season 7 and we are back to the same old shenanigans, again there is a revival of some deadly super natural creatures. Honestly speaking , the whole Julian affair and the huntress thing was boring and predictable. Season 8 was still good, although the ending broke my heart. I still gave this series a 8/10 because the first few seasons of this show are a pretty close to my teenage self,this show gave us amazing characters. Stefan , Damon , Katherine , Lexie. Liz Forbes. One of the best things about this show is that contrary to popular belief, its not all about romance, infact, for me it is more about the brotherhood of Stefan and Damon. Stefan and Damon were best friends who ended up as enemies because of their love for Katherine, then came back together after a century reunited by their love for Elena. And eventually, Stefan loved Damon so much that he decided to give up Elena for him because he could see his humanity returning thanks to her. I honestly love Stefan and Damons relationship. Anyways, the point being that I would recommend this show despite the fact that its quality fell over time, because it still encapsulates beautiful characters and story telling."
472,"I learned about this series 5 years ago....i used to see it because of ian somerhalder....But after few months i fell in love with Katherine....I know she is evil, but she is smart, funny, and independent....It was Klaus who made her like that(who i hate him).Joseph Morgan is such a good Klaus that i was afraid of him(not lying)...In 2014 Katherine died....This was the end....They killed the best character and destroyed the series.I used to like this series, but in season 6 stopped watching...6/10 .I wish i could give more but i can't.Nina Dobrev was an excellent Katherine.She should have a golden globe....But she wasn't even nominated....Unlike that ugly Anna Paquin...Nina, Ian, Kat, Joseph and Claire are my favorite actors.Caroline and Jeremy are a little stupid."
473,I watched this tv show from when it first aired to the end and over the years It developed into an amazing series. Not only were the supernatural components great but the everyday people problems were what made this such a lovable series. I highly recommend for teens/young adults as the issues it touches base on are aimed at that age. Watch it and you won't be disappointmented!The season finale (CRIED FOR HOURS)It's been added to my 'pull it out once a year and binge watch' pile.
474,"Honestly this show was my addition. I loved it. The characters are amazing and it was an emotional roller coaster all the time. The characters grown so much since season one it's amazing. But there where something's that got boring after awhile and it was very predictable who Elena was going to choose in the end. But I really loved the fact that the characters went through very realistic feelings and emotions, but in like a supernatural fiction way, like it wasn't so fake that you couldn't relate, but it wasn't so relatable that it's took away from the supernatural aspects of the show. I've always been really into supernatural things, so when I found the show it was like a whole nother world, they gave me a lot of the aspects of supernatural and fantasy that I was looking for. Even though some of the dialogue was a little off, and the plot was a little all over the place, and somethings got boring sometimes. Overall this is and amazing show. The characters and relationships between them are awesome, and you can really see how much they grow as an actor, and the character they're playing. I would really recommend the show for anybody that wants a very long show, and that's really into fantasy and Supernatural things."
475,"Imagine you're watching a stage play in a theater with very talented actors & actresses. You feel their emotions, their pain, their happiness, but then some dude in the audience behind you starts singing on his guitar and moaning and mumbling out loud how his girlfriend broke his heart. ANNOYING. I'd turn around and ask the guy to STFU. So while you're trying to focus on the story, the characters and their moment, the vocals of the music they use breaks immersion. Don't get me wrong, I like emotional vocal music, but you can't do both IMO. Do you want to focus on the emotions of the characters and their intense moment or do you want to feel the emotion of the singer? IMO you can't do both. Fortunately they don't play vocals over all the scenes. There are some very intense scenes where they have instrumental music and you can feel and focus on the emotions of the actors. It's funny, during the most important scenes they know better than to play cheesy vocal music. If I could somehow turn off all the vocal music, I would've given the show a 9/10. The actors deserved better than to have annoying teeny bop vocal music played over them. There was lots of Tokenism in Season 7 & 8. They're trying to do the diversity and inclusion crap, but it just resulted in poorly written characters and using under qualified actors."
476,"Best Show i have seen so far!!! The characters, the storyline, just everything about this show is epic!"
477,"I have started watching because my friend suggested me. First two episod was like love story and then real fun started. I just can't explain how entertaining this series is. Every character of this series has different story to tell with so many different veiws. Some time you will feel emotional and sometime you will feell happy. It will make you so tempting that what is gonna happen next. It will make you feel like its happening with you. You can feel every character of this series. I would like to suggest that if you are planning to watch it, watch it continously. Once you go till 2 or 3 season then you will understand what is happening. Why this series is so catchy. Hope you guys enjoy it the way i did.,"
478,"The Vampire Diaries started in 2009 when I started High school. My mom and I rented the first season at Blockbuster and wanted more. TVD basically got me through my high school years. I never missed an episode. I was team Stelena from the get go. Best show ever and best cast ever. Lots of episodes that left me on the edge of my seat. Poor Stefan deserved better. After 8 years of never missing an episode and being a complete super fan, I was devastated when it ended. Stefan didn't deserve to die. The final episode wasn't horrible, but there was a lot of things that had loose ends. It felt rushed. Hair and makeup for the return of Katherine and Elena was sloppy. They looked horrible. So that's why I give a 9 out of 10. Best show for a long time and then it went out without a big bang."
479,"My Youth, since I was 15, My first American shows."
480,"Two vampires that go back and forth between being good and evil. Throw in a ""good"" witch, werewolves, ghosts, and other demons. Then add a main female lead that takes turns loving and hating the two vampires, and what do you have? Buffy, Angel, Spike, & Willow or Elena, Stefan, Damon & Bonnie. Add some additional ""supporting roles"" in the guise of friends, and what do you get? ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", ""The Vampire Diaries"" and other wannabees, such as ""Twilight"", ""Being Human"", ""Underworld"", and more. Then throw in some odds & ends (more similarities) with ""Eureka!"",  a bit of ""The Grunge"" and ""The Ring"" and you basically end up with one show with different titles. ""Buffy"" was okay, ""Twilight"", and especially ""The Vampire Diaries"" were a little better. And it all culminated with a big let-down in ""The Gates"". Don't waste your time with the last one. ""The Gates"" only lasted one season, and tried to encompass the main plot points of all the others in that short time span."
481,"Katheryn, Jeremy & Isabel were by far the worst characters in the show. made me not want to watch the show. much of the show was unrealistic but it was somewhat appealing which is why I initially watched it."
482,"The characters on this show are soap opera psychopaths or sociopaths. There are never good people. If they do seem ""good"" in the beginning, the writers slaughter their innocence. Elena, like the doppelgangers before her, was an evil magnet. Damon is an enabler for Elena and Stefan. Speaking of Stefan, he had the dangerous Salvatore brother codependency thing regardless of what people tell me. Bonnie was a used punching bag that never stopped those who would treat her that way. All of these characters defend problems and danger more than end them. Oh, and this series stopped getting interesting for me after Kol and Klaus left in season 5. The only reason why I watched this was because of Katherine, Kol, and Klaus. They could have made a KKK group to represent their names. The kind of KKK group that some people would rather see if you know what I mean."
483,"Getting Netflix last year and clicking on The Vampire Diaries is probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. I don't have the words to describe or explain how much love I have for the characters that I have started to fall in love with over time. The chemistry that the characters have together is just too beautiful and I love them all more than anything. I have watched the show 4 times and have started to read the books and I'm currently on the 6th. The books are amazing, but nothing like the show. I will always choose the show, but I do love the books. If you read this, then please just watch the show and I guarantee you will love it. Just the gorgeous male characters such as the Salvatore brothers or Mikaelson brothers, you will fall in love with, just like I have. The actors and actresses all play the parts so well and have such stunning talent. What I am writing right now is nothing compared to the love I have I wish I could describe, but it's not possible. All I can say is this show has helped me through so much, and it's uniqueness and beauty always makes me smile, and I will never not be in love with the show. Watch the show and you won't regret it. Always and forever, Keira."
484,I finished all 177 episodes and fell in love with it when i first watched it on the last episode i cried my eyes out realizing that that this amazing show is irreplaceable and that this amazing of actors and actresses are amazing and so talented.
485,"I'm on my 5th re-watch of the series and I absolutely love the pacing of the first two seasons. Lots of major events take place in a relatively short amount of time. Those two seasons really drew me in and made me stick through some of the not-so-fun episodes. 
I've read the books the series is based on and I've got to say (and this is rare) the TV version is MUCH better than the books. I know it seems silly to say the TV series is more realistic, because obviously nothing is realistic about the series, but it truly is. The actors were perfect for their rolls, all of them.
Nina Dobrev does a phenomenal job. It's unbelievable how much of a difference there is between Elena and Katherine. She's also extremely beautiful. In fact, everyone on the show is beautiful. 
There's Stefan/Paul Wesley and his ""ugly"" cries at various times. There's Damon who makes even killing innocent people look fun (and always looks good doing it). I don't think I'll ever enjoy another show the way I enjoy this one."
486,"Noticeably, I read wiki about Jamie, Bonnie's stepbrother who deserve a minor role and did not have any important role or story background. Don't blame CW network that show diversity with some African- American actors. Mostly, CW covered many Caucasian celebrities in early 2000s. Though, it is still a great teen vampire drama and action show. I did praised actor's performance. Jamie Bennett, who played by Robert Richard who did not displayed a major role in The Vampire Diaries. The Originals in spin-off show have African American witches, vampires and werewolves. He should played more like any gangsta rappers. I also had seen him in many shows like Skeeter. It seem confusing to follow up that I watch Do Not Gentle an episode which he had almost killed by Klaus. The episode may get sensitive by many African-American viewer. It bugged me when Bonnie and Jamie Bennett are in sex. I think awkward and confusing. TVD took place in Mystic Fall which why show minor African American role. We need show more 90s supernatural legends and creatures."
487,"1 of the most addictive shows I have ever seen.Moreover, I'm in love with its music.I remember the day when I started with The Vampire Diaries and I was bit scare of it because lately, I was done with The breaking bad so I didn't want to ruin my taste of tongue.Eventually,this show held with a promising start and apparently, I didn't even notice that how strongly I got hooked into it. Lastly,I must say that this show is a worth time spending series."
488,"I am hooked on this show. At first I thought it was just about this love triangle. But, it's so much more than that. The Vampire Diaries is one of the best shows I've ever watched. It aired from 2009 to 2017 and has 8 seasons. However, romance and drama play a huge role in the show. Also, if you don't like the supernatural types of shows, then I don't recommend this show for you."
489,"The vampire diaries is one of my favorite series (after pretty little liars of course) it has constant drama and suspense. Elena Gilbert is the main character and she starts off dating Stefan Salavatore, who is a vampire as the series develops she falls in love with his older brother Damon Salvatore and from there the plot thickens."
490,"Not being really critical about it. Just what I felt in the heart. Heart to heart talk. Finally the not so long last season. Vampire diaries comes to an end for me. Now, I wish it never ended. Characters in the series start to seem undo able without. They certainly became a part of my somewhat solitary life. ""I was feeling Epic""- 2nd last episode , last season. #vampirediaries #forever #forevermine *all teary eyed* :'( P.S - Stefan's hero hair intact at last. Never gonna wear off. #salvatorebrothers #elena #stefan #damon #carolineforbes #elizabethforbes #bonbon #bonniebennet #bonniethewitch #alaricsaltzman #ric #tyler #jeremy #werewolves #twilight #lorenzo #enzo #niklaus #klaus #originals #katherine #donovon #mattdonovon. Can't go on, but in love with each and every one of them. Paul Wesley Ian Somerhalder Nina Dobrev Kat Graham Candice Accola Gonna miss each and every one of you."
491,"The meant it when the said the show was a drama, worth watching anyways. Bonnie is far my favorite character, strong, independent, resilient and loyal it was quite beautiful see how they develop her history. Also it was interesting to see how Caroline and Dammon became better ""persons"" through the seasons...and the poor Stefan finally got peace. Wouldn't change a thing."
492,"This is literally the best show i've watched in my entire life. I admit, season 1 isn't the best but oh my days it honestly just gets better and better. I highly recommend it for teens who are looking for a new show to watch. It also has a successful spin-off show called The Originals, which doesn't have as much romance in so if you're looking for something more sophisticated then go for that show instead :)"
493,"first 4 seasons its interested teen TV marmelade. (rating 8/10) season 5: tralala bored... season 6: painful to watch... season 7: first half is watchable, then again too bored... season 8: wake me up...rating 6/10 because season 5-8. DON'T waste time after season 4! start to watch the Originals."
494,BEST SHOW EVER!!! it really makes you feel alive and live the adventure like you are really on the show. i wish there were more seasons and Stefan didn't have to die. and its the only show that makes us love viliains like Katherine <3 she is one of my best characters thanks to the great actor Nina Dobrev <3 and really great actors by the way especially Paul and Candice and of course Ian and Nina too <3
495,"I'm really sad that the series ends here. Well i enjoyed watching a long 172 episode series. And I should to say that the climax was awesome. But they could've shown us at least a glimpse of Damon's and Elena's life, romance, their children etc. It's understandable that Every story can't be a happy ending. But I feel like they have hurried a little bit to end the series. And they just left a question unanswered. How did Bonnie break the spell of Kai Parker? Well every story leaves some question marks isn't it?"
496,"I will say that this show suffers from the same thing that has plagued many great seasons these days. Just like Prison Break, the producers get greedy for the views and keep on adding episodes for the sake of more episodes. I think this season is actually twice the length it should have been. What viewers need is a good story with proper closure, this show leaves many ends unexplained.The acting is great, You find loving characters you once hated and hating the ones that you once liked. The emotional scenes are really well done but the more you stick to it the more it feels like stretching the same story over multiple seasons. You get an all powerful villain, defeated by a hero who has to take questionable decisions, their friends forgive the hero because the dead actually come back alive. I'm not saying that everyone becomes a vampire, but the ones that should die, don't. In the end what lets this show down is that nothing is certain ever. You might have a character that died in first season come back, while others become downright invincible despite being very vulnerable. This puts me off very much.I'm actually happy with the ending and believe it is worth going through all the drama that is the rest of the series, though first half of the series is the best part."
497,"I grew up reading the first 4 books of The Vampire Diaries, 90's child after all and at first I was really disappointed that the t.v show didn't follow the books more closely (I am a traditionalist when it comes to book to movie/ t.v show conversions). After watching the first season I am so glad that the only person that they really kept completely true to the books was Damon, Ian Somerhalder fit my ideal vision of Damon to a Tee. In the books I didn't really like Elena at all and Didn't really care for Stefan either. I think the books were the rare ones where I actually liked the secondary characters better then the mains. I felt like T.v version of Elena was a lot more relatable and likable, contrary to what I have read in other comments she did grow and mature, she went from not able to cope or accept her Vampirism to being OK with it, yes it took her awhile, at the end she was able to live with it. I think one of the reasons I don't like Stefan is that he is too noble and self sacrificing, he also denies his inner nature. Where as Damon has always been upfront about who he is, he is a narcissist and selfish but he admits it. At the end of the day Damon will make the harsh decisions, he will do what ever is necessary to save his friends and family. Stefan and Damon alternately love each other and hate each other, their whole relationship puts the dys in dysfunctional. How could they EVER have a normal relationship when their father was an abusive monster and their mother abandoned them?Up until now I have loved seasons 1-6, even though the show has gradually become darker and darker. After watching season 7 I think that once Nina Dobrev decided to leave the show it feels like it has fractured, it just isn't the same without her, at least for me. The whole show is supposed to be about the brothers relationship plus the relationship that they have with Elena. Also loved watching the dynamics between Elena, Bonnie and Caroline. Bonnie, Matt and Caroline have pretty much gone their separate ways with Caroline going to Texas, Matt pretty much has become the supernatural police, so there is only Bonnie left to help Damon and Stefan :(. I also found the jumping around from present day to three years in the future really confusing and wish that they had put all the present day episodes together and have them lead up to the future."
498,"I was really loving this show... Until they ruined it. They completely destroyed the plot in season 4!! I loved the Twilight saga and the show also begins with a deep heart-blowing love story. Then, probably to extend it into more episodes, they ruined it. They are lucky that there are plenty of girls that have the bad-boy syndrome. Because that is what happens. I'd love to say it happened in a way that made sense, but it didn't. Has for the rest of the story, again, it started with a really engaging plot and then started to be senseless. I did try to continue seeing it, but I gave up. First seasons are really good though."
499,"What would you do with your life if you were immortal? In this American drama/horror series, The Vampire Diaries (TVD), filled with star-crossed lovers and an everlasting life full of mortal enemies. Before watching the series, I had expected it to be like The Twilight saga written by Stephenie Meyer, full of love stories and violence. TVD stars: (Nina Dobrev) Elena Gilbert, (Paul Wesley) Stefan Salvatore, (Ian Somerhalder) Damon Salvatore, (Kat Graham) Bonnie Bennett, (Candice King) Caroline Forbes and (Zach Roerig) Matt Donovan. This show was created by Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, who are well known for other feature films/shows such as Scream, The Originals and I Know what you did last summer. The start of TVD series was a little slow and confusing—which got more interesting after a few episodes—since so many characters were being introduced to the series at once. After being introduced to everyone, it got more interesting and the plot line got easier to follow. In the series, Elena Gilbert said, ""And I'd choose you; In a hundred lifetime, in a hundred worlds, in any version or reality, I'd find you and I'd choose you,"" this is a love story you'll want to know about. This series is something that had you on the edge of your seat for every episode, I loved how action packed and scary it could be at times. Overall, this is a must-see, with my rating of 9 out 10 stars, this can be appropriate for anyone fourteen and older (TV-14)."
500,This show was my favourite TV show of all time.. Even half way through season 4 and all of season 5 when it declined still loved it. Then nina dobrev/elena decided to leave I thought that's it its over but it wasn't in fact I just realised what it was really about the 2 brothers and there bond and how much they hated each other but loved each other at the same time. People were complaining about the final episode expecting a big delena scene but like I said it was never really about her it was about the brothers and there relationship. like Stefan said in season 6 he thought he needed her but he needed his brother more. The ending was a bit sad but I liked it especially the final scene with stefan and damon pefect end to a perfect show I thought it was epic. anyway rip tvd I will probably never like a TV show like this again.
501,"I have been a fan of The Vampire Diaries for a little over four years now, so I guess you can say that we have history together. I absolutely love the show for everything that it is. When I was first made aware of the show, I thought that I would not enjoy it all that much. I thought that it would be something to watch when there was nothing to watch. I thought that it would be some underdeveloped, knock off version of the Twilight series, but luckily, I was wrong. Unlike Twilight, Vampires in The Vampire Diaires' world can't procreate, which makes more sense to me since they are supposedly dead creatures. The Vampire Diaries completely took me by surprise by its unique storyline, characters, and special effects. The shows usage of flashback makes the show unique because every show is not able to pull of a successful flashbacks. I love the show for the way that storyline continues to progress; there was never any filler episode to me because every episode revealed something new.. The individual story lines always tie back to the main storyline, which also makes the show interesting and earn its label as a drama. The creatures that they have in the vampire diaries are definitely a force to be reckon with, which is why the show has earned its label as a fantasy. The show has been successful for over five years. It's been so successful that I spin off show was created based on some breakout characters on The Vampire Diaries. If you watch this show, I'm pretty sure that you will see why the show has been such a success. I'm positive that you will love the show just as much as I do now."
502,"First of all, I started this show since my best friend absolutely adored it, and had recommended it to me for a while; somehow being able to bring it up in most of our conversations. I started to watch the show, and within the first half of season one; I was hooked! I agreed with nearly everything she had ever praised the show about. The concept of vampires being the victims (which you will see in season five where Enzo is introduced) is incredible, as are *most* of the other story - lines. I'm already on season five, even though I started watching it less than one month ago. It's my new obsession. Also, *spoiler alert for if you haven't watch past S04XE07* I love Elena having both Stefan and Damon, like Katherine; though she never dated them at the same time. Overall, it's an amazing show and definitely should be watched."
503,Nina(Elena) needs a stronger script and acting lessons. Her character is weak and hasn't matured. Watched up to season four; her character is becoming very annoying and dull. Her scenes seem very repetitive and irritating. Such a shame the programme revolves around a dullard. 'There's always an Elena problem'!Overall I enjoy the show.The story lines are good and have some depth.Daemon's character is my particular favourite. His character offers a light hearted humor to an other wise circular storyline. Caroline's character is also a favourite. P.s the Origionals are a much stronger cast.
504,"I love this show , I also love the originals . This is not twilight do not compare it . My favorite character / actor is Paul Wesley who plays Stefan , the immortal vampire with a love for a human and a awful brother . The lead who plays 2 main characters Elena and Katherine (Nina dob-rev) is an amazing actress and I love her role as Katherine more than Elena . Everyone rives about Ian Summer alder (Damon) Cu's yes he has some funny lines but let's not forget he's a idiot . Stefan has more depth to his character and is a better actor there for more enjoyable to watch , I am a team Stelena not Delena and wish more people would be with me considering they were 'soulmatezs' and Elena is only with Damon because she has a ''sire bond' to him making her love him. This show has blood and gore with equal amount of romance and friendship / family depth."
505,"I hate to see this great show come to an end after so many years that show has kept us at the end of our chairs. The Vampire Diaries had a little of everything. Not only was this a Vampire story but it talked about every day topics like family, friends, romance, hate, drugs, and much more. I like that one of the main characters was shown as the villain of the story but as we got to know him we understood his ways, he later became like a hero. Season after season the show kept a constancy of the concept but yet so different. From season one getting to know the story behind it all VAMPIRES and the Original Family, to expect the unexpected. So many different stories about vampires and werewolves, but TVD goes the extra mile involving not only VAMPIRES and WEREWOLVES but having WITCHES, DOPPELGANGER ,HYBRIDS and VAMPIRE HUNTERS."
506,"The vampire diaries has really changed. Season 1 I would rate 7 stars, season 2 I would rate 8 stars season 3 and 4 nine stars and season 5 and 6 I would rate 8 stars due to Caroline's character development and season 7 I would rate 8 stars as I think it is really interesting but I feel that it is a bit messy and so far a real villain hasn't been established, furthermore Enzo and Matt have been lost. I miss Rebekah and lexi and Vicki and Anna but I do still enjoy it without the old characters and character development. Caroline is by far the most enjoyable character to watch as she is really funny and has developed so much. I will also miss Nina Dobrev and Claire Holt but Candice King is the real star of The Vampire Diaries!"
507,"i have never seen a show like vampire diaries, the show give me a feeling nothing on TV can give me. Every day without this show is a struggle, and when it is finally Friday and the new episode is out that feeling is amazing. The actors is amazing they can make me cry they can make me laugh they can make every single atom on my body raise and touch the sky They deserves a lot more rating then 7.9, but vampire diaries have so many haters. For example Supernatural i watch it too and i love the show but vampire diaries is just something else, and every single common fans can agree with me. Personally i hope this show never ends and i hope CW give them more seasons to show us fans their perfect'story line"
508,"Whenever you hear about vampire, a sensation arises. To create this sensation this show is created likely. This show is a trio of The Vampires, The Witches and the Ware-wolf. The story revolves around a girl called Elena (who is a doppelgänger) who falls in love with Stefan Salvatore (one of the vampire brothers). In second season other vampires also start emerging, one of them are The Originals. The arrival of The Originals is like icing on the cake as they are immortals and all the other vampires are their bloodline. It is filled with a lot of Elena drama mystery. There are a lot of turns and twist and a lot of killings whether human, vampire, witch or ware-wolf. Over- all it is a good show with a lot of drama, romance, mystery and what not. If you loved the Twilight series then this series is definitely meant for you guys. At the end a must watch show for all who are obsessed by the vampires and want to know about them."
509,"I love The Vampire Diaries, and have done since the first episode. The range of characters is really good, and it gets better as the seasons go on! I also love the spin off of 'The Originals' which some of the characters are in (it makes sense when you watch) The show is sometimes hard to grasp so my friends have said, as there are a lot of characters will different roles and magical powers - In my opinion you have to be totally watching with 100% attention so you don't miss anything because little things happen all the time and they are easily missed! Damon Salvatore is my favourite character, what a surprise! But he is the dark vampire brother, who changed between good and bad throughout the seasons. I love this as you never know where he's at, but he makes such funny and witty comments throughout which make me love him! SPOILER - In season 7 when there is no Elena, i actually prefer it. Its nice that everyone is not so focused on her and what she needs/wants. Finally!!! all of the other characters are able to share the limelight. I of course love the whole Stefan and Caroline thing and the Enzo and Bonnie thing in particular. If you watch TVD, you will be totally hooked and want to keep watching more! There are always new exciting characters being brought in and taken out throughout the whole series with amazing story lines. I am on my 4th time watching them all through again!"
510,"This is most definitely the best vampire show out there! and personally the best show period. followed closely by ""The Originals"" which is a spin-off show of the vampire diaries. The three main characters Stefan, Damon, and Elena, have an amazingly good character development! and the great character development doesn't stop there, it continues with the other 5ish sub-main characters! The research the directors have put into the show is truly amazing the Magic that is used is incredible accurate (Minus the vampire magic part) according to historical data, I'd give them a 9/10 on accuracy for the magic use. I have yet to see a show by the CW that isn't good! I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes vampire, witch, werewolf, things."
511,"People of all ages will enjoy this show ! I was skeptical when I first started watching the Vampire Diaries on Netflix . I'd never tuned in when it was on TV before . I'm A huge sci-fi / fantasy fan but I always assumed this was as lame as twilight . I binge watched the first 5 seasons ! The first few episodes were slow but then I was hooked .***** MILD / SPOILER BELOW*****There is never a dull moment on this show . Constant plot twists , action , romance and mystery . The chemistry between the main characters is undeniable . I also think a lot of the story was original . The way vampires are turned has an original twist ... The entire ""Orginal Family"" story line was amazing (as is the spin-off ).**** Big spoiler below Do Not read if you are in the middle of the show !!*****The only thing that annoys me about this show ( besides the ever present blood bag supply ) is the whole ""Sire"" thing . Totally get how the hybrids were sired to Klaus but how the hell was Elena sired to Damon ? They didn't explain this enough . So many characters had been turned with no sire bond . And Elenas psychic connection to Stefan , I know they were both doppelgängers but why didn't he have a bond with Katherine to know where she was ? Or with the paramedic ?!"
512,Well where do I begin? I am obsessed with this show. I was In love with the Twilight series and when it ended I was like man now what supernatural vampire show or movie am I going to watch? But I ended up coming across this one and man I'm glad I did! This show has everything you could want and more. It started off just a bit slow in the first couple of episodes but after that it takes you on a ride! Its been 7 seasons and I've seen all of them at least twice Lol. I loved it so much that I got my husband into it and he even likes it! Trust me it is well worth your while and you won't be disappointed with this show! I would give it a 100 rating if i could!
513,"To Write A Review For the vampire diaries, was hard and difficult for me. that film is my favorite, I Love Paul Wesley, Ian Somerhalder And Also Nina Dobrev. they are my favorite actors. When I Am Watching That Film, I Have so bug emotions.Now I Am watching season 7 and that is very cool. I Am Stelena, but its okay that Stefan and Caroline Are Together. I Also Love Them, but i wish Klaus And Caroline Together.They Would Be Perfect Couple. For Me, Season 6 was the best and I Wanted Cry When Elena Died. But I Want Bamon. I Want That Bonnie And Damon Was Together. So, That Was My Review Of The Vampire Diaries, And I Am Still Watching It! That Is The Coolest Film Ever..."
514,"vampire diaries is my favorite movie of all time. Two vampire brothers, Damon who is 160 years old, and Stefan, 156 years old one have an eye for a human girl named Elena who look like a Katherine, a girl Damon and Stefan fell in love with when they were humans.With everything that is going on in mystic falls came the original vampires and the one they feared the most, Klaus, the hybrid of werewolf and vampire. with Elena and Stefan being in love, don't want the attention of an original in their midst wanted the Klaus dead, but later is reminded that Stefan and Damon are sired to Klaus, with him dead, all the vampire from the blood line die with him."
515,"I really love this series i have been watching it from the beginning I love Damon and Caroline the most I only hate Elena because all people in her circle face problems only because of her and she just can't shut up and keeps on interfering in everyones lives It was because of Elena that her Parents ,Jenna, Alaric, Jeremy and Bonnie all had to face problems thats because she can't just shut up at least Katherine is better than her she is known to be the way she is but Elena acts very good to others and others end up in problems because of her its good they have kept her away from season 7 at least season 7 is better because its without Elena"
516,"TVD is a drama which has every element a person would require to see in their relax/free time.Horror,Romance,Thriller and full of many twists and turns that a drama could have.I really like the way they introduce new characters and relate to 1880's legends.Let me summarize my thoughts or like/dislikes for TVD to make it easy for you to judge:Things I like: 1)Twists 2)A new mystery in every episode 3)Doing it a different version of book 4)Reflects that Vampires do have weaknesses 5)Fantasy that creates addiction Things I dislike: 1)Too much romance 2)Stefan is just a character 3)Elena the main character Died :( I don't think i need to read the book because i know everything!Thank you so much for viewing and give i a thumbs up if you find it useful!~Ann"
517,"The show was good up until season 3. I remember watching it on TV, and when they were on Netflix I was so excited. Then before season 4 came on Netflix I quit watching it for a while. I cannot get into season 4,5 and 6. But I still rate TVD a 9/10, because they have made great efforts to spice this show up and continue to get millions of viewers. The screenplay was good, very few mistakes in the show itself. However, I personally thought season 1 was slow at portraying certain characters, they didn't go into enough detail without completely giving away their whole story. In season 2 they went by to fast with Katherine, I never truly understood her back story until season 4. I thought season 3 was their best season, characters were developed and things started to change (in a nice, smooth manor). Season 4, it started off okay, but ended strangely, I didn't like the whole Silas and the Travelers idea. And this also continued through season 5."
518,"I'm not real big on teen drama shows, but when the genre you like is overloaded with them you take what you can get. So after avoiding the series for years I saw 6 seasons for the taking on Netflix just when I needed a new long term show to watch so it won. It took me several weeks to force down the first half of season 1 and just when the loop of Damon being a jerk and Stephan sickeningly kind (he's a vampire!) I finally saw a break in the flow that caught my interest. Character development and the beginnings of a backdrop. So by the time Elana got Stephan to openly admit his secret it had my interest. Through the first few seasons I would rate it a solid 8 as the story was about the characters and there was depth developing. By seasons 4 and 5 they had introduced an overload of mystic history that I really didn't care about. Plus after all this stuff had gone untouched for 1000 years why where they all becoming prominent with this group of kids now. The show through remained good and held my attention with the constant development of the people. Who'd have thought Damon could be a good guy during the first year and a half, yet as shocking as it was that Elena chose him over Stephan it was even more surprising that he truly began to change to be more selfless and develop a legitimate healed bond with his brother that they both acknowledged they needed to make over the long hall. Just finishing season 6 I however don't think the show is going to make it much past season 7. I'll watch season 7 but be very surprised if there is a season 8. Reading the entertainment news it is pretty clear Elena is gone moving on to who knows what sort of career. She is pretty and for this show a good fit, but I am actually surprised to see Caroline demonstrating more broad talent that her. While I think the show has enough steam to keep going another season I just don't see a long term future for it without Elena. She was the central character from the beginning, and while many have grown (and many dies off) I see more hope for The Originals having a 4 or 5 season run than much more being squeezed out of TVD. A 7 Season run is pretty good and most of it enjoyable, but some changes just aren't going to allow the show to remain viable and I don't see it making it without Elena. I'm guessing Aleck and Damon will spend some episodes getting drunk and flashing back to the misery of losing their loved ones, Stephan and Caroline developing a relationship, and without Elena to bond the natural enemies together Matt and others becoming true hunters of those that have dumped on their lives. Interesting that the new bad guys will be led by the Salvator bro's mom, but they better be careful or that will become to much of the plot real fast (like so every season has had since season 3). Overall I think the show had a good run but believe that with every additional season from this point my rating will go down. I would of course like to see the show end with the reunion of Damon and Elena, but there really can't be a ""happily ever after"" for them so I think she is just gone (and dear GOD I hope they don't turn a quest for her blood as the cure for every loser vamp the theme). Kind of like when they killed Tera on SOA sometimes the writing is just on the wall reading clear ""this show has run its course"". As painful as Season 7 of SOA was I hope Season 7 of the vampire diaries instead is a closure but without such unbridled darkness that I can't include the last season when rating it. It was good, built to be more than I expected, but they lost the main character, so time to find closure and more on."
519,"The Vampire Diaries is truly a great show with many good actors and a fairly consistent script. It is one of those shows that you have to watch more than 4 episodes to get into. Granted, the first episodes do not set the tone for this epic vampire series, but you get the general idea of where things are going.I would say seasons 1-3 are my favourite, because they have strong additional characters who stand out and the plot isn't too complicated. Standouts like Klaus (Joseph Morgan) really steal the scenes. After season 3 the show started to go downhill, partly due to the lack of consistency and clear plot. Now I have always found Elena a bit annoying, but Nina Dobrev portrays her perfectly. As for Paul Wesley (Stefan) and Ian Somerhalder (Damon), they just deliver their roles! Overall I would say that this is an entertaining show!"
520,"I haven't made any reviews yet, but I feel like this series needs to be heard about. Excuse any grammar mistakes, and beware because there may be some spoilers.The show did, like other people say start out slow. The actors didn't know how they should play, and the script was bland. However, after a couple of episodes, the show really started to pick up the pace and immediately caught my attention. After watching the first 3 seasons, my feelings were so confused. (Small spoilers ahead!) The relationship between Stefan and Elena was amazing and was really well acted. I loved watching them be in love. However, I hated Damon and how he acts as a human (in the show, of course). This continued for 2 seasons. Then, my feelings got thrown in a loop and I started to hate Stefan and love Damon. When you do decide to watch the show (which you really should) you will know what I'm talking about.I recommend not googling too much about the actors because there are a lot of spoilers which can ruin the experience for you. One small point is that (spoilers ahead) the misery never seems to end. In the first season, everything was calm. Everything after season 1 is just mayhem and people running from each other while ripping hearts out. It does get quite chaotic.I really recommend watching this show, even if you're not a big fan of other vampire movies/series. Hell, even if you're addicted to crime series or action series, this show will amaze you."
521,"This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, ""It cannot get any better"", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."
522,"Honestly can say that this is a to show I have watched from the beginning and have not found boring or repetitive .Each season comes with a fast paced story of love , death happiness and a twist . I would highly recommend this to everyone as my auntie (32) my granny (60) my brother (8) and I (16) watch it together weekly . The content is mature enough to be enjoyed by adults but not explicit . It truly is an amazing show and the actors are great and sell their characters brilliantly . I loved the books and the to show is just as incredible hope it goes on for many more amazing seasons. Absolutely love this show 10/10 rating from me"
523,"The beginning of it's kind, with a plot quite similar to The Twilight Saga. It involves the story of a teenage girl stuck and caught in love between two vampire brothers. slowly with turns and twists, now the teenage girl Elena has grown up and is in a relationship with someone else than the two brothers, much unlikely to what it started with. I have no idea what will happen in the future. But one thing for surity is that, is spite of it's weak script and loose plot holes, you will still like to watch the series for Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder. Ian as the role of Damon, the evil turned good vampire and lover, delivers a passionate feeling, which is enough to sweep girls off feet. Nina as Elena as well as the sexy catherine, is superb in both of her shoes. Paul Wesley is moderate. Watch it for sexy vampire chicks and time pass."
524,"This series killed me! Im hooked however the first 2-3 episodes of season1. To see this evolve from being a cheesy s1 to an amazing have to watch every week s6. I cant wait to see how Damon and Bonnie (Ian Somerhalder and Kat Graham) escape and I'm totally obsessed with the story line, yes the books may have been horrible but you honestly cant expect the books to be a replica/similar to the TV series, i cant wait to see whats gonna happen and am finding it very hard to stay seated and wait for each episode!! Nina Dobrev has been an inspiration from s1s1, she is my inspiration and role model! I cant wait for whats going to happen at the end and am very excited to see s6's season finale!! Amazing TV Show overall!!"
525,"This actually doesn't have to do with the current season but I have been catching up on previous seasons and I was wondering...when the gang went to the island to get the cure from Silas...Katherine killed Jeremy, right? Well Jeremy was a hunter, so why wasn't Katherine haunted by the hunters curse the same way Elena was haunted by it when she killed Connor?Can anyone provide insight I to this? Unless I missed something which means I'll have to watch the season over again. Lol10 lines to post a review? What I had to say wasn't ten lines worth."
526,"Throughout all 6 seasons there is an ever changing storyline and plot which draws you as a viewer to continue watching the show as it continues over the years. I personally extremely enjoy watching The Vampire Diaries and find myself uncontrollably emotionally attached to the characters. The series is full of emotion and I often find myself crying along with the characters. I wouldn't fault this show at all. It has all the qualities of a hit show, which it is; there is romance; fear and horror; and the effect of friendship that you can relate to in a strange way. The show is never predictable which I love. I find that if I can tell or think I know what will happen next I won't continue to watch it every week. It is also a great programme as it appeals to both genders of different ages; I watch the show with my 40-something parents and 20 year old sister and we all love it; my dad isn't such a fan of the romantic storyline between the Salvatore brothers and Elena but he enjoys the action and adventure side of it. Which to me makes it a basically perfect show."
527,"i loved it nothing else.The vampire diaries is one of ma best serials i cant wait for months or days even for a minute its amazing. charters r so dam good specially Ian Somerhalder and Joseph Morgan my best In the vampire diaries i want more horror its not that much scary. Its an a superb serial till date and all the vampire diaries fan may agree with me.I'm not an expert at critiquing the direction or editing but I like what I see, the effects are simple yet very natural and believable. It might start off as a love story since every synopsis available says so but its way more than that. I honestly can say that this is one of the best series I've ever seen. Every week I'm waiting to watch a new episode which I do not have often with other series. Although it's fiction due to the normal and common environment I feel like it's almost every day life"
528,"y samanthahudson589583, 19 hours ago so everything was going brilliant, this was by far one of my favourite series to watch. i was watching episodes everyday and became slightly addicted, i couldn't help myself but look up a few spoilers to find that elena falls for damon and ends things with stefan? due to this, i can literally no longer watch tvd, im so disappointed and annoyed at whoever decided that would be a great plot twist, as i loved stefan and elena, they were tvd! i also later discovered bonnie and jeremy die? i was getting so attached to the characters and their relationships, such a good story build up and i don't want to ruin it by watching on, it isn't possible. words cant describe how disappointed i am, really. im rating a 1, because its heartbreaking that elena falls for damon and leaves stefan then all the good guys die."
529,"I've seen a lot of films, but his one's different in such a way that, every event or happening has something to do with either its history or future, i mean, everything is relevant, unlike other films that they twist anything just to prolong it but seems unsubstantial. this one's worth spending 43 minutes every episode...... What also makes it unique is the fact that, whenever something undesirable happens, the team(production) does it to the point that you yourself who is watching would realize immediately that there's no better choice left to do so it has to happen.. it's like they leave it with no choice, which is very effective in making the viewers anticipate more and look forward for the following episodes...if there's one thing bad i could comment about, i think it would be about the casting.... like, i think it could have been better if they've chosen someone like Chace Crowford or Matt Bomer or Milo Ventimiglia or Aidan Turner for the roles of Stefan Salvatore."
530,"Yes, just like you, i've seen countless movies and TV shows where every single actor in it is overly beautiful, and i am not really fond of that, Since this movie's main actors are two male brothers, it shouldn't come as surprise that the majority of the fan base would be females. Cause of that many viewers don't even bother or watch enough to appreciate it's beauty. The actors are actually very good, each on it's own building compelling characters throughout the show. The story becomes a bit repetitive but as you go through the seasons new characters join the show that keeps you interested. It's mixture of love and horror driven by blood."
531,"After having watched four seasons of Vampire Diaries; being a part of the extended audience across countries; witnessing suspense, thrill, mystery, fantasy, paranormal, and cliffhanger endings at its best, I was a bit skeptical about watching the fifth season. The biggest part of the reason- the absence of the original vampire family from the show. I couldn't imagine how a plot can be any better than or at least as good as the third and the fourth installment, without the presence of Klaus. And when I finally started watching it, nothing could stop me. I had little to regret. We had known about vampires, werewolves, witches, vampire hunters, the originals, hybrids, doppelgangers, and spirits. The fifth season added new terms to our paranormal dictionary once again. Anchors (to the other side), and the Travelers, Augustine rabid vampires and more doppelgangers. I liked the story, the different subplots, especially that involving the new character Enzo. Not much to criticize, but I felt a similarity between the concept of 'Travelers' and 'The Host'- novel by Stephenie Meyers. And the number of deaths in the season made it a lot depressing. So many deaths at a time! Didn't like that part."
532,"This show is the best show I have ever seen. I am not being sarcastic here.Extremely well written story, the audience will be holding their breaths to find out whether Elena will end up with Stefan, or if it will be with Damon.This show is very open minded, unlike other crappy TV-shows that would depict vampires as evil. Vampires are people too, folks! That is something which the residents of Mystic Fall makes very clear. The tolerance from Elena and her gang of friends warms my heart. Most people would think ""these vampires have killed dozens of people, maybe we shouldn't befriend them"".One thing I like is the main character, Elena, who is very kind and brave. The best part of her is that she is very forgiving. In season five, Damon does something evil to Elena's friend, but Elena forgives him, because she is a good person.The story is very fast paced, it doesn't drag on like other shows (Lost is a good example) does. New things happen all the time. Another bonus is the fact that you never really have to worry about characters, as when they die, they are often brought back to life somehow. Klaus being a good example. Imagine my relief when I thought my favorite character was gone forever, but then they resurrected him! So basically, what I'm trying to say, this show is the opposite of a waste of time. You will come out educated about vampires, you will learn from the kindness of these individuals, and you will become a better person after watching this show."
533,"I just watched the series 2 weeks ago and now i can't keep my mind out of it. I basically watch all episodes 'til the latest one in less than 1 or 2 weeks. 5 seasons and still can't get enough of it. It says so much about how good is this series because i am kind of easy to get bored. This show is completely brilliant. I finally get what the fuss is all about. There are so many things going on at once but not too many so it make us confused. Just right to keep us stay seated and wondering, waiting for what will happen next. While there are a lot of romance- supranatural kind of movie right now but this is in its own league. Not just some lame love story (Twilight i am talking about you), it's actually have depth. Very recommended. Worth the time."
534,"You know when you just love a programme well I just love this!!!!!!!!!!!!! The main characters are hot!!! Iv never been in so much with a programme since lost! ( also another great programme) it's fun, and sexy an great story lines. After seeing 1 episode you will have to watch another as the programme leaves you with cliff hangers an you won't be able to help your self watching another. Give it a go u will not b disappointed.please watch we gotta keep this brilliant show going. It's better then twilight. Then men an women are sexy, hot.. The show just keeps getting better an better. There is also a spin off called the originals what is also just brilliant give them all a go. Xxxxxxx"
535,"Starting off with this show, I was 4 seasons behind and it was hard to catch up but from how good the show was, I was able to watch about 8 episodes per day. I was badly hooked on the show and I still am! This show is not just another vampire love story or twilight this is more than that, this show contains of werewolves, doppelgänger and witches. It's not just about Elena being torn apart between Damon and Stephen, a lot of stuff happens that leaves you pulling your hair at the end. There's a bit of comedy in it along with of course, drama and some may say horror. You get attracted to the characters really fast, I got attached to A LOT of characters. It's brilliant. If you love drama action and love all mixed together then go for it, I didn't lose my interest in the show until midway season 5 but then I caught up and regret even doubting the season. Also, if you watch the vampire diaries go for the originals too, it's amazing."
536,"I hadn't started this series until last year. So many of my friends were talking about it, I felt I had to check it out myself. Once I did I was hooked! I couldn't stop watching it and still can't. This show has great use of love, mystery, drama, the supernatural, and most importantly, creativity! There are so many twists and turns you never know what may happen. There are great relationships, life lessons and values, great morals, and so much more. I'm excited for each and every episode. If you haven't already watched this show I advise that you do. Not to mention many many good looking people fill this show. TVD takes a great pull at your heart and emotions. I really hope this show is on the air for a very long time... I am never disappointed. It is great for teen, young adult, and mature adult viewers. If you get woozy at the site of blood... be prepared because this show DOES have vampires!"
537,"The Vampire Diaries,When I first found it on IMDb they were halfway through season one. I immediately started watching it from the beginning and got sucked in right away. The Vampire Diaries is an amazing story about the supernatural that is in one word amazing. It's a story about love, betrayal and hate. With a touch of thrill and sometimes even horror this makes it perfectly balanced. If you start watching this and you like stories about vampires and werewolves, be prepared to be amazed.Greetings,Stefan"
538,"The show starts of a lot like Twilight, but after the first few series it gets a hole lot better! I really love the character of Damon and Kathrine, they are macing in a way, but in my opinion, that's why they wont be able to be together. Klaus is quite a tyrant, but doesn't do bad things unless he needs it to or it's a cause of revenge. He should return to TVD, were he promised Caroline that he will be her last love, he's done horrible things Caroline wont be able to forgive him for a long item in my opinion, but if this does happen, with her and Elijah trying to see the good on Klaus will do wonders in my opinion. Bonnie is a strong person and not the type to get threaten easily. At last Elaine is the person which shows most compaction and care for her loved ones, the number of times she tried to throw her life away for some one else is countless. To sum it off, all of the plans mostly fail because of someones humanity getting in the way, mostly Elaine's or Stefan's."
539,I can't believe it has taken me 4 years to sit down and watch this show. I have watched the first 4 series religiously every night for the past three weeks and I can safely say that I am hooked. I can not wait for season 5 to come on to Netflix. I may have to watch seasons 1-4 all over again. The fact of how they portrait the relationship between Damon and Stefan how it constantly changes between love and hate. I love the way that they portrait all of these supernatural people and how they all seem to come back to one person. Please hurry up and bring season 5 to Netflix. I can't wait to see what happens to Stefan being a doppelganger. And eager to find out what happens with Damon and Elainer.
540,"This show is the best show I have ever watched. It is so different to every other vampire show/movie I've seen. It is always compared to Twilight and True Blood, but really all they have in common is vampires. Every show has a love story, this one happens to be fantastic. Elena originally falls in love with Stefan, but has a strange strong attraction to his brother, Damon. Her love towards both brothers grows stronger until eventually in season 4 after much complications in her life, she chooses to be with Damon (who I much prefer.) This story is so unlike others I've seen, she is part of a love triangle, but it is just so different. My favourite TV show in the world."
541,"I love this show. Its characters, story and the actors- just amazing. Before I started watching The Vampire Diaries, I had watched the first part of the Twilight movie, I liked the movie but after watching this TV show, the movie seemed nothing. If you love fantasy and Romantic genre shows, its perfect. True Blood, Twilight and The Vampire Diaries; they all have different concepts about vampires, and I don't know why but I liked this one the best. The only thing I don't like about the show is that there aren't any humans left in Mystic Falls, either the people of the town turn into a Vampire or end up Dead. It never gets boring though."
542,"Flicking through the reviews, I can see clearly that there is a wide range of opinions on this show. For starters - guys, get out. Don't even bother: every male viewer of this show that I personally know, hates it, and judging by the lowest scoring reviews, so did most of the rest of the male population. Ladies... it's a different story. Typically this show is made for teens, and I'm sure that's where the majority of viewers are placed, so adults I think have less chance of enjoying it. But, nevertheless, it's got me helplessly hooked. There are so many elements to this show that are what make it great - I don't know where to begin! I'll admit - and I'm sure most others will agree - it came off to a shaky start; so if patience isn't really your thing, then there's no doubt you'll think very little of it. The key advise I'd give to someone considering watching this show is - give it a chance. The first four episodes are very clichéd, predictable, and the same old vampire story you've heard time and time again. After that, it starts to get interesting - the plot thickens, and you kind of want to know what happens next. All of a sudden, the pace picks up; there are many twists in the plot, and characters will do and say very unexpected things, that will have you gasping in your seat - (if you're anything like me!) The show twists and turns - you don't know who you should trust, and who you shouldn't, so it keeps you guessing, and moves at neck-breaking speed in many episodes, and often there are major plot developments you'd never expect. Of course, the standard fluctuates - some episodes are better than others, even after the first four or so; but really from there it's just a matter of personal opinion and taste as far as I'm concerned.The one thing that has been recognised as this show's ""stamp"", is its unwavering boldness to kill characters off without the least bit of warning. Oh yes! That's the other thing - the characters. None of the characters are completely unlike-able, and even if you're convinced you hate one of them, there'll be something that gives you even the tiniest bit of sympathy for them. Each and every one of these characters is well thought-out, and totally three dimensional, and not to forget, all brilliantly well acted. You really feel like you know them, and laugh and cry (well, almost) along with them. Each of the series come to fantastic ends, with finales that are just... fantastic! This show keeps on getting better and better, and, although it's most certainly not for everyone - (like I said, some will loathe it!), it has the unfailing ability to keep viewers who do like it guessing, gasping, and desperate for more. A true ""Marmite"" show.One last and final thing I have to comment on: the violence; the blood; the gore. Please, do realise that this show is not for little young girls - it has guts. It's not afraid to live up to its title - 'Vampire', and show us all *exactly* what they're all about. So be warned."
543,"I admit it, I was hesitant to watch this show. Many objections came to mind: It's a CW show, it's too much like Twilight, it's just plain stupid. Well, I'm not saying it's not stupid (this is a teen show, after all), but this is a massive improvement over Twilight, while being considerably more tame than True Blood. I'm genuinely interested in most of the characters, there are actual plot lines (Twilight, take note), and I admit that the love triangle is quite... intriguing. Damon all the way! A lot of parents might shy away from this show because it's from the same channel that brought us Gossip Girl. But CW portrays this show as a lot more steamy than it actually is. Yes, teens sleep with each other frequently, but I've never seen any nudity, just immorality. Still, conservative parents should probably find a different show. All in all, this is a fun show. Romance, humor, and a little bit of violence all rolled into one."
544,"This is my favorite show ever. I am a fan of all these TV Series starting from Adventure time, to Gossip Girl, to Pretty Little Liars, to Modern Family. But TVD is really awesome. Every ending of every episode makes you look forward to the next episode. I can't sleep almost every night after the Season 1 Finale. It is the best finale ever. It goes deeper and deeper every episode and every season. The ending of every episode will make you excited but when the next episode started, it will go back to normal, until it is the episode ending again. Perfect characters of all the shows I've watched. Perfect location and perfect storyline. It has twist every episode. It is the best!"
545,"This was by far the best vampire movie I've ever seen! All of the characters were very strong and you always knew what was going on. It was a very fast moving series, so every episode contains new information. Once you start watching you can't stop. Even though in the back of you're head you know vampires aren't real it makes you forget about that so it seems so real. And the sets really fit the scenes that are occurring. I'm not saying that Twilight is bad or anything but the Vampire Diaries is so much better. I heard that the new season comes out in October I'm so exited! You always understand the plot. The audiences that watch this should be old enough to handle the violence."
546,"This one was (and still is) truly nice surprise! Books are quite boring and I had no expectation for the show. Fortunately books have nothing to do with this (names are probably only common thing.) First episode was kind of slow, but after few more story starts kicking in. Odd, but plot and dialogs are quite believable, there is some kind of chemistry between main characters and I really enjoy the way new characters are introduced (no big story, no fuss, no big explanations, easily accepted and slowly put in context).After a while I couldn't stop watching and now I can hardly wait for a next episode."
547,"One of the best TV shows ever. At first i thought it would be another GOOD VAMPIRE sort of stuff like Twilight. But after watching two episodes of The Vampire Diaries my notion changed completely and i fell in love with the show. The show centers round the love triangle of Elena(human,Nina Dobrev), Stefan(vampire, Paul Wesley) and Damon(vampire, Ian Somerhalder). Though it not all about the love triangle( there is fights between werewolves, original vampires, witches, hybrids and much more), the show is must watch for all even for Vampire movie haters. The show is full of twists and suspense. Three seasons of the show has been released till date. New characters keep popping up but it does not disturb the sequence of the show. Rebbeca( original vampire), Alarick(Human, teacher), Bonnie(witch), Caroline(human turned Vampire), Catherine(Selfish Vampire), etc are names worth mentioning. In short i have become a huge fan of the show and bet you would be the same after watching."
548,"I started watching this show over a year ago and stopped after the first couple of episodes. Amongst True Blood, Twilight, and all the other vampire stuff I couldn't be bothered. Six months later my sister was talking about this amazing show called the Vampire Diaries and she persuaded me to give it another try so...I watched it again and I persevered through the first few episodes where it was slow going, and the characters annoyed me as well as the acting. But it gets better the longer you watch it. The first season ended really well, and the second season proved that it's developed into a fantastic show. While True Blood has gone downhill since the third season Vampire Diaries is progressively getting better. I'm on the edge of my seat with each episode and I can't wait to watch the next one. The acting isn't wonderful, but most of these actors are new and everyone starts somewhere. They can only get better. This is the best vampire show since I've watched Buffy - and Buffy's my favourite show ever."
549,"Here's why TVD works : 1. The acting, no one can be a better Cathrine/Elena than Nina Dobrev. Nobody can touch Ian S and Paul W they are the ultimate Vampire brothers. (The Very hot type, too!) These three are the main reason why TVD works.2. The story, It is so interesting. It is about love, but it is about treasuring life too. It's about sticking to life, it has a lot of surprises, humor, thriller, drama and excitement.3. It is Addicting, Simple as that! You wanna know what happens next.4. The Characters are just believable, the way they handle this supernatural happenings around them. I love every single one of the characters.and there are so much more... It just simply has a good but at the same time strange feeling to it, that you have never expirienced.I'll give you my word this won't disappoint you, Just Watch and you'll understand.10/10 definitely!"
