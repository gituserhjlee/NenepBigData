0,"Will I was surprised I didn't expect that I can watch a foreign tv show and make me feel amazed with how excellent everything was first from acting - cinematography - score .
maybe their is poor CGI used in the third episode but It is not a big issue for me.
Personally my favorite episode is the last episode.
I am waiting season 2 ."
1,"Good solid start of a new promising new horror/mystery show.The story reminds me of classic adventure stories like Indiana Jones and gives constant suspension and couriosity. You want to know what happens next and what the mystery is about. It does not invent something completly new, but delievers an exciting premise.The main protagonist is the heart of the show and carries the main attention of the spectator. In comparison the other side characters are boring and lack of an impact and can't compete with the actor of Refaat Ismail.Where The Haunting of Bly Manor fails and tries to copies his own formula, this show creates a satisfying setting."
2,"I started watching the anticipated series ""paranormal"" today and actually it is not only another horror/drama series produced by netflix, but it is a very well done adaptation for the great egyptian author ""ahmed khaled tawfik"" paranormal stories, the acting was nice, the music was better than expected, the cinematography was interesting to watch, overall it was an enjoyable ride and i am surely waiting for season 2"
3,"When i decided to watch this series i did not know what i'm gonna see,but from the first episode i found myself into it and that's for multiple reasons:
-the decors and the setting of thoses periods of times in the arabian countries they really did a great job there.
-also,the egyptian and libyan arabic they have done it perfectly it doesn't feel like they translated it from english to arabic.
-Samma Ibrahim ''Raeefa Ismail'' all i can say about him is that he's done a remarkble effort in playing his character..as well as the othere characters except some of the kids they didn't convince me with there acting..
even though the series still has cons like
-a lot of questions are not answered
-the CGI they used was so bad..i mean really bad,and they tried to hide it with the darkness in the scene and the camera movment but they didn't succeed in that one,plus,a lot of events rely on CGI.
also,the relationship between Raeefa and megie was so cold and cringy and other things that i don't wanna say for the sake of not spoiling any thing.
still this does not diminish the value of ''Paranormal''.
if you love horror, mysteries and suspense like me..you'll definitely love this series."
4,"Gorilla at the desert it doesn't make sense at all ! The story is great and the cinematography also,but the graphics are terrible like it's done by a 5 yo kid ,and of course I won't forget the legend Ahmed Amen for his audition such a great and brilliant actor."
5,It's a great start .. the music is awesome .. the cast and everything are amazing .. i am going to end all the episodes now
6,Amr Salama the director did a great job by turning the novels into this great show this the best Arabic show i have ever seen
7,"I'm a fan of the novels series, I read the 81 stories since I was 17.. When I heard about this project I went back and read the whole collection again.
Now this show stands alone as a very special first Egyptian production from Netflix, I loved the general atmosphere, the looks of the characters, the suspense inside every moment, the coloring.. Loved it all
The only thing that disappointed me that they had to deform my early imagination about the storyline itself, I had that bad expression all over my face 😅 every time thay tend to change the way I remember some details.. Daram stuff I know but I didn't like it.
I hoped they could find another way to give us the whole thing without messing with tge details.
Regarding this I'm proud of the series and I hope they go on making a lot more seasons very soon."
8,I didn't expect that.This show will be one of my favourite. I highly recommend it to everyone doesn't matter what age you are. Everyone will find something interesting in it. GOOD JOB KEEP IT UP
9,"Usually I don't watch Horror category movies, but I liked this one for sure.
The series is so neat, 6 ep. without boring scenes and unnecessary clips. The main actor Ahmad Amin rocked the role he played, he deserves an oscar for it!There was a scene should be fixed and it bothered me because of the vfx effects, but it doesn't matter between the awesomeness of the series"
10,Very good and waiting second shafter. we need a second very soon
11,I expect better than what i saw This is the first time that i see King Kong in the desert eating and protecting cave Its really bad
12,"Episode 1-3 are very bad. Episodes 5-6 are very good. Terrible graphics, good acting, Ok story in general."
13,"As a HUGE fan of the late Dr. Ahmed Khaled books and specially the Supernatural series, I have to say when I heard that this show is coming up it was like a dream to me!That being said, I was highly disappointed after a watching the first episodes of the series, It was so bad!I don't know why but the script was very bad written, nothing came from the original books. I know it shouldn't be a copy-paste version of the books but at least keep the original storyline!The acting was average, CGI was below average and the characters wasn't that interesting.I couldn't find any positive thing about this show. Having a really high expectations from it, it was a huge Failure!"
14,I love it so much...i highly recommended it to all horror story lovers
15,This series is a big step for the Egyptian drama and a great door to enter the world of Egyptian drama and experience some day to day Egyptian habits form the ordinary boring stuff to the mystics and the legends of this culture
16,"I gave it a chance after reading the reviews here, while I watched it all, I really fail to see what exactly is special about this series.. yes it had a bunch of interesting ideas all crammed into a 6 episode mini series but they are not even well executed, the acting was good (you can see the actors really tried).. I get it these reviews are probably because it's a foreign series and small budget compared to other big titles.. but overrating it will never change the fact that it is mediocre at best..I'd still watch a second season though."
17,"Actually iam glad that we could do a series based on a great novel such as this one, But Iam so confused of these people who rate this series 10, is it 10 because it just an egyptian good series?!, or it is 10 because it deserves 10, I didn't rate breaking bad, GOT, Chernobyl, prison break, the walking dead, and shameless 10 to give this series 10, WTH Is going on here?!"
18,"Started exceptionally, becomes absurd and boring midways. The cinematography is great, yet unrealistic at times, even pitch black scenarios, are illuminated so brightly that you wonder why they carry the lanterns.
But the major probelm is Dr Reefat's character and how the plot becomes absurd at times"
19,"I loved the series, but it ruined the novel completely, it makes dr. refat as a psychopath not like in the original story, also it keeps involve Maggie as a main character which i didn't like, hope they stucked with the original story and change a little bit not so much, they completely wash Dr. Ahmad's spirit from the story"
20,"I expect better than what i saw
This is the first time that i see King Kong in the desert eating and protecting cave
Its really bad"
21,"I give it 6/10, its not a horror serie , not one sense, but the story line was good, could be better. Should people stop overrating this show, because it worth 5 or 6 not 9 or 10."
22,"I was skeptical right from the start, wondering how they'd pull off making series off 80+ novels, with complex details and graphics, and hundreds of characters and locations worldwide, but I thought maybe because it's Netflix production it might work, and the director seemed too confident, assuring that he and the lead actor Ahmed Amin are avid readers of the novels and friends of the late author, and that the novels were in good hands, too confident in fact that he went as far as giving people a list of ""recommendations"" on how to watch the series the night before it was aired, encouraging people to focus on its details; however, the series came out nothing like the books, and I feel that the director exploited the name of both the saga and the author for personal propaganda.. It is just so bad! Excellent plots have been reduced to silly and childish fairy tales, like two heartbroken mummies that caused some epidemic of which the only cure is a rare flower in a cave guarded by a nursing gorilla!!
Important characters have been ommited or badly distorted, like the silly egyptologist with the rattle or Lucifer the main antagonist. Even the main characters are portrayed nothing like the books. Ahmed Amin who claimed to have studied the character of the main protagonist ""Dr. Refaat Ismail"" so well managed to portray him as dim witted, dull, depressing, and downright boring, lacking his witty sharp sense of humor that would make you laugh out loud even amidst the most intense situations. ""Maggie"", who the series makers ignored the fact that she's described in the books as an angelic blonde physicist, was portrayed as clingy physician redhead with a weird accent and a broken arabic dialogue, insisting to follow Refaat everywhere when she didn't have much role in the books, so the two of them together ended up looking like some comic book hero and heroin braving dangers together! That and the unnecessarily increased focus on the love triangle between him, her and Howaida, which is not of much concern in the books, as if viewers are too petty they need to see this action/love screen mix.Ignoring the messed up storyline, the various plot holes, and the characters' manipulation, the acting is very bland and most characters are very flat, and most of them only said two lines or so.. The dialogue is slow and boring, and the different languages and accents in the arabic version is annoying. There is zero suspense, I felt downright bored from episode one. The character's reactions are mostly cold, like in that scene where Howaida sees Najat being slammed into a wall by a supernatural power in the myth of the naiad, and her reaction was just raising her hands to her face and ""waking"" her up, while Reda calmly overlooked! Maybe the best acting was Raeefa, and the child who played Taha is sweet. The child actor who played Shiraz is super annoying, I hated seeing her on screen.. Her acting gives no vibe of fear or suspense or even innocence.. The costumes are so so, some of them being very basic, like the Touareg tribe who are wearing the same clothes they use for any bedouin in the desert in any movie, not their famous blue garb and face covering. The special effects and graphics are mediocre and silly, basically halloween costumes, and who the hell carries a skeleton as a whole?!I liked the cinematography, and some frames were great, and the set design/decor is beautiful. The music is nice too even though it sounds familiar. If I was to ignore the deformed storyline I would rate this as a 6 at best, but since I normally focus on the story when watching movies/series, and because I felt cheated that after more than a year of promises of the generation's favorite saga coming to life it ended up being like this, I rate it a 3. Shame! because this had the potential of being a REAL huge success.Edit: After watching this ""attempt"" at egyptian horror/thrillers, the only outcome I hope for is the book series getting translated to English, maybe then a hollywood director or producer would realize how great it is and decide to make it with a proper budget, actors and graphics.. Only then we will see something exceptional."
23,For the first time l believe there is a single egyption series can reach to world level
24,""" I will never stop loving you Maggie , until the stars fall from the sky , until the world ends , until planets collide and suns wither , until the moon is extinguished and all the seas and rivers dry up , until i become senile and my memory is eroded , until my tongue is no longer capable of uttering your name , until my heart beats for the last time , only then , i might stop ... i might stop loving you """
25,"Although the series did not strictly follow the original plots as in the novels, it is still cohesive and enjoyable. The cast is great, audio is very good. My only remark is about the visual effects which are quiet modest especially with the mummies and the custodian."
26,"Please Egyptian friends, don't give a show 10 stars just because it's from Egypt."
27,"No horror, just suspense. Give a fair rating and it will be less then 7. Basic script, no surprises."
28,"If it wasn't Egyptian, I would've rated it 6. The extra star for being the first Egyptian Netflix series. Anyway, I hope Egyptians don't over-rate it with full 10 stars rating without being objective.Most episodes are entertaining, the series is excellent compared to what we used to see from Egyptian productions. Protagonist role was exceptional (although it's not what you expect from reading the novels), however other characters are poorly developed and the graphics are very poor in some scenes. No doubt that it passes as a good above-average thriller, but let's be honest, what makes this series to stand out are the quotes ""specially sarcastic funny quotes in dark moments"" excerpted from Dr. Tawfik.Don't compare it to the novels, the novels were much more engaging. This doesn't belittle the hard work done for this work, but it reflects how great and awesome Dr. A.K Tawfik was. May his soul R.I.P."
29,"If you are looking for a scary series, you'll be disappointed. It's watchable, and since you know it is from a novel, you can excuse some bad plots.It would have been much better with a real Hollywood budget (especially for FX) and a better wig for Maggie.Also the main actor should take some classes. The guy has the same face, same emotion, same things in all episodes..."
30,"It gets interesting from time to time, most of the time it's just silly. Lots of nonsensical plot events, bad cgi, and none of the characters are engaging. The rom-com aspect is pretty endearing, and you can expect some thrill of horror from this series, but only if you find 'Goosebumps' scary."
31,"As a conclusion and as the first time to Amr Salama to work with Netflix...
1- Bad acting from all actors
2- He failed to make the story dramatic and mysterious."
32,Its really sad how they wanna submit fake ratings to this very bad series and childish directing.. A really waste of time and media talks over a 1/10 teenagers series !
33,Thanks for everything and thanks for ahmed amin he's A Great Actor.
34,"Seriously the monster is a gorilla, skip the horrible CGI but seriously a gorilla in the desert?"
35,One of the worst things I've ever seen ! Couldn't even finish the third episode .
36,Its really sad how they wanna submit fake ratings to this very bad series and childish directing.. A really waste of time and media talks over a 1/10
37,"Not that what i was expected ,
The graphics was so poor"
38,"I'm baffled at the people who are saying this is a masterpiece, the best ever, Oscar-worthy, etc. The only thing I can think of is that they must have only watched horrible shows in their entire life. I really wanted to love this as my family is Egyptian and we lived in Cairo, but it's just a mediocre horror series. Not suspenseful or scary. The creatures and such are very cheap looking. When they were searching the temple for the queen's grave, and the claw came around the corner and scratched the wall, I rolled my eyes. It was SO cliche and not a realistic claw. The main character seems depressed and in complete denial to the point of illogic. Yet suddenly he believes and can solve the mystery in a matter of seconds? I thought from the book description that he was supposed to be brilliant and a lot more charasmatic, but he seriously mopes around everywhere. It's okay, I'll probably watch the whole thing eventually because it's short, but I'm not excited about it.I rarely leave reviews, but after reading all these 10/10 reviews I felt I had to say, lower your expectations if you're used to good horror."
39,"Childish writing and transformation by Amr Salama he really failed to write the first episode and instructing the rest. For the series, really bad VFX creations taking into consideration its a netflix production. Great cinematography and Acting by Ahmed Amin.. A really overstated rating and should be out of the top 200 soon.."
40,"If you are looking for a scary series, you'll be disappointed. It's watchable, and since you know it is from a novel, you can excuse some bad plots.It would have been much better with a real Hollywood budget (especially for FX) and a better wig for Maggie.Also the main actor should take some classes. The guy has the same face, same emotion, same things in all episodes..."
41,"Egyptian please stop overrating
It's just another mid-core show, and Egyptians are overrating the show. It deseves 10/10 if we compare it to other Egyptian tv series. But generally, it deserves 6/10. I understand Egyptians are getting excited about the show and want to support it. But by overrating, they are misleading the rest."
42,"If this was not an Arabic series I would have rated it 4/10. It's great to see Arabic cinema delving into other genres and telling stories from another perspective. So I added an extra star as a show of support.I'm really shocked at the high ratings because this show is poor. The writing is terrible, the CGI is terrible and some of the acting is terrible. It's a really big missed opportunity because some of the actors are so good and the production value and cinematography are beautiful. I also enjoyed the music (even if it was a little cliche ""epic adventure"" score).I don't know what happened here. The writers just took this into really bad directions (mummy's curse and cave guard). They've tried to make it an anthology series which is fine but it doesn't link at all to the main storyline. End of every episode feels like a finale when it shouldn't!If you don't have the budget for good CGI then don't do it! They could easily have hidden the cave monster (like Cloverfield for eg) and left it to our imaginations (infinitely more scary). Cheap jump scares, cringe-worthy acting (sorry Shiraz, cute kid but wasn't scary).What kills it the most is Maggie. Why oh why did they give her such a horrible wig?! Please it's 2020 I'm sure you could have found a better one! It just really took me out of it and then her Arabic is awful. I don't like criticising stuff like this because my Arabic is poor but if you can't speak it well then keep the dialogue in English! Lines here and there can be in Arabic but majority should have been in English. I don't why they didn't think it was an issue.Other than the above the production value is great, Dr Refaat's acting was very good (he did what he could with the matieral), Raeefa is the best actress I think and Howeida was adorable. I loved the sets, art direction, Egypt in the 60s, atmosphere. I think everyone tried hard and gave it a really good shot, I dont want to be negative. I think overall it's a great effort.I really really wanted to like it as a big horror fan but I don't know if I can finish the series. It's painful. Hopefully the next project will be better (please find better writers)."
43,Expected much more. Unrealistic. The director is trying so hard to make something different but he failed.
44,"Egyptians are giving it 9 and 10 out of 10 just because it's an Egyptian series, which is pretty pathetic. I have seen several posts on Facebook that urge people to go rate it 10 even if they don't think it deserves it. Wow!As for my review, I found gorilla scenes in episode 3 too funny. The graphics are very poor. Gorillas don't live in the desert. The dialogue is boring and the +50 minute episodes could have been made in 25-30 minutes. The kids' performance were pretty poor. Overall, it's a failure."
45,"Well I'll try to be honest and objective.. First, it fell below my expectations; I know books are usually better than their screen representation so it's natural that I felt it is not what I expected. Now, if it was meant to be a thriller or an horror series then it deserves 3/10 max. Arguing it is a slow burn? No it is a turtle burn with no actual fire at all. Graphics or CGI is terrible to say the least; 2/10 is sufficient. The lead character is talented but it seems that he is doing what he has been asked to do; his performance takes around 6/10. Secondary and minor characters take 7/10. Setting and general atmosphere is the best thing along with angles and colors; 8/10. I forced myself to see it in two days hoping that it gets better but unfortunately it got only 10% better max. Hopefully there will be a 2nd season that is better but this season is really overrated due to patriotic feelings. I have them too but I wish for a way better series. Sorry to disappoint you but it doesn't worth the watch."
46,I am in episode 3 but i can not see the reason for such a high rating. The story is very boring and long-winded.
47,It is a great Egyptian series it is perfect to watch because Imaging accuracy and the good story
48,"Way too overated , wasted my time , i don't know what are the high rating's about , i can only assume that egyptian' voted hard for it , i cannot think of anything else"
49,Simply waste of time i hate everything about this serie
50,Thought I'd watch an amazing series Many ideas are Copied from supernatural Boring
51,I expect better than what i saw This is the first time that i see King Kong in the desert eating and protecting cave Its really bad
52,Very boring and bad stop watch this please and this so over rating he must 1 star
53,The actors are asleep There's no enthusiasm in the movie 👎👎👎
54,A very lame and disgusting show I am very disappointed with this And I hope you all read the main books because it is way better and completely different
55,"It's a good trial as an Egyptian series, however, I felt each episode similar to a movie I have seen before. No creativity has been made. Also, the Episode for the Gorilla is so cliche, didn't like it at all."
56,"Below expectations
I recommend everyone to read the novels better"
57,"I still can't understand why it has such good reviews, the whole story doesn't make sense, it's confusing, horrible actors, so boring... tried realky hard to finish it but couldn't... please don't waste your time!!"
58,"After watching season one. I found so many lost opportunities. In the original stories, Refaat is a worried man not a sad one. He is lovable and cares about people. Although he keeps saying he wants to be left alone, he runs to help people not caring about the danger. He is sarcastic but not disrespectful. In the show, he is sad miserable old man.They removed a lot of details that shows Maggi as a smart and funny person. She is also pretty. The series shows her character as flat dull woman with an ugly wig.The elements of horror from the stories were effective and scary, but the show probably for financial purposes chose to go for mediocre effects and monsters that do not compare to what the stories had. They could not match what came out of the imagination of the writer Dr. Tawfeek.And the big disappointment was for the myth of incubus. This story happened to another guy and this guy sent his story to Dr. Refaat in a letter. The incubus story end was horrifying. And its environment and the place which it happened is so different from what they show. They chose to make it happen to Dr. Refaat passing the opportunity of making a real good horror episode.Another disappointment is with the Cave guard story in the desert of Libya. This one in the original book will make the ice crawl on your back and will give you nightmares for a long time. But again they chose to make it a gorilla! So laughably bad.The books were smoothly connected and we learnt about the time line from Refaat thoughts and notes before and after he tells us the main story. The show eliminated all that which made the show very shallow compared to the books. And made the episodes disconnected and confusing.The love story between Refaat and Maggi is one of the best. It melts your heart. It is something unique and pure. In the show we don't feel any chemistry or lost love between those. We don't see Maggi as the sensitive yet tough, smart, funny woman that we met through the books.If they stick more to the original books, they can make something much more better and much more scary.3 stars just because they are ownering a great writer and because the show has his name on it."
59,"Being a horror/dark fantasy buff I really wanted to like this, and with review ratings similar to other shows like the Haunting of Hill House, I really thought I would. But I didn't. Acting was average at best, special effects were poor, and the most important aspect, the storyline, was convoluted, lacklustre and just kind-of boring. I didn't make it past two and a half episodes.On the plus side the set design was beautiful along with the cinematography, and the score was decent too - though it sounds like it was inspired by the violin in the much better horror venture 'Drag Me To Hell.'"
60,This is very boring. Don't watch it lol I fell asleep and you might too
61,"The most stupid show ever. I regrit that I have wasted 30 minutes of my life watching this piece of garbage. It is even worst than Bab Al Hara (the most stupid Syrian tv series ever made). If you want to watch Arabic tv series, watch those shows in 90's and early 20's. This show trying to copy SCI-FI Hollywoodd's but in very stupid way. By the way I am Arab, just in case!"
62,Its only bad and sucks and boring and loser and fake dont watch this
63,"Amr Salama never disappoint us, but this one is really special, it's as the name says ""Paranormal""...We don't watch Arabic show with amazing performance like this one everyday, certainly not. Show that contains almost all important factors for success like great soundtrack and visual effects, distinctive photography that highlighted the most important details that the viewer is looking for, and most importantly the dramatic structure. no wonder why it reached world level.All thanks goes to Netflix for always being behind best, most successed, series."
64,"This series is below the average.. Poor graphics
You don't need to Build characters to show us Refaat ismail's world..
What in this series is amr salaam point of view and faaar away from the novel.."
65,"I hope it's as perfect as novels.
Wish we still have Dr.Ahmed among us to witness his masterpiece"
66,"Superficial with nothing new , predictable, poor graphics and very bad"
67,Simply waste of time i hate everything about this series
68,"It's good to see a pleasant Egyptian show but clearly not a 8.8 rating. Far away from the haunting of hill house for example (which is 8.6).
Difficult to see the link between the episodes which have very different plots. The main character seems not to change and still not bielieves in paranormal eaven after all what he has seen during the 3 first episodes, and all his background before this...
Then I stopped at the half of the 4th episode"
69,"Superficial with nothing new , predictable, poor graphics"
70,"Very good series good work Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawney
First Egyptian series on Netflix
👏"
71,"I was proud to watch an Egyptian series on Netflix, however, it was way far from a memorable show. The storyline was horrible and the actors were so fake.
Looks like that they had the money to produce a good show, but they couldn't find good actors and screenwriters.These 4 stars are for the effort they have done especially the main character (Ahmed Amin) he has done a great job and for the great quotes of Ahmed Khaled Tawfik."
72,I expected more than what I saw.. The writing and story line was too weak and poor ideas.. The direction was good and the Acting of lead caracter was great too.. But the story destroyed everything unfortunately.
73,"I gutted it through the whole series because the settings were different and the plot was somewhat interesting. I hoped it would get a grip, take off, and land well.It did none of those things. The worst aspect, unfortunately, is the central character, Dr. Refaat Ismail. There's just nothing to like or care about to him. He is unkind, unfunny, uncaring, unlikable, unsympathetic. He constantly frowns, sags, smokes, coughs. People around him (for no discernible reason) try to help and care for him, and he responds with bitterness, sarcasm, and abuse to all of them. He's wracked with causeless self-pity and anger, and sports a single, unchanging, glum expression. He is never remotely enjoyable to watch.Few of the people around him feel real or relatable, either. They're largely like characters poorly drawn by a talentless cartoonist. Most of them are constantly angry, yelling, mean to each other...except the poor sweet cousin Howaida, and Maggie, neither of whom ever feels like full characters with comprehensible motivation.Sometimes you stick through a mixed series and arrive at an ultimate reward; sometimes you wish you could have all the time back.This is the latter case."
74,Bad bad bad its only bad and dont waste your time to watch this please stop watching this
75,"There are mediocre series, there are overrated series, and then there is this one. I lowered my expectations to see this, but I still got disappointed! No scenario, no cinematography, no lights, or story, or graphics. I only liked the music, which was also loud and distracting.... What is this and how did this get that rating? I don't know, and thisnis probably the only ""paranormal"" thing here."
76,"Lame , bad graphics .. the ring drawings ... overrated"
77,"The Egyptian thinks it is a game try to win by over rating
this is so boring
tempo is so slow and i do not imagine why they did that"
78,"The series is just average maybe less
The CGI is so dump
I still see Ahmed Amin young
I saw most of scenes before in another series or movies
So i wish if there was an epic scene ...
I still see his brother death and figuring his friend is the devil so stupid and dump"
79,"As I said earlier after I watched the second episode: THIS IS NOT PARANORMAL.They should've called it something else, and they shouldn't have mentioned that it is based on or inspired by the book series that is written by Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik ""May Allah have mercy on him"", because it is NOT, It is something entirely different.And I'm not talking about the ugly different narratives of perfect stories or the hideous portrayals of beloved characters, I'm talking about the beliefs of Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik and the essence of his writings.Dr. Refaat Ismail is standing on a chair, tying a rope around his neck, and about to commit suicide?!! REALLY??!!!!
Did the creators of this show even read one novel of the +80 book series?!! Did they even read any of Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik's other book series like Fantasia, Safari, or any novel he wrote?
Dr. Refaat Ismail wouldn't even consider committing suicide, the thought would never even cross his mind!To tell you the truth; when I heard about this project and that they will adapt Metaphysics by Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik into a TV series, I wasn't optimistic; for so many reasons I don't have the time to mention them now, but even then I couldn't imagine what a mess they will be able to turn this show into.The only thing that is fairly acceptable about this show is the portrayal of Dr. Refaat Ismail's character by Ahmed Amin, he did a decent job, at least for the physical appearance, and that is it.If you haven't read the novels you might enjoy this show, if you don't mind the terrible decisions taken by the characters and bad CGI.But if you have read the novels; Please be warned, don't watch this awful mess of a show, and if you must watch it, please push away any thought about the book series out of your mind, because if you didn't, you will be slapping your forehead every 3 minutes, and that will be a preliminary event before you start banging your head against the wall."
80,"The novel is way better than the episodes, the episodes didn't create the same mental image as the novel. Ahmed amin did a great job. Rest of the actors are below average, specially Magy"
81,"The series is mediocre. It doesn't deserve these high ratings, only reason I can imagine must be thousands of proud Egyptians voting."
82,"Terrible acting, hideous story that doesn't make sense and graphics that leave you in awe (because, like, I could have drawn them better!).
I asked myself ""what am I watching?"" at least 10 times during this 6 episode ""horror"" series. I genuinely did not understand what was going on. I continued to watch because I thought I was crazy for not understanding. I doubted myself when I should have doubted the director.This show for me was a haunted house, a pharaohs curse, a gorilla in Libya, dream deciphering, and an Arabic speaking Scottish girl that needed subtitles (even though I'm fluent in English and Arabic). Like I had to rewind something she said about 5 times until I was like OK subtitles on, I will never get it.The story was hard to follow because it was all over the place with little to no meaning or logic.
Textbook horror scenes were in surplus here. Covered mannequins, broken mirrors, candles in dark rooms, rocking wooded chairs, a ghost girl in a white dress..like come on! Seriously?
And then you have a cave with a gorilla and a baby gorilla in a Libyan desert cave. What was that about? And a healing plant growing without sunlight or water in this cave. Of course our main character needed this life saving plant but he had to get passed the gorilla first. I can't even....
I also can't summarise the story, because what was the story? A man who was surrounded by paranormal activities? I guess so. That's it. Then every random thing happened to him, and the links between them were not clear.
Who are these people calling this a ""masterpiece"" or the ""best show on netflix?"" Who are you, really? What is your agenda? This show is a complete disaster. That is FACT. I feel sorry for you if you think this was in any way good.
I made an IMDB account just to write this review because I am in absolute shock at those giving this anything above a 5. WORST SHOW EVER."
83,"One of the worst things I've ever seen !
Couldn't even finish the third episode ."
84,"It's just another mid-core show, and Egyptians are overrating the show. It deseves 10/10 if we compare it to other Egyptian tv series. But generally, it deserves 6/10. I understand Egyptians are getting excited about the show and want to support it. But by overrating, they are misleading the rest."
85,I beg the Egyptians not to rate this s..t with high scores. This looks like the kids were playing filming.
86,Fine acting superb leading actor but overal not so good as thay say
87,Extremely bad CGI and badly written story get this big attention cause it's Arabic series my advice your time is precious don't wast it on this show.
88,It's pretty interesting. I'm just REALLY thrown off by the English dubbing not matching the closed captioning. I'm not hard of hearing but usually I miss a few words so I like to have it on. The dialogue in no way matches the captioning. Throw that in with the fact that in the film the actors are speaking another language and their lips don't match...just confusing.I do like the story line and the characters but so far I'm not seeing the almost 9 rating.
89,"There is nothing special about it, even watching it with low expectations didn't make me happy with it.
The story and plot is way different than the original book."
90,"Not worth 10/10 CGI was bad story is nice but not Served well on my opinion , but waiting the second season hopping the will give the story what it's deserve."
91,"The series doesn't deserve its rating, people who has given it 10/10 probably haven't watched any good shows ever. The story is somewhat predictable and the series isn't that great."
92,"Very very bad graphics, poor story. The only prefect things is the actor Ahmed Ameen, the picture and the soundtrack."
93,"I am in episode 3 but i can not see the reason for such a high rating.
The story is very boring and long-winded."
94,"So sad to see this ruined version of the greatness of the ""Godfather"" Ahmed Khalied Tawfeg ""paranormal""
It's totally different stories not even close to the original ones, bad drama and awful directing, mixing many stories together without any reason, not serving the Maine story and not even convincing,
The graphics was bad, so bad, awful and even miserable 😖
The only good thing was Ahmed Ameen nothing els
This is sad 😞"
95,Its really sad how they wanna submit fake ratings to this very bad series and childish directing.. A really waste of time and media talks over a 1/10 teenagers series !
96,Waste of time and everything i very sad to watch this and this over rating
97,Waste of time its only waste of time and very fake series
98,Waste of time and very fake series dont watch this bad thing
99,"Weak script, weak vfx, and weak directing from Majid Al-Ansary' episodes.
So why it has all this high ratings?! because it's the first Egyptian original Netflix show and nothing else."
100,"Ok i am a big fan of the mini stories by Dr.ahmed kgalid tawfeeq .. and if i were to compare it with the show I'll give it zero.. actually I'll say they ruined the series they disgraced Dr ahmed works
But
For someone who hasn't read the books, I'd say it is ok as a start to an arabic horror show
The cinematography is quite alright even though mostly dark
The acting is unrealistic in many occasions, just seems overwhelming faked
The suspense isn't building enough to maintain a mysterious thriller, you have 45 minutes, use it
Finally, for people who overrate it just because it's Egyptian, well be real"
101,"Paranormal is a show having separate stories and the transition between them is good, show is spectacular beginning of the script ending with the small details .
*U will like the show if u like fiction stories it is not much horror but it's great*
The director amr salama did a great job on bringing the dark theme upon the show .The music selection was perfect .The casting was amazing ."
102,"Thought I'd watch an amazing series
Many ideas are Copied from supernatural
Boring"
103,"This series is only getting high rating because it seems that fellow reviewers just admire that Netflix would do a local series. There's might be good things about the series but it sure not of deserving this high rating, competing with Westworld and GOT."
104,"I wanted to like it. It has adorable children, good scenary, and good camera work. But the story and the scenes don't flow well. Characters appear out of nowhere breaking continuity. Even the background soundtrack doesn't seem to match what is happening on the screen. Then there are the long winded professor narratives. It just has too many technical filmmaker glitches to make it an enjoyable tv series. Perhaps this Egyptian mummy horror tv series just does not translate well for western audiences.Also, for people rating this a perfect 10, I understand the enthusiasm stemming from nationalism and wanted to see your country on the filmmaking map. But over-exaggerating the artistic qualities of this film and saying it is the best arabic tv series of all time, over-and-over, really sets up a very low bar. This series needs better writers and more importantly, a seasoned film director. The way this film was edited together is a disaster.Seriously, call the production company and request better writers and directors next time. Just giving 10s arbitrary because it's the first isn't doing the Egyption film industry any justice, especially if all the 10s are mostly coming from one part of the world. If anything, it draws attention from the rest of the world who will see it for what it is and rate it harshly.Better to be patient, improve, polish and then release quality material to the world. As I said before, the cinematography is good, the sets are good, the children are adorable. But the writing and directing are the foundations of storytelling. If you don't have that right, the rest collapses onto itself."
105,"A very lame and disgusting show
I am very disappointed with this
And I hope you all read the main books because it is way better and completely different"
106,"I have read all the books and I am so much in love with them, unfortunately the TV series is so bad and the greatest failure for such wonderful novel, the actors have 0 feelings while they are acting, it looks like they read the news in a very cold way, the directing is very childish with bad CGI, and not even 1 creative visual scene, the main actor tried his best, but he was the wrong choice for such role, the main character suppose to be old, not young acting old, and you can totally predict everything, there is no surprise, the oy surprise that you are watching a TV series which claim to be horror, but it has no horror at all."
107,"Nothing like the novels and the actors are fake except for Ahmed Amen who tried his best.
Not to mention the very poor direction, bad lights and having to turn the volume up to 100 to be able to understand what they are saying."
108,"A very Good stories with bad writers and very cheap quality of sound design and sound effects a very bad color grading and where is the suspension!!! the shots are not set for a horror series you have to learn from worldwide movies like annabelle ,conjouring and insidious .. etc i feels bored so many times how could this people put these reviews!!!
And my advise to you to look for a good sound designer with a good experience like the ones in MBC2 promotions team it will take this series to a good place"
109,"I grew up Reading the novels and wishes to see it on screen, what a disappointment , terrible acting, refaat is boring and cold, always sad like he lost his mother 5 minutes ago, no attention to details for example the sick boy on 3rd episode was looking perfectly healthy, his father was full dressed and was not panicked at all, the big monkey was a joke. killing 20 men of the tribe but didn't harm the guys who disturbed his baby sleep! And it was protecting this baby for centuries! What a joke of a series"
110,"Paranormal wasn't just a fashionable series of novel, it was a part of the history of at least two generations. Every reader of the series literally lived it, not read itDepicting the protagonist (Refaat Ismail) is absolutely terrible! In the novel he is a cynical, reckless, grumpy, introverted professor, yet very smart, witty, and bright. In the series he's more of a naive, stupid, boring moron, and even that was performed by a terrible actor!Actually, acting overall is terrible to say the least. Even Razan Gamal, who desperately try to sound Scottish, she ends up sounding like a Scottish from Upper Egypt!Story is shallow, and dialogue is uniteresting and superficial. A signle star is shared by cinematography and music, which is decent. But the overall experience and having a childhood legend destroyed this way makes them uselessThumbs down (again) Netflix! 👎👎👎👎"
111,"Can someone tell me why is this a 10? I believe you that probably the main actor is a legend - understood. But the main character is so difficult to relate to, so flat, women characters are also written not pleasant... i mean i cant find it neither scary, nor creepy. Looks like a Russian tv shows they show at noon. Graphics, script...not good to praise like this with 10 or 9, I'm sorry."
112,"I'm surprised how there are so many 10 stars. Stopped watching in the mid of episode 3. It's not scary, tried to make it adventurous but failed miserably."
113,"8.4?? Seriously?? For what?? For the elementary school level acting of all actors?? Or for the dull beyond tolerance dialogue?? Or maybe for the perfectly destructive adaptation of the novel?? Ok I got it, maybe it's the story, the unbuilt, undeveloped, set discrepancies put together and called story!Amr Salama and Ahmed Amin have paid the most blunt, disrespectful insult not only to the late Ahmed Khaled Tawfeeq, the author and creator of (Paranormal) universe, but to literally millions of fans who lived every single scene of the story in their childhood and adulthood! They have disrespected each and everyone of them by portraying that classic in such a ridiculous amateurish work, that would normally kick it's entire team out of any respectful cinema school!The trick is in coloring, and music, which are just ok, not spectacular by any sense! It's the shiny rapper that hides the rotSeriously, I feel like I'm disrespected! And even worse, I want my watch time back!"
114,"The storyline is discontineous and dull . Terruble graphics . The dialogues are juvenile. And its very boring.
I was fooled to watch it because of some bias reviews written because of national reasons but still couldnt go further than half of the 5th episode .bottom line is I really tried to like it but i couldnt."
115,"Well, I only watched a couple of episodes because I was excited to see an Arabic horror show on Netflix. Couldn't finish it though because, well, it's really bad. There's nothing interesting about it. The acting is really bad and so are the visual effects. The scary parts are not scary at all. Don't waste your time on it."
116,"Simply waste of time
i hate everything about this serie"
117,"Way too overated , wasted my time , i don't know what are the high rating's about , i can only assume that egyptian' voted hard for it , i cannot think of anything else"
118,Its really sad how they wanna submit fake ratings to this very bad series and childish directing.. A really waste of time and media talks over a 1/10
119,"I am till now astonished how can Netflix waste their own production on such a scenario, there is no logic in the development of characters att all, also if we talk about the visual effecta, how beginner are theyin thia field, the explosions, the monster which we discover it was just a gorilla, then does this serie promote for the power of dead people, and the curse that they can applyit to us after their dead with thouaands of years, does the serie calling forngoing back to religion control, and many many other questions about where and how Netflix produce such a serie with a minimum qualifications?!"
120,"Superficial with nothing new , predictable, poor graphics"
121,"I finished all the episodes of the series in one day .. The story, directing and filming was a wonderful .. The selection of actors was successful .. It did not disappoint at all"
122,"Best Arabic tv series , hope Netflix complete the following seasons"
123,Plus very poor graphics. The plot is predictable and naive. Way too many characters don´t contribute to absolutely anything. I will finish it just because of the language. There are not so many series available in Arabic.
124,"Some notes need to be in consider like the translation in AR , but In general very good, great effort. wait to complete the full series."
125,"I'm surprised it's got such high ratings .. very poor acting and childish horror story , nothing exciting at all"
126,If you're a fan of paranormal novels then don't watch it as they completely ruined the characters we all love but if you're not a fan don't watch it too because it's the worst horror series netflix has made
127,"Briefly
Story is so-so ( I tried to be positive but...)
Plot is nonsense, not cohesive, irrelevant and incoherent..
Acting is soooo bland... They need to spice their actings up
Characters are boring... And for God sake what's the exact role of Maggie in the series except saying "" Refaat, Refaat""... And as I watched the series , I do believe that Refaat is not a kind of man of 40 ( actually looks like in mid 50s) that's so attractive to drag a scotch lady from one country to another looking for him... He's so negative, introverted and.. Etc
Graphic is mediocre... It needs more efforts
Cinematography is GREAT
Music is more than good but not magnificent
Directing is good except for few silly mistakes that are really annoying
Mmmm and what the f... The GORILLA doing in the desert... COME ON!!!"
128,"Starting with the good, the overall atmosphere of 60s and colors is good. Also the 5th episode was okay.The bad:1. The performance by Maggie is below average. Very poor choice to be made for a series that's planned to have more to come.2. The repetitive over-dramatic music that would be more suitable for a ""war"" movie more than a supernatural sort of series. In one of the episodes, one of the music tracks sounded like copied from Interstellar.3. Use of poor wigs for Maggie and Howaida. though overall Howaida's performance was much better than Maggie's.4. The first 4 episodes are slow, boring and nonengaging.5. The characters, incidents and the monsters lacks originality in their creation."
129,"The series was so bad, the directing is weak, a big difference between acting and imitation ( no creativity )
It's was Imitation, not representation
A lot of mistakes."
130,"Not really a fan. Didnt read the stories, but also didnt like the series. Weak scenario but better execution."
131,"Stop this guys, we all love Dr. Ahmad Tawfik, may his soul rest in peace, but the show is terrible, the monsters are just funny, magie is not blond ???? Shiraz has no blue eyes ????? and the worst part is turning the best novel Al jathum into a terrible dream.....wow. you guys destroyed the series."
132,It may be 6 or 7 if I haven't read the book. I feel it is wiping out the good of it
133,It is pathetic to give this poor tv show 10 /10 just because it is Egyptian.. this is not football match..!!
134,"Before you watch: This is not an adaptation of the books. This is just loosely and poorly based on the books!I never knew that a book adaptation has to mean that you only take the names of the characters and do every single thing else your way. That is the case here... They got the names of the characters right, and that is about it!It is a slow show... Extremely poor stories and very anticlimactic conclusions.They turned the main Character from the sarcastic yet lovable character to an irresponsible, weak and for some reason always has a sad face person. Add to this the very lazy writing and the very cheap visual effects and you get this series. Calling this Mediocre is a nice compliment.The one star I gave it is for the good color correction. I really tried hard to find a positive point."
135,"After finish this series, i think it's overrated.
boring, nothing new at all, poor story, great acting but it can help this show better"
136,"This is not just a bad tv show, it's a crime for the fans of the novel and the fans of tv generally. The dialog was a big joke, acting was terrible except for Ahmed Amin who did a good job with what he was told to do, not what he was supposed to act on. The terrible director of this mess is responsible for it, he had a gold mine to bring something shiny and precious for us yet he extracted coal. And since this was supposed to be a "" horror"" show the only thing that was scary was that CGI in 2020."
137,"I loved everything about it, the crew are amazing, cadres are so perfect, directing is brilliant and the stories is good.
Also, i loved the lines and the quotes
Usually when you watch a horror movie or series it always lacks the story, they only focus on the graphics or how are they gonna scary you. But, no story
In conclusion, thanks for the beautiful work.
AND THANKS FOR CLEANING UP MY EYES WITH THIS MASTERPIECE 💖"
138,"Tempo is so slow , not good acting and big propaganda for nothing"
139,"I dont know why it has good rating, the acting is bad, the special effects are bad, even the story is bad. not worth wasting your time."
140,I'll trust the reviews when more than the Egyptian people review it. So biased...
141,"This series is actually quite good, each episode brings something new, and the characters play their parts well.
BUT me and it's my problem, I just don't like Subtitles, and feel that my score of 6/10 is probably lower than it should be."
142,"Extremely Poor visual effects.
Dramatic buildups is almost absent leading to disconnection in events, also twists and climax are not observable in the series making it boring with oversimplified solutions to all problems.
No historical and geographical review was performed leading to fatal mistakes."
143,"Not the poor graphic, and I have a real problem with King Kong in the Libyan desert! The producers should have worked the details out for a better show!"
144,"This is a good adventure show meant for easy viewing. It's not horrific by any stretch of the imagination and the cgi is weak (mainly episode 3) . Some characters have promise but end up falling short, a certain red head springs to mind. In case you couldn't guess she was scottish because of her accent the director made sure she had bright red hair.This isn't the pinaccle of TV so I can't imagine why anyone would give this a 9 or 10, surely those scorings are reserved for the top tier stuff. But alas opinions are subjective and what appeals to one may not appeal to another.Having said all that and a few other pet peeves I didn't mention. I was thoroughly engaged whilst watching this show, it was put together well enough to be entertaining. Each episode gets straight to the point with little to no wasting time, so you won't catch yourself drifting off.In summation it's a decent watch, would I enjoy it as much if it dragged on any more than 6 episodes? Probably not. Is it a 8* plus show? Most certainly not. Is it worth watching for some casual entertainment? Absolutely. Go into this with tempered expectations, and you'll enjoy it."
145,"Honestly I thought I'll watch something as good as I heard about
There is a better one called (fi kul esbou' youm jumaa) (every week on Friday)"
146,Finally it is here i am pretty sure it will be a fantastic one
147,"One man can destroy the greatest novel
refaat Ismail(the lead character) is supposed to be a PHD professor who is incredibly intelligent and very sarcastic in the original novel
The tv show turn him to weak, ominous and depressed character who's also has no sense of humor"
148,After watched 4 epsioed and i think it's super overrated
149,"Finally Egypt goes so far with this amazing series by a good cast starring Ahmed amin the famous comedian who make a horror scene very well, big claps for the whole crew for doing an amazing story by the great author Ahmed Tawfek may his life rest in peace"
150,"I really wish that one day maybe in the future Egyptians will actually try to give some solid critique, way too overrated."
151,"It's not what i expected to see, jut a propaganda,
Poor graphics"
152,"The story is adventurous and good to follow but let down by the bad CG effects, come on guys the setting is nicely made to look 60 era but the monster CGs are PlayStation 2 quality.. again great acting from the main character.."
153,This is a tv series .. not a football match .. it is pathetic to overrate the show just because ti is Egyptian.. !!
154,"Very disappointing, as a person who read this book before I can tell it's very weak"
155,This should not be on TV until its writers start doing a minimal effort to creat logical and consistant storylines.
156,I will spend my life collecting money to produce an alternative of this series.. because actually it's not good at all.. sorry guys
157,"Everything is great, even the soundtrack. The performance was great and the photography was very nice"
158,"For the life of me, I can't understand how people think this deserves such high ratings. I really wanted to like it, as I generally prefer foreign series over American ones; however, this was so dull that we kept checking to see how much longer the first episode had left before it was over. Watching it is far more horrific than anything that occurs in it."
159,"The best Arabic show i have ever seen .
Professional
Great sound effects
Very good visual effects
I wish if there's more seasons to come and let Dr Ahmed khaled Tawfik's stories live to the coming generations too like we grew up on reading them
Great Job lads great job "" Hats off ""
."
160,"Every scene, where's refaat ismail.. You will said he wasn't like that!"
161,Good adaptation from the book series .. average in every thing except maybe the acting .. the 3D scenes of a gorilla in the desert are out of expectation.
162,"How come a horror novel turned into that boring dull episodes?
I might be biased cause I've read it all but even those who haven't read it just asked me.. Is Refa'at really that boring?
Of course NOT...
The main character is sarcastic yet serious, normal and hesitant character...
So definitely his voice tone is going to change tons of times to reflect that character.
The director made him monotonous regardless what is happening.. Even if he is going to be eaten by a 3 headed monster, I guess I'm going to hear the same dull non-reactive voice...
I used to laugh while reading, yet get scared before going to sleep.But the director successfuly made me ywan while watching it. Who does he think himself is to spoil the writer's masterpiece like this and turn it into a monotone lullaby?"
163,"To my brothers and sisters egyptians, please stop give 10 to this series just because is egyptian work."
164,Not good enough for paranormal.it should be more professional
165,"I really tried to give this series a fair shot and endured all 6 episodes but honestly there's nothing spectacular about this show. The only reason I can justify the high ratings is because it's an Egyptian Netflix series and people want to support it. The CGI is terrible and looks so fake, the ""paranormal"" creatures looked like they were brought from a cheap costume store, the acting was mediocre at best and I really didn't connect with any of the characters. I haven't read the novel but I'm sure there's a lot more depth than what was visualized on screen. I wasn't horrified nor thrilled so not sure what genre this falls under really. The only thing I enjoyed was the music."
166,"Why everyone is afraid to say that this series is terrible?
Just say it, it's the truth.
Extremely trashy acting, bad scripts, meaningless plot, bad directing and boring af. Terrible by all means"
167,"I don't know from where all this high rates comes from, especially it comes on bulk if we compare it with stranger things or Dark it means we under estimate such adorable stories and work. So I think the fair rate is 5, anyhow keep going Egyptian cinema, and learn from others,"
168,"With almost the same votes as Queens Gambit and the same rating, if you click on the number of votes you will see a very different story from Paranormal. In Paranormal, total votes of +45 is almost null. Also the number of votes of <18 is 10x higher than in Queens Gambit, averaging 9.9. You can clearly see how the score is biased with this info- basically the egytptian/arabic fanatics, which I'm 100% sure there are hundreds of thousands, tend to score 10 before even watching the show. They are fanatics after all and they are young, I don't blame them. I think there are really a lot of people like that. That said Queens Gambit is clearly an objectively speaking superior work than Paranormal, even thuugh it has the same rating. With no bias, Paranormal is a 8-8.4 at best."
169,"I was whiting the novel to become life , the best anti hero ever D.Refat , the series is great and I recommend to watch"
170,Its a very bad tv show even I don't know who he in the 250 top rated
171,"This is the worst series based on a novel
When I see netflix and horror I thought it would be something like stranger things but actually it's the opposite of it
The characters are stupid, the story is lame and the graphics are like cheap halloween costumes"
172,Nothing special. I don't know why many give high rates. Just saw 1st episodes and waited for something that deserved 9.1....and nothing...
173,"According to what i saw till this moment, things i hated in series were so something or two, but acting, music, story.. etc are amazingly done.This isn't just a series, it's the best series i've ever seen after Constantine's"
174,This is the worst TV show I've ever seen in my life! They ruined the original novels which I'm a big fan of! I couldn't make it to the third episode.
175,"Not worth watching, boring and acting is extremely cringy"
176,"Recommended for kids its a funny king kong series. Stupid series, awful animation with funny story. Its has a very good horror start and ended up with a story of how is king kong made"
177,"The script is so bad.
No horror/thrilling at all.
Weak stories."
178,"A chain smoking Egyptian doctor falls in love again , and to his colorful family's chagrin , with his former Scottish university colleague as they explore an ancient Egyptian curse/ legend Which involves a ghost of a girl with laughable make up which brings them to the Libyan desert from which they embark on an Indiana Jones like adventure. The lead actor is super annoying , the lead actress cannot act with a permanently frozen facial expression, the storyline is excruciatingly slow and boring And has zero horror elements, it's basically a jumbled and incoherent mess , pass on this one !"
179,"I would've loved to see some different kind of horror coming from one of the first contemporary and prolific Arabic Fantasy and horror writers. However, this series is a serious let-down.
I'd say the main issue with this series is poor screenplay. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural and wooden. The characterisation makes us unable to empathise with anyone due to their one-dimensional personality, uninteresting backstories and counter-intuitive attitudes.
Also the follow up of scenes is boring and trite. The story is told in a way that simply doesn't draw us in."
180,"It's an honest attempt from Egypt. Good production and though sometimes the CGIs are not good, you do believe that you see Egypt in the 60s. Sometimes it makes you realize how much these countries reverted from western culture the last decades. Was that intentional? I don't know.
It's interesting to see the inner battle of the main character, trying to rationalize his encounters with the paranormal.
Don't expect much from the female characters for obvious reasons.
I get the high rating, Arabic speaking people are supporting it a lot and that is understandable. I would do the same if I saw a show in my native language.
The bottom line is that it's entertaining enough to give it a chance"
181,"It was a good show.. Some scenes were a little bit creepy/scary.. I liked the main character and his sense of humor.. You wouldn't understand it if you don't speak Arabic.. It wasn't that great.. Sometimes it was boring.. Third episode was the worst, I don't know why ppl r giving it a 9 or a 10.. Come on guys"
182,"To all those people who said why this show is so overrated?
Well i agree with you and I'll tell you why
First of all, the plot of story was done weakly
Secondly , the acting and the CGI were so poor
Maybe the only good thing in the show was the acting of Ahmad amin and the soundtrack which is by the way stole from another show
Finally, all this overrated came from Egyptian people just to support their first show on Netflix , so my advice is keep your time on good show and don't wast it in this"
183,"Had a high expectation at first but i couldnt complete the whole series really , silly scenario & very boring conversations , also Refaat the hero of the story is completly different character in the series"
184,"Well this we have been waiting for like 20 years to be on da screen, everyone read this book series know that the content of what Dr.A.khaled put is more than just a simple paranormal horror stories, even everyone of the characters got an identity, we lost this on da screen, I just finished 3 episodes, well can't deny that Ahmed Amin tried his best and the rest of the cast tried really hard, but the plot?!!!! Are you kidding me, I don't know why the director insist to edit lot of details of the stories and the real horror came when he with no reason forced us to see Maggie speak Arabic!! And to insert her in the 1st episode where she has no role at all in Dat story, his fiancee somehow he decide to make Howaida his relative!!!! And story line it's self is very boring, the director thought about him self before the fans, I don't know why the other rated this +9, i will give it 5 for the effort of the actors and the sake of RIP Dr. Ahmed"
185,This is very boring. Don't watch it lol I fell asleep and you might too
186,"The original novel is more interesting.
Graphics is weired specially in gorilla scenes."
187,"Unfortunately it's depressing 😞 . . The original novels are extremely much better, but the producers destroy the story by their changes, limited vision and sleazy scenario . .
Also the main actor wasn't professional that much to provide the lovable character of Dr. Refaat Ismaiel, his pretentious performance wasn't required.
I hope that they consider this in next session if any."
188,"Most of the time I felt the emptiness of the story, we didn't have enough time to know the characters, to love, to hate, to be afraid.
Poor effects, good music, good acting especially Ahmed Amin.
The finale was great. I hope that the series creator will make better in theseasons to come."
189,"The first episode was good and felt like I'm gonna watch a series with a whole new level that never happened before but when you go further you'll get disappointed and doesn't deserve all of this hype, overall it is not bad and a very good start for an Arabic series and would expect more in the next sessions..."
190,"I give it 7 and i am being generous here, lots of scenes lack logic or simplest common sense, there is no story building for 3 episodes and when you get to plot it's very naive, won't talk about cgi, i can only praise the lead for his amazing work to lift this series up, good cinematography and camera work here and then, finally the soundtrack is very good. if you're going to watch this lower your expectations its watchable with some enjoyable moments and thats it."
191,"I was very excited before watching first episode. Total disappointment! Please stop giving it 10/10, it's a very poor show."
192,"The series disappointed me greatly. I expected it to be better than that series. It started very well in the first two episodes, but it went down to the end of the series. Ahmed Amin. I mastered the character of Refaat Ismail, but I did not like the character and his relationship with Maggie was bad and the best character in a series was the hero and CGI was one of the worst Marit I haven't read the novels, but I'm sure it's better than this bad job"
193,"Not worth to watch, waste of time, Terrible graphics."
194,"I died when Maggie started talking, they could do better than that"
195,"While not exactly a horror series, Paranormal is a very entertaining show with supernatural and dark elements.
The structure is linear and the plot is simple but really effective. Overall a very good job!"
196,I came here to check the reviews after watching 3 episodes and I have to say anything over 6 and that's being generous is highly sus.
197,"This TV show should be rated the worst TV series in 2020, it is based on the most successful novels in Egypt, yet the director and screenwriter messed up with everything, from having actors without any feelings for their roles, to very bad cliche scenes, to the worst CGI since the 90s. The soundtrack is stolen from another German TV series. Total waste of time."
198,"Absolutely not, this is more like a worse Tintin story and for all ages who like such things."
199,"A waste of time ! boring, bad acting and mostly not scary at all. I wanted it to be great but sadly it is not and if you want Horror watch The haunting of hill house that's a show you won't be able to stop watching plus it's on a different Level."
200,"The show is average, it's not bad but it's not very good either. As and avid reader of the books and a fan of the original author the amazing Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfeq, I have to say I was disappointed when I watched the first episode. It felt really slow and dull compared to the books which was of a faster pace and much more entertaining. I was very excited when Ahmed Amin was cast as Dr. Refaat Ismail, the protagonist, as he is a brilliant actor who has both the dramatic skills and the sarcastic sense of humour required for the role. However, the end result was not very pleasent. I believe the director played a big part in restraining Amin from becoming Refaat and doing his magic with this complex character. The voice and the delivery felt imposed, slow and unnatural, while the character is supposed to be witty and sarcastically funny, at least internally. I hope, in case we were lucky enough to get another season, that the director allows Amin to embody the character as it was written by the original author.
I know that the casting for Maggie was very controversial, however, it turned out to be surprisingly pleasant and spot one. Thumbs up to Razan. Also, the actress who played Ra'ifa, Refaat's sister, was very good even though she didn't look nor sound like the character in the books. The rest of the cast and the acting was a huge let down, except maybe for Reda Refaat's elder brother who was pretty good.
I hope the show gets better as I continue to watch and will definitely review again as soon as I finish the whole thing, and hopefully, I will give it a higher rating then!"
201,"This show is over rated , the graphics were poor , and the episodes were boring & an un horror at all and predictable, the women characters were very flat and un professional in acting , ahmed amin is talented , I saw that , that why I give this show one star"
202,"Let's start with the good stuff, it was something new locally speaking, a good effort to produce something crisp, it was mediocre on the scale of ""Fun and amusement"".
The list of cons is long, the screenplay, it was bad and chaotic, very poor plot that relied on a sequence of disastrous and disconnected fairy tales that were attached together and glued to a story of a young girl warning the main protagonist
from LUCIFER!! How the hell are local mythologies such as a pharaonic curse or the nadaha connected to Lucifer, this was pure Kiki (no profanity allowed), the main novels were about that every event thought to be paranormal is eventually normal but twisted somehow, so the story relied on chaotic kaka ( no profanity allowed again), instead it should have stick to the main protagonist Refaat focusing on the complexity of his character and the genius and charismatic aspects of it with another choice of actor, bad character's building and development, bad choice of actors except the child who played (Taha), that boy was the best thing about the show regardless of his short screen time, mediocre editing, bad directing as the narration technique was shallow, felt like narration for a four year old and that's the problem with most Arab productions, there are no brain teasers, nothing left for the spectator to interpret on his own terms.
Very very bad choice of actors again.
In the end, it's not about how good your camera is or how much you spend on production design, it's about how you used it and make it come to life.
I recommend Sherlock instead of this, at least you'll know what's wrong with paranormal after."
203,"As a person who have read the novel before watching the series I was having really high expectations and I got disappointed really bad.
Ok, some cool frames from far away or close-ups but who can't do that nowadays!!
The only character that have a little bit of weight is the main protagonist Dr. Refaat and Ahmed Amin was trying his best to portray Dr. Refaat Ismail that sarcastic lovable human with his dark sense of humor but on the contrary he made him depressed, paranoid, irresponsible and careless towards his beloved ones. The kids were acting on a very low-scale apart from a couple scenes or so. The dialogue was really weak, the only good dialogue was between Dr. Refaat and himself. Obviously there's no need to address how silly the CGI attempts were. The other characters suffered from the weak writing and the actors was just saying words without any kind of emotions. I felt like the characters were dead, empty and without textures. The love tringle that was supposed to be shown on the screen was really cold and there ware no sparks or emotions from any kind. I know that's an adaption and there're things gonna be taken out of the novel or added to the screenplay but to filp the whole idea that the novel was trying to prove upside down is something else, from trying to prove that every paranormal act is actually has a rational explanation to just believe in those myths is giving me a hard time. Putting that aside there was no plot or a thing to hold all the episodes together at all.
Horror isn't about blinking-lights or missed up faces, it's about the storyline and the plot and that was completely missing. Most of the time I felt cringey and annoyed. Really sad how this great novel turned into a mediocre TV show. I know how the crew worked on this project to come out to light but I'm afraid they took the easy path and didn't invest their talent in it to its full. My only hope is this gonna be a trial to learn from and of course I'd love to see a season 2 but with an acceptable screenplay, CGI, acting and plot.
P.S. : Please take a subjective look at this show and review it fairly without biasing to the show just because it's from your country. Giving it 10/10 out of nothing is not gonna help to improve!"
204,"Too lame storyline, good acting, empty content, very good director"
205,Recommended for kids its a funny king kong series. Poor animation stupid story. But it has a very good horror start ( that is why its take 1 out of 10) then it ended up with a story of how is king kong made. The real review is 0 out of 10
206,I really had higher hopes for this show..Bad acting...bad script...the only thing good about this show is the music (yes i grew up reading the books and I consider myself a huge fan).
207,"Ahmed amin is overeacting as a man on an edge of craying all the time....you are waiting for him to cry but it doesn't!!!
he is moving like a younge guy who have badback wich need fixing before comming to the studio to start his bad overreacting. in the book Dr. refaat was angri yet funny, in dark way, old person not a sad slow person who has difficulty to talk in a normal tone!!!!!!!then why the inviroment and the people doesn't look like noraml people that you can see everday.I hope people don't see the series befor reading the books because I don't them to hate them"
208,"I was very curious to watch the episodes as I was big fan of the novels. However, they came very disappointing to me; miscasting issues (i.e Sheraaz role), Ahmed Amin was acting and changing his voice as a character in an animation movie, poor graphics (why to put King Kong character in one of the episodes? That made me getting nervous), the sound track came very poor, the scaring shots were not professional at all.Finally, it is a good trial but I hope the coming season fixing all of these issues."
209,"I feel like I watched a completely different series after reading the posted reviews by other viewers.There was nothing suspenseful, scary or even intriguing about this show. You have the option of spoken English dubbed in by voice actors. This is always a dicey proposition and here it does fail quite badly. The voice actors weren't good actors in any sense of the word. I do realize this is a foreign made series (Egypt), so perhaps translating the language and then dubbing it caused a real loss between the spoken word and the meaning of the written words. Most of the time the lines the actors spoke did not match the subtitles at all-they didn't even come close. The subtitles were actually much more descriptive.The cinematography was awful. It felt like 3/4 of the shows was filmed in near or total darkness. All you could see were the actors running in a set or location that was so black that it was impossible to even see their faces. There were simply bodies moving through pitch black.There is nothing to recommend this series other than it's the first Netflix show from Egypt. That's a big deal. Too bad it's a badly acted, badly shot story that doesn't elicit a single shiver let alone qualify as a horror movie."
210,Please tell me that this was made by middle school students for a class project. I really tried to get into the show but all I could do is laugh at the acting and the so call special effects.
211,"I gave it a try as the trailer seemed really interesting and the first episode was fair but from the second episode onwards the quality of the ""monsters"" from the series are edited as if the editor was an 8 years old kid. Unfortunately it's been by far one of the worst series I've seen."
212,"I was so excited for this series, especially since it's the first egyptian Netfix production. I have read most of the books, and was extremely disappointed to see, that they changed a lot of the story. A LOT. and even added more characters.
The acting was horrible, there was no life to the characters, especially Dr Refaat. They grabbed the character in a wrong way, and made it depressing to watch. No excitement.
The reason i gave it 2 stars, not 1, is because of the filming. The quality of the series was a lot better then most of arabic movies. props!"
213,"How on earth can this series have such high ratings. IMDB should check that and if necessary categorize Arabic productions similar to Indian ones. Here, the country of production alone seems to be decisive for a good rating and not the quality of the series!
Because paranormal is far from being excellent. The actors are ridiculous, the effects are bad and the story is outrageous nonsense, always sufficient to scare youngsters. Even after watching the entire season, I am still unclear whether the whole thing should be a comedy ... At least the main actor, a kind of Arab version of Woody Allen speaks for it ..."
214,"This is not reefat Ismail!
The plot is different, the characters are different,nothing is related to the actual novels...
I don't like it at all!
Actually It lacks the sinister sense of humor of Dr.reefat Ismail
Technically it's good but the story is ruined"
215,"I am a fan of Ahmed Khaled Tawfeek, grow up loving everything he wrote. But this series is a complete trash. Bad acting, bad dialogue, awful director (sorry Amr Salam, I know you are going to read this but this show os too big for you).
Ahmed Amin is bad choice. Being close of AKT doesn't give him any advantage to be selected.Think twice guys when you rate the show, you are not rating the novel here."
216,"I'm so glad to see our childhood horror stories turns to a brilliant tv show, But surly we need more than 6 episodes, well done for all amr salama and ahmed amen and Maggie"
217,"It is so far like the books .. I love it .. Ahmed Amin has reflected Refaat Ismail exactly as I imagined him throughout my childhood ., highly recommended"
218,"Priefly , its a masterpiece not merely a TV series . Iam looking forward to watch more and more seasons , Go on . all thanks to the smart director Amr Salama , the great actor Ahmed Amen and the rest of the cast . 😍"
219,"The motion graphics were really bad, good story but not the best"
220,It rarely happens but I was so bad I could t watch it entirely. Don't understand how people could give good ratings on this one!
221,"Unfortunately, the director and screenwriter was unable to turn the novel into a TV series. Ahmed Amin did not succeed in reversing the character of Dr. Rifaat Ismail who We knew as he looked scared, cold, hesitant, and depressed, unlike Rifaat in the novel who was nervous, angry, and stinging of the tongue. Frankly speaking, this work distorted the true story and could have produced a better fit for Professor Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq the writer of the novel. The novel is much better than the series"
222,"Just less than average
Not very bad
But not deserve this 8.4 at all
Higher Point it deserves 5 out of 10
Very Boring not scary"
223,"I was very disappointed to see such TV series, it is boring in many parts of it, actors which can't act, and director who need to learn directing from the beginning. lots of cliché copied from other movies or TV series. totally unworthy."
224,"I was excited to this because its based on Ahmed Khaled Tawfik novels, and Amr Salama is the creator, as well as it's the first Egyptian series to be produced by Netflix. The hype and the expectations that were set were not BY ANY MEANS met by the series itself.Cinematography is the only good thing about this series. Directing is really bad. Some landscape scenes though are too fake, you can tell that it's a green screen, the graphics and SFX/editing was really bad. Acting is really bad and some moments are very cringey and unnecessary, script is mediocre, has some nice quotes, but again, can be unnecessary at times.When it comes to the plot, it's beyond chaotic. It is supposed to be a ""scary"" show but I kid you not I didn't flinch for one minute. I think the plot is poorly executed compared to the novels, and I think it's a bit crammed.Overall a bad show and definitely beyond overrated, don't waste your time."
225,Fantasy/Horror but didn't even feel like either tbh. The story just felt all over the place starting out with the Egyptian mummy curse routine then turning into a Nightmare on Elm Street. Pretty sure the same CGI team that did Clash of the Titans also did the monkey in this movie. Don't even get me started on the Wigs.
226,"While the lead actor Ahmed Amin is engaging, the concept and most of the six episodes in the 2020 season were poorly developed and plotted. The least intelligent and most poorly executed was The Guardian of the Cave (""King Kong in the Sahara""), but barely beat out The Naiad and Incubus for worst episode. Most interesting was a glimpse of life in Egypt of the time, but the spookiness was forced and uninspired. (One of the scariest parts was what Maggie's hairdresser did to her before shooting began.) It seems the author's books are not readily available in English, so I can't see how they compare; hard to understand how this series is rated so high if its merits are being judged."
227,"I would like to ask Amru salama.. Really this is your imagination about Dr. Refaat Ismaeel? If yes,it means crisis"
228,"Amin did a hell of a great job , he proves from the first scene that he is so talented and passionate actor out of his usual light comedy rules , the script is great , the tempo is fantastic , music is fabulous , but the graphics really sucks , it reminds me by the Animation movies at the late 80's
Otherwise it's not bad"
229,"The trailer was promising so I decided to watch. To be honest, it was a very poor attempt at making a horror tv show. It was neither scary nor enjoyable. I rated 4 instead of 1 because the protagonist was the only good thing about the ensemble."
230,"There a lot of things i didn't like about this series but
the worst thing that i didn't like is the acting also Ahmed amin i feel he is trying so hard to be Refaat Ismail and notice that i didn't read the novel but i can see he is trying his best to be him and that why i am so annoyed and also his classical Arabic is not good, needless to say, the ghost looks quite funny."
231,"Not worth time , motions, graphics, light , dialogue, story , all are poor and stupid"
232,"Spoiler-alert!!🚨
First of all, I'd like to clarify that I tried to distance myself from the book series I grew up reading because I know most movies/shows are almost never as good as their books. But seriously this has nothing to do with the books, except the names and the general theme: the plots are different, the characters are different, and the motives are different!
The director turned Refa'at Ismael, a cynical witty intellectual, into a depressed rude old man who leaves his family behind and causes the death of innocent people. Refaat who always has something sarcastic/funny to say, who is always quick on his feet turns into a dull push-over no one wants to hang out with. From a respectable professor with very strong intuition that almost never disappoints, into a grim pathetic man who calls himself stupid all the time!The storyline: very weak and full of loopholes, and major events in the books were omitted/changed. If you want to change so much, why not just write your own novel? Why use the author's name to sell and market your show?Examples of some of the major mistakes:
Episode 1:
-Why does Maggi creep onto Refaat in the dark??
Why would Maggi come to Egypt in the middle of a war for no 'solid' reason?Episode 2:
Why is the tomb left without guards? Why is the coffin open? Why is the black Pharoe moving too slow? Why isn't Maggi afraid after she saw it? She's hardly surprised!Episode 3:
How does Refaat recklessly decide to blow the cave and run alone leaving Louis and the love of his life right in front of it?And don't get me started on the Guardian of the Cave! Why is it a gorilla when the author specifically mentioned that it is not? A gorilla in the Libyan desert? Why won't the tribe just shoot it?! Or destroy the cave the way Refaat did?!Episode 4:
yet another restless corpse causing trouble in order to be buried!Why did Reda decide to swim? How could Refaat leave him to drown in order to get the corpse out?! Refaat who is always ready to sacrifice himself to save others leaves his only brother drowning for a corpse?I honestly feel bad for the actors who, in spite of doing their best (especially Ahmad Amin in the role of Refaat), their hands were tied by the weak story, poor direction and visual effects. It's sad that many fellow Egyptians rated this 10 before even watching thinking they're honoring the memory of the author. I'm a dedicated reader of his and I think this is an insult to his genius!"
233,"Why there would be a gorilla in the desert!!! Also the scenarist did a bad job, you could barely follow."
234,"If it were a normal series, it would have been good
But it is taken of Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq's novel in a failed way that offends the writer and the novels
I love Dr. Ahmad Khaled Tawfiq and all
His literary product"
235,"I am so proud of this great show from Egypt
I recommend it"
236,"Work is not like the rest of the Egyptian works, not just a story that has been reworked and has been used in all the works as in most works, you watch and you know what will happen but how will this happen is just different, but here we have started to get out of this framework and make our own different works
The pain is that I feel in the episodes that there is not a lot of details but at the same time I feel that if there are a lot of details my brain will stop absorbing the many events but I was enjoying and did not hope despite this feeling, and also Graphic like gorillas and jathum I did not feel their reality and i felt that they are graphic and this is not nice because I get out of the situation in which the events brought me
But I'm very happy with this job, and I hope season two comes out as soon as possible."
237,"The dialogue at first was very witty, and very Western, the but Storytelling is mediocre. Sometimes some of the features of the Stories were there just for the convenience of the Plot.This also seemed like some Middle Aged Egyptian Guy's fantasy, a balding, strange looking Middle Aged Guy is being fought over by one young Gorgeous Woman and a Red headed Foreigner Woman.I couldn't get past 2 Episodes before finally calling it quits."
238,"The show is not bad the product was perfect if we didn't count the cgi part it was horrible the mean story was great the side one was really boring ahmed amen acting was amazing too but the conversation between characters was poor and the side characters doesn't have any depth to them could have been better but it's a good start, and i dont get how this show rated 9 when hunting of hell house is 8.7 really overrated"
239,"I didn't have a high expectations but the show is great and the ending is perfect !! I know that everyone talked about the positive things and how they liked the show
But I will just talked about some things that I didn't like :
The CGI is bad and the making of monsters is kinda meeehThey need to make the episode longer or make more episodes per seasonThere is some missed parts in the story that need to be explained wellAND THAT'S IT !! this show can be one of the best and I would highly recommend it to the rest of the world"
240,"I'm Egyptian too and I think that almost everything in that series was NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF. Poor casting, script, graphics, acting and an ignorant director.
Honestly, I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I hate."
241,"Who ever picked the wigs for the girl from Scotland and other people, didn't do proper research. It looks quite unnatural unfortunately."
242,"The series from the beginning till the end was perfect, 1) the acting from all was soo good, specially ahmed amin and razan jammal they were the best. 2) the soundtracks from khaled al kammar was fantastic, i am pretty sure that i will not get bored from listening it. 3) the photographing and the colors was really good. Finally, I can't forget amr salama, the man behind it all. Really I want to thank all of you so much."
243,"The sound design and cinematography is top notch. The theme is borderline noir at points but nonetheless vibrant Landscapes and visual horror are abundant but regulated.
Although the CGI is lacking at times but the practical effects provide a graphic and grotesque sight.
The story strays from the original works yet i can't say they add any negatives exert the mortal romantic subplots which ultimately don't take away from the movie at all.
Ahmed Amin does indeed carry this whole series as an amazing and captivating lead.
On a positive note; a better focus on practical effects can easily improve this series to a 10/10."
244,Another promising piece of work ruined by the awful distraction of having dubbed voices!! For the love of God just put subtitles up; anyone who watches a lot of film will find this obnoxiously distracting. It's not just the visual effect but the audio sounds different... idk what else I can say is this is just laughable...
245,"This critique is coming from an arabic person who's more indulged into both foreign and arabic cinema, and i would say it is really a great start as an arabic series which is available worldwidely. Expect there are alot of miswriting of the majority of characters, you cannot relate to them. But generally the acting was great however. And the CGI was really bad in episode 3 and 4, i wish they'd had done a better job. Rather than that i liked the cinematography and great soundtracks."
246,"Cons: not scary at all, graphics are so bad it's like they were done by a child, some actors are really cringy especially the kids
Pros: the story is ok, the music is really good and some actors are actually surprisingly really good and the camera work is good"
247,"I'm Egyptian and I hoped to give the show 10/10 .. but unfortunately, if I'll evaluate it as an horror/thriller show I will give it maximum 3 ..
as a well built drama in general I give it 3..
as a dream I was hoping to watch coming true one day since I was 8 yeras old boy, I give it 3 ..May be the only bright side is that they gave some extra care and effort more than most of other egyptian shows I watched recently .. whatever the result was..and by the way, the episodes 2,3&4 of the director called Majed Al-Ansary are much weaker than the other episodes of Amr Salama."
248,I enjoyed watching every single second of it. What a real good job they made. We need more seasons of it and more of Egyptian series as well.
249,"A well-made and entertaining series, based upon popular novels written by an author who wrote over 200 of them.The issue is that the life of women in Egypt in 1969 was much more liberal and Western than in 2020. The women portrayed here don't smoke, are covered modestly and generally behave like models of propriety."
250,Good start for promising series good script and very good photos fantastic views but bad cgi
251,"Overall, a great work by Amr Salam and team. I loved the acting of Ahmed Amin and Roshdy Elshamy. Amazing make up and decorations to get the characters and environment right.Somethings that I didn't like:
In some episodes, the dialogue could have used some work. Specially the 3rd episode.Some of the logic isn't convincing. How did Refaat get out of quicksand so quickly after the beast has sunk? e.g. Why Shiraz ghost tries to kill young Refaat but then helped adult Refaat? Why did she suddenly start appearing to Howayda?But keep up the good work. Looking forward to season 2."
252,"7 stars compared to Egyptian series and 6 compared to world standard ,
Still a good starts for egyptian drama in horror zone .
Very bad graphics , naive scenario especially in libya episode ""el 3asas"""
253,"I have wasted my time watching such weak performance, childish CGI, naïve screenwriting, very bad directing. Netflix will regret doing such bad TV series."
254,"I only turned this on briefly to have background noise while we discussed what we actually wanted to watch, until one by one each of us was drawn in. The paranormal TV and movie category is overwhelmed with roughly the same stories retold in slightly different ways this is not that. We are exposed to interesting new stories and insight into a culture that we are rarely exposed to. The lead actor is great and in a surprising twist he is a stand up comedian and while this isn't a horror comedy he does add some occasional comic relief. If you want gore or are looking to have constant jump scares this is not for you. A comparison in scare ability it's much closer to the original Twilight Zone than it is to American Horror Story. If you have happened upon other of my reviews which is unlikely but if you have I never give any details about characters, plot just in the broadest possible way. To give you tiny details about dialogue or my impression on its commentary about societal issues would mean nothing if your world view is different then mine. I stick only to my likes and dislike of the show or movie.
I very much enjoyed this start to finish and I will anxiously await more of this unique show in a over saturated category. If the theme is still interesting to you this is a different set of stories so you will be exposed to new pieces new folklore that unless you are within this culture or you've spent a lot of time in 1960's Northern Africa primarily Egypt this should be new. It has no political or religious over or undertones its a straightforward show about paranormal investigations by a somewhat sullen college Professor with a incredibly dry sense of humor that began with an incident in his childhood that floods back because of a present event."
255,"This is the worst tv series i have ever watched in the last 10 years at least, I am a big fan of the novels which the tv series is based on them, it was very disappointing that these very successful novels gets transformed after all these years into visual media, with such bad directing, acting, visual effects, scriptwriting...etc.
Egyptians should be ashamed."
256,"It is the worst series I ever watched, very low script..... An ignorant series that calls for ignorance, and the characters have been distorted ... not related to anything of the novels of this series"
257,"I loved the direction, acting, production of this piece of work. The music score was superb and Amr Salama presented his work on international standards.
This is the first Egyptian work of this standard. Cannot wait to see upcoming season(s).
Well done production team.
The first episode placed the groundwork but could have used more finesse as used in later episodes.
I particularly liked the casting, very true to the characters and was nothing overly done.
Well done production team and cast."
258,Its just an overrated series....and people are creating hype...i dont know why...i gave up this show in episode 2
259,Great performance by Ahmed Amin. The concept is quite good. The overarching of the main story plot is great. Too much use of exposition and foreshadowing. CGI is rubbish. I hope next seasons will be better.
260,"I only watched the first two episodes. It was sort of nice, the main character is likeable but the story is nothing new really. The 'frightening' scenes were predictable. What I didn't understand: why does the main woman character have to wear this ridiculous wig? I mean when I saw the red-haired woman my very first thought was that her wig looks so unnatural. I think the other leading woman's hair was also a wig. I am not a hairdresser and I am not very interested in hairdos so I think this clearly shows how exiting the series is."
261,"Episode Four and the killing of a raped girl by her father simply because she had been raped. It sickens me that people of this culture think that is ok, and clearly they do because there is no attempt to show it as what it is. Murder. This shows stops for me, right here."
262,"I hope if there is a 2nd season, Netflix should change the whole cast, including the directors and the screenwriter, if they want the 2nd season to succeed and not be a total failure like the 1st season."
263,Not that good compared to the novel but it is a good start
264,"The series is good and it's the best of the Arabic world production but that doesn't mean it is the best!!!, sadly that means Arabs are way behind the world if we were very positive we might give it 6 starsthe soundtracks are amazing, camera movements and camera angles are good, even I wish to see more camera angles at the same scene, the story and the script itself is the true power of the work, but there are much weakness and disappointments in the graphics especially the ""Assas"" scene which obviously looks like cheap CGI, besides using Gorilla doesn't reflect the actual Arabic culture of desert horror mythology, the acting wasn't powerful, Ahmad Amain ""Rifat"" was unsuccessfully trying to deepen his voice toon wich make some scenes looks selly, the kids was way below convincing, although shiraz was very convincing on her death scene."
265,"One of the biggest issues I had with this show was the main character just looked to much like Groucho Marx! One kept waiting to hear ""say the magic word and the duck will come down!' She story lines were ok however that is compared to shows of the similar nature from the US or UK."
266,I was wondering how it would be possible to make our favorite books on TV for every myth there was maximum 10 draw pages to help you imagine how the ghost was so after watching the 6 episodes i think we have more to do with the graphics and the visual animation our imagination is better please make more seasons
267,"Based on the novel/s by Ahmed Khaled Tawfik (Beyond Nature). We follow Hematology professor Dr. Refaat Ismail as he explores unusual events in his life. In the book most of them turn out to be of super natural origins though quite a few are very much natural human crimes that take advantage of superstitions.Season one focuses on a supernatural tale interweaving it over several books. Discounting some really bad CGI in episode 4 this was a surprisingly good series. Ahmed Amin gave an amazing performance and there were quite a few sleeper performances from the side characters throughout.I watched this in english and sometimes the dub would slip and insert an arabic word here or there thinking it's a name like Yume when he is saying Mom or Nahyad when he means Nee-da, as in a call or cry for help.Overall the quality was impressive and I hope we get more of this series."
268,"Finally Netflix did something good
All cast perfect"
269,"Definitely not the best show to watch but sure it's worth watching especially if you are Egyptian , most of the actor did a great job except for few of supporting actors in small rules , the cinematography and the score are main elements in getting you immersed into the show's world , the stories are so compelling even though some are full of plot holes and poorly done , the script is one of the weaknesses here , why does it sound like it's poorly translated from English into Arabic?
Anyway .. it's a very enjoyable show and definitely recommend, but if you are a fan of the books it's good to manage your expectations and stop comparing between the two
Final words: Maggi's hair is terrible , it looks fake (I know it's but it shouldn't be that obvious)
And the color keeps changing evrey three minutes"
270,"I'm an Egyptian and I really wished Paranormal would have been better than this. Nothing new in the story, very slow pace, very poor graphics and and silly acting except for Ahmed Amin who tried as good as he could. Honestly Egyptian drama has presented way better productions. Netflix should've given us something better. Strongly disappointed."
271,I saw many episodes i can't complete the all season.
272,Easy watch over the weekend. Not bad. A bit boring at times.
273,"Everything was above my expectations , waiting for season 2"
274,"First let's start with the great preformance of Ahmed Amin (Refaat) and Samaa (Raefaa). It was a OUTSTANDING preformance.
Amin (Refaat) outdid himself.The storyline was good enough.
The cinematography was satisfied to me and very good especially at the last episodes.The soundtrack is MESMERIZING. Love it love it. One more again, I LOVE IT.It deserves just 8 of 10.
It is a great start to a great series. Don't be late on a second season."
275,"IT'S JUST THE START!Obviously, as Egyptians, we should be proud of this series that was released.
Unique despite any faults.
And to be more subjective, here is my review:
I wanted to give it 6 stars, the other two stars, one for choosing Ahmed Amin! Who surprised us all, Dr. Rifaat Ismail.
We haven't seen this aspect of acting from him before, so thank you, Amr Salama, for believing in this:"")
And the second star for being the first Egyptian series on Netflix.My 6 stars are for the cinematography, my eyes were more satisfied,
Colors, colors, colors.
The mood they put us in. It made me remember the feeling of watching Indiana Jones or we're on an adventure and we have to find the key with Rifaat Ismail to solve the mystery.
So yes, Good job and I'm very proud of this."
276,"How amazing to see this interesting series.
Waiting for 2nd season."
277,"Not bad according to what we used to see from Egyptian series usually but the Arabic and egyptian touch still there and easily noticed..
also Netflix clear goal to show as always ... atheism"
278,"It's pretty good show with few faults.
I like it but Egyptians are giving higher rate just because it's an Egyptian show.
They need to work on few things on season 2.
7/10 and by the way I'm Egyptian."
279,The best Egyptian series from years but i gave it 9/10 because of the graphic in Ep 03..I wish to watch season 2 and 3 and...
280,"Good work in terms of actors/actresses, locations choice, decorations and music, however the graphic effects specially for the monesters and ghosts could be better."
281,Ahmed Amin is a great actor proud of him. This series is a great milestone to Egyptian drama
282,"I loved this new take on the horror genre, it's always great to see something new in its ownThe cast is incredible the setup is perfect something you don't get often from the Arab worldI enjoyed the show and finished almost 6 hours over night watching it on Netflix"
283,"Best thriller egyptian series, waiting for more seasons"
284,"Every little detail is so perfect,, starting from the 60's decorations,styles, even the way of talking and all the actors are so perfect,, never seen something so pleasant as this"
285,I admire the story so loved the series and hope see all its seasons 👌👌
286,This series is one of the best What was produced by Netflix for short shows 💎
287,"Ahmed Amin has always proved that he will be a great actor, fantastic casting as well, and a very well made piece of art."
288,"I do not know that I enjoyed watching the first two episodes, but there is a fundamental change in the novels in many ways. The scenario, narration of dialogue, and events were not given their right at all, especially in the curse of the pharaohs. Much of the novel has been deleted, a severe shortening of it and a complete change of events"
289,I didn't expect that work will be beautiful like this.
290,The big break of Egyptian horror and a great start of Arabic drama on Netflix ..
291,"I read the books as a teenager and I always wanted to see them on screen. The adaptation is surely different in some way but the execution of the show is brilliant from every actor (especially Ahmed Amin), the director and the music composer. The best way to present Egyptian talents on Netflix platform and a very good show to enjoy."
292,"Good start hoping to get more of it soon.........
...."
293,I'm looking forward to other seasons of this show.
294,"My review won't be completely neutral, since I've read every single word Dr. Ahmed Khaled Towfik wrote throughout his life as an author.
Being the first Egyptian horror series to be universally published, this makes me happy.
The music is authentic and completely suits different situations there are.
The traditional Egyptian environment is created perfectly without any unnecessary extras or overrated decorations.
Actors are Pro's!! There's no fake eyelooks, no fake smiles.
Dr. Refaat is basically ""according to the novels"" a pessimist misanthropist who didn't believe in any supernatural that defies logic and religion. Ahmad Amin brilliantly empraced that character and I would watch this series over and over just to watch his acting.
Other actors were realy passionate and intimate wit the reality surrounding them.
I really hope several seasons to be out there soon 😍😍"
295,"I loved the show,the actors, the actresses, the vibe the effects, the music, and dramatic context the but the series dose not connect to the real story written by Ahmed Khalid twafik, there are many differences between the between the series and story but finally it is amazing show"
296,"The Egyptian actor AHMED AMIN and the EGYPTION director AMR SALAMA ,gave us the ultimate EGYPTION feeling for an original EGYPTION serie ."
297,I am a big fan of Actor Ahmed Amin and i am really glad Netflix started to make Egyptian movies. We have alot of talents in Egypt that need to go global 🇪🇬 🌍
298,That was a great vision to the novels i enjoyed the acting of ahmed amin and the direction of amr salama i joined netflix especially to ensure another season as amr salama advice the audience i hope this dreamy series for the arabic readers will last for many seasons
299,"Thanks netflix for letting this happened... the show is great and a very good start, the novels as well so amazing and still remains lots of novels that wait to be seen on the screen... waiting for a new season.... Ahmed Amin... good job..."
300,"Don't compare it to other shows, it's just a good start, however it's lacking special effects and it's not horror due to poor direction, I think all people behind that work tried to do their best, but I don't think they met the expectation we felt when we saw the trailer, may be the director and the whole production team will need to consider that success is a long way and they have to accept the fact that going global will put them in hard competition."
301,Very nice surprise! I loved it! it was nice to have an insight in fantasy and supernatural from Egypt!
302,"With its exotic setting in Egypt - this show stands head and shoulders over its competition.
. Wonderful acting, cinematography, and score. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show.
Folks who love Ghost stories or shows that are spooky rather than gory will love this show.
Sad it's only 6 episodes. I hope a second season is in the offing."
303,Overrated showThe story in ruined the original novel
304,"The show is a new start for the Egyptian shows. Ahmed Amin has nailed it. The show though, has a lot of defects and graphics are horrible but great cinematography and soundtrack.
I am sad how the rating is super high because a lot of Egyptian people voted 10/10 even before they watched it.
IMDb should have a different mechanism to rate movies and shows. Democracy isn't always the right way."
305,The best egyptian in the history mediaBest of the best
306,"I loved it
cast did a very good job
thanks Netflix for the opportunity"
307,"Extraordinary acting and a wonderful storyline, could have given it a 10 except for the graphics so 9/10."
308,"The series was good, but this rates and the reviews are overstatement, the Egyptians have come to consider it a national issue and rate it from several accounts 10/10, madness!"
309,"The plot, the directing and the actors are all fantastic ... But the visual effects and graphics were mediocre.
There are also some illogical lapses ... In the story, Lewis is a very significant character (as it turned out at the end) ... But he only appeared in one episode, with scenes that were modest.
And the beast (Alasass), which turned out to be an enormous gorilla!!, The rare flower and the Libyan tribe ...... They all live in an all-out wasteland, a desert without plants or water, and this isn't logical at all."
310,I want to see more sessions and more serious work like this
311,"Unfortunately.. I am one of the people who has lived my life reading and enjoying the novels by the novelist Ahmed KHALED Tawofek ..
And it was my first window to the horror passion..
And when I have heard about the series I was not expecting a lot from the director from our country
But ..
Sadden when I sow the sign of the NETFLIX ..
I became more enthusiastic to see the work
But with all the sad in my heart I sow that most of the graphics was self-destruct to the series
Music wonderful
Character perfect
Regardless of the change of the story
But really was the graphics and the choice for the creatures like ALSAAS AND LUCIFER"
312,"Sound and visual effects are the best. The sounds complete the thriller experience. Actors are 8 out of 10.The sisters 'Raaefa' acting was great! Her character depicts the typical sister and wife in Egypt. However, the storyline is weak and needs improvement. I felt like it was slow and boring at some point. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward in watching the next season. This is one of my childhood novels and it made me so thrilled when I read that netflix is going to produce it."
313,"I just want to know something
Why all the negativity in the reviews!
I mean it's the first of a kind as an Arabic series it's a new experience, it's understandable that it has some mistakes, EVERY SINGLE SHOW EVER CREATED HAVE MISTAKES!
But some people are just giving bad rating with unrealistic reviews!
I mean come on how is it predictable! And people comparing it to the novel ofcourse it's not gonna be a copy paste
I know everyone has his opinion but litterly some reviews are just ridicules"
314,"Between killer mistakes, poor graphics, and fluctuating performance from one episode to another, this series leaves you satisfied, really satisfied.
I guess it is the novel that leaves this influence and the clear devotion from the Director to keep the lead character as close as possible to the original script.
I really liked the sound track, the novel, the direction of Amr Salama in episodes 5 and 6.
Acting from Ahmed Ameen included overrated body language sometimes.
The female main character ""Magi"" was pale.
The second female character Huaida was well acted by Aya Samaha.
It is promising line of book-based horror from Egypt based on the legendary writer dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfiq.
Waiting for more..."
315,It's amazing and good story I'm very happy to see this work
316,"This is a good 6. Different, captures the 1960s good enough, fresh storyline but boring at times. Towards the middle you'll beg it to end quickly."
317,"At the time of writing this review, IMDB has this on as 9 with over 30,000 reviews.This just blows my mind! Almost as if we were watching a completely different show.I mean it's OK, reasonable acting and effects, script is OK but nothing special.We stopped after 4 or 5 episodes"
318,"Nothing interesting about this disappointing TV series. The director used ideas, words and characters from the most successful short stories for youth, and he totally messed it up, providing such low level of TV production, he should really look for a career change."
319,"I didn't watch Arabic contents a lot as they usually be very bad in some way or another but this one is just fabulous the acting was brilliant some episodes was not at the same level but it started strong and ended it strong also .. the 3th episode was the worst maybe 6/10 but the last episode maybe one of the greatest episode i saw.
I loved Ahmed Amiin (DR.refaat) , magi was great also but the one who take it to another level was raefa 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 I hated her and i loved her .. only great actors can make you feel like this."
320,"What a nice surprise. I didn't expect to like it so much. You should be careful it's not 100% like the books but a really nice version of them.
I can't wait for the next season
For those who will compare it to the books yay be you'll not like it. The only advice I can give to you is to forget what was written and to focus on the new version of the story"
321,My expectations wasn't that high when i first heard about it but they truly did a wonderful job the shots are amazing the music matches the scenes perfectly and all this balance delivers the perfect watching experience in my point of view thanks for reaching that level of professionalism
322,Well done waiting season 2 I like soundtrack acting story
323,"Totally a one of a kind egyptian series..................................................
Totally a one of a kind egyptian series.................................................. Totally a one of a kind egyptian series.................................................."
324,"The series is based on a series of horror and paranormal novels by famous Egyptian writer Ahmed Khalid Tawfik.Ahmed Amin who plays DR. Refaat Ismail, the main character, has done a great job bringing the character to the screen.The ambiance and general mood is captivating.A must see experience."
325,"This show is the first Egyptian title produced by Netflix, everybody know that. Chances are you don't know that this is the first Egyptian show produced American way, with one show runner leading a team of writers and directors. And yes, this means that all Egyptian shows are written entirely by one writer and directed by one director, wish I was making this stuff up.
Let's get the stuff I didn't like out of the way first: the special effects were really bad, computer generated imagery is not Egypt's entertainment industry's biggest strength, and I didn't expect a cooperation with Netflix to fix that, keeping the streaming service's track record.
the second weakness is that some of the child actors weren't ready for the scenes and episodes that almost entirely relied on their acting.
the third was the fact the way the myth of the naiad\ Naddaha was botched in episode four.
now, to the good things: the horror elements are great in some parts and meh in others. the adventure elements were great. the casting was right on point, and the acting was amazing. the cinematography is real art, like you can pose a certain scene, print it, frame it and hang it on your wall. the details of Cairo in the 1960s were taken very seriously and worked on very hard, not only the wardrobe and décor, but the tension caused by the political climate at the time.
there is some serious character development in the show, coming from the fact that all the characters are realistically flawed, including the lead character.
which leads to the greatest thing about the show, Dr Refaat Ismail, the protagonist, and his very deep, very funny, inner dialogue. Ahmed Amin was great in the rule.
lastly, this show is fun, if you like fantasy, horror and adventure, you'll like it even if you hadn't read a word of the late authors work. but if you are a fan of the source material and the author, you'll have more fun finding Easter eggs and hints.
I loved it, not as much as I love the book series, but I still love it"
326,Ahmed Amin good actor...but the director have many mistakes
327,"The CGI is sooooo bad.
Cinematography is really good"
328,Very Good series and. A great cast I really liked it
329,"The books were better, but it's still great.
Ahmed Amin just nailed dr Refaat.
I recommend checking the books in order to live the full experience."
330,I hope to watch a second season soon. Thanks to all the series makers
331,"Excellent actors
Excellent direction
Excellent written"
332,They truly surprised me with this one..Ahmed Amin is going out of his comfort zone (comedy) and going above and beyond.. Amazing I tell you
333,"Go ahead,we need another session
A wonderful Egyptian work, and a second part of it was necessary to continue and adequately work, which was produced in us by casting filth for society
Actively encouraged fresh need
Shabouh Amr Salama and of course the global Ahmed Amin
Greetings"
334,"The show is based on novels of one of the best novelists in arab world and who considered to be the first horror novelist in same region.
Paranomoral novels are widely known for generation x and z, considered to be top of their list.
Show is done in a very good way mixing novels and adding necessary drama scenes to fit the screen, which was a concern for many, but after watching the show found satisfactory.
Main role played by Ahmed fahmy is absolutely amazing, he made me see Refaat Ismail live talking, moving and even the look in the eyes I always imagined.
A promising start of such series and willing to see more seasons of it."
335,"This show is a dedication for every fan of the writer. It took us to that world again with most of the details just as we imagined them. The frames, the music, the script...just amazing.
Can't wait to see the rest❤"
336,"I just cried when i saw My beloved Dr.Refaat, thank you for making him real my childhood best friend .."
337,"First time to see good job like this , thank for every one participate in this work 💞"
338,"Beautiful and well done work, but I have a note that I hope will focus more on Dr. Rifaat Ismail, especially his comments and what is going on in his head."
339,"Good series really , i didn't expected that , bravo."
340,"Forget blood bath and sharp metals
And come to the true kind and real horror
The best arabic series Stephen king style with new flavor"
341,Worth to watch ... try and you never regret .. really good serues after so many years of disappointment.
342,This series is about novels by the great Egyptian writer Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq I still see him very good in his story and acting
343,"Paranormal is an Egyptian tv show based on a series of novels for Dr.Ahmed Khaled Tawfikif i want to talk about the positive things the acting of "" Ahmed Amin "" was 100% perfect and he could turn a written character to a real one , the cinematography was really good , there is a logical sequence of events , the editing of rules in each episode ( Merphy laws / Refaat Laws ) and refaat funny laws about almost everything , And the show succeeded in making us live the experience of fear, excitement and anticipationthe bad things that i didn't like is the CGI especially in episode 3 and how they made "" the guardian of the cave "" looks like , in some episodes there is details that you need to be really focused to see them or you will miss some parts , i understand that they wanted to put their touch on the story tut it made some of the footage incomprehensibleThe objective of the show is to turn this great story to a reality and let the fans live their childhood again with their favorite character "" Refaat Ismail "" , we can see that the directors and the writer didn't cover every single detail but focused on the most important things with their personal touch i mean they didn't literally turn the original text into an episode , they turned the idea of the myths into an episode but they deleted some details like in the myth of "" Shiraz "" it's kinda different in the novel but with same BIG DETAILS as the showSo i really liked this touch of merging the myths together so one myth follows the second one and that's what made the show really bingeable and i really recommend it"
344,Ahmad Amin is amazing .. and this job is new experience in Egypt ... Dr. Ahmad khaled Tawfik was great Novel writer
345,"The series is based on the Egyptian writer's novel ""Paranormal"" . . Ahmed Khaled Tawfeek the writer, died two years ago and the novel itself was written in 2006 and his dream was always to see this novel become a television show or artistic work .. As you see, his great work with netflix efforts gave us a great horror series with just 6 episodes in one season, and I'm definitely waiting for the second one .. thanks A.K Tawfeek
You can rest in peace now"
346,"Excellent tv series and novels hoping to see more. RIP Dr.Ahmed khaled tawfiq.
Nice acting and directing"
347,Good start but need updates and not some actors not giving any emotionally
348,Great Music .. Great Cast.. Great Director ... Amazing
349,"First: - The series is an artistic masterpiece in the sense of the word, and for the first time I see an Egyptian work so elaborate that there is no lengthening, boredom or dialogue without any need. Every word in the script has its place and value.Second: The performance of Ahmed Amin, who has proven that he can play roles far from comedy, an exceptional, distinctive and terrifying role.Third: The performance of Razan Jamal ""Maggie"" was distinguished and light on the heart.Fourth: The documentary music that added a state of perfection to the series, so that the events came out to us in an interesting way, and it was the share of Khaled Al-Kamar, who did the music of the Qabil series and the movie Sahib Al-Maqam.Fifthly: The whole form is directed by Amr Salama and Director Majed Al-Ansari."
350,"Great Series and amazing acting , I'm waiting season 2"
351,"I'm a fan of the novels series
Thanks Mr Amr Salama for this!
for bring the memories back
writing, music, soundtrack was truly Awsume
a great start ,Netflix has done a great job
hope to see aseason 2 soon"
352,"I'm a big fan of the writer Ahmed Khaled Tawfik , specially this series . generally the atmosphere puts you in suspense mixed with with horror and creates a state of wonder and curiosity ."
353,I loved to see Refaat Ismail on TV screens I also love Ahmed Amin in Refaat Ismail.all the details are incredibly awesome even if the episodes are not the same as the books we read but I believe there is no harm. It actually gives more suspense as you keep thinking how they are gonna make it!
354,"Already waiting for the second season, loved it.The acting, the sound effects, the story and of course the direction are unique.Don't waste any time on reading reviews, just go and watch it."
355,"Amazing shots, good characters and acting and pefect directing specially the last three episodes
Finally iam proud of amr salama and ahmed ameen 👌"
356,"By Netflix standards, this series is considered to be one of the best.The Acting was great especially Ahmed Amin. He did a great job in Refaat Ismail role, his dark sense of humor was the best.The soundtracks are amazing.The cinematography is great - just like every other Netflix original (They care too much about it that their shows almost have the same cinematography) .The plot of the episodes can't be considered separately, cause if we rate every episode on its own, they have a lot of flaws, but the plot as a whole is amazing.I'd love to see more of the old man's adventures.RIP Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfik"
357,It is completely fantastic. The music is very good
358,"I loved the direction, acting, production of this piece of work. The music score was superb and Amr Salama presented his work on international standards.
This is the first Egyptian work of this standard. Cannot wait to see upcoming season(s).
Well done production team.
The first episode placed the groundwork but could have used more finesse as used in later episodes.
I particularly liked the casting, very true to the characters and was nothing overly done.
Well done production team and cast."
359,"Overrated show ,,
PLEASE Egyptian fans it is not a fight 😆😆
and for the show i found it a bad collection
a very fake and poor acting from the lead actor ,,"
360,Deserve more than it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
361,I wasn't sure if it will be as great as people in reviews said or not but once i saw episode one it pulled me deep in the story Makin me so excited to know what will happen next
362,"Absolutely fantastic , enjoyed every minute of it and waiting season 2 asap."
363,"I did read all the 81 novels the show is based on more than one time but its clear rhe show is not follwoing the books but its kinda of based on the books.
This is not bad as it was going to be boring if every thing is the same and I know every single detail.
Acting was ok and Ahmed Amin tried his best( he is a big fat for the real character) but overall good enough.
I was surprised with Maggie acting, I thought no one can do Maggie but this was also nice acting enough.
What I did not like is the fast conversion if main hero point of view, just after first 2 epsiodes Refat Ismail already believe in the magical herb.
Also all these Refat laws was a but too much.
I really wish it had more stories not just 5.
There was some classic momemts from the novels and I was so impresed with watching them on the screen like Refat never ending poem to Maggie or how Refat was making fun of the flowers in the tie he got as present.
Looking forward for season 2 hopefully with more topics like Hin Tsue Kan."
364,"The first episode was a pleasant surprise. Mixing humorous dialogue with some genuine scares, but it went downhill from the second episode onward. Veering towards fantastical elements instead of the promised premise of horror. Sad to see how it turned out, really had so much potential"
365,It's not Egyptian It's cultural colonization aka Netflix and shill
366,Really enjoyed this series and hoping they will roll this out to s2. Cinematography is excellent and really loved the time period it was set. Wonderful Egyptian series! Interesting mini stories with an overall plot that weaves it together nicely.
367,"I liked the show because it is the first Egyptian show on Netflix and it has a better directing, acting and story compared to the most Egyptian shows. but I think that it would be better if they worked on its weaknesses in the next seasons. Firstly, they should have a better graphic designer because the graphics are so poor. Moreover, the main character is so depressed without a valid reason and shows zero fear emotions towards the paranormal actions which separated the character from the story, so I think that Ahmed Amin should balance his emotions more than that. Finally, the writers cant depend only on the novel because it was written for kids and if they are planning to target more audiences, they should increase the horror tune.
Anyway, This project made me feel better about the future of the Egyptian cinema."
368,Great story and I actually enjoyed it and the acting was good not the best though but pretty bad CGI but its okay for a start of something new in Egypt
369,"For an arabic show Great scenes and high-quality cinematography, the story and dialog is not that great. full of plot holes"
370,"The series is based on a series of novels by the late Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq. The novels have an enormous popularity among the youth born in 1970s and 80s, as they were issued mostly during the 1990s. This popularity explains much of the very strong reaction of the Egyptians to this series.The series is very good and pleasant in general. The cinematography and music are the most enjoyable. Ahmed Amin who played the main role passed with excellence. Other actors/actress vary much. I loved the performance of the main character's sister; the actress is superb.CGI is the worst element of the production. If there will be a second part of it, there must be enhancement to this element.The writing is the second worst element; except for the parts adopted as is from the novels.In general, it worth watching and very good start... looking for next part :-)"
371,"The original story written by Dr. Tawfik is special for many who have grown up reading them. The most important pillar of the stories is Dr. Refaat Isma'il, the haematologist who is fed up with everyone around him, and is bored from how they are all expected. His continuous sarcasm of himself and people around him is what attached most of the readers to the written stories.
Unfortunately, it is hard to translate cultures, and turning the stories into a unique scenarios would have required a bigger team of writers or the presence of the original author who unfortunately have passed away two years ago.
Luckily, the director and the main actors are fans and friends of Dr. Tawfik, and the whole work was a fulfilment for a promise Amr Salama (The director) made to Dr. Tawfik in 2015 that he would turn his work into an artwork that competes with international set pieces.
I think that the work is the best possible presentation (but not representation) for the novels. It wouldn't have been easy to present the book without the budget of Netflix.
However, the writing needs to be improved. It's hard to translate cultures, but with a bigger team to write and with Salama being more flexible to comments and new ideas. I am concerned that Salama might be emotional in his steering of his work and taking it personally ( which is his right by the way) which will hinder the smooth transformation."
372,"I have to admit i didn't have high expectations for this since that I'm not a big fan of the showrunner Amr Salama, i watched most of his work and I can't say i hated it any of his previous projects but i certainly didn't love them, all of them lied in the good but not great area,he always does a good job but there's always something missing and i have to say Paranormal isn't necessarily different.
The cinematography and the music are so captivating they play an important role in the overall experience but the acting from Ahmed Amin carries the show for me, he's my favorite part of the show although I think the supporting character were underused they didn't didn't have enough screen time that made some of the emotional scenes a bit underwhelming.The series can be divided into 2 parts the first 3 episode are the set up and the last 3 episodes are the payoffThe first 3 episodes are the worse part, the first episode was good but the second and the third episode are just weird and the CGI in the 3rd episode was honestly laughable and there were some directing mistakes in the 3rd episode that i don't how did they allow that to happen, maybe the CGI was bad but it's not the CGI fault to have Gorilla in the desert, it was a weird creative choice that makes no sense the 3rd episode overall is the weakest episode out of the 6Horror wise the 4th and 5th episodes are the best ones, they also had the perfect balance between the drama and the horror they had some really good moments and great acting by the supporting cast and Ahmed Amin.The last episode was very good and it made me wanting another season of this series that i think it's a matter of time until Netflix renew it.this is not the haunting of hill house rip off, this is different. These are Egyptian stories and Egyptian myths and I'm glad that this show exists and I'm glad that Netflix gave Salam the freedom to do it in his own way, this is a good start for more True Arab projects led by Netflix and maybe thst will open the window for the another big network to do something like this in the future."
373,"The show is great, first of its kind in Egypt and the Arab world
The photography and the sound effects are amazing
Acting is super great and exactly like the novels we used to read
Great job Nitflex"
374,The acting and music are extraordinary beautiful but still many ironic mistakes like any other Egyptian products.
375,"Whoever you are, wherever you are, & whenever you watch it, you will find a line somehow touches inner sides of your entity."
376,"Finally, a masterpiece by Egyptian hands, we were so far away from the competition although we possessed it for so long, between 1970~2000 we had a cinema witch was as strong as Hollywood and after those twenty years of creation poverty, we are here again with perfect actors and filmmakers, and we will always be here..."
377,"Ok I'm going to read the novel because what I saw is very good stores and I am sure that the novel have more like this, the acting was great especially from Mohamed Amen , the districting was nice, CGI not good in 80% of the scenes , The image was perfect and pure ,Good music, but Overall it was an very very good experience and I would definitely want to see it again and by the way, the ending is great ."
378,"I never thought I would love an Egyptian series specially that they took it from a written book for a the best writer Dr.Ahmed Khaled tawfeek. It's a must watch series it's a must watch series. wonderful acting, and wonderful scenes. It's a masterpiece."
379,"One of the best series I have ever seen I don't see any flaws in the series, except for slow events"
380,"Cgi is very very bad and actress is very cold
There are illogical things in the sequence of events"
381,"Ahmed Khalid Tawfik. The author of the original novel series that is called paranormal. The books that this tv series is based on is one of the greatest and most admired writers between the Arabic readers . The novels is unique and greatly admired and loved . Dr Refaat Ismail is a special kind superhero to millions of Arabic and Egyptian youth and kids and old folks . The TV series here is just a great nostalgic story adaptation of a five of his great novels . The series is ok . But it is not the best that could be done based on that strong story lines . The mix and the changes made on the original story lines make it a little weak , interrupted, unacceptable sometimes. Acting is good but this not Dr Refaat that we live in the novels . Music and cinematography was good . Two different directors is a bad idea . . Graphic is poor. Overall the series is a good start but I hope if there will be a second season please stick to the original story ."
382,Netflix has done a great job of showing the novel the best way and The actors adapted the character in a unique way and Young director Amr Salama has proven that he has great talent Don't miss the first season and wait for the second season

398,"The show was just released and i finished because i honestly think it's a masterpiece, Imagine one of the best novels turning into tv show, I was sure netflix will do it right, when they first announced the cast i wasn't so sure about Ahmed Amin but he proved the exact opposite within the first episode. This show totally deserves 10/10 and i would like to see a fanbase which is not from the middle east."
399,"It's so fantastic..

407,Something really worth watching great acting and sound effects also good story
408,"There's no such a thing called paranormal!
Well , but I was ? An idiot!! Yes
The most used word by Refat Ismail -our hero-.
Ahmed amin is an amazing actor.
Dr Ahmed Khaled Tawfik , your dream has been true.
We loved it and it was so surprising because we grew up on the Pocket Novels and now we can watch our hero Refat talk in real life not in our heads.
We hope the best for the cast and the director of course and the genius, the groom of tonight, Dr AHMED KHALED TAWFIK."
409,"What an absolutely amazing job, I loved this amazing work, and I am proud as an Egyptian to see work like this up on Netflix. I invite all my friends to watch the series. I would like to thank the employees behind this series, starting with the director Amr Salam, the talented actor, the wonderful writer Ahmed Amin, and the rest of the participants, and we do not forget the great late Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq, the author of the wonderful novels from which I am inspired by the script of the series. Thank you for this wonderful work."

412,Highly recommended. I really enjoyed watching it. It's very unique.
413,"Just finished watching season one from this interisting series me and some of my friends here in Sweden , our advise don't let the language barrier stop you from watching this .
Acting and characters building is superb . It is a decent and well done Mystrey/Horror show . One of the finest we have seen on Netflix infact.
Can't wait for season 2 ."
414,Proud to be Egyptian master piece. Good acting and good story from great book. Waiting for another seasons.
415,But It needs to increase some details of the supernatural also the occurrence of more blood spread and the loss of some characters
416,"That tv series is such an incredible work, great job everyone"
417,"A heart sieres, looking forward to season 2. Actors performance, music, scenes, casting are much better than any one could have imagined."
418,"Its the most perfect arabic show i ve ever seen, the soundtrack the suspense every thing is perfect"
419,"Amazing, i hope there will be a part 2 of this masterpiece ❤"
420,"My husband and I absolutely binged this show. The storytelling is fantastic and has you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is more than worth the watch. It will make you cry, laugh, and wonder what's going to happen next at every moment. Just watch it. If you're on the fence, just do it"
421,We need second sessionWe need second sessionWe need second sessionThank you
422,"I like the main characters, story and narrative but the CGI was a no go for me, the gorilla scene made me cringe so much, though netflix is the main producer and weve seen better CGI on things like the haunting series but IDK whyd they stop on this one and go for the worst CGI"
423,"Very nice ,except few minutes specialty the Cgi scenes blew avarge , may due to high cost , but over all very good 8/10"
424,I wasnt sure that Egyptian Drama can make such a professional masterpiece
425,"An acting beyond imagination, an untold production, a great Egyptian work!"
426,"The series Very nice , but i don't like episode #5 , The industry is very bad ( devil ) , My kids Halloween costume is more scary than it
The series just need more scary devil not stupid devil look like made in home"
427,"This show is enjoyable to watch but i cant give it more than that. Some episodes were boring and got me to sleep and some were really good, the main actor did a great job, he is just the greatest aspect of this show. The cinematography is fairly good. The GFX was obviously bad in some episodes. The music score is just great. At the end this show is just overrated. Its not bad and its not that great too but definitely a good try."
428,"The middle east has not this type of horror drama, because of this this is a new experiment in Arabic drama.
Graphics 2/10,
Story 6/10,
Acting 6/10,
Experiment 8/10,
Script 6/10."
429,"While I enjoyed Paranormal, the lead character Recast, caused me to only rate it a 6/10.
His sheer stubbornness to adhere to scepticism, constantly causes problem after problem, that he refuses to learn from. But other than that, it's well worth a watch."
430,Very excited horror mixed with drama.
431,Very Nice series ans recommended to watch it. Very Nice series ans recommended to watch it
432,"Thes series is compatable with my immagination of persons in the book series of the greatist auther (the godfather) of our generation dr. Ahmed khaled tawfik
Thanks amr salama
Thanks ahmed amin for his great acting our hero dr. Refaat ismaeil"
433,"I recommend you watch it
I Loved this series good start for egyptian"
434,It's wonderful Ahmed Amin's acting is amazing And the director was fine The end was legendary I recommend watching it
435,"I wish if this tv show could last forever! The music, the directing, the acting, okay I can mention all these things and keep writing FORVER!I will just talk about how details made this show amazing, small details that even the smallest insect in the show can make a difference, so don't miss details!I never believe in paranormal activities or dreams coming true or anything, however; this show is still amazing, cause it's not just another silly horror show, but real art!Personally, I would prefered if they would leave a door open for probability of no paranormality, however; this door looks like getting opened in the upcoming seasons, I'M WAITING!"
436,"1st Ep I was about to quit watching , but later I found that I'm one of the crew acting with them100% perfect"
437,"I'm mindblown how all of this was produced, all the details that were taken of. This is definitely a great tribute to the author of the novel who made a great story for all of us to read, and now to watch. The visuals/sounds were beyond thrilling too, they made me feel very engaged whilst watching it. The actors depicted their roles unquestionably in the best manner possible, kudos for the director for choosing such a talented cast. Can't wait to see you again Dr. Refaat Ismail!"
438,"A great beginning for stories worth reading for the greatest writer, Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq, may God have mercy on him... The series is excellent"
439,"Loved it hope to see second season soon
was a great egyption work"
440,"In all honesty, I do not like Arab works, but this series, which exceeded all my expectations, was wonderful and distinctive and was beautiful and I strongly enjoyed watching the joy beyond description The role of the actor Ahmed Amin is wonderful in everything, his voice and movement, his look at the camera, his expressions are very beautiful.❤"
441,The series is very good as the actors in a little while if we can make the series is very nice and helpful for us
442,"I was amazed. The screen play, the dialogues, the story everything was just good about this. I expect a season 2 for this."
443,Final 3 episodes was great nothing can describe this piece of art.
444,"In my childhood, I kept reading only comic books for some time till I knew of a book publisher that can translate to ""The Egyptian novels that can be put in your pocket"". The books were designed in a way where you can put in your pocket and have the chance to read anywhere and anytime. The books were classified in series. So, there was a series called: ""The impossible man"" which was an Egyptian agent who was very talented, very strong, very smart, very everything. Another series called: ""The file of the future"", which was a science fiction series focusing on a group of young men and ladies in the future solving mysteries related to advanced technology. Another series was called ""Flowers"" focusing on romantic stories, etc.This was nearly the first time I started breaking the barrier of reading a book end to end without pictures. What was common between all these series is that they were very exciting, breath taking and really addicting. But they were also focusing on giving a positive role model to the youths. So, the main characters were usually brave, faithful and eager to protect others.This really had a good impact on me as a child and then as a teenager. I liked a lot watching tv and going to the movies, but reading these series took me to another level. It was a portal to different worlds enriched my imagination and sense of beauty and values.In 1993, they decided to publish a new genre for the first time: Horror. The series was called ""Paranormal"". I was not into horror. So, I kept reading the other genres for a while, till fate intervened and I had the courage to read it. The first thing I noticed was that the main character was not the typical character I used to in other stories.Refaat Ismail is a doctor who is old, thin, bald, heavy smoker and has a weak heart! He's more of an anti-hero type. Refaat is the main narrator of the stories. He speaks to the reader directly sharing terrifying memories of his past. The stories are not fast paced like the other series. There is here more space of quiet moments, but tense is always in the air. No bombs, no laser guns nor cars being exploded. The story always starts in an ordinary pace. You get to see Refaat having his tea, listening to classic music, going to college as a professor or travelling to conferences around the world.There is always a chance where Refaat expresses his thoughts of life and quoting other writers, thinkers and philosophers. The horror or the metaphysics were just the frame. What really touches me is the small stories in the background. They were beautiful and unforgettable. The other thing is that Refaat Ismail is so sarcastic. I always laugh out loud when he talks and interacts with other people. When I read in a place where my friends are around, it looks so weird when I break the silence with laughter! They always wonder what could be that funny in a horror novel!At the end of each book, there is a section where Refaat talks to his readers and replies to their letters. They also sent to him some poems or short stories that they have written, and he (Refaat) shared them with us and commented on them.As time passed by, I got involved more with Refaat. He accompanied me every summer during my travels. Lots of my memories with Refaat are associated either on my way in the bus from Cairo to out of town, or with a gentle breeze in the balcony with mint tea. He was a faithful friend during high school. He empathized my struggle during college and gave me the warm comfort I needed.The author (Ahmed Khaled Tawfik) was able to work on other series too, which were also amazing, but Dr. Refaat Ismail had a special bond with the readers.So, knowing that the show was to be directed by a talented director as Amr Salama, released by Netflix, and Dr. Refaat to be portrayed by the amazing Egyptian actor Ahmed Amin; This was like a dream come true to many readers in Egypt and the Arab world!A lot of readers were skeptical of how this project will be able to translate this heritage to the big screen. In my opinion, most of adapted movies/series face the same fear from the loyal book readers, even for excellent adaptations like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. I had faith in Amr Salama, and he didn't disappoint me.The TV series succeeded in several levels: Paranormal Themes: More than 80 books of the Paranormal book series were published. They were diving into several mythologies and metaphysical themes. The focus of the tv show was on 5 themes only, told in 6 episodes. This was a smart move in my opinion, as it gave the show creators more focus on the other aspects.Storyline: The story does not exactly match the books. It instead combined the five chosen paranormal themes into one big story. This frustrated many faithful readers, but again I see this was necessary, as the viewers in 2020 are in favour of more intertwining drama and complex relations, rather than standalone ""Monster of the week"" structure. The story was moving from one myth to another smoothly with a bigger plan in mind on how to connect them together.Visuals: If the aim of adapting the books was just for the visuals, then I am totally in! The visuals were...stunning! Each scene was perfectly crafted. If you randomly click pause in any episode (especially the first one), you will percept a piece of art, that you can print out to decorate your living room! This takes us to the fact that horror in this series was more into the gothic style with its mix of beauty, charm and fear! There were still some gore and jump scare moments, but the main theme was biased to prettiness. The CGI, on the other hand, was not up to the level expected. I am hoping this would improve in future seasons.Acting: Ahmed Amin is a well-known Egyptian comedian. Doing a complex character like Dr. Refaat might seem a challenge to who knows Amin. However, I was optimistic that he can do it, and I was right! Amin was able to summon the character's soul from the books and visualize it as I imagined it to be. His walk, his smoking, his sarcasm, his dark blue suit that makes him charming (by the way, this is one of the famous quotes in the books!). Some people did not like that Dr. Refaat in the tv series seemed insecure and depressed, while in the books he was calmer and more confident. My defense would be that the tv series chose to tell the story through the struggle between being a man of science and the supernatural elements he's facing that he's not able to explain. This struggle is relevant to the era we live in, where the scientific thinking prevails and human's arrogance debates that everything is clear and well explained. I think the show tried to state that there is a lot that we do not know or realize out there in this universe. Most of the other actors were also very good. I would give a special greeting to Refaat's sister Raefa and his brother Reda. This might need another article to talk about how awesome they were.Soundtrack: The soundtrack is just brilliant. It has its own character among the show. I like the fact that some of the characters (especially the creepy ones) had their own theme, which was so good! I am actually listening to it right now!I know Dr. Refaat Ismail since 1996, and I kept reading his stories till it ended in 2014. Dr. Refaat means a lot to me. So, seeing him on screen makes me really happy and proud as if I am the one who worked on this project! I really hope for a next season soon."
445,"Really enjoyed with all episodes, the story and sound effects are amazing.
Waiting for season 2"
446,I haven't watched the whole show but from what I have seen It's not that great and it gets worst with each episode so I'm not looking forward to what's next.
447,"I just saw the first episode of the series and i like it i actually don't understand the toxic reviews on the series we know that it doesn't have that great cinematography because it's the first series of it kind but it will evolve in the future and this is the first step for the Arabic and specifically the Egyptian series to actually be good, SO STOP THE HATE PLEASE."
448,"First, Ahmed Amin proved that he is way much better than lots although he is a comedian actor but in this situation he was an outstanding dramatic with dark comedy actor.Second, As the directing from Amr Salama It was very good, I never saw an arabic show with this techniques, Some shots were confusing a little bit, but overall the conversion of a novel into screenplay and present it this way was very good,
I have an idea of this that Amr Salama didn't do a lot of shocking (silly kick up horrifying scenes), he injected the horror with thrill and mysterious scenes and talks.Third, Smooth and perfect soundtrack, we cannot argue with this.Fourth, The period could me a little much longer to gain more details, sometimes I felt there were a fast shifting between two events or I was lost for a moment due to lack of time or fast explanation, a little extension would have been beneficial.Fifth, actors casting was good, some of characters introductions were too early,
as an example ""Maggie"", I felt like she didn't have a real impact until the 3rd episode, She was just there to inject the romance part only!
The too much spotting on her on the first 2 episodes were somehow pointless.
Drama scenes from all the cast were really perfect with smooth and intelligent effort.Sixth, Editing was average and Graphics were bad.Seventh, Cinematography was outstanding, it was from the strongest points that made this show a better standard.Overall strongest points were the Acting, Cinematography, Soundtrack and Directing."
449,"This show is an amazing journey in terms of characters, acting, music, cinematography, script and story. I wish they've done more episodes and can't wait for season 2.
Visual effects needs major improvement, but there weren't many of them any way."
450,"Paranormal offers an enthralling experience of drama, horror, and psychology yet in fresh perspectives leveraging its rich Egyptian origins as well as best-selling novels.It especially excels in cinematography and soundtracks but clearly lacks in CGI and some plot devices which might seem too convenient at times. It however leaves you excited for more ""myths"".A ""10"" mainly because it is the first Egyptian production of such quality, meaning it had to overcome a lot of obstacles and barriers to achieve this."
451,I see it's a great start for us and deserves support 💙
452,The series is very good because it is one of the first series on the Netflix platform
453,Everything is great liked the actors and everything we need more parts for
454,"A great performance by Ahmed Amin and the rest of the cast, directed by Amr Salama, and Dr. Ahmed Khaled remains the best horror writer on the planet."
455,"So as a start I didn't have the chance of reading the books so my opinion is solely focused on the show..+++Ahmed Amin as Refaat Ismaeel was great acting wise and voice over (physical acting wasn't as great, like him handling the axe or falling off the ladder)
+++cinematography was top notch
+++The score by Khaled Alkammar was phenomenal and catchy
++Secondary characters were great especially Raeefa and RedaCGI wasn't that great at some times like in the third episode (would have been better if there were more reliance on practicalEffects)
-Motion effects and lighting were off alot of times also editing was bad at times.
Dramatic aspect of the story was under-utilised in the first half of the seasonAll in all a solid start to a promising show, definitely grants a second watch and hopefully a second season."
456,Us bank account and I have a few questions about the blue one is the one I was looking for a few days and I have a few questions about the blue one is the
457,"First Egyptian drama production one of the best series I watched highly recommended
I fell in love with the characters"
458,"It is breathtaking and really nice, Ahmed Khaled Tawfik wrote an astonishing novel, And it was well replicated into a nice series with really nice graphics and great editing.
I really loved it!
Definietely recommend it!"
459,"I wish no one would see the seasoned person in the air, and no one would catch every word just because it was an Egyptian Arabic series Amr Salama (director of the series) came to Astori and said that this is the first season of it This means that in many seasons there are many, and indeed it was a very promising start from the terrible positive opinions that praised every need about the series, acting, decor or influences. We must go and do it I missed ten / ten, even if you like it, it can be transferred even if you like it. It can be transmitted by large works of art and the series includes representatives from different Arab countries. I would like to encourage them to see from this many because Arab cinema will finally compare and transgress the foreigner for a certain time."
460,Everything is almost perfect...Ican' t believe it is an Egyptian series ...the music here incredible ...the director did amasterpiece
461,Every Thing is amazing in this tv show wow icant wait for second season i needed right now
462,"Amazing serial to watch
I love it so much and I'm waiting the next season"
463,"A great start from Netflix for Egyptian production is a wonderful series in everything, romantic horror, even comedia, beautiful, and ideal performance from all Actors , especially Ahmed Amin"
464,"As expected, it was a wonderful experience. Ahmed Amin is appropriate for the role and he Give an unforgettable performance. I hope that the coming seasons will be better, or at least on the same level."
465,It is one of the most amazing works I have ever seen
466,"Great series with some mistakes especially in third episode with bad CGI. They tried to cover
the bad quality with making the scenes dark."
467,"Before writing my opinion of the series I should consider the following:
1. The series is based on a novel so you will find some variations in expectations from the readers.
2. The series is Egyptian.
3. Ahmed Amin is known as comedian, it is 1st series out of his scope.I liked the series very much, I watched all the series at once. I never read the series but I love Ahmed Amin and Amr Salama. In general, I did not had any expectations, however, It met my ambition to look forward for the rest of series.Ahmed Amin has proofed once more time that he is a comprehensive artist, can do any sort of work. Amr Salama has also proofed that his work is very professional and has a special taste. I loved the cast and the roles fits the characters.So why 8? Because I wanted more thriller. The series have some parts a little bit slow. I also wanted something to take my breath out, might be more faster rhythm. I know it is very hard with someone like Dr. Refaat Esmail, however, but that what I see from my view.By any means, great start and great effort from Ahmed Amin to catch the character and convince people that he is not only a comedian.Please, publish the music of the series as soon as possible, I loved it."
468,"Wow it was amazing , can't wait for the 2nd season"
469,It's a successful start for the arabic products in netflix i wish to see more in the following years
470,"Can't wait for season 2
Proud of this Egyptian series"
471,"As a reader for the original series,i did not expect these fantastic series,it takes you to a new Arabic level if drama to match the top levels in drama ,thanks NETFLIX and all the cast for this entertainment,waiting for season 2"
472,This show sits the par really high for other productions in the future
473,"Tbh i haven't read the books yet but the show is very good and the acting was amazing, pretty good for the first Egyptian netflix show."
474,"He was so deep in the character. The way he moves, talk everything is perfect in acting !"
475,Very good story new ideas very good music depend on a great story books written by the godfather of the arab youth Dr Ahmed khaled Tawfiq
476,"Really well written and acted, with a good story and characters. This is everything horor story should have been"
477,"After watching the 6 episodes I can say it's a good one somehow it made me excited but few things I have noticed
First, visual effects not good in some scenes and good in another so it was confusing how it could be!!! So if you can make a good visual effects why not continue the whole series the same way, for example without spoiling the show episode 3 was very poor in visual effects at the same time the girl from the lake was very good so it's really confusing, kinda it feels like there are 2 designers working on the project, one is good and the other is amateur 😂.
Second point is rating and reviews kinda I feel the egyptians or Arab ppl are trying so hard to raise the rating as if it's a competition or something which is really so funny or silly will be the right expression 😅😅
So overall I think it's a good one especially the music was really great, I noticed some rumours about second season so if it true hopefully they will fix visual effects, cheers."
478,I really loved the show and the environment of the 60's in Egypt except for the bad CGI the gorilla was so funny but i think it's because the low budget i hope they can improve and develop the CGI in season 2
479,"There are good aspects to this show. Certainly more than the bad aspects.The story was decent. The character of Dr.Kamal provides some comic relief via his interactions with Dr.Refaat. Maggie and Howaida are both stunningly beautiful. The settings are also nice.The CGI was extremely horrible. Like extremely. The lead character's chain-smoking is very off putting. If the lead character was supposed to be extremely irritating then the actor portraying him has done a good job of making the audience hate him.All in all, a good attempt and a decent watch. If there is a Season 2, I really wish they make Dr.Refaat likeable. At least a little.And please, for heaven's sake, upgrade the VFX!!!"
480,"Everything is great, even the soundtrack. The performance was great and the cinematography was very nice"
481,Its good but not the best thing can give to us.... Keep in mind its the first Tv show from egypt in Netflix
482,"For an Egyptian, I'm obviously proud of that production. But putting that aside objectively, the storyline is inspired by comics that we read as kids and masterfully implemented on the screen.The cinematography and scene transition are very artistically executed with authentic sound effects from Egyptian folklore made this production a spooky one, but that's what horror is about, isn't it?Regardless of few goofs that don't suit the time period in regards to building constructions and costume design but the overall is very good.I recommend more scrutiny to the stories chosen for the second part and possibly a bit of scene variety and enhancement of CGI effects.Great effort from the cast, thank you for an enjoyable experience."
483,Lamping to The Sofa for the story about all the magi is make person to can't wait the next ep!!!
484,Good for our first attempt at producing this kind of art as Egyptians
485,"It is very very good i was so excited
Waiting for the second season"
486,"Some episodes are better than others, but overall it's a pretty good show however, I think it could be a lot better"
487,"I didn't expect that , but to be honest this series will remain the best thing I've ever seen since years . I highly recommend it to everyone."
488,"For sure my review is biased to the series,
But I must record my proud and happiness to see my childhood characters come to life today,
First of all when I see the owl in the opening I start to cry and crying continue during this episode, I remember my childhood, good memories with the paranormal original story, I remember Dr Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq and I think he is proud now,
I gave full mark to all the elements of the series except the performance of the children they appear classy and can't cope with the era.Ahmed Amin was very good but I think dr Refaat had more sarcastic character and you show that he was hesitated character or defeatist
He wasn't
But overall bravo 👏🏾 👏🏾👏🏾"
489,He was not convincing ... the actors' actions were not convincing ... How could he smoke in the middle of the meeting? How can his fiancée run in the middle of the street and not hide at the seller ... or he gives the guard money to bring him a cigarette ha ha ha ...
490,"The series is good mixture of horror , mystery, love story and story> screenplay is good and lighting effect is super."
491,Great job ahmed amin for start in netflix i hope i can see more egyptian shows in future
492,It was very good season as a first egyptian Netflix compination and the the story was perfect but the graphics and CGI was under average i think that is the worst thing so in other seasons it should be improved well
493,"A good show, an interesting story, Ahmed Amin the main character is just an amazing actor. The soundtracks are beautiful.
BUT
The direction is horrible, I mean it's a Netflix production, did they not provide enough money to get some quality CGI?
Also the director is missing the last touch, for example, in the 3rd episode when dr. Refaat light the dynamite to blow up the cave and then hear Maggie screaming so he decided to turn off the flare it doesn't show that this is what he wanted because of the bad direction!!
I could go on and on about this bad direction, if Netflix decides to produce another season I think they should go with a more professional directors."
494,"Good solid start of a new promising new horror/mystery show.I was surprised I didn't expect that I can watch an Egyptian tv show and make me feel amazed with how excellent everything was first from acting - cinematography - score. Personally, my favourite episodes are 5/6. I am waiting to season 2."
495,I hope it's as perfect as novels. Wish we still have Dr.Ahmed among us to witness his masterpiece .. only my complain is the cgi need to be better in the next season ..
496,Absolutely a surprise for me and for everyone to see an Egyptian TV show with this story and this quality
497,Doctor refaat is super hero with no super power only super mind
498,"The cinematography, the acting and the mysic are awesome
But the cgi is not good tbh"
499,"Different and perfect one.
Of course there are some mistakes but the greatness of the series make you forget anything.
Ahmed amin was really good and others actors were good too.....but who really great is ahmed Khalid twfik he is overthinking and crazy"
500,"Great start for a new Era of egyptian series, one of the best plots, actors are significant specially Ahmed Amin who is well know as a comedian in Egypt and surprisingly he shows up here as a perfect dramatic actor which is a huge turnover, original stories from egyptian traditional Myths"
501,"FYI; I'm not a fake review and I am not Egyptian.I really liked the show. Suspense, story, acting.
It wasn't horror, rather than drama thriller but regardless it never failed to deliver.
The main actor is a comedian and you still can tell by his dark comedy throughout.
There were some mistakes and unrealistic moments, but hey this is a big step for the Egyptian TV shows in the horror genre!Well done & Keep up the good work."
502,Good start for actor Ahmad Amin .. we are waiting for the next seson
503,"It's a big step for Egyptian and arabic horror tv show.The cinmagroph and direction was very good .
The CGI was a little bit poor . They can make it better specially in episode 3 .It can't be compared with famous horror series but as the second experience in global network as an Arabic horror series.
It based on Arabic methodology so some myths will not be familiar for non arab people.It worth to watch so you can give it a chance."
504,"The main protagonist charmed the socks out of my family with his witty dark humor and sarcasm. The actor himself in a more serious setting surprised me by doing very well. The cinematography is on par with good international production which makes the watching experience as an Egyptian more exciting.
The set design is my favorite part of the show, even though some of the external scenes I feel could have been a bit more detailed as they felt lackluster. The Khadrawy Manor both pre and post ruin was wonderful.
Some of the scenes felt forced this was in part because of some inexperienced acting. For example the"" Naddaha "" made me cringe with her arm movements while calling for ""Refaat"". Her whole placement was off, You would expect her to look drenched as she only appears from bodies of water, but they settled for the easier route which could have been improved.
The wigs were HORRIBLE I hated noticing them seriously where is the scalp? There is literally no scalp visible which made it look like a cheap party wig took me out of the scene.
Then comes the elephant (or should I say the gorilla) in the room which is the vfx. As a person who is in animation and motion design. I know how are it actually is to produce a 3D object inside a scene. Great color matching to the scenes however it could have used more shadow layers and much less sharpening as it looked off in prolonged scene and there was a down right scene where the ""Essas"" was running off of the frame and his right arm froze into the edge of the screen. The ""Naddaha""'s glowing halo was okay. The part where ""Sheraz"" was going to possess ""Maggie"" was just awful.
Overall it was still a very welcomed start to a great and hopefully long running show. In the end it was entertaining enough for me to watch it twice in the same week."
505,"Choosing Ahmed Amin to do this character is very courageous from the director since he is a comedian, but he did very well actually, he convinced us that he is really dr Refaat.
The effort done in this show is pretty obvious, starting from rewriting the scenario of the novels, introducing the us to paranormal things smoothly and the characters performance are all very good.
Horror scenes needed to be more intense with the music's volume needed to be higher, poor graphics in only one scene.Generally a very good start and waiting for the next season hoping for it to be more than just 6 episodes :)"
506,"The series are great and yet it is just the start from an author who has a lot to explore.
I hope we will have many seasons, they are about 40 novels."
507,Amazing series very interesting. Need more professional visual effects next time
508,This a great successful show what gives you a great idea of egyption folklore novel and what can be done when you have the opportunity to do
509,The series is amazing... Good acting and producing
510,"I was waiting for this show impatiently and also so afraid that the TV show will not be as good as the novel, but it was perfect, regarding story line, background music & Character performance especially the main character, Ahmed Amin (Refaat Ismael).
junior Actors performance need to be improved, the relationship between Refaat & Magie need to be more romantic & growing.
waiting for season 2 and hoping to improve the CGI effects than season 1.
thanks Dr. Ahmed KHaled Tawfik (may Allah bless his soul)
thanks Amr Salama (director) & Ahmed Amin (Refaat Ismael)"
511,"Acting was good
Story brilliant
Directing excellent
Music average
CGI TERRIBLE
OVER ALL it was good considering it's the 1st drama for an Egyptian work."
512,"If we compare this work with other egtypians works, this tv series will surpass them all, thats why i gave it 9 stars, However i have some comments about the series in all
1-The only perfect actor in the series is Ahmed Amin, i am not a fan for him but i really liked his work, the other actors were below the average.
2-A chimpanzee in the desert, are you kidding me!
3-The series is not unique."
513,I can find Ahmed Amin's real character in reactions and jokes too
514,"Best actors,story and a lot of support to this action"
515,"The story was captivating cant wait for season two. The CGI is still poor for some reason and I hope they try to reduce their usage of CGI as much as possible, but other than that it is a great experience in every aspect."
516,"I love the fact that it was an Egyptian series
There were some flows & CGI is very bad.But other wise everything else is good."
517,It's a great work here and I really enjoyed with this season. I am highly recommended for watching this series and I am waiting for next seasons.
518,"One of the best series i have ever seen, i recommend it to everyone"
519,I loved the series honestly Amr Salama and all the cast did an amazing job I have given it 9 instead of 10 because the only thing I didn't like is the visual effects (graphic design work)
520,"Amazing and you should watch it ator very good, story amazing and director exllent"
521,"I completed the whole season in 2 days! Loved everything about it except for the Gorilla episode
Waiting for season 2"
522,I like what I see it different from what I see in normal Egyptian drama that is something great in his own category i like it i can't stop watching it i hope that Will more episodes next season
523,"Great series with exceptional actors and actresses and script

525,It is just a masterpiece everything is perfect scenes acting soundtrack novel from dr ahmed khaled twfiq we need more seasons of that kind of creativity
526,"I was wondering if the series will be good like the novels or what.
But know I'm sure that Paranormal is one of the best Arabic series I have ever seen."
527,Fascinating and the best is yet to come. I am excited to watch the second season very soon. The Egyptian drama is coming
528,"Worth more than 10 Completed artwork, great drama, mastery of events, an unexpected ending, awaiting the next of the series"
529,"It's very amazing , thanks for all, The series is very descriptive. I didn't hope it was concluded. I related to the characters, the atmosphere of filming, and the era is functional and deserves more support. This is a lot."
530,"So happy to see refaat ismaiel trasferred from book to screen with that fantastic production and amaizing acting

537,Am only wondering when season 2 will be available?.??
538,"It's absolutely fantastic, being a fan of the original novels it's been tricky seeing them on the screen.
But i gotta say they have done an absolutely marvelous job... the locations and scenaries are amazing. Ahmed amin was utterly brilliant! And the whole series was a success 😍"
539,"This series is not only horror stories or paranormal series coming to life. It is a history of our childhood with more the 100 story written by the great Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq he is the father of many generations and he was the first one that hoped these stories would come to life in a series
Ahmed Amin was a great actor he convinced us with Dr. Refaat character although he had some ironic words that resembles his personality where I really thought this is Ahmed Amin not Refaat Ismail
The direction is well and the lighting is really convincing and convenient
I liked the clothes and the makeup of characters although I didn't like how the pictured Maggie
Also there are some twists made in the scenario that are different from the stories which made me a little mad how the storyline went but I guess they thought different would be more convincing
Waiting for another season eagerly"
540,Great work from everyone who worked on this show. It felt like I was watching a hollywood production. Thank you for this piece of art.
541,"I'm proud of being one of the fans for Paranormal series
Such a great work have been done

544,"I wish to see another works like this soon
Music is amazing , and the cast is awesome
Keep on"
545,"The directing, the cinematography were awesome , the background music was thrilling and horrifying enough to get you into the mood , Ahmed Amin embraces Dr. Refaat with his dark sarcastic sense of humour and i was impressed with his acting despite most of the new actors who lack the sense of acting for a bit but it doesn't matter cause the show overall was great"
546,"Thanks for all who are work hard in this series thanks ahmed amin thanks amr salama great work proud to see egyptian creativity's ,,."
547,"I cant believe that finally we get to see Dr Ahmed Khalid Tawfik chef-d'oeuvre on screen, i already finished this show and can't wait to see others .

552,Loved it .. so impressive as the first Egyptian horror show
553,"Great series, great actor and great experience. I never thought i will enjoy an Arabic series, this one is just outstanding ."

559,"I love it the acting the director every thing great for me
I hope to continue and produce new episodes
6 is not enough we need more"
560,Great one.. i've read the books when i was a kid its like a 23 years ago and this series is just amazing ahmed amin nailed it ! surprised all of use of with his amazing acting amr salama one of the best egyptian direactors of all time keep the great job young man 👏👏
561,Indeed this is a world-class tv show ... Ahmed Amin is talented actor 👏👏
562,"I wasn't expecting that it will be perfect like that the stories from first episode to the last its all perfect, a good start, good crew, it's amazing"
563,"For starters, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to call an Emmy for Ahmed Amin's performance. When I first heard he was cast for the role for such the complex character of Refaat Ismail, I wasn't really that optimistic due to the fact that Ahmed Amin was known for his comedic roles in shows like ""El Plateau"" and ""El Waseya"", but it was less about doubting his abilities and more about the stereotypical character we expect him to be. However, all it took was 5 minutes for me to adjust to him being Refaat Ismail. It was so good to the point where I actually thought he wasn't acting and this was what he really was. Amin has impressed us by the way he brought Refaat from the stories to the real world. He gave complex depth to the character with his facial impressions and his expressive internal monologue. I think this was one of the best cast put together and actually fit together into the roles of the characters. Razane Jammal's Maggie was is also worth mentioning. This is no easy character to give depth to but she did it almost flawlessly like she was born for the role. The way she expressed what she thought and felt without actually a line expressing it was well-executed. It was well done.
The photography was on-point with the way it cut through scenes as well as the editing of the show. I personally loved the music which I think was focusing more on emotions rather than the intensity of the horror scenes. I am okay with this as I think the show is also about the development of its characters and the way they perceive the world rather than just a couple Egyptian legends. This is an approach Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq takes in most of his books, the characters, the way they develop and improve or get worse rather than just plain outer focused approach of what's happening in the world. I would like to praise Amr Salama, the director, for this impressive take on something extremely risky and it actually turning out to be this good. Hats off.
The makeup artists and production designers also did a great job.
It does have a few mistakes with the CGI and some other stuff but those aren't really that distracting from the brilliance of the show.
I really hope this continues to excel the same way it currently does, as it has the potential to be an all-time greatest in this genre."
564,"Really good start, the script is awesome, refaat is spectacular I loved him
The direction needs some enhancement and also the graphics
Overall it's really amazing"
565,Best Egyptian series I have ever watched .. am an eternal fan if the paranormal book stories .. and now am a big fan of the life action version .. very well done
566,"Great movie keep going..!! I fell good while I watch .
Good job"
567,I love it . Egyptians has done a very good work and i enjoyed this work
568,"Very good show, nice directing, very good acting team, looking forward for many seasons in future,
It's really good to watch such type of stories in Arabic.""keep going"""
569,Great show with great acting ahmed amin nailed it ./ with great sound effect and great choice of background music . the show have a horror theme but its NOT horror specific. the only bad side is can find is that the CGI is horrible but im not into graphics im into the story which was awesome . so hyped for season 2
570,"One of the best shows in 2020
Can't wait for season 2"

And it's overhyped"
596,"I love it , I proud of ahmed amen
Keep it up star ⭐"
597,"This show is worth checking out for. The source material is highly acclaimed as i found out . the adaptation is mind blowing and i didn't expect this from a egyptian creators. The lead is phenomenal, the supporting cast is also very good if not excellent. The overarching mystery is fantastic and especially the supernatural tone of the series. i never thought i could enjoy it so much. Renew this asap netflix with increased budget"
598,"To who said overrated .. No Sir , every Single arabic People rated this Show They knew the Series very well , becuese we Read it on books since 1995 it's not about Graphics or budget it's about Charcters and The Life of the Series and we love The writer .. RIP Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawif ."
599,"As a person who spent my life watching a lot of English language tv shows. I tend to watch some few foreign language ones that would amaze me. In my experience of watching Arabic cinema, nothing that really amazes me that much in the way of the talent of directing, filming, narrative and acting. This show i consider one of the best done in term of filming quality and directing. The cinematography is very excellent and everything is just like watching an American tv show. The director did a great job and the actors are very talented especially the protagonist.
The score is amazing.The issues and problems of the show are: the CGI is bad at some points, not the greatest.
Not every episode was that good and fun, some episodes were below average and slow (the first three episodes) and then the show turns to an above average great in the last three Episodes.
Some characters in the show didn't have a big impact in the show, one character specifically felt odd and not right it's the character of Maggie: the Scottish girl speaking Arabic.
Some other plots like the gorila in the desert and Louis being Lucifer is not perfect.Finally, I would say the horror and excitement of the show pulls you in to keep watching with some of the low and bad issues in the show like the cgi and bad scenarios, it still makes it a great different experience and totally recommended for those who'd like to watch foreign tv shows and new experiences."
600,"I was pleasantly surprised with this show. In college, I took literary creation classes and this show reminds me of an imitation process. In this, the student took a short story and followed the structures and patterns but still make it is own. It is not a bad thing, it allowed us to grow and improved as writer.In this show, I saw the story of the biblical fall from grace of humanity. Refaat, the protagonist, is Adam. He has no doubt as he is full of certainty in science. He does not know any better. Even though, he always do the right thing, putting everyone else's happiness before his own.Maggie is Lilith, Adam's first wife, the ""one that got away"". She is also a ""red head"", like some depiction of Lilith. She speaks her mind. As Refaat never told her how he felt about their relationship, she did not bother to stick around past what she deemed appropriate. Her sensibilities are her own. When they were both in college, she dated another man who wooed her first, Louis C. Ferrer (Lucifer).Compare to her, Huwaida can never hope to match her. Huwaida is Eve, made to love him. She does what she is told. Even her engagement was arranged by Reda, Refaat's sister. She only grow as a person once Refaat put an end to there relationship, believing she is the one the tarot predicted would die, and also, after eating of the ""forbidden fruit"" (the flower that cured her). She even mentionned having met a new person, and she even affirms she and Refaat would probably not work out in the end.Like I mentionned, Louis C. Ferrer is Lucifer. He is the one who abandonned is medical studies to become a ""snake oil merchant"". He hold a tarot deck which he uses to predict the future; therefore knowing of the Good and the Evil. He ""corrupted"" Maggie away from Refaat, refering to some stories of involvement between Lucifer and Lilith. Maggie really enjoys those games but Refaat does not want to partake in this. He as to fall though, in order to save Huwaida's life. He gets a reading, thus acquiring the knowledge of Good and Evil while on the quest for the flower (forbidden fruit).Even though she is not Divine, or Godly, Shiraz is still akin to God in this story. She invites all the kids to play in her Garden. Even when she gets hurt, she just stand up and start laughing again, her wounds healing immediatly. There is no Death in the Garden and everything is provided (like the drinks and the jello). She help Refaat throughout the story without him acknowledging she is there. She refuses to talk to him because she was ""trap in the basement"" (which is something a like to think is like a refusal to accept one's own Faith). Even after Refaat ""rekindle"" is Faith in God, making peace with Shiraz's ghost, there are rules she must follow and once she breaks them, she as to leave Refaat alone. Even when she tries to convince Refaat as a child to jump over the roof, and he falls to the ground, Refaat is not hurt. His brother is though... This makes him limp and forces him to work with their father, which in turns allow Refaat to go to England for his studies. Thus, we can say that 'God' works in mysterious ways"".The Black Pharaoh's represent Death. Before him, no one dies in the story. It is this shadow of Death that cast doubt in Refaat, thus leading to his Fall first by getting a tarot reading by Louis, and than sending him on the quest for the flower. This flower being in cave, you have to get the permission to enter. As Refaat dynamites the entrance, he did not get permission, which is why acquiring the only remedy for Huwaida is the ""forbidden fruit"".The game played between Louis and Refaat are for his immortal soul. The labyrinth / mind imagery represent its intricacies. Refaat does not understand what is so precious about it but Shiraz tells him it's the most precious thing he has and must never lose it. The ending leaves Refaat with this questioning as we, Humans, will never get an answer as to why Gods does what it does and why the Devil is so interested in us.All in all, I find the show very well done. If it was the intent of the author to represent the Fall of Man from this stand point, I consider it a success ! I will watch the story again and do hope for a ""round 2"" between Man and the Devil !"
601,It was a good Arabic show as its start and looking forward to season 02
602,"Wow! such an outstanding thing! Amazing perfomance based on a book series that amazed me literally. Actually the CGI by the way is not bad at all to be honest I'm convinced. It's not a bout to fear someone, but it's all about the story that touched me to death! Everything impressd me n The only thing that disappointed me is i didn't know that's only 6 episodes to watch, i was waiting for the next one to begin and i didn't found it so it was a shock for me. I'm waiting impatiently for season 2. Overall its remarkable and unforgettable show. Best of luck for everyone was in front or behind the camera."
603,"I read the novel and in my opinion the serious was very good specially its the first egyptian try in this filed u may say the graphics were not that good but But the actors performed very well
my rating may be tainted or biased coz i am egyption but it is what it is
i look forward to another part of it"
604,"A great show that brings us to the past, good quality."
605,"It is a really masterpiece and deserves watching
I can't imagine that is an Egyptian series"
606,Masterpiece tv show and a good show very good and very interested in the house you can get a good show up at the end
607,"In fact, I am Egyptian, but I would like to convey why the Egyptians are embarrassed by the Egyptian series The Egyptian series from Nestflex is a wonderful thing, but the series is perfect for the other series in Egypt, most of them very bad. But this series lit a candle that was present in our hearts. From my opinion, this is the best Arab series ever, for this all Egyptians and Arabs give him a very high rating because we are astonished by this work"
608,I think that is very interesting and very good . i know that this series is the best
609,That is a super surprise and great show i hope more arabic series like that one
610,Great stars and great story and great horror . my favorite episode is the first one
611,"Such a noticeable boom and a big leap in the cinema industry of Africa and the Middle East that this artwork held... By the magnificent writer Dr. Ahmed Khaled tawfeeq who blowed our minds with his writing skills.... He confronted us with an excellent gruesome story collection ""Paranormal"" that gave us frantic goosebumps. Sincerely it's such a good one......"
612,More than fun and adventurers and a lot of mixed feelings that makes u so attached to this show .. Just Good Work.
613,I usually don't watch any horror paranomal but this one is so good the story is so good and the acting too there is one thing that I didn't like that the graphics in the 3rd wasn't as good as the others
614,"I am proud that this series is Egyptian and its protagonists are from my country.
Acting, directing, filming and everything is wonderful, but the thing that made me sad is that I read the original novel of this series and saw that some of the events of the series do not resemble the events of the novel that I read, but this does not prevent that this series is wonderful and I hope more surprises in the second season."
615,I really liked the music and the whole vibe of the show 10/10 would recommend
616,"Egyptian dramas are great! But I've never witnessed an Egyptian series discussing paranormals, and for the first of it's kind to turn out so graciously made, it's really such a good series with a lot of folklore background in each myth and episode..the cast is perfect for the roles and it's executed prefectly..great effort👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
617,Actually I was surprised by his performance as i hated his type of comedic shows. He proved that he is a talented actor who can play a lot of characters.
618,"It's very good for all guys to start thinking about what behind the nature, so everyone who is very interested in fictional characters and self-thinking will be so excited while watching this stuff.
I hope they give us more works with Ahmed Amin.
Thanks for everything."
619,"Ahmed Amin nailed it as Dr. Refaat Ismail, Maggie was good too, I loved the music, there was so much effort to show Cairo's 60s and it was fine, well done Amr Salama and all the cast you've done something amazing and you took the egyptian shows to a whole new level."
620,"An amazing show, Amr Salama is an amazing director and he made this gem flawlessly and Ahamed Amen is a funny comedian and a genius actor he really embodied Dr. Rifaat Ismail character there some flaws in the CGI and the graphics but regardless it's an amazing show and worth watching more than one time."
621,"Great tv series, amazing acting, Really enjoyed it"
622,"I am very proud that Egypt is doing this amazing job, and this series is worth watching. loved it"
623,"One of the best shows I've ever watched a really good representation of the Egyptian urban legends
And after hearing all of these stories when I was young finally I can see it in real life
10/10 especially if you red the books"
624,"All the episodes were very entertaining, kept my attention and intrigued me to continue the series. A must watch!"
625,"I love Ahmed Amin work and I like this show
And I so proud by this work good jop"
626,"There were a small books on the street.. A brilliant man called Ahmed Khaled tawfik created the personalities of the generation who made 25jan revolution in Egypt by those books.. He gives us all of informations in every field and literally he grows us like a good father with his sons and daughters..he loves us.. Believes in us.. And we love him by all of our heart..he was the godfather of the generation..
So we will stand with amr salama, Ahmed amin.. And anyone try to give the godfather his deserve respect ."
627,"Great acting and great acting
One of my favorite actors"
628,Very poor geaphic but its the first series for the beloved Dr. Ahmed Khalid tawfik
629,Nice series waiting for the next parts I hope to produce more from Rifaat Ismail
630,As an Egyptian this is such a great class art compares to other low art which made me not interested in the product they present until this one
631,"I'm a big fan of the original novels and I grow up reading it and always was a dream for me and my entire generation to watch it on screen.
I really loved it actors are amazing and also the director
I absolutely loved the music.
Can't wait for the next season."
632,"Such a great series with a great actors.. It was really epic and special, I wish there is s 2 for this greatness with their music, actors, and the great stories of Ahmad Khalid Tawfik, may Allah rest him in peace❤"
633,I think it's the first egyptian work that really I enjoy it
634,"We The Egyptians did a good job.
This series was based on the Egyptian great novels of the writer Ahmed Khaled Tawfik... why the Egyptian did a great job
Because the script was awesome... Magnificent photos. Great vibe. I'm a big fan of the current horror movies/series, and I can recommend this one to anyone... And I'm waiting for the rest of the sequel, because I watched these 6 episodes at once..."
635,"I didn't expect it to be that good...Loved the story, the script, the actors. Need to work on the special effects in the next season. But it is a good start for future Egyptian horror series... Good job 👍"
636,"Egyptians, I am Syrian, I love you, my brothers, you are the media flame, you are the ones who makes the media, not others."
637,Very good show very good acting solid story marvelous novel overall full 10
638,"I like all team casting 👌 ecxleosev ahmed amin
Thanks NETFLIX
looking for more chapters & episodes ASAP
REALLY GOOD JOB"
639,"I'm one of the biggest fan for this series since more than 15 years
And since 1st episode I got kind of nostalgic feeling that make me more focused with every episode until finally I finished all the 6 episodes in one night"
640,"It's a great Arabic series ever I see
I see all the series it's very nice and great job."
641,Cinematography was way above my expectations !! Really a masterpiece
642,It's one of the best Egyptian series I have ever seen.
643,"Actually I am a reader for the series (Books) since years, around 20 years now, the story line and the dramatic homogeneity must revised and it was hard to form a unity out of the main story line, they were more than successful in forming the dramatic line of Elkhadrawi House and contextualize Raaft within it, Raaft as anti-Hero is well depicted here than the original, the visual effects are not the best but can be improved, the image elements are so Egyptian, which gives an insight of what a normal Egyptian village and Cairo had. Magie as a character is not clear, the relation of Raaft-Magie is not clear, was clearer in the books, a classic love story. there is something must be established about the relation in the next seasons. Over all it could have been directed better, but still possible."
644,"It is a great show.
The story line, acting and directing are all top notch
The main character, Ahmed amin, is genius
They need to improve the graphical characters
Worth watching"
645,First i didn't read any books from Ahmed Khaled Tawfik but this amazes me in such a good way!Allow me to focus on two leads: Ahmed Amin was perfect here as Dr. Refaat i don't think of any other actor can do a better role than he did.The other one was Razane Jammal as Maggie was something else her accent was absolute superior for the character characteristics and i didn't know her before but i will begin to follow from now on!Amr Salama as a director did a good job not perfect but a good one and the rest of the cast was decent!I loved they way episodes are connected to one another not just some stories from Dr. Refaat!I really enjoyed the show and i finished it in 6 hoursI didn't deal with the show as just horror i liked the drama especially with Maggie.I hope i can see season 2 at nearest possible time!I believe the success of PARANORMAL will allow Netflix to explore more EGYPTIAN stories and they won't regret!
646,"Brilliant, as the 1st Egyptian work on Netflix. Graphics could have been better, they should have used The Crew Graphic Design Company. The Gorilla episode is the worst among the show, I wish it wasn't included. If there will be season 2 please add more brain teasers and lost of hope moments instead of having everything straight forward."
647,"The 60s and 70s is a nice time period movie and series makers can use to add attraction to their work
The storyline was great even it didn't follow the novels in many events
The drama was very attractive.
The graphics weren't good.
If you are looking for classic horror series this is not a good for you
But if you are looking for a great time I recommend this series for you."
648,"Very enjoyable series U had to see it
Not borin at all the cast incredible"
649,"All crew do their work excellent
ahmed amin. is amazing
👏👏👏amr salama
thanks netflix and we need part 2 now 😅"
650,"I am a fan of Dr. Ahmed khaled Tawfeek since my childhood, I have read almost every book written by him, I have read Paranormal series years ago and couldn't imagine it would come to life oneday and watch my favorite characters on the screen, however Ahmed Amin and Amr Salama made dreams come true after all those years. Great work and waiting for the rest of series :))"
651,Best horror series i had seen great job ahmed amin amazing series
652,Excellent start but you have to improve the quality of the graphics ( monkey scene! )
653,A very good series for the beginning of Egyptian horror series
654,"Very very good series we hope another season as soon as possible, Bravo Ahmed Amin"
655,"Ahmed amin is so talented and presents us great and lite character as usual
In love with refaat esmaeel"
656,Its extremely amazing I do recommend to all of U doesn't matter the age. 10/10
657,Based on one of the famous story in arabic literature with marvellous production and acting
658,A great movie that deserves to be watched. I hope that it will take place in parts and other seasons
659,Netflix has done a great job of showing the novel the best way and The actors adapted the character in a unique way and Young director Amr Salama has proven that he has great talentDon't miss the first season and wait for the second season
660,Very exciting story I think It will be from the first 50 movie in the history
661,I am proud for this work and it's a very good job Egyptian and Ahmed Amin is the super star
662,"Amazing work, I wish they don't cancel it so we can get more seasons of this."
663,"1- Ahmed Amin was a great acting performance that did not happen in Egypt for a long time. I enjoyed it very much whenever it appeared on the screen.2- Music was the first thing I noticed. It flattered me and introduced me to the world of the series3- Photography and cadre were an art board, so every image was beautifully expressed4- The costumes, cars and the general atmosphere were beautifully embodied as if you went to Egypt in 19605- Directing was uneven and the dialogues were not the best, but the worst thing was cgi"
664,The best show you could ever watch. Something different and new
665,Very impressed with the quality of filming and the text
666,"Still a good series to watch and looking for season 2 , the cast is good but those are the special ones (refaat & raaefa) , need more attention to the background of the characters and the sound effects is not that good"
667,"The show Story,Acting,soundtrack and directing are great !!!!! I recommend this show and can't wait till second season!"
668,"First of all I have been waiting this show since I ever read the novels and even more planning to produce it as an ambitious kid so I'm grateful that it's a live show .
1.The story lines are completely different from the novels which is known for tv shows creators to and their image about the show and in this particular case was entertaining, interconnected and made all the episodes like one magnificent piece as I hopped.
2.the cast was unknown, perfectly unknown for Egyptian first line actors as Netflix always do but worth it because the main character is a dark depressed sarcastic doctor who lives alone made by a comedian who mastered the character in a balanced way and all actors as well.
3. The cgi was good as a first and acceptable for all sides except the guerrilla scene but the elements of drama and suspense coverd it .
4. The story was epic and satisfying for me and I hope it is for others who watch around the world as I said it's a hope for new era in Egypt to create tv shows actually talk to the young people not only about fantasy people who live in fantasy houses and conflict about women and money as we always see in Ramadan seasons all over years ."
669,"For start it brillient ..but series was neded some additions .
Based on views of director and re wrkter"
670,Its one of the best egyption series Good photography and sound effects make the series live the events of the novel
671,"I started watching the anticipated series ""paranormal"" today and actually it is not only another horror/drama series produced by netflix, but it is a very well done adaptation for the great egyptian author ""ahmed khaled tawfik"" paranormal stories, the acting was nice, the music was better than expected, the cinematography was interesting to watch, overall it was an enjoyable ride and i am surely waiting for season 2"
672,"The performances of the actors are wonderful, and the photography and directing are excellent"
673,"Masterpiece and beautiful and wonderfull
Its completely series"
674,"A great series from all sides, acting and directing, transforming events. They made you enjoy every shot and eagerly wait for what will happen. The performance is very convincing by Ahmed Amin, who has excelled in his performance, but I have a comment on the visual effects in the third episode of the gorilla. First, it is an unsuccessful choice for a gorilla In the desert as well, the moves were not realistic, they were a little quick"
675,"Perfect story building on Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik novels, great actors specially Ahmed Ameen, music was very good the only challenge is in the special effects which was good but it could definitely be better"
676,I didn't expect that.This show will be one of my favourite. I highly recommend it to everyone doesn't matter what age you are. Everyone will find something interesting in it. GOOD JOB KEEP IT UP
677,One of the best Egyptian series ever. If you are Arab or not you will really enjoy it. It is based on one of the most popular book series. You will see a part of Egyptian folklore and international myths. Through the viewing time you are always on the edge of your seat. I do recommend it.
678,"I didn't expect it would be such a good show , the acting is perfection , soundtracks are fantastic 👏"
679,"B3on allah fo2 el 3azama
Ahmed ameen 3aaaash
B3on allah fo2 el 3azama

680,Actor Ahmed Ameer did a great job! Director Amr salama was good !
681,"Great work with a great actor , it was a scary day for me when I was watching this that mean they really act very good"
682,"This series is considered its transmission in the world of Arab and Egyptian drama in particular, it may contain some mistakes from influences and some other things, but it can transfer you to the world of Rifa'ah Ismail with ease. I hope that it will be a gateway to many works to learn from him, so it deserves the highest evaluation that you can give him and this As I mentioned on my Sobhy Reviews channel"
683,It takes you to great two stories in obe min with great locations and best believable acting
684,"Amazing, I can't wait till the second season to be
reproduced. Go Ahead Ahmed Amin 💞👌"
685,"Compared with the Egyptian and Arab series, this series was the best of them in terms of performance, production and filming, but the third episode had many negatives, so I put the rating 9"
686,"Just watched yesterday and it's so hard to find anything wrong about this serie !! As the first Egyptian work produced by Netflix we expected some downs ,but actually it came exactly the opposite! The cast is amazing and they are irreplaceable they did their best and it was epic. The directors did everything they could, episodes 1,2,5,6 were fantastic. I really appreciate their work and I'm proud of being Egyptian"
687,"I know that this is the first Egyptian series to be produced for all the world, the acting is very beautiful, but in Episode 3 you must gain experience in the work of visual effects in the gorilla because it was not good. We must pay attention to the details, but in general the series is beautiful"
688,"Great Egyptian work, i love the cast, story, acting all of the series great."
689,I don't know if it's right or not but i think the performance of Ahmad Amin is one of the best Egyptians ever...i used to watch him as a comedian in Al Platouh and for me he was one of the best egyptian comedian but now he's one of the best egyptian actors ever...the tv show is worth watching without and doubt.
690,The best of the best. Ahmed amin convencied me that he is refat asmail and razan played magi character to make me believe that she is the real magi. Amazing work. Each part of it is a so creative.
691,I enjoy watching it and idont feel the time passing through
692,"Great job, our wish became finally trure to watch this masterpiece"
693,"Great job from Arab people , I love it

715,Takes a leap with based view to a beloved book franchise. I am super happy with Ahmed Amin and Amr Salama
716,I would love to say that waiting part 2 from now. I wish to everyone watch it
717,"The show is extremely engaging. You feel the characters and sometimes talk on their behalf. Except episode 5, it is not an actual horror series, it is much more of thrilling and spooky experience. The ideas are unique. The twist at the end was not expected which makes it more powerful. Drama is heavily existing. Music is really expressing. Main role actor deserves an award for this role. Last episode is something epic. Can't remember many shows/episodes that caught me like this episode 6. Some graphics and monster styles were not up to the level though."
718,Great.. a new era for Egyptian TV shows with fantastic production from Netflix.. good job
719,I am super busy and have lots of personal tasks on hold but I enjoyed the series and wish to seee More seasons soon

732,"Great start according to the first Egyptian show on Netflix, love it so much"
733,Thank you for all cast. Gooooooood love it so much
734,"Great work and effort
10/10
Amazing acting , casting , illumination and sounds"
735,Very good série from godfather dr:Ahmed khaled Tawfiq .I want to see more
736,I think it's anew theme for the Egyptian cinema makers to use horror in such a good collection of acting and script and camera views and music
737,"Very organized.. detailed and accurate work.
Actors are very relatable and professional."
738,"As a big fan of the original novels this series has put me into a nostalgia when I first read them in my teenage period during the dark nights and cold winters, but regardless being emotionally to that, the whole series is good enough compared to the books, I like the dramatic treatment, the amazing acting of Ahmed Amin who done the Dr. Refaat Ismail's character perfectly, I also like the acting of the rest of the cast, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the script writing...But what I don't like: the slow events that make the episodes somehow boring, the very poor CG scenes and VFX, I don't like putting Maggie in every single scene in all episodes which makes it meaningless and if we removed her role it wouldn't differ much, unlike the books, Maggie appeared from time to time between the issues, and when she do the story is all about her, not just as a side kick character, I don't like the idea that foreign characters speak Arabic because in the books Maggie and Louis never spoke Arabic, this is very important point because in the series there are many issues completely with international people in different locations like Scotland, England, US so it would be unlogic if they all of sudden just speak Arabic spontaneously.
But after all it's a nice good start for a wonderful series to come..."
739,"The actors are so well chosen, ahmed amin is a hidden gem guys look at his performance, he literally was so deep in his character, i love all about this work and waiting for more amazing egyptian works to come."
740,The show is very good but the CG character is feels cartoon they must to fix this issue if there is more episodes .. and i hope to complete this show ...
741,"Beautiful to the eye and relaxing , I loved it so much a great job by Egyptians especially ahmed Amin ( rafeat Ismail)"
742,"Great step with Great horror movie👏👏
Ahmed Amin is the only one how can do this"
743,"I enjoy it, it was beautiful idea to change the novels into episodes"
744,"A7a, l series super fashi5 bgd, 3ash l cast kolo wallahy 👏👏👏"
745,"RIP Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfek
Your Books Are Now Great TV Show
I Love The Performance Of All The Cast"
746,First of i really hate egyptian scary movies it's sick n stupid asf that's series really make me scare n have a good time all the ep are great but the third ep is little bit boring but everything else is really good i like it
747,"Great series and great actors, can't wait for the next season"
748,Nice imagination from the director based on novels ..
749,"The novel needs all actions to compleate so its important to implement a second season, all ingredients in this thrilling drama are awesome from the image to the music, thrilling, and the great script, smart directing, actors especially thh hero and all the cast..
Its a great job, i like this series so much"
750,"Very cool series, actors, stories, music, decor and directing is very interesting"
751,"It was my childhood dream to see Dr. Refaat alive . Now my dream come true and I saw him in a perfect way .
Waiting for the battle between him vs Lucifer"
752,"As a fan for the novel series I can confirm that the key to enjoy the TV series is to watch it without expecting to see an identical copy of the written novels.
The season is well made as a start. Any future sequels could -sure- use some additional work on special effects. I didn't like the kids performance (except for Shiraz - Reem Abd El Kader). For the adult actors the following characters (Dr.Refaat Ismail / Maggie Mckillop / Huwaida Abdel Moniem / Louis) performance was very good.
Episodes directed by Amr Salama were better than those directed by Majid Al Ansari.
And the final episode is the best and takes the credit for the high rating given for the series.
Good job for the crew. And sure waiting for the second season.RIP Dr.Ahmed Khaled Tawfik the author of the original novel series."
753,After a long waiting .. these epic novels on tv .. waiting the rest of the full series 😀😀😀
754,"The show is excellent, it is based on novels of Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfic, which is very popular novels in egypt.The actor Ahmed Amin is very talented and did a great job playing the main character of the novel with agreat performance.Highly Recommended!!!"
755,It was a great show im really proud of it need to w9rk on graphics but it a good expression f4om Egyptian cinema
756,First of all thanks Netflix to upgrade our series in Egypt Ahmed Amin I can not imagine anyone else in this role that would do it better thank you thanks to all cast I hope that you become best actor ever you worth it it is a great honor for us as Egyptians to have people like you like Mohamed Salah like Ramy Malek thank you all
757,My favorite actor 💟 I love everything in this story
758,Great show to watch! Finish it in one day. I liked the connection between the episodes while there are different stories. Great acting and the last episode was amazing. I hope there will be more seasons.
759,I'm totally amazed by this fabulous series. I'm literally finished it in one single night.
760,Very good actors and perfect script love the work go forward for next session and do better one people

779,"When you see the greatness as a show by your favorite horror writer since you were a kid , you can't describe how you feel .."
780,It's amazing to see that level of the Thrill and excitement
781,"Being a huge fan of the original book series, I went in with some reservations regarding the expected quality of the result, questioning whether or not the Egyptian film industry can produce something that can compete with global film making standards, and boy was i proven wrong!
I teared up seeing characters that I loved as a child come to live on the silver screen in a beautiful heart-felt picture that is not only well-painted but also sublime in all its elements!
The acting, the cinematography, the music ... everything fits perfectly with a culture that has many myths in its history.
The lead characters (Both male and female) did an exceptionally amazing job, even the secondary actors were up to the challenge and delivered their scenes beautifully!
I have never met the author of the book series personally but I couldn't help feeling proud for him and wishing he was alive to witness his legacy become real.
I am an avid binge watcher and pride myself on the variety of shows and films that I have seen so far, and I passionately recommend this series for all fellow lovers of book-series-turned-tv-series who look for pieces of work that stayed true to its original vision.
I have only seen yhe first episode so far, and I believe it is a great start for a good series, hopefully it will only get better from here, and extend to many seasons to come."
782,"I am truly proud of this magnificent work which shows the power of the egyptians in the works of art that come from a long history of cinema and drama, It may not be the best artwork in history, but it is one that will bring the best to the Arab and Egyptian works of art, respectively, May peace, god's mercy and blessings be upon you."
783,"For me I don't like horror series but when i saw first episode i keep watching until the last one ,actor ahmed amin is genius for doing this role , the story is so good it keeps you want know what happens next i love it, i love so much I can't wait for next part ."
784,"It's taken from one of the most beloved writers in Middle East, Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, yet, it is a separate show kept only the spirit of the novel series, but it is marvellous though, I wish more seasons to follow with greater direction"
785,It's amazing I can't stop until watching all series 😅
786,Wonderful beginning and the cast are professional actors
787,The first Arabic serious experience to carry over Dr.Ahmed Kahaled Tawfiq to TV. And I think they totally succeded to to so. We loved the hard copy novels many years ago...and now the TV show succeded to bring Dr.Refat personality to life.
788,"Directing, acting, lighting, storyline
All good totally recommend but a piece of advise watch the show on speed 1.25%
Sometimes there is a little lag of outdoor scenes"
789,"Strongly recommended. A very good series. I was surprised
Best cast and effects and background music. Totally perfect"
790,I Hope To See More Things Like That Ahmed Amen Did A Really Great Work And The Directors Are Perfect
791,A dream that came true and was really up to our wishes Very intertaining and sometimes scary
792,"Amazing experience, really enjoyed watching every moment, highly recommend it"
793,I love horror novels and the series is amazing I love it especially Ahmed Amen who is a great actor
794,"Great series...couldn't leave before fishing the whole season, waiting the next season."
795,"This was more than expected, its amazing , the actors especially ahmed amin was fantastic, and wanna talk about the 5th episode ; it's literally a masterpiece ; i hope it goes over the world so the world can see what we can do!!!"
796,Stop reading this review and just go and watch this awesome TV series .
797,"Refaat Ismail is our Robert Langdon (Only fans of ahmad khaled will understand)I will not argue that the novel is better than the series;But if we take into account all the advantages of this series, which are certainly more than the disadvantages, it will definitely deserve an above average rating.
I read all the books of ""Dr.Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq"" ... However, the books series Paranormal was the most beloved to my heart ... I was very pleased with this Adaptation.I started watching it the day it was released and i finished it the same day.All i can say is : it's an amazing series, there are some things i didn't like about it, but the things i liked about it are more.
I hope the next season would rock the boat even more.Love to all."
798,"I loved this show, it was amazing 👏 but i wish they didn't make it as short because the novel had so much more details and i hoped they did it the same exact as the novel by Dr. Ahmad khaled tawfeeq"
799,"I like this shows it's amazing and very interesting.
1:the plot is good.
2:the show isn't boring.
3:the acting is fantastic especially the leading roles and all of the cast.
4:the CGI isn't bad
5: the relationship between the characters is good
I hope Netflix will renew the series for second season and third one."
800,"This is our beginning
This what we should presents"
801,"Awsome show , no word can describe it
Great job all cast and netfilx is on fire"
802,I swear it was the best tv show i have ever Watched before they eorked so hard on it
803,I honestly want to see more and the main protagonist is different in that he is just an average normal guy who find himself in unfortunate circumstances.
804,"Fantastic series,great, scary
Best Netflix series in 2020"
805,Good start of this genre in egyptian drama..with good acting and large production
806,"A series of incredible, creative and excellent representation, dialogue, direction and story"
807,😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
808,"Yes, believe the hype it's a well done series. Great cinematography and acting. Good story and it challenges people's beliefs in a good way. It gives different point of view on most conceptual ghost or paranormal theories. It's an easy watch. I watched with original language with subtitle on. I tried watching with English dubbing but it kinda of ruin the whole experience. I'd recommend watching with original sound with subtitles."
809,We need a season 2 sooner than 2022! Come on Netflix this is a good one.
810,"It is based on the books of Ahmad khaled Tawfiq , and first Egyptian 🇪🇬 Netflix production ,now don't compare Arabic and English production 😉, it's really good compared to other Arabic series and it has some good horror, each episode is a new adventure, but the scary figures some of them are a joke 😳 ."
811,"The CGI wasn't good and the idea of a Gorilla In that place is kinda stupid and even the existence of the cave itself didn't make any sense. Nevertheless, every other thing was so entertaining and it has deserved every second ."
812,"This serie is a Masterpiece, i think must be in the Top rated list."
813,Transforming the story that we read into a work of art. It's a real amazing thing . the CGI wasn't good enough but the rest of work is fine .
814,"This show is high quality, excellently written and acted and interesting. I love the set design, and it's classic spooky qualities. My only complaint is the horrid, crooked red wig that one of the main actresses has to wear and I just don't understand it? It distracts me. But this show overall is truly a gem."
815,"I just get a Netflix subscription to see the first season of ""Paranormal""..each and everyone of us in egyption and speacially the 80's, 90's generation we wanted and needed this since we were very young.the show is taken from books of Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, may he rest in peace, you can't watch this TV show without see his fingerprints between the lines.and the greatest move from the creator is creating a time line for the story which wasn't there in the books.and waiting for the 2nd season hope they promote about it soon cause this is a great job from everyone participate in it."
816,"Amazing I love it A very beautiful Arabic series, and the writer is also creative, thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work"
817,"I have found that many people commenting on the graphics and forgetting about the how was the series, to be honest I don't find it that bad because most worldwide series doesn't have good graphics cause in the end you are not watching a Cinema to be movie, but about the whole seires I am one of the people who likes horror movies and series, I have watched recently haunting of hill house and haunting of bly manor, I can assure you that Paranormal made me in many times get scared but what's more scary is that when you think that this can happen to you not your typical ghost story, something like the sleeping paralysis will keep you scared if you knew that's a real thing. Also the actors have been chosen perfectly and the plot twists are just the icing on the cake, I would say that you would really enjoy this show specially watching some new types of ghost stories as it's not only about one thing."
818,"I'm amazed with the story, acting and directing of this brilliant Egyptian series .. good job Ahmed amin and Amr Salama for giving us an amazing experience we had during watching this series ..
Can't wait for new season to surprise us more and more .. thanks for all the cast"
819,"Show discusses paranormality from a new perspective. It explores Egyptian mythology which is different from western traditional horror and paranormal. It based on the novel by Dr Ahmed K Tawfik professor of tropical medicine and one of the leading Egyptian novelists.
Definitely worth watching"
820,"I'm a veteran fan of the novels, I was suspicious that the series wouldn't be as good, I was really surprised to see the quality of the series, happily surprised :)"
821,"Thanks Ahmed amin for this series
Thanks Ahmed Khalid tawfeek"
822,"I hope that the next season if there is one, the performance will be improve"
823,"Paranormal it's not just a series it's a lifestyle
Rest In Peace Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik"
824,One of the best egyptian series i had ever watched and i can't wait for the next one ... and ahmed amin from the beginning i like your colour but i didn't thought that character can suite you ... but after watching that series i can say you are a brilliant actor 👏
825,"It's more than perfect for me

826,The Beast work in Arbian and Thanks Netfilx for that 💙💙
827,"Very creative series and i love it, I'm waiting for another chapter ."

832,"This season is a clearly good start.
Every detail count and every word is in it's very right place.
Amr salama showed the world how great is Egypt and how in a good way different are we.
Best Egyptian series till now
Can't wait for the next season"
833,"It's based on a very long series of novels by the great Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfeek. Literally generations have been raised up reading those novels and still. This series has been made with professionalism, from the shooting, scenes, script, lighting to the very end. It's really worth watching!"
834,They show good story line and makes me interested to know whats happening next episode even though i completed the novels but the bad thing is terrible cgi
835,"This took me back 30 years! Thank u for making this as a series, you perfectly caught the essence of it all! Add to that the perfect scare moments, thrill scenes, and the perfect acting of Ahmad Amin and all the other actors. I give this 10/10 without hesitation."
836,"Everything is perfect from directing to costumes to effects to script to acting, loved the music too;"
837,"This series is a great work for our godfather Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfik the most popular writer in Egypt. May God has blessed him with mercy.
Thank you for the opportunity to see Refaat Esmael on the screen.
Thanks for Amr Salama the amazing director.
Thanks for Ahmed Ameen the biggest actor.
Thanks for Netflix."
838,"For the first time, I am proud that this series is an original Egyptian series, and not only that, but that it is one of the most beautiful series that I have seen in 2020"
839,"New type and way of filming a tv show.
Good story and good execution."
840,"I just want to say
It is very good not great Although I am Egyptian, this does not give me the right to give it 10/10"
841,"Thanks for all crew for this amazing seried, it was a dream to see one of your dream comes true"
842,"The show was at it's perfect when telling the story of D.Rifaat and his psychological thoughts and his relation with the paranormal things, and the actor Ahmed Amin have really played the role very well. Music was fantastic. The same thing with Settings and decor.The bad is the movie starts very slow and the first 3 eposodes weren t that great and some CGI felf wuite off.Overall, the show was a good start for the first Egyptian work on Netflix series so I gave it a 10 so support the producers of the show."
843,"Since the 80s we hadn't seen a good Arabic series or movie, during this time it's all about love and comedy and action, and every year we see a show that repeats themselves but this show changes the rules it's not in Ramadan and it's not 30 episodes and its horror that new thing in the Arab industry so I'm proud about this series and I hope it's will break the chains of the 30 episodes in Ramadan, just a little thing I hope the CGI be better than that and more realistic and in many times I can see that is a green screen, I hope in the next seasons they will fix that."
844,"AMAZING , one of the greatest shows i've ever seen
RIP dr ahmed khaled tawfik
ahmed amin has done a great job
dude! watch it. it's better than stranger things"
845,Excellent series from the Egyptian actor ahmed amin and we need to see another seasons for the special character refaat
846,"The entire series is a masterpiece, and it proves that if we had the capabilities, we would be able to fulfill a global need that we compete with with any other business outside of Egypt."
847,"Reflects how great and awesome Dr. A.K Tawfik was.
May his soul R.I.P."
848,The series egyptian It's very good and One of the best fantasy and mystery series you'll ever see.
849,I like his style and love how he works and it's fun
850,It is the first time for me to watch an Arabic horror series and like it. I think this will be the start of a new era for Arabic horror movies and series
851,"The maze is your mind, you own your mind, do not give your mind to the devil"
852,"I liked the show the moment i watch the first episode.
It is the kind of show making us travel through an ancient Egyptian society.
I really like the production and the casting, every actors fits theirs characters especially the main character.
Moreover, choice of music is amazing.
There is a little bit of horror and suspense and the whole story is amazing.
I hope there will be another season."
853,"Love is marrow of life. The author, Ahmed used the stories to convey complex human nature, intellection, dreams, subconsciousness and the importance of love in a humorous and thrilling way. It includes family's love, responsible love between husband and wife, romantic love between lovers. These people who love him finally die for him. I think the books are not only for the youths to read, but they can be read for a lifetime. As the readers grow up and developing, they will always keep on enlightening from the books, right? Wisely, he didn't give an absolute right or wrong answer, just arouse the youths to thinking by themselves. I feel quite disappointing I couldn't read the original books. Suck!What is love? If the only true God exists, I do believe that it must be the most high-frequency of cosmic energy, that is, eternal unconditional love, happiness, and joy. It's that spring, when we riding along a country road, the breeze gently blows our face, and the fragrance of flowers rush into the tip of our nose; it's that summer, when cicadas scream in the trees, and the white clouds drifts over the blue sky; it's that autumn, when the earth is sprinkled with colorful fallen leaves, and the yellow wheats are ripe in the fields; it is also that winter, the crystal white snow drops on the window, and the hot stove fires in the house. Therefore, love conforms to the law of conservation of energy, that it can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form to another.Refaat always consider that he is a tragic person. However, he is always surrounded by love, maybe just being treated in a way he doesn't like. There are a few scenes that I like quite a lot: 1. His brother complained that the broken leg because of rescuing his life and suffered the consequences of Refaat burning the crops, but in the end he saved him and drowned without any hesitation. Refaat repented for the sake of his coward and selfish at the grave. Love is brave, and sacrifice without asking turning back 2. His dominant sister cried after the death of her husband and realized that she had treated him unfairly, and rudely. Love is forgiveness and tolerance 3. At the end, he realized that Shiraz had been supporting him, instead of what he had repeatedly emphasized in the notebook, that she wanted to take a revenge. His avoidance and fear kept him away from seeing the truth. Love is assistance and kindness. 4. His Irish lover has always hoped that he can be himself, can speak out his thoughts sincerely and undisguisedly. To escape only allows fear to occupy himself. She returned the ring to her fiancee, also for his consideration, which represents a kind of letting it go. Does she really want his promise to get married with her? I don't think so. She must know it deeply that they cannot be together. All she wants is his honest words, the poem on the back of the photo, it was written: I love you until the stars burn down. The real hurt is not separation, but his hesitation, evasion, and insincere were suffered the two of them. Love is letting it go, and understanding. She gives the best wishes to the lover to be happy forever, even if she can't be participated in his future.Sometimes, I find complaints, jealousy, pride, wrangle, control, separation, insincere, these negative emotions cover our eyes, and make us can't see the true love hidden in it. At certain moments, we think that love has been gone, disappeared, and no longer exists. However, love is always with us, cuddling with us, never increasing or decreasing, and never ending. The love between all kind of relationships is like a silver bracelet that needs to be polished frequently. We need our sensitive hearts and enthusiasm to wipe the love that has been dusted by life's trivial matters and let it continue to be shine. Love is also eternal, and it can be easily denied without any words.Each time when Refaat confront fright, he can always overcome evil. Sometimes people set limits on themselves, and draw a line as their prison.Moreover, the author also allows people to realize that even the laws and truths that they believe, and have repeatedly confirmed will be changed one day as their own understanding and experience developing. Just like Refaat's own laws, he is a rigorous scientist who never believed in paranormal or tarots, such superstitious stuffs, and finally he admits their existence.When a person says no, he closes a door for himself. What we call science is sometimes like a child's tool to measure the infinity of the universe. If humans did not own dreams of flying, diving, and constant exploration, which are not related to survival, we would definitely not have airplanes, submarines and astronauts now.Newton, who was hit the head by the apple from the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, he discovered the laws of classical mechanics, however it doesn't work well out of the earth. Einstein's theory of relativity can't find a bridge to combine the macro and the micro world, which is against quantum mechanics. He said God never tosses a coin. Until Hawking introduced the black hole theory, but it haven't been proved by experiments. We always ask questions again and again, but do not get any answers. The questions only lead to more new questions. Perhaps no answer is the final answer. What is truth? Does it exist? Is our universe in a nutshell, or is our human beings that are trapped in the third dimension, a kind of accident, like the expansion of coronavirus?"
854,"I'll try to be as concise as I can with my review.Overall the show is watchable but not impressive i'm giving it a 7 and this is why :Plus :
-The main character captures well the mood it wanted to portray and somehow reminds me of main character from ""a serious man"" the only difference is that he falls into assumptions really quick and tries to explain his unluck with theories like (murphy's law)
-the storyline can be intriguing at times especially the first episodes.
-The setting is well done (dark theme, lighting, wardrobe..)
-Newness, this is the second egyptian series i watched after ""Ramy"" the cultural difference and layout can be new and intriguing to watch.
-Some good dark humor from time to time.Minus :
-The rest of the characters fall short and fail to be intriguing and are hastily introduced in each episode although each one is quite long 40 to 55 minutes.
-each episode feels like a movie in itself ( i'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing ) but more probably bad than good because some stories in each episode didn't have time to ripen and they usually end abruptly. (ex the dark cloud, the desert tribe, the flower..the plague...death of the brother )
-There is some discontinuity to the development of events (eg: what happens to the kid) sometime he is undisturbed the next time he is doodling in a manic manner.
*some plot holes ( eg :the dispensary scenes, you don't know if it takes place in the morning or evening, some tea making when sun is up then moments after there is sun set.
*A desert picnic with no food and water, challenge accepted...
*The mother character could be intriguing but the story fails to mention anything related to it that can be useful to the story, you wonder why she is portrayed at all.
-Definitely CGI is kinda poor but i won't complain about it, i know it's budget related and it's usually out of the hands of the Director, BUT something could have been done about the stories related to it..come on the KingKong in the desert was not needed and just as most of the stories ends abruptly in not so satisfying manner. The Devil thing looked so ridiculous it made me laugh. It is almost like a parody (the fear emotion was killed because the showed too much of the devil).-Story's elements are already used before in other movies/series, ( the kid with the painting, the flower cure..., the omens,..the mumy curse thing) stacking all this stories together and using them the exact same way they were used before and sometimes without prelimenary story preparation seems a lot like recycling and repackaging than originality.
Final thoughts :It's definitely Netflix material, you can chill out watching it, but don't expect something superb other than the cultural newness of it and this is why i gave it a 7. At times I felt that the Director was so excited with the deal he made with Netflix, afraid he may not have another chance he stacked so many stories as he could. I feel like the Show could have been a lot better with less but deeper and intertwined stories than so much stories that can fall flat sometimes, of course this could have given a chance for characters to be deeper as well, and for the stories to be well paced, properly introduced and properly resolved. I know this can be Taxing on the writers but hey..this is what makes a show stand apart or not."
855,"It's a good in Egyptian, series making..Good story and plot. Amazing acting by Ahmed Amin.. very recommended to watch"
856,"I loved this show, the only complaint if you can call it that is that it needs a bigger budget so they can do more"
857,So glad and so beautiful videos quality is so impressed this videos I am so glad
858,"It is the first Egyptian Netflix Show, and it is the first to top them all! New creativity s added now to Egyptian Cinematography. Ahmed Amin, i thought he can only act comedy, but now this changed for me, because now i believe he is a complete artist! Waiting for another season!"
859,"90% of the credit belong to the author . Dr ahmed
This series is one of my best this year"
860,"Millions are waiting for it, the original series readers are a bit worried comparing the original novels - which is great - to Netflix series, but in the meantime many of us are optimistic because of Amr Salama the director and Ahmad Amin / Refaat Ismail"
861,"The title says it all. This is a never seen before take on the paranormal/horror genre. We get a mesmerizing insight into Egyptian culture which I think was depicted from mid 1940s or thereafter.
First episode was something breathtakingly beautiful. The sadness and the music just sticks with you. Immense promise, tension.. just bloody brilliant.
It clicks all corners for acting. But thereafter the story loses plot and it episodes become redundant until the final one.
This is something that definitely needs to be seen.
But it isnt in the category of 8.4. i think 8 would be a fair assesment
I have given it 8 because too many people have blindly given 10"
862,"It is definitely worth the time to watch this show. I couldn't stop watching after the first 3 episodes. Good quality, old story, great filming."
863,"I think it gonna be on the list of the best international series, the sound effects have added a beautiful character. It entered me to the world of the story, the lighting was elegant with the atmosphere, the decoration, furniture and clothes are excellent. Ahmed amin lived metempsy perfectly and intelligent with a secretive character at times and maintaining people's in love for his character but the graphics were bad I hope if other parts work to fix it"

867,"Good but not perfect, Ahmed Amin was very good and his sister but there some bad things like the gorilla"
868,Honestly.. it's a New series style.. came from lands that most of the western people don't know many things about it.. but it's surprised them with the astonishing cinema and acting there
869,"This is my reaction after 20 minutes . good actors good story, with a subtile touch of horror (not the american way of making weird things). I do not expect a mystical awakening...But the law of Murphy is a good concept to begin an horror movie ..."
870,"The series idea and story aren't new but the episodes is very exciting and the episode make you interested in the next , the only thing that was disappointed me was the graphics since it was poor. and marveld that how Netflix couldn't do graphics better"
871,"Lovely series.. great acting and great story..
Never expected this great serie from arabic..
It's filled full with suspence and surprises.."
872,One of the best shows in the Middle East I liked the story it was new and didn't see like it in the Middle East shows so I recommend u to watch this shiw
873,Wonderful series I belive it is the best drama i have ever seen good start and i hope from ahmed amin to pursuing his career with that kind of science fiction
874,Amazing work from Egyptians actors .. thanks for whole cast sho work in this series
875,I haven't read the novel yet but it can be good refresher for movie series
876,"Really loved this!
Ahmed amin is amazing!!!
Loved the cinematography!
So much talent!
Really hope to see a 2' season.
The series gives you an an inside look on arabic egyptian society, the human mind and it's complexity, the emotional evolution of most of the characters is really good and bassicly, a ride within life itself with all it's chaos, wrapped in a mesmerizing paranormal thriller. i was hooked to the screen!
Loved this!
from an israeli neighbor:)"
877,"I've cried after the last episode, it was an amazing experience watching Dr.Ahmed khalid novel in a Netflix production. Although there is some weak points but in general its very good season . Ahmed Amin did his role very good .
Amr Salama very good job."
878,"The most wonderful series in the year, we waited the second part 2"
879,"1)I hope to see better graphics better storylines better twists better script writing...
2)I actually lost the connection to the main character after episode 2 and reconnected to it at episode 6 which was the end of the series LOL.
3)There was no suspense and no horror as it was expected to be.
4)lighting in some scenes wasn't providing the story and my eyes in so many dark scenes could barely see anything epically the main character.But ,I have big hope to see season 2 because season one was a tough job for all of the team and they must have learned from the mistakes they have done."
880,What makes any movie is a great movie how much data have a details and the series have a lot of good details like this doctor at work Howie is smokes and I have deal with other people that's what make is the best Arabic series ever
881,"Ahmed amin is a great actor , and all of the episodes are good , especially last 3 episodes they were amazing , the worst episode is 3 because of the bad CGI and actually there is no gorillas in the desert , that was a big mistake , despite of that
I liked it ."
882,"Awesome Awesome Awesome
I really love it so much
So good
So good
So gooooood"
883,"It could be perfect unless director and writing cast messed up the original stories, which caused some flaws and immature fast (sometimes unexplained) closures. I am giving it 9/10 because the overall work is interesting and touched my feelings. Please stick to the original book series in coming seasons. You will never be as 1% good as Dr. Ahmad Khalid."
884,"Paranormal is an Egyptian supernatural Netflix Original horror series and based on the books by Ahmed Khaled Tawfik. The series contains Egyptian myths that play a big part in each episode, that deliver humor, fun, action, some creepiness, monsters, demons and ghosts, all told with a great affecting narrative. It's a short series that has an overall story arc that is engaging and is spiced up with some great supernatural adventures. It feels fresh, mainly due to the main character and after a short introduction the paranormal is fully on taking the viewer on a mysterious journey.This first season consists of 6 episodes with each a duration of 45-55 minutes. It has an overall story arc with a continuous storyline but each episode brings in a new spooky paranormal incident or adventure. It is highly recommended to watch this Egyptian series with its original Arabic audio and with subtitles in your own language if possible."
885,"I am surprised about this series 😍
When l listen about it before production i was interested .The story is so great because they use stories known with people in Arab world . The stuff of acting is awesome ""ahmad Amin"" and other characters .The supported characters like Refat's brother and his sister were simple and realistic acting . The music was fantastic with other events . The graphics is OK almost episodes .These things I don't like it is CGI wasn't good in the gorilla scene and they didn't finish some episode good as they surprised in the end of it."
886,"Horror series based on egyptian novels, acting and effects are really interesting, not boring at all it took me completely.
locations are chosen very very well by the director.
waiting for more seasons to come 👌👌"
887,Good for first scary movie I hope to see something better more than this next time
888,"Give it a chance

889,"The whole show was excellent, especially the small unnoticeable things that make sense at the end"
890,I rated it as 7 cuz i didn't like episode 3 there is no way that monkey protects his baby for along time and the baby didn't grow up like wtf xd but the rest is very nice especially the last episode
891,Brilliant series and everything was good from the start until the end . I have enjoyed every moment of it
892,"Really i like it it is very awesome

895,Good start for transfer paranormal novels to series
896,"There are some problems with CGI but they didn't affect how the show is great and how the storyline is amazing.. I really recommend this show to anyone who is looking for horror, drama and thrill because it contains many and many different emotions"
897,"I love it and I am waiting season 2 and i love all the actors and i wish paranormal season 2
Will be better than 1"
898,"Perfect cast, acting, and story, for the first time in Egypt a Mystery Series"
899,It's very good but the green screen was bad the book is better
900,It's very wonderful 😍 show I can't wait to see another season
901,"The best series I've ever seen.
Very very recommended. If you Arabic speaker you will have the best experience"
902,When i started watching this episode ididn't read the story before but i knew how mouch mr ahmed khaled tawfik was great and how that this series is so fantastic
903,"Great, but needs improvement in some CGI 2nd and 3rd episodes.."
904,"I am not saying this because I am egyptian but I say this because I found myself in this serie and I am also agreed that the special efects was too bad and it barely dosen't content any horror or thriller but if you love drama,I consider you to watch panoramal. (The best egyptian serie)"
905,"It is very cool and I enjoyed watching it and it is one of the best horror, thriller and mystery films I have seen"
906,"An old novel for a great writer which here in egypt almost every one has read it in his childhood , I haven't high expectations when i heard at the first time it gonna be turning into a series , and I wasn't sure about watching this series for not spoiling the novel outlines in my head , but i did give it a chance , surprisingily i did get amused by this series and how good the actors were and the way of organising the story , can't wait to watch season 2"
907,"This is amazing arabic TV show over my expectations, but I really know the main reason is the writer (Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfiq) who wrote this amazing series of short stories and, for sorry, he died before watching his own stories turn into a big TV show, which was his dream to see this.
Ahmed Amin, the main actor, surprised me with his new amazing character and he did very well. He is very successful as well as the director Amr Salama, They both made this show amazing and made Dr Ahmed dream come to true."
908,Good show for egypt very good direction goo graphics
909,"It is not the first time that I see Ahmed Amin as a natural actor, but it is the first time that I see him as a creative actor who takes the path of the dumb as a path for him, and this is my assessment, and I will not forget the role of (Shiraz) the creative child and the beautiful actress Razan and his grace. Thank you for your creativity."
910,"Loved the character of Refaat Ismail, the script is amazing and last but not least the suspense !Can't wait to see season 2.
Well done everyone"
911,"It's true that if, say, The CW put out a show like Paranormal, it wouldn't really be highly rated.However, this show completes its objectives. It is a great show for Arab viewers to watch while, for once, finding relatability that stems from that the show is set in 1960s Egypt and brings out and embraces its entire culture, using it to drive the plot forward instead of shying away from it to bring a story that would fit in a Western setting.All of that aside, the show isn't bad. The story is very appealing. The cinematography is impressive to say the least. And most importantly, the protagonist Refaat Ismail (Ahmed Amin) is phenomenal. You have to buy Refaat's character in order to enjoy the show, and Ahmed Amin sold Refaat hard. The rest of the characters are perfect for the setting, and Maggie (Razane Jammal) is a great bridge between Arabs and international audiences, and her character is amazing (as is her performance)."
912,"An amazing start for our beloved paranormal books
great job to all the team and the godfather ahmed khaled tawfiik the author we miss u, R.I.P , wish u had seen your work come to life"
913,"Script/Scenario: 6/10
Graphics: 7/10
Storyline: 7/10
Directing/Filming: 8/10
Acting: 8/10
Soundtracks: 9/10Overall: 7.5/10"
914,"The way ahmed amin and amr slamah shows their combination of the character of rafaat ismail was intelligent although the story was not 100% copied from the main novel but i would them to edit it more and make it more powerful than the novel , this will not make the novel spoiled but it would help us understanding and joining the scenes and have more powerful feeling and cooprating while watch better , i rated 8 out 10 and this is too much less than i imagine"
915,Outstanding making and acting. Ahmed Amin proved to be a world class actor
916,A great show to watch worth watching. Love it so much. Great actor ahmed amin.
917,"A dramatic work that is considered new for us as Egyptians. Filming, making out clothes, and decor. All the details were impressive."
918,It's a great start .. the music is awesome .. the cast and everything are amazing .. i am going to end all the episodes now
919,"It is a huge jump for Arabic TV shows, specially Egyptian shows.
This work is beyond normal for Arabs.
It actually mixed the western and middle eastern work in one, Mythical creatures that you don't expect, a reshape of what horror movies and series are about in the Middle East.
This is different than anything you have ever saw and that is why I loved it."
920,"I urge you to start watching. From the very start, this show is *fantastic*. The story and narrative are wonderfully written, there is never a dull moment, and the characters offer a full spectrum of emotion, especially our lead character, Refaat. There is great depth to the background of each character, and the whole story pieces together and converges beautifully by the end of the show. The music and sound department has also done a remarkable job, and the direction and cinematography are simply exceptional. Overall, the quality is at par with the Netflix productions made by seasoned filmmakers with big budgets, and it is highly respectable how well-made and powerful this show is."
921,A beautiful series .. I am proud that it is an Arabic series with such strength .. I am waiting for the second season with great enthusiasm
922,My greeting for Netflix and actor's it's a perfect series
923,"Slow start, and a very bad CGI in ep 4. Otherwise immensely enjoyed this character driven story. Humour might be lost in translation but as an Arabic speaker I found it struck a comedic tone that complemented the more spooky aspects.."
924,"A fun series, the story is beautiful and successful, the character of Rifaat was beautiful and performed by a wonderful actor, but the women were not successful at work and they did not have a great touch in this work, my review of the series 8 of 10"
925,"I have read all the books when I was 14.
What a lot of people need to understand here that this isn't a novel. Not even near. These were teenage short-story books. ( I'm not under valuing Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq). However, what I am pointing at is some of the episodes and the stories might seem silly to us as an a grown up adults. (Gorilla in the desert ?). however they were scary/interesting enough to spark my curiosity me when I was a teenager.
It's not the perfect example but it's like when you have watched harry Potter when you were a kid vs watching it now as an adult.
Overall. It's not that scary of a show as you might think. Also. A lot of it is based on some pure Egyptian superstitions. Which would make it more interesting to Egyptians in general and the late 80's and 90's generatios who grew up with the books. So I understand the chance of being disappointed if you are a foreigner.Overall. Acting is incredible. Cinematography is superb. Music is incredible.
CGI? Couldn't be wrose."
926,"The first Egyption serie on Netflix
I think it's very usam"
927,"I love horror and this series is a mixture of horror, science, myths, creatures and also a little humour. The story is so addictive and the characters are just on different especially Dr. Reefat Ismail. The BGM gave me Harry Potter vibes and I loved it. Its a fun, entertaining series so have a watch, I bet you gonna love it!!!"
928,As an arabic show series on Netflix it was one of the best
929,I started to watch this ..and i thought that i will see another failure...but i have been shocked instead ....this is one of the perfect TV series i have ever seen ...i hope i see another season for this greatness
930,"The best ever, i haven't seen such a masterpiece from egyption actors and director
Ahmed ameen just keep going 🙏 🙌 good bless u"
931,"Great cinematography isn't new to egyptian movies and tv shows, but what's new is the quality of the making regarding the set, the storylinea and the casting. The graphics isn't that good but not bad. What's really really bad about this show is the dialogue, it's surprisingly bad that it's almost empty."
932,"The show is very good to watch and it has an interesting story. Mainly it encourage you to avoid fearing from the unknown and start searching in the causes.
The only issue is the very poor CGI. I hope it got better in the next season."
933,"Am not fan of paranormal Movies or series,The dialog was deep and excellent, Ahmad Amin performance was Marvelous as first work. Some of Arts are not up to this Era but dressing was fantastic."
934,"Very nice series
-The story is good .
-Photography is great.
-Acting very well, especially Rifaat Ismail, whose acting was excellent.
-CGI is bad"
935,"Ahmed Khalid Tawfik's dream was to see this tv show and I can't deny he had a point of view in that.. this was an amazing experience I was proud to see an Egyptian tv show so good like this on an international platform like Netflix.Ahmed Amin was soo good in playing dr refaat and the way they visualized his inner monologues was amazing..
-------------------------
#mg_series_reviews"
936,Great show specially last 3 episodes but very bad cgi in episode 3
937,"From my POV paranormal is a very good series in fact probably the best Arabic series I've ever watched, I know a lot of people r complaining about the CGI but I didn't actually see it that bad it wasn't good tho that's why I gave it a 9. Good scenario perfect acting and a very promising filming as well"
938,"I haven't seen any egyptian series that comes with a perfect story since 10 years ago.
So i recommend this show for those who like watching mysterious series btw it's not a horror movie but sometimes it attracts you with the mysterious scenes that might make you afraid"
939,It's is great considering it's one of the first Egyptian making TV shows on Netflix and the story is great and the actors are amazing maybe the side characters were boring a bit but they were acceptable but the graphics were bad to be honest just not great and the hype is overrated but I understand and I think from my opinion it's worth to give it a try and watch it and I'm waiting for a season 2
940,Iam egyptian but it's very slow in a side then going faster and womans are not good enough than Ahmed amin..continue with better
941,"Considering that the first Egyptian Arabic show
cinematography 10
music 10
story 8 ( as a fan to the the original novels and Dr Ahmed Khaled Tawfik )
the novel better than the show
but overall 10/10"
942,"For the first time you can find an Arabic mysterious and thrilling series . Finally great papers are turned into a respectable production. If i compare the original novel with the series i would prefer the novel for sure but still find the series satisfactory specially with a promising actor like ( Ahmed Amin ) and the production by Netflix .
Paranormal deserves to be watched and you will never regret . I hope they could produce the whole parts of the novel"
943,I love this type of series and this a good work taking from egypt
944,"A new experience for the egyptian TV series, a thriller horror, great actors choice.
Based on Paranormal novel series by Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfeek may he RIP.
Waiting anxiously for more seasons to follow."
945,"Its agreat start for an Egyptian drama on netflix
But it must improve graphically in the future seasons"
946,A great series made from a great Egyptian novels and the casting choices are great and the nailed the characters in the novels
947,"Thrilling and Great adaptation of Dr. Tawfiq original story and great actors ,but the cgi for demons was average."
948,"Different types of horror and thriller , and I have liked that so much specifically The last two episodes were rules , I liked The whole idea of each episode is a standalone it has its own myth
but in the same time it's all connected somehow
, So you get all of that in the 60th In Egypt , I meant to tell you Come on man"
949,"It's a great Egyptian series so now we hold it to a higher standard than other Egyptian series. Lots of Egyptian will give 10 cause they're comparing it to other mass produced Egyptian drama with married couples going through a tough times nonsense.
A well thought out, well written series with good directing & cinematography is not very common with the 30 episodes full of fillers episode written to fit a certain ""star"". This series they care about the story telling & how they'll represent it to the audience. You can see the effort to perfect the story & how much the lead character carries the burden of presenting the story effortlessly & keep the audience engage & invested in the character.
It definitely deserves a high ratings but not a 10 stars as they still have room for improvement & a long way to go to build other characters, improve the CGI & build the whole world of these stories more & make the audience more invested in other characters other than the leading man as all the female characters in the story are 2 dimensional with no character development & main purpose for them is to support the leading man whenever he needs it."
950,The main actor Ahmed Amin really did amazing work specially at the moment he was talking in his head he could do it perfectly awesome and the crew were not that popular but instead of that they could really do the parts they had as perfect as it's not even acting from the big brother till the little terrified boy I loved the serious it's aweeeeesome
951,"I really loved the show in general , i personaly dont find it scary or anything i just love the story but what really botherd me was episod 3 with the horrible gorilla like it was really bad and a turn off for me
I am egyptian tho and im really proud of how the show turned out to be but its not a 10 for me."
952,"I had low expectations but I was surprised, I loved everything about this show especially Ahmed Amin's character (Rafaat Ismael), His acting was phenomenal, The only downside about this show is the CGI for me, for example episode 3's CGI kinda destroyed the tension, overall I recommend giving it a try."
953,"A good leap in the Egyptian drama, no more 30 episodes 1 season boring style! However, CGI is a bit bad, and it is more of a thrill story not a horror one!"
954,"Unexpected and fresh, I enjoyed this one. I liked the story and the mythology used. I liked how they kept things open in the end, so hoping they continue the story.
Was nice to get a glimpse of Egyptian culture."
955,"Overall, the series is good, but CGI was very primitive, and there's no depth in the secondary characters."
956,"It is nice really but it could br better
The storyline is amazing but we need more better visual effect"
957,"This TV show is different beginning point for the Egyptian series ,the actors were very good . Story is very good and was written very well with much details which is very important to make the story very good . But cgi graphics are a little poor and needs to be much better than this ."
958,I want to say that's great to me but but not great for all people i think if them watch it again in The right atmosphere it will be great.
959,"I am very proud of doing something like this and it is of high technology and the representative performance is very wonderful with the music, the picture and the directing and I hope to do the second part"
960,The protagonist is a character you grow to love so much. Cynical sense of humour but a lot of wisdom and kindness. The story is very well written and the series are well directed. I even love the soundtrack.
961,I liked these series. They are different from horror movies that we usually see. The series didn't have lots of jump scares or disgustingly terrifying scenes. It is scary because it makes one think about the story and relate to its personalities not just because a scary face popped up on the screen. It reminded me of when my grandpa was telling me scary incidents that happened to him when he was younger.
962,Cinmategrofy is awsoome and the voice of ahmed amin is leagndary
963,Yes Hari Krishna Nagar near you and your team and the second time in the morning
964,"For these guys saying it is bad show or its not worth it I just want to say the book this show based on is more than 80 books for **** it can be made into 10 seasons I mean they are just starting the graphics is not that poor it's very similar to ""the 100"" show , they are using the same technology , so instead of saying "" it doesn't worth it "" make a real preview and say please do a real preview and tell the things u want to add or remove from this awesome showthe second thing is the rating with 10 stars some previews said that Egyptian people are voting their show well..... there is 4000 (10 stars) rate 1500 of them are from USA and the rest are from around the world so stop being bit*h*s"
965,"The best thing in this series is Ahmad Amin act
& the soundtrack was so perfect 👌🏻But the cgi was bad I hope they will Develop it in the next season."
966,To be honest it wasn't scary but rather creepy and i was so deep into it to the point that it was in another world when i start watching except the 3thd episode
967,"I never thought that the novels
I have read on my childhood.... ...
would be converted into a series ........
That would leads to the total destruction of the original novels ..............
However, the series did not completely disappoint me .
It is true that there is a great deviation from the original novel ................
{As if the scriptwriter is trying to compete with the novelist in suspense.}
the first episode.......
(The myth of the house)It was introduction to the personality of Dr. Rifaat ......
To my surprise, I liked the character so much, I never imagined that the actor could impersonated Dr. Rifaat.....The same dark-minded personality with a black sense of humor ..... the Grambling face while telling jokes.......
You couldn't tell if he is joking or mocking everything around him..............(That makes me almost die laughing ........)YES...... It's didn't follow the novel precisely.......What happened to the blue eyes of Shiraz, (which are blue as the surface of the water)which why Dr.Rifaat the child was attracted too because he had not seen blue eyes in his life ????????But as I said earlier.... the episode was introductory of character...........Than come the seriously funny sceneDr.Rifaat
(This bacteria of the Dubococcus type lives in pairs .......???? ...
and Maggie shows him a picture of schistosomiasis while swimming in the microscope .........??????? ... but initiative's humor
why Dr.Rifaat stop invite girls to dance floor......????
The very short and cold in English way answer by Maggie
(it a shame)The embarrassing situation....... When
Dr. Rifaat, came to the family lunch with that includes his fiancée ... accompanied by Maggie.......
????????
the second episode :-
the myth of the curse pharaoh .........
beautiful......wonderful ..... despite its lack of important details ....
What is wrong with using crystals .(As in the original novel) ........They are more elegant than those scarabs that lived for thousands of years ?
Why are they shortened like this..............
Where are honey, onions, and the kitchen ......... Scene?????
the third episodeFrankly, it was disappointing,
who (Al-Assas is A Gruela ...(and Loy) is the same Doctor as Dr. Lucifer ........... from the myth of the Tarot cards .and Dr. Rifaat became capable ( romance??? ) ....
he almost recite A poem...
(on badof his dying fiancée Howayda) ........ ????
Episode four
(the myth of Naiad )that one wiped away all the disappointments that I had received from the previous episode (The myth of the Cave Guard)....Frankly speaking, the episode .... despite the deviation from the original story ..... but it is my favorite one ...
(Why did Rida die?) ... .....
to add an atmosphere of black calamity ... so that Dr. Rifaat would believe for little superstition......I loved the episode very, very, very much .............. .......The Fifth episode
(the myth of incubus)I would knock my head against the wall.....Why was the original story changed in this horrible way, that was more scarry than the shape of incubus
Where is the original horrific story that made me cross from childhood to manhood???????
Where is The highlights of the story (The Necromancy)Has the director forgotten the Necromancy???? How could he??????I think he needs a visit from the incubus) ...........
Sixth episodeThe myth of house returned ???....Frankly, real horror .... and interesting suspense, despite the very shortening of the terrifying scenes ........ For the first time, I watch our horror in the Arabic language, inspired by an Arabic novel .......
honestly interesting a thousand times ...... ..... I hope to see more ..... and more and more ....... from the series paranormal"
968,"I would definitely recommend watching this serie.. Cast is very well-chosen, and what I loved the most is being able to hear those wonderfully written lines that one loved from the original book and upon which this serie was based. Very well done and good luck with the upcoming seasons 👏👏👏👏!!"
969,"Well done production and am glad the director and the actor stayed true to the original books, especially to the character of Dr. Refaat Ismail with is hilarious sarcastic comments."
970,"A wonderful series by all standards, and the actor Ahmed Amin is a legend coming and i awaits the second part"
971,"Many people downrate the work like those stock in novels they read and some non Egyptians. So, don't blame others for overrating and don't judge! We are not professional in that career. As for me I enjoyed watching the series overall despite I don't like movies about ghosts. It is a nice start as an arabic ""horror / suspense"" series yet needs much improvement regarding graphics, editing and director. I thank all actors esp Amin."
972,"I think the first time i watched this show i wasn't Really interested to the rest of actors, but that doesn't mean they were bad but Ahmed Amin did a great job that made me focus on his acting more that the acting of the rest of the actors, realy GOOD JOB!"
973,"I am an egyptian,but I didn't expect this much from an egyptian show,the show is good ,sometimes scary, mostly dramatic
I hope the next seasons are better and with a company other than netflix because it cancels shows for no obvious reasons"
974,"I am from Egypt and I will tell you my personal opinion, for me the story is amazing it shows the dark side of our life with a touch of dark comedy also the love triangle was amazing and Ahmed amin did nice work in acting, also the crew helped in confirming the message but the only mistake they didn't care about it is the CGI the monsters were not the best, they seemed to be fake but although it is still a good show!"
975,"Of all my life, this is the first time I see an Arabic well written script, that made me love the character.A very well execution for the story.Excellent director, an amazing writers.My first time writing a review."
976,If they ask me about beyond nature: they ask you if you're fine but you're not really fine etc.
977,If they ask me about paranormal: they ask you if you're fine but you're not really fine etc.
978,"I just finished watching #Paranormal series on Netflix. O.M.G.!!
I am so impressed, speechless! #Ahmed Amin you jumped too high with the character of Dr. Refaat_Ismael; it's even better than how I used to imagine him in my childhood, when I started to read these brilliant novels by Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfiq.
the Director\Producer Amro Salama, man, You hit the Auteur level by creating this distinctive visual art! not only this, you made your own master piece of the ""Miseenscene"". In the same time, all I watched was just the pilot episode! usually, we can't count on it to judge the whole series compared to the pilot. But you just nailed it!
Can't forget to mention the excellent D.O.P. Ahmed Beshary, just fabulous, speechless, extensive, and expensive picture, and how he managed the lights with each character and scene's mood! One word, fantastic.
Please, proceed on season two immediately NOW, by order of love!Thank you all cast & crew of the #Paranormal series, from the bottom of my heart.
#Netflix"
979,I love it very much it is very good work and very scary
980,Absolutely good work and a very big shift to new ideas written by the late Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq
981,"I wating next sesone.

982,It's very interesting to watch that I hope to watch sacond part please I like rifaat Ismail and shiraz it's moving dark I don't like vicual effects it's bad I hope in part 2 get better
983,"This show is amazing It's not that scary show that scares you by jumpscares which I like this type of shows and the actor I didn't expect the comedian Ahmed Amin to be this good and the child actor reem abd elkader was pretty good too just the 3rd episode wasn't that good, good but not great."
984,"When you make a recipe of the best of music , casting , art director, location , color grading and for sure the story which is based on one of the top seller novels in the middle east , the result of all of that is this show .
BUT , don't compare with the original novels so you can enjoy the show ."
985,"I am Egyptian but you know this series is not for everyone.Not everyone one like the horror movies, series's.
I know this series to anyone isn't an Egyptian is a strange to see because is the first Egyptian series on Netflix .But that's isn't the greatest series . Thats a normal one.
The series did not come with a new idea, but it implemented the usual idea in a beautiful waythat he deserves 8/10 because of the direction and the beautiful performance of the actor Ahmed Amin, but the beautiful performance was not from all the actors.And this is only my opinion ."
986,"So so so nice
I love this very much
I want more from this"
987,"As Egyptian, i think about the show is great effort compared to other shows in the same category.
Moving forward i think we can do better."
988,The thing i don't like is it is a bit too much unrealistic but overall i had fun
989,The best series ever i like to watch it for the third time
990,"A very well made fiction about our insecurities, director, cast, music, shooting, all together form a unique visual experience am sure it will at least get you satisfied if not fascinated, from the beginning till the end of E 6 , you feel like you are fully taken inside another world of dreams, i can not wait next season"
991,Be calm...!!! nobody will blam you if a cheap series got 187 rank .... Game of throne very expensive and full of CGI but day after day people got boring of the random ideas in the stories .... Today we have new great ideas from different countries around the world ..... Regular users can't estimate 198 country this condition is acceptable only if we will estimate one production only ....Hollywood of course......be fair
992,"Very good 👍 perfect nice 👌 cool
Ahmed Amin perfect actor
Amr salama is perfect director"
993,"It's amazing star and It's amazing ending and
very very amazing photography and great music"
994,"The spectator expected the serries is horor that wrong . The serrias is thrill like a novel.
You have to know that befor watching..
Its good work"
995,You should stay concentrated all the time. I LOVE this
996,"The series is based on the same name series of written stories, written by the great egyptian writer Ahmed Khalid Tawfik.
It reflected the egyptian culture myth with this good promising start in Arabic horror series.
Main actor Ahmed Amin was perfect in performing Refaat Ismael, the music is amazing and scary.
I loved it.
Not to compare to Great horror series and movies from Hollywood, but a very promising and good start in the middle east.
Good luck to all of the series team"
997,"I love this, thanks Ahmed ameen you were amazing on doing new character."
998,"I was surpised that the show was really good. Highly recommend to everyone who likes ""paranormal"" shows."
999,Very good work i advise all i know to watch it fantastic
1000,"A very cool series that deserves to be watched .. Bravo, the cast"
1001,"I admit that I was skeptical about this series as it gained popularity in a concerning way and me, myself though it was overrated but I was actually surprised!
The show wasn't perfect, but it was great in many aspects, Ahmed Amin really nailed this role, the production was great, scenes, music and cinematography were really amazing and gave an atmospheric setting making you feel the warmth of Egypt in the 60s and earlier.What excites me the most so far, that this is just the beginning with the first Egyptian Netflix Original Series kickstarting what's more to come, and I'm really looking forward the next season of this satisfying works!
With great plots and adaptations of these great Egyptian novels - the one at hand is from the great Ahmed Khalid Tawfiq - I guarantee that It would yield phenomenal works! I loved it! 9/10"
1002,An unbelievable breakthrough in the history of Egyptian drama .. It is very amazing the truth is about a great novel by Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq
1003,"Well done. Doesn't follow the original books but good adaptation. More funding for season 2, more and longer episodes! I hope the characters will develop and acting will gel and mature."
1004,"Black comedy, big thriller, and good drama.
Rifaat Ismail was exceptionally well presented and I think he is the only character who is not disputed in the show."
1005,That's a very good work and will be a mark in Egyptian TV history
1006,I love it ! I wasn't expecting how interesting and fun this serie was! Hope comes a season 2!!

1008,"A series more than wonderful in the future, it will undoubtedly be one of the undisputed masterpieces of Egyptian drama."
1009,"One of the best and iconic egyptian TV shows that I have watched in the last 20 years, everything has been taken care of so good and the attention to the details was outstanding"
1010,"A series that was based on the short stories of the writer Ahmad Khaled Toufik under the same name, the back storie and climax of its revelations is stunning, it is melodramatic with a sence of humor, the sountracks are amazing, it has huge future potential."
1011,"Very attractive Series, not so terrifying but it really worth it"
1012,An interesting series and horror to the far the extent and the story of the film to the world Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq

I hope the make more seasons"
1014,"The series is very cool, the actors are great, the directing is very advanced"
1015,"Regardless of the novel which is amazing, it is always impossible to transform a novel into a movie or a series, books give your imagination the space to draw the pictures while movies & series bring them into reality.The show is amazing, all characters were attractive, the main characters reminded me of ""breaking bad"" hero ""Walter white"" who was just an ordinary teacher who turned to be the opposite at the end.Seeing Dr. Refaat Ismail who is a doctor whom believes in science living all those paranormal activities around him and trying not to believe it because it is against his believes was something great.I believe the visual effects in one episode ( the 3rd ) could be done in a better way but still acceptable for a team who is a making a horror series for the 1st time as a production.And if I can vote, episode 5&6 were rocking and deserves 10/10 rating.To all members of the crew, thanks for such an amazing job and very excited for the 2nd season.For those looking for a unique series to watch, really recommend paranormal for you."
1016,"Well, I've seen the show twice, and every time I've enjoyed the work of great actor ahmed amine,
hope see another season 😉
dr. ahmed khalid twfik God have mercy on you🌺"
1017,"Actually i have enjoyed this, the cinematography is epic the soundtrack make you feel like dreaming
I loved seeing the beautiful Egyptian myths, the streets of classic Egypt this was very classy
The general atmosphere of the show is creepy and thrilling
The only thing that i didn't like
The rush in ending the situation and the cgi was poor at sometimes
I hope they make another seasons"

1020,Best Egyptian series i've ever seen thx for Netflix and the crew of this series ❤
1021,Its just amazing I wish thay do a s2 fast because i love it sooo much
1022,Great start for an egyptian netflix show. The story telling is great. Actors were awesome. But I would reconsider the CGI
1023,"A very nice production (thank you NETFLIX) it was about time that Egyptian drama took back the place it lost a while back, The casting is exceptionally good ( a few minor mishaps in the children casting) Ahmed Amin marks his status as a serious actor , Razan is a talent no doubt as well as Aya who was very convincing in her role, the rest of the cast is quiet good Specially the Albino doctor (Batea Khalil).
all in all I think its a promising start I hope more will follow."
1024,"Honestly I am surprised. Well done I am satisfied. I like the colors , Music. The acting I am familiar with the story line caused I read the books."

1034,Excellent series and perfect if you need to watch some arabic series
1035,"I was afraid that the series will not be able to convenice a person like me who read the stories more than ten times. On the contract, I felt like I am watching Dr rafat Ismail himself. I like how they connected the different stories together, the music, the acting and everything. Great work 👍"
1036,"First horror Egyptian series that took it all to the next level. I am stunned to see all these amazing actors, extremely new way of shooting scenes and the amazing story telling scenario that was perfectly well made.

I expect session two to be extremely better and more thrilling than it already was ! Can't wait.."
1037,"Thanks for a great show, Was a fan of the novels and can't wait for part 2"
1038,"It is excellent and funny, but when i tried to buy the authors books couldn't find any in English."
1039,"As the trailer is so bad the series is quite the opposite, such a smart thriller series well written and directed, ahmed amin is such an amazing charismatic actor, but truly the cgi was stupidly bad"
1040,"Nice graphics, perfect acting and professional actors. It's totally perfect"
1041,"As a start of Egyptian of paranormal category.
Its worth to watch.
Need some improvement specially in graphics. But overall its ana amazing experiment.
The final episode for me is the best"
1042,"Amazing footage, storyline and acting by the lead actor.
A job well done"
1043,"Nice shots with fantastic motion, and not good cgi but good actors"
1044,"Every thing is perfect except graphics may be accepted because of it is a paranormal emagination but should be better in the next season, Otherwise it is a really great series especially Ahmed Amins' acting performance and sound effects."
1045,"Taking into consideration that it is a fresh experiment for an Egyptian Netflix show we all should support ,, this is really satisfying especially camera shots ,, music ,, Ahmed Amin 's brilliance in Refaat Ismail 's complicated role"
1046,The script is unique. It's a new story. You must watch it.
1047,"Wonderful series, Ahmed Amin excelled in the role of the doctor, some mistakes, but the whole combination of suspense and comedy"
1048,"I like this series so much , yes there are some things need to improve in next
parts but at all i like what i saw beginning with the fantastic Acting from all the cast and ending with the fantastic Directing ,
message to Amr Salama and Ahmed Amin : Really good job and i waiting the second part from now"
1049,"Great Performance by Ahmed Amin, amazing soundtrack, final episode nothing more
The graphic scene for gorilla wasn't good at all and the (Gathom) that was running behind ""Refaat"" in his dreams also was like a halloween suit and mask, I loved the series because of ""Refaat Ismail"" brilliant performance, and amazing soundtrack, little kid that acted as ""Shirz"" was very good, Last Episode was the best one, hoping for season 2 but need to improve graphics"
1050,One if my favorite series despite its not long but i hope it has more seasons a

1053,"Amazing performance , the series on 6 episodes will take your breath away.
chapeau Amr Salama the greatest director and the talented Ahmed Amin as DR. Refaat"
1054,"A really good series and getting out a story from Dr. Ahmad Khalid Tawfiq's best novels ,new experience of Egyptian drama, egypt has a treasure of novels, which can work on television, but the series has some mistakes of the graphics-and just like this, just as we see the story has not yet finished and i hope the next season is better than this. Thank you to all the manufacturers. His experience was beautiful, and especially thanks to Ahmed, the representative, who has a great future."
1055,First time for me to spend all of these amount of hours in front of tv because of the creativity
1056,"A series of Beyond Nature, Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq"
1057,Best Egyptian series in my eyes it actually beats stranger things for me and Lucifer it just upscaled my expectations af I hope there is a second season
1058,Really wonderful. I did not expect to see such wonderful Egyptian work wait season 2
1059,"I started to watch paranormal yesterday and I finished all the episodes one time, it's an amazing music, cast and sound effects
It's one of the best series I ever seen"
1060,"Well, my opinion on Paranormal in quick points:1- Acting is great. All the actors are great, of course, lead by Ahmed Amin. They played their role perfectly. The whole series is cast from the smallest role to the biggest one. The acting in episodes whose director is not Amr Salama are not like the episodes that were directed by him personally, and this is very clear in the episodes From 2-4, I don't know why there is more than one director for the series. In my opinion, there was no need for more than one director, it had to be all directed by only Amr Salama.2- Directing, filmmaking, cinematography, and lighting are amazing means that the lead director, Amr Salama, and the DOP have performed their role in terms of technique as it should be.3- Color correction, grading, and sound mixing of the finest.4- Music, of course, there is no word that gives it its right, Bravo Khaled Al Kamar.5- Script and the treatment is a disaster, it is completely unacceptable for a novel and a series of such size and production to have such weak script & treatment.6- Now with the worst nightmare and shock... The graphics! What a bad level! How can a series with such size has such a hilarious CGI and VFX, especially that Egypt has gone way beyond this level a long time ago, whether in 'blue elephant' or 'El Ekhtyar' or 'Les Baghdad' whose graphics by the way was done by Aroma (the same company who did the graphics for Paranormal).. I am surprised, how did Netflix agree to these scenes in which the graphics are of this level, and as far as I know they were approving each and every scene after post-production? In addition, the company who worked on graphics is not a small company, it is one of the biggest companies in this field in Egypt.Finally, the series in general is very good and a great step for Egypt to enter the international drama through a great platform like Netflix, and the series, in my opinion, has publicly succeeded with some comments on script and graphics. Other than that, it is a wonderful series and a wonderful and great effort is being made in it A new genre to us in the Egyptian drama. Bravo to all the staff, thank you, NetflixI really need to know your honest opinion and comments especially that this was my first Ad to write the creative for and the first project with such scale that I become responsible for on behalf of the agency."
1061,"Woooow what an amazing series , i can't wait to watch season 2"

1072,This was the first time I saw any Egyptian television series and I have to say I'm impressed. Paranormal keeps you want to know what happens next with all of the mystery relating to evil. Some scenes are definitely frightening and cinematography is amazing. Overall it is recommended and worth it because it only has 6 episodes.
1073,Excellent just only 6 episodes but i think its very creative
1074,It's completely great and acting by ahmed amin ((reafat ismail) was amazing and the graphics were low because of low budget for first season of an arabic series Netflix of course wasn't sure about success but it made it and i hope next seasons be better because the real book is wonderful

1101,"Very amazing performance. Thumbs up Ahmed Ameen and Amr Salama for this incredible series and I can't wait for the coming seasons. Luckily I didn't read the books so I don't have to compare the show to the original story. once I started watching I couldn't stop till the end of the 6th episode at which point I realized that these people should've made more episodes 🙄.this is show is for everyone to watch from around the world, I am sure they'd be as amazed and intruiged as I was during watching the episodes.The whole cast was really good especially Ahmed Ameen who felt like a natural fit for this character. I hope it gets even better in the next seasons and they make more episodes."
1102,"First egyptian TV series on Netflix, I watched it and enjoyed a lot"

I have not finish it yet, and not sure if i will"
1104,"Loved to see dear refaat ismail alive on screen and ahmed amine was a genius. Episode 6 is the best. Graphics need to be more professional
But the real critical point is refaat's true character. He was more cynical with a hilariously funny personality in the novel than on screen. Ahmed amine could nail the true character in a much better way"
1105,When I saw the series I felt that it was a international series and it will done great job
1106,"It's a good job we hope to go a head soon.

I would give it 10/10"
1124,"The story is different, acting is almost perfect but the special effects and monsters was very humble but still the best arabic series till now ."
1125,"The novels under same title for Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfik sold more than 15 million copies.. As an addict reader to him I used to set myself in a critic and even sceptic role but you guys did a really good job, you really surprised the novel fans and I should confiss I'm biting my nails waiting for season II."
1126,I was surprised I didn't expect that I can watch a tv show and make me feel amazed with how excellent everything was first from acting - cinematography - score. Personally my favorite episode is the last one. I am waiting to season 2 .

1130,I usually watch American and British tv shows cuz each time i give the chance to a local work it lets me down Lately the field has targeted a certain type of people with the worst taste and a great number in order to gain the most profits with a drastic disregard to the decent taste. I'm excited to see more like this thank you Ahmed Amin

1140,"It is fantastic work with excellent attitude
it not very Horror
it miss special sound track to become really scare."
1141,"As a fan of the original novels through out my teenage years I built my own imagination of the novel's world, and for many years I was thinking ""if these novels made into a TV series I will surely be disappointed because even if they made it so good it will sure not be as I imagined it"".
But what a pleasant surprise it is when I watched it, may be not exactly what I imagined but close enough and nicely done.
My only two comments would be the bad graphics, especially in the desert episode, and that the series' start didn't make a fine character establishing so that we ""especially the people who are not previously familiar with the novels"" get to know the characters better and get more involved with them through out the story.
but the overall experience is exceptional, breathtaking and well made."
1142,"Just wow, can't stop watching, one of the greats TV series I ever seen."
1143,"Thanks Netflix for such an amazing show , really can't wait , music and characters was good"

1198,Well the first episode I see and it's just so good in psychological horror I like it and i would like to see more even though it's an Arabic series but its better than a lot of American series I hope they continue on this rate of performance
1199,"Great show and the cinematography was excellent, but very poor graphics"
1200,"A new kind of series in Egypt
Ahmed amin get out of comedia and give us a new curcter we didn't imagine it will be like that i hope a second session 🖤"
1201,"The series is more than amazing, the actor has a very convincing performance, and all the actors have a very convincing performance, Bravo Egypt 👏👏👏👏👏"
1202,"Can't wait until season 2, Ahmed Ameen and Amr Salama better than expected, music is a fantastic, thanks for a wonderful a series."

1205,"I didn't expect to see Dr Refaat the main character in the series in the screen , it's surprising me , I like this kind of talent and sarcastic people .
The series it was great , I'm waiting for season 2."
1206,Nice and it will be a good start for egypt in Netflix
1207,"Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfiq, the popular author of this long awaited series wrote many novels, which are often listed as the top books in the Middle East, this Paranormal series must be followed by another seasons and another series based on his books as it has a high welcome across the world.
We can't get more pleasure than what we get from this series, Ahmed Amin is a brilliant actor indeed.
We hope to get another season soon abd more series's to come based on Dr. Ahmed Khalid books.
This rating is well deserved."
1208,"Big forward step in the Egyptian shows
Hope see next seasons"
1209,The mystery in this series will take you to a different planet . Must be seen
1210,"That was phenomenal by all measures. After years of watching Egyptian Cinema being limited to stories about poor guy losing his dad and then trying to fight the world to be someone in power or someone trying to get married. But this was amazingly different. It was a mix of drama, comedy, supernatural, and I'm waiting for more seasons and really proud of such great work done by the amazing Ahmed Amin."
1211,"Well, at first I'm Egyptian and I understand the hype the series is getting from other Egyptians.
And I actually agree that the show is promising but it has obvious and clear flaws! Specially in cgi
I don't mean it's bad ofc but definitely doesn't deserve a 10!
I hope next season they will avoid these mistakes as that might be production or budget problems therefore it could be fixed next season
Any way this thing is good and it's worthy of your time"
1212,The atmosphere of the series that introduces you into an interesting world
1213,I am proud of Egypt to produce this fantastic tv series
1214,"Actor ahmed amin's performance is thrilling
Director is not the best thing-could be better
Music is great
Story is very rich"
1215,"This cast is amazing
This cast is amazing
This cast is amazing"
1216,"More than perfect 👌🏻
The actors, the music and everything was perfect
I loved it"
1217,"Excellent work and can't wait the next season,
Thanks Netflix and crew of series
Egypt has more talented people"
1218,"Through episodes you will doubt wether there is paranormal phenomen or its the mind that make us believe it ...with good sequence describes Refaat Ismaail and his bad luck in every thing that appears not to be luck and it is planned by ghosts or planned by his mind...this approach in horror series is quite intersting and adds sepcial flavor....
direction in all episodes is very impressive and special effects are very good
episode 3 special effects for the great gorilla needed some improvement but the episode story is very good as well as direction
in episode 4 ...i felt the story went far from its purpose ...but in last episode it became why it was told...
the Actor ahmed amin usually sawn in perviuos projects as comidian but here he can perform trajedy and can use his talent in mockery in briliant way to reflect refaat ismail's thoughts who is a serious scientist
the actress who played magi was quite impressive as well as the actress who played hoida ...the young girl who played shiraz could reflect very good acting regaldess her age...Ahmed Dash appeared in short scence but it was very good actor and made it very well and I was happy to see him ....the directors used the talents of other actors to make complete and good story based on brilliant writer's books (Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq)"
1219,"Awesome work for the Egyptian team .
Grata for any salaam and ahmed amin"
1220,"This series is very interesting and I will recommend it to anyone
I'm very proud it's a Egyptian series
All casting us perfect and music ang cinma photography"
1221,"Iam not a big fan of horrour movies or even series, but this series is kinda different .. it frankly mix between what our sivilized, modernized brain process and the anicient myths and paranormal creepy thougts."
1222,"Very satisfied
music awesome
actors was great
wonderful show you have to see it all"
1223,If you forgot the bad cgi sometimes you will really love this show in acting and the background music and the amazing story
1224,They only paid 250k dollars to make this series unbelievable!!! it is awesome for this amount of money the graphics arent so good of the paranormal creatures but i think it was because of the very little amount of money they had to spend
1225,From the best arab tv show or series and ranked from best tv shows in last years in world
1226,Can't wait for the second season :) Ahmed Amin did an awesome job :)
1227,I like it and I think this series will be a great beginning for Egyptian horror movie good look.

1233,"When the actors, cinematography, music and the vibes let you in and don't let you feel bored or checking the time while watching so you are watching a different work that deserves the good propaganda and feedback. Excited to see the next step."
1234,"If AMR Salama and the cast want to deliberately repel Ahmad Khaled Tawfeek's sereis fans they wouldn't find something more alienator than the first 3 United and naivy episodes
Surprisingly the last 3 made a different piece of art ..in fact my detailed rating was from 1st to 6th ep. As follows : 7,4,5,8,9,10
Making an average of 7 mathematically , and as a final courtesy gesture for the man "" Ahmad Khaled Tawfeek"" I made it an 8"
1235,"I'm sad, it's only 6 episodes
That's great job
It is great that this series is an Egyptian Arab work"
1236,"Best Arabic series ever seen...
Good actors, brilliant director
God bless your soul Dr.Ahmed Khalid Tawfik 💙💙💙"
1237,"The series has great cinematography and soundtrack what really uniq in this series that you show an original Arabic horror stories translated to the small screen also what is so important about that you get to see one of the most beloved fictional character of all time (rafat ismaiel)
Whith much needed improvement in cgi its very great series overall"
1238,High level of acting. R.I.P dr/Ahmed Khaled Tawfik
1239,"Great TV series based on series of paranormal novels for the Egyptian author Dr. Ahmed Khalid Tawfik, many of the mythes are based on local Egyptian horror inheritance which give you new horror aspects. The lead actor Ahmed Ameen did amazing effort to translate whats is written in the novels for the main character Dr.Refaat Ismail into flesh and blood character as millions of fans imagine and read it in the series. For sure we expect Netflix to build up on this success to make more seasons."

1248,"Music and effects are really good.
Story line and dialogue brings back lots of childhood memories"
1249,"This content is based on black drama and has several exciting and attractive corners for suspense. Unusual and different in all possible ways. You will not feel the time and will be attracted to it The decoration, montage and directing in its best form, and the performance is fabulous and distinctive in all its details. There is a great journey with Rifaat Ismail's unique character in his epic dramatic style. I enjoyed every minute of this wonderful work and I hope there will be a second part as soon as possible."
1250,"The first time for me to follow such kind of series, it's really deep and fantastic series you need to watch. It's not a horror movie but is more mysterious and mindful."
1251,"1st time for me to look for a series and wait for it
It is surprised me , hope to be more than a season , also I surprised about the Actor Ahmed Amin which he is a very funny Actor but he was in his rule I forgot all his plays before"
1252,"I have started reading this series 27 years ago and I haven't stopped going back to it.I believe this series has the potential of becoming great if the director focuses on character development without pushing certain mode on them.I also would suggest to extend the budget and actually follow the story closer to the novels instead of the changes done to save spending on new scenes and areas. If you want to include a specific storyline that has the characters travel abroad and you don't want to do that then stick to the domestic novels, don't throw many stories in for good measure."
1253,I enjoy every minute of watching this series.. Some CGi is bad but didn't effect in my total opinion.. I really want to see more seasons
1254,"I like what they made from an old script 👏🏼
Waiting for a new season soon
Ahmed amin you did a great work"

Dr.. Ahmed Khaled tawfiq"

1287,"I would like to express my deep admiration regarding this mini series which is inspired from the great Egyptian writer Mr Ahmed khaled tawfik it is unique from its kind in Egyptian drama and really worth watching, all the cast was very good also the sound track is totally perfect and really attracts you inside the scenes which made me like to watch credits after each episode to continue listening to sound track of the seriesWhat i didn't like in this series which made me put 9 instead of 10 , is that sometimes I noticed that chemistry between cast is lost or not in a strong bond , also the libyian flag when dr refaat arrived appeard to be wrong in the time of the series which was the end of 60s also the CGI was a little bit poor and not integrated firmly in scenes looks like it was inserted inside scene not part of it but overall it was perfect intiative from Egyptian producers to start this type of horror drama which were missed a lot"

I have been a big fan of the books since I was 12 , the show is very close to what I imagined the characters would be like , of course there are some changes to the story to fit as a tv show been watched by many people who did not read the books but the result is amazing , the only thing is that the CGI effects may need more work , i hope for more seasons , and I think it will happen hopefully. According to the books there will be many stories that will need way more CGI effects than season one , so please make it better"

Netflix was a good choice, and they are working on the show

1372,"I knew that it would be a great TV series, but when I watched it, it exceeded all expectations, I was hoping that the first season would contain many episodes, not just six episodes, but they are among the most amazing things that can be watched."
1373,"It's unique , original and different, The originality came out of being able to show Egyptian drama and original horror story from Egyptian folklore"
1374,"What a great web series totally worth your time the acting, the direction, the screenplay, and specially the story telling but one thing that was missing in the jump scare scenes was the horror BGM it was a bit of dramatic which doesn't make you scare in most of the scenes where you're supposed to be, but still it's worth the time"
1375,"Watch it nerds. .,.dyjdthvfgjbffhhgsiydoydoydydoyoydoyoyddoyoydydoydoydoydyodohdydkydldydoydoydyodoydoydoydoyoydoydydoydoydoydoyoydoydoydoydoudouudpydpydpudydoydydodydpdyd"
1376,I have not watch an amazing series like this before
1377,I really enjoyed watching this series. The only negative I have is that some of the monsters are a little too cartoony for the storylines they're in.
1378,"Amazing work, it was realy nice.
Am waiting for the next season"
1379,"Following the Egyptian epic pocket novel series ""Paranormal 1993 - 2014, as translated from the Arabic name (Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa - what is beyond nature)"" written by ""Dr Ahmed Khalid Tawfik 1962 - 2018"", the new TV series by Netflix made it quickly to IMDB top TV list.First of all, good job for reincarnating the spirit of the main character ""Dr Refaat Ismael, a hematologist who was not believing in paranormal things and found himself in the middle of facing many of them"", played well by ""Ahmed Amin"". As for the rest of casting were average, some of the kids as well as ""Maggie Mckillop"" were a poor selection in my opinion ""although the actress might be good but does not fit in this role with the strange Arabic accent "", but there should be a honorable mention to the Kid who played ""Shiraz"", Raaefa (Refaat\s sister) and the old lady who played Refaat 's mother.The directing was good somehow, but I think it needs more effort as well as the special effects which were good in some scenes and poor in others. Locations and decoration were almost above average, sometimes were outstanding as well as the music.Without spoiling anything, I would say that the vison of the series making
had changed/removed some of the original novels plots and characters, which might had lowered the expectations of millions of the novels' readers (which I'm one of them). I think there are many other stories that would better serve the purpose of introducing ""Dr Refaat Ismael"", his informative myth knowledge, his black sarcasm, and his epic world!Still good job and congratulations for all the cast and crew. We are looking forward to seeing better work, more effort, research and surveys to experience some of Refaat Ismael's adventures. Thank you."
1380,"I am one of the biggest fans of the Egyptian Godfather. Raised addicted to his novels. He might have had the biggest influence on me growing up a reader. Used to wait for the book fairs in Egypt in the 80s to buy his books. Exchanging his novels with friends was a common thing, I don't exhadurate when I say, I made a life time friendship with friends that the only common thing between us was the love of these books.
Salutation, love and respect to the Egyptian Godfather D. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq's soul, the pioneer of Horror fiction in Egypt and the Middle East.Now to the series. The problem with this series, it lived in the Godfather's fans imaginations for 30 years, so we had high expectations, then those expectations reached a higher level when we knew it will be produced by Netflix.The actors did a very good job, Ahmed Amin shined like a star although the scrip framed him in a way that might not match the original novels. He was so depressing and black ora surrounded him, although Refaat in the novels was a sarcastic and a funny person. He is the start of the show undisputed.A lot of people criticized Magy's character, on the contrary, I loved it so much and I didn't want to tie her to the original scrip. One point that I didn't see any one mention before is Magy's Scottish accent! Native English speakers who can distinguish accents can appreciated the perfection attention to details when it came to the Scottish accent. A great point to the actress playing Magy! Bravo!The lighting, music and videography was perfect, the people behind it did a tremendous effort that matches the ambiance the godfather wanted to reflect. Portraying Egypt in the 80s which I lived, It was done to perfection.The final thing, the CGI and the monster's effect! I can't believe a production at this level fails so low when it comes to CGI and graphics!! I was expecting more from Netflix, like seriously?!! it is like if all the good expensive Netflix monsters were contracted in other series and the producer of this show left out with the third grade monsters! This is the only thing that I detested with a passion about this work.Finally, the series got better with every episode, it was like the actors evolved with every episode and got more matured, I think if this series was 15 or 20 episode, it would've been one of the best in this decade, regardless, it leaves us wanting for more.Thank you so much Netflix, Thank you Amr Salama, Thank you Ahmed Amin, I am waiting for the second season with a passion."
1381,Netflix has done a great job of showing the novel the best way and The actors adapted the character in a unique way and Young director Amr Salama has proven that he has great talentDon't miss the first season and wait for the second season
1382,"Wow new series of netfilx

1388,"Ahmed Amin proved to be an excellent and rigid actor. I was afraid of him before the series, because he was confined to the role of the comic comedian, but after the six episodes, The Man proved that he is a true actor .. In the glory of what is the diminutive character of the deep, gloomy and miserable Doctor Rifaat, he can make you laug seriously like a verse."
1389,"Perfect story with perfect crew. I like it much..
It is a new promising future for arabic cinema .."

1399,For ahmed khalid tawfik who made the young men read
1400,Honestly the performance by the main characters is outstanding (especially Ahmed Amin) and the plot is interesting and intriguing. It's everything you want in a good series

I highly recommend the show to everyone."
1405,"Wonderful series
The staff is good and the great writer Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq"
1406,"I'm truly impressed! That exceeded my expectations , every single detail was taken into consideration; the script, their performances , the sound effects! I'm really proud. Keep going Ahmed Amin 👏🏻"
1407,"Egyptians at this movies did a great job ,,,script written by great hematology doctor ,,,we waiting for next season ."
1408,"The series contains the Arab identity, or more precisely, the Egyptian identity. The movie reminds me of the series Stranger Things. and there are some scenes that are completely adapted from it.
All the actors, I see them, have performed very well, and I hope the director will do a lot of work for the writer Dr. Ahmed Tawfiq, because he is with us from our childhood until now."
1409,"I so liked good jop He deserves to be watched, never tire of it"
1410,"The way the writter played with our minds long ago is the same way the director got this piece of art out to life on TV l, Thank you Amr Salama and thanks for each and every one who participated in this... waiting for season 2"
1411,"We love the novel series , but that dosn't mean we've to love the show that much .
The actor is great we know him as egyptions people cause he always used to be in comedy shows , he just do more than his best .. the gorila is tooooo bad also it is in desert 😠 , Maggie don't fet in , like you bring her in by force .. she was like ston in amovement planet .
Other than that, the cinematic picture is very good as well as the decor and reaction of the characters is great
Please improve the performance of the heroine Maggie in the next season, as well as not to use things that are illogical that the writer of the novel series did not mention."
1412,It is worth your time. All what you can ask for in one Masterpiece. Ahmed Amin showed capabilities an A star actor.
1413,"Despite the bad effects, it's a work worth praising.
Congratulations to everyone who worked on this mitrio."
1414,I am surprised to see such high quality Egyptian TV series
1415,Wonderful story ... Good graphics .. but fast series
1416,"I really enjoyed watching this show, the script was very good but very short, I think the events needs more time than what is given and we would really love to see more of Dr. Refat conversations.
The music and directing was decent but the make up and visual effects very weak and bad which is very disturbing since its supposed to be a horror series."
1417,"I was a reader of original books and I was a big fan of the stories and the hero Dr Refaat.
And I find this serie super great and it has his own way to tell his stories.
I loved it and I can't wait for next saisons..."
1418,"Egyptians really did a great job especially Amr Salama (the writer&director) & Ahmed Amin ""Refaat"" (main character)
Great plot,casting,visuals & places
Egypt should really be supported as it is making ALOT of new awesome films/series which are lately released/ coming soon"
1419,"Very good job ...The Show is INTENSE of emotions. You fell every part of it
LOVE ... HESITATION .... FEAR ... Sadness
The show was able to take us to Egypt with it's city and the country side lifestyle.I really like Ahmed Amin acting and character, What an over-thinking and hesitated character...who always say the opposite of what he want !! This character reached me a lot !
Ahmed Amin played the black comedy very well . It is miserable.. and in some moments he is still able to steal your laugh :OReem the young girl ... She played the role in the best possible way ! ChapeauI can say for sure there are mistakes, visualization was not the best, but still the series is excellent overall."
1420,"Amazing scoopy and smooth movie.I really like it, and I like the darkness if the scene, the performances of the actors. Specially, the last episode, on which I got so emotional and fell in love with Shiraz's character."
1421,"I won't talk about the great cinematography or the great performance of Ahmed Amin as the lead character who was by the way a comedian and this is his first serious role.
I will talk about the story that creeps you out from the start and the amazing girl who played ""Shiraz"" .
Reem Abdelkader has raw talent and a great future ahead of her."
1422,"I loved the kids' acting especially Reem who portrays sheraz, she's a natural and ibrahim as well, it's a good story based on a great novel, but the series needs a lot of work when it comes to graphics."
1423,"Apart from the poor visual effects .. It's a promising beginning for the egyptian drama.
Splendid acting from the protagonist, Excellent soundtrack, good directing.Eager to see more..."
1424,"As old novels fan, not bad at all. not so far from the original books but not so close too.. not bad to meet my fears and not great to meet my expectitions either.
I hope next season will be much more better in quality specially CGI epsoide 3 CGI is so poor. script should be as deep as it should be"
1425,"For me its my fav series i love it it's a masterpiece
I had fun with it , amr salama is a great director
Ahmed amin is a perfect actor too . Great cenimatography"
1426,This is literally a masterpiece done by the Egyptians.
1427,"This is the best Egyptian series I have ever seen its a execution for Ahmed Khaled Tawfik's novel the only bad thing was the CGI.
And I hope there's season 2"
1428,"I finished the whole tv-show in one session, I guess it has its own rythme, but yeah, worth watching."
1429,"Nice first Egyptian Netflix series, I didn't read the novel as an Egyptian in my childhood and I am not much into horror but I liked the work done and the acting, there is a a series of novel called Impossible man Adham Sabry , if Netflix could make this series it will be very good, something like 24 series even better, it could go to a lot of seasons but if made right it could boom"
1430,The music is awesome and Ahmed Amin is great actor
1431,The strong points are the the acting of Ahmed Amin and the directing of amr salama and of course the great soundtrack
1432,"The struggle between logical positivism, scientific thinking and intuitive, emotional thinking and superstitious cultureThis series reveals an inner battle that is on fire inside Dr. Reftaat's mind"
1433,"Ahmed Amin surprised me with his performance, and the direction was excellent, but the only bad thing was the graphics"
1434,The serias was very good in every Maybe the only proplem is the cgi but it was bad only in episoid 3 and the last three episoid was the best because their was many feelings and shows the the diffrens betwen the main charactar in the first and in the end and Im so exited to see what they will make in season 2
1435,"Amazing which can take you to the mystery world, recommend it so much"
1436,"It's one of the most amazing work I've ever seen, starting from the music till the choosing of the actors"
1437,Perfect series everthing is perfect from a to z and a great start
1438,"A great leap of the Egyptian/Arab drama. A perfect integration between decor, locations, lighting, sound track and effects, graphics and camera techniques.
Promising series that will definitely be developed time by time into a memorable one."
1439,"Such an amazing series, very exciting and very interesting. Music is amazing. Stories are incredible"
1440,"I love refaat ismail good job Ahmed ameen

1441,Great actors great series the best ever all the episodes are 10/10 and Netflix should start preparing for season two we are all waiting for it
1442,"Ahmed Amin is the best thing in the series
Excellent photography, excellent story and excellent acting"
1443,"Bruh, this series is something else. I really liked it and waiting for s2!!!"
1444,Great script as expected but ahmed amin really surprised me how he act perfectly with the original character from story
1445,"I just loved it, welcome back on the map, Egypt 🖤"
1446,I love it it is a good thing to do it and it will take me to a new place
1447,"Wow..... Just wow you must see it, it's the first Egyptian horror TV series on netflix"
1448,"I've been waiting a lot for the release of the first Egyptian Netflix original title. Although, I didn't have high expectations for it, but it surprised me. First of all, I didn't read the novel, but after watching the series I will definitely. The best thing in that series in my opinion is the Cinematography, Ahmed Beshary shows how he is an awesome cinematographer, along with Amr Salama, who is not only the great director of the series but he had also wrote part of the screenplay. Ahmed Amin was the one thing surprised me most, this role was a great challenge for him and he did above a great job. When I first knew that Ahmed Amin will be doing the leading role I was worried honestly, he is a great comedian but I didn't picture him in a horror movie, I think he proved me wrong. The first episode was a great start and introduced the characters and their background well. The second episode was better than the first. The third episode was terrible honestly, most of what I didn't like about it was the unrealistic CGI, also they said it's a mythical monster and then they find a gorilla in the desert and I don't know if gorillas even live in the desert. The forth episode wasn't bad and it also reflected some background relationships between the characters. The fifth episode was completely perfect, the best in the series, that was the point I was waiting for. The last episode was awesome and had a great ending. I can't wait for the next season with more stories from Paranormal. I just want people who think that it's not so good to know that nothing is flawless and we must support it."
1449,"Almost 30 years ago I started reading PARANORMAL Series for Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfeek, The hero is more than simple basic human being, not perfect, has all the issues in the world. But he reads a lot and got knowledge, always makes fun from everything starting with himself but all in his mind as he is always afraid from the outer world. Till the outer world comes to him and start playing with his mind. Even though the Series didn't get 10% of what was really written, but it makes a childhood dream comes to life.Dr. Refaat Ismael (the main character) is a teacher for a whole generation that taught us how to look at thing, read more to learn and brought knowledge to us while reading.Thanks to the Team of the series who tried there best to give life to the characters, Season 1 is only introduction to Know who is Dr. Refaat and how he became a legend, can't wait for more series to come.Paranormal is 81 book/stories plus few special editions.DR. AHMED KHALED TAWFEEK. We all love you R.I.P."
1450,"We waited for this wonderful series so much.
but it didn't fail to surprise us .
Dr Ahmed Khaled Tawfik has treasures should be discovered ..
One of them is this series."
1451,Good job keep it up egyptian proud ahmed ameen like agold respect made in egypt 😍
1452,"It is a beautiful, interesting and fun series of novels, which is why it was so interesting to see it as a series"
1453,Best horror Egyptian show ever. A Great performance from Ahmed Amin
1454,Great experience with this Egyptian masterpiece. I recommend this series for anyone
1455,"I love very much the series , I'm pumping watching this , it has all the elements of a great reality tv series."
1456,I think this is the 1st step for the egyptian actors and directors to make movies and tv shows that compete with Hollywood tv shows and this tv show have taken place at 204 of the best 250 works of the cinema so it is a very good tv show in my own opinion maybe the cgi was not the best but the story it self and the actors made a very good job at the end i would say this is a horror masterpiece
1457,"We are So proud of you dear...
Keep going
You nailed it👍"
1458,"I am a life-long fan of the books written by Dr. Ahmed Khaled Wafik. He was my childhood role model. Almost everyone in my generation was affected by his writing in some way or the other. The man was a legend in our eyes.Now, to the show itself. You can guess I am slightly biased here, but I will try hard to be as objective as possible.The show follows the story of Dr. Refaat Ismael, a professor of hematology in the University of Cairo in Egypt as he goes through a series of paranormal encounters with different ""beings"".Refaat is a firm believer in science, and didn't believe in anything paranormal. He fights to keep his beliefs but is forced to concede defeat as science fails to explain what was happening to him.The ending is left somewhat open, to promise more seasons to come.The episodes are vastly different in their quality. The best ones are No 6, 5 and 1. The worse by far is 3, while 2 and 4 are quiet average. As a whole season though it is really good.CGI can be much better, but I guess being a first season and Netflix didn't know how it will go, they didn't want to put in too much money, hopefully this will change in consecutive seasons.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1459,"Ameen was known for comedic, non-thinkful roles, that was the most surprising. Ameen has proven that he is a great actor. One of the most fabulous rare serieses i have ever seen in Egypt."
1460,"An integrated series, starting with a story by a professional writer and a distinguished director besides photography and huge sound effects, ending with a resounding surprise from a brilliant actor, he knew that he is only a comedian"
1461,Watch this you will like ... If they just improve their gci this will be masterpiece
1462,I explicitly enjoyed this new Arab work and new ideas that we did not see previously in the Arab series .
1463,I don't know if I am addicted to the novel series or the tv series more but although it's not an exact extract from the original book but I am so in love with itI wish more and I am looking forward to season two
1464,A great egyptian serie that contains a lot of Egyptian meanings and a very good step for Netflix
1465,I like it so much it's one of great sieres I have seen
1466,"One of the best horror fantasy tv series ever
Worth watching"
1467,"Great actors

1468,It's the best series ever that's based on a novel and it's not just about horror it's perfect in every way the scenes the storlyline the decorations the whole experience is marvelous
1469,"This series is the best series i have ever seen take about the ghosts . It and Constantine is the best two tv shows took about it. However, i see that the cgi need some improvement but it doesn't effect at the story ."
1470,"It is first Egyptian series produced by Netflix and get high score rating that prove the success , it will be the best not the first only."
1471,"Amazing series,perfect actors ,highly recommended,i hope to see more espoides"
1472,"The series is great
the worst thing about it is the cgi
the computer graphic interface is very sh1tty
for me
there is so many serieses that has a great cgi like (the end)
the sound track is very well
so i have to say that is should have 9/10
but i will make it 10/10 as it is the first egyptian netflix work"
1473,"A very enjoyable and entertaining series and I wish it becomes. More popular, i love it"
1474,"Our old novel turns to the real on screen what a wonderful moments, great job from all the cast.

1482,"We need more from the amazing series
really it was one of the best netflix productions
we are here waiting."
1483,"First of all am a book fan, and it was really good tv show and am very happy that the Refaat Ismail I imagined was really played by the great Ahmed Amin, the 1st, 5th and 6th episodes were just PERFECT really and I enjoyed them very much indeed.
the 2nd was okay, just OKAY.
the 3rd and the 4th were a complete disaster! I don't know from where shall I start!
from the Poor graphics in the 3rd episode?
or from the weak dramatic concept in the 4th episode? the episode left me really hanged asking myself thousands of question like: who is the Nadaha?, why Reda died?!?!? why didn't Refat save him? the whole scene under the water was confusing and I couldn't get over it to be honest!.
Another thing, I couldn't understand the relation between Magy and Refaat in this show, in the books I could understand them, but in the show the dialogues were so cooled, dry, pathetic not related to the Magy I know from the books the enjoyable sarcastic cute Magy,, also I didn't enjoy her dialogues in Arabic if it was totally in English it would be better-Magy's dialogues-.. please in the next seasons give more attention in the dialogues between Magy and Refaat I want to feel the love they had the relation they made.
but eventually I enjoyed the show.. I enjoyed Ahmed Amin's performance,, I felled in love with the pictures and cinematography
and I liked the fact that the horror in this show respected my mind, it was enjoyable and interesting also scary, Thanks Amr Salama for bringing this show on Screen."
1484,"Paranormal is the first Netflix Egyptian series, and it was a surprise for all of us, how it was great, and how every episode had its different mood of thriller. I really wish Netflix does more Egyptian original series !!"

Actor really was too close to Refaat that we have in mind ..i recommend to everyone read the novel it will take u to another dimension..

1510,"The acting, the story, the music, everything works well together. The photography is brilliant. And Ahmed Amin is mesmerising. Absolutely loved it."
1511,"Ver good story
fantastic ending
good actors
everything is just perfect"
1512,I hope they work on the animals visual effectsAnd the children need to act more realistic .
1513,I am a fan of the books of the writer Dr. Ahmed Khaked Tawfiq.. specially paranormsl series of books and its main character Dr. Refaat Ismail.. to see him real in the TV series was a dream came true... the series was very good and succeded in bringing Dr. refaat alive on screen. thnx for all who made this work.
1514,I've always been facinated with this subtle kind of horror.. weird and unsettling in a way that gives you chills without jump scares or meaningless gore.. a connected story that is conclusive yet mysterious.. I haven't read the novel but I'll do..I like the dark skeptic protagonist who's always critical of everything.. the direction is great.. the actors are alive and true to their roles.. it's a serious horror and mystery without nonsense.. reminds me of X-files or stranger things.. the CGI needs much improvement.. the color grading and scenery are great.. some dialogue is a bit anti climactic.. and I like the references to historic events and characters and the connection to ancient mythology..
1515,I thought that I will never see this in my life but some how the stories we used to read in the past came out to be something amazing like this!! You don't even need to know the stories or the plot to enjoy this great work. The characters are written in an awsome way that will take you to another level of greatness. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself. Ahmed Amin you took the work to somewhere we never know it exisits. Can't wait for more seasons to come
1516,"Really good
And differentThe graphics could have been better other than that it's really good"
1517,The best thing i have ever seen.the actors are amazing spcialy ahmed amin
1518,"Seriously, this series is one of the best series that one has seen from a long period of time, every thing in it is seriously deserved, from the first visual effects to the wonderful staff, and it is enough that it is the work of the great writer, the godfather. Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq, you have done well on Netflix, and from the success of the success, I wish we will see the second and third parts, and many parts very close"
1519,"I am so proud of this amazing piece of work
People might compare to the books but i guess it wouldn't be fair
Aside from having set expectations
The series is wonderfully executed
Cast is beyond amazing. Ahmed Amin is a true genius noone would have been better for the role
He outdid himself, truly excelled is impersonating such a popular complex character. The director did a phenomenal vision. It flowed really well the entire series is the way the story line was connected and in the isolated stories as well. The music was really a perfect pick couldn't have been better. The rest of the characters each did such a great job. The lighting is so good. Visual effects were impeccable. I really have nothing negative to say. It is a must watch, i am blown away by the quality of it. Just superb"
1520,"Congratulations for the makers I really enjoyed the series, I'm waiting patiently for season 2 to enjoy more"
1521,"This series is amazing
I highly recommend it to both the fans of the books and the fans who didn't read the books, U will enjoy."
1522,"I was surprised by the quality of the story, image and acting. Very good job for the Egyptian team behind this series, what a phenomenal success."
1523,"Im proudMabye its not the best,but its the first time we produce something on such a great network as Netflix.it contains some defaues. But it didn't stop me from enjoying it. Its something that has been never done before in Egypt.Waiting for the next season"
1524,I loved how Egyptians knew how to create such a good series based on the famous novel (also paranormal) by dr ahmed Khalid tawfiq...just they both gave us (by the help of amr salama) the best they can with this series!
1525,"Script is amazing, I loved the story
Very well done work for everyone in this work
Best episode is no. 5 and 6, waiting for next season I wish it will be soon :)"
1526,"The most wonderful egyptian series ever.
Ahmed Amin and Amr salama were very creative"
1527,"Thx doctor R.I.P
We love you and your imagination life in us"
1528,I can't believe this piece of art comes from Egypt ... great work
1529,Will everyone says the CGI in ep3 wasn't that great and I kinda agree but it still puts u in the mode and the music oooh it frecking awesome. story and music take 11/10 so if we remove a star cause the CGI it still count 10/10
1530,"First if all , i recommend this series for people love the mystery and want to see some Egyptian deep thoughts culture of horror and pharaonic curse, also great screen ,decoration , sound effects that for sure will make you feel and taste the fears , i watched all 6 episodes , i Give 9/10 .. and absolutely i will watch it one more time"
1531,"For giving us a childhood hero and helping in Shaping my mind to open up to all new ideas and to believe that anyone could be a hero even normal people like Refaat Ismail
I'm sorry he didn't get to see his dream coming true but he lives with his books in our hearts forever.
I loved the show but I didn't like the graphics especially the Gorilla seen
The 10 stars for my godfather Dr. Ahmed Khalid tawfik may he rest in peace"
1532,"Great main character along with the supporting roles, however director needed to focus more on details to align historical elements, graffics and better selection for the monisters. As a person who didn't read the original books, I needed the episodes to dive a bit into the stories behind each character to connect with the story line. However, I believe that is a massive improvement for the Egyptian and Arab horror drama overall."
1533,"The Series is full of mystery and actor ahmed amin did the character as it was written in the books, the final episode totally took my attention
locations been selected Wisley to match with the story.
i did like the show overall"
1534,"To be honest, I have watched many horror movies and most of the share the same plots...it's not like iam saying this show made any different plots. But it gave me a unique vibe of the horror movie/Series style... it's like looking at those horror feelings and events in a Philosophical way...to be honest iam kind of biased since iam Egyptian, But this is my honest review on this show, For me it had those 8 stars easy and they could use some more time next time to achieve higher Monsters Quality and they will be getting those 9 stars in the next season of the show on achieving their best quality"
1535,It was amazing to see an Egyptian series like that ... completely underrated
1536,Great story and great endings. i like theis series specifically the caretaker of child she called sheraz.
1537,"Story 10/10
Graphic 5/10
Direction 9/10
ahmed amin 10/10"

1540,"I enjoyed this series very much and was attracted to everything that happened in it, such as the composition of the characters and their interaction with the story. I would like to thank Dr. Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq for this masterpiece that he presented to us. I would also like to thank the work crew who enjoyed everything he presented, such as photography, directing, music, and also the author and the script.

1544,"The entire cast are amazing, I really enjoyed every little detail of the show"
1545,"Amazing scenario, good casting especially ahmed amin"
1546,Best Egyptian show based on a book by one of the best Egyptian novel writers
1547,"We need more of this in Egyptian cinema, honestly. For an anthology it really picks up an interesting narrative throughout the six episodes, and builds the character of Dr. Refaat Ismail in a way that gets you torn between cheering for him to get to the truth and wanting to see him proven wrong in his denial of the paranormal. Although it's definitely lighter on the horror and more on the mystery side, it does actually build some tension as it reaches its close."
1548,"I ask for another seasons ! It's brilliant
The characters especially dr Refaat Ismail is incane the way he talks, his voice , his eyes and looks the customs !"
1549,"Script 4/10 ( cos I read the novels, script wasn't deep enough )
Ahmed Amin Primary Actor 9/10
Casting 2/10 ( Children were a disaster)
Amr Salama Director 6/10
Music 10/10
Photography 9/10"
