It is a western drama aided by solid performances n amazing cinematography and the film does have some very intense scenes.The dinner scene, the hotel scene with the axe n the final scene, they all r tension filled.Visiting a house situated in the middle of nowhere and that too inhabited by bumpkins/yokels is scary man.
Imagine the yokels served u dinner and u r particular with kosher/halal food."
1,"Like many I'm a BIG Costner fan. This one could easily have been a rugged but amiable Western drama, but, like the moth flying close to the flame it gets tinged by inflexions of horror - a disquieting experience for the unwary. The plot has at its center the 'kidnap by marriage' of aged Margaret and George's grandson, goaded on by another interestingly psychotic family of near in-laws, resembling to no small degree the Snell Family of Netflix's 'Ozark', though this time featuring North Dakota as that bastion of redneck eccentricity. On the good side, it's a terrifyingly real situation, acted out charmingly by Kevin Costner with his trademark reserve. But the movie was a little long, with those now clich√©d tropes, the sort that better directors do well to avoid."
2,This was like watching Father Knows Best (salty version) meets MA Barker and her boys! It was a good story that moved along well with the beautiful backdrop of the mountains of the west. There was pathos and you connected with the characters. I like watching a movie geared towards 50+ year olds! Make more.
3,"The whole story is a short 30 minute film at best, but you have to sit through nearly 1.5 hours of exposition, as it meanders and wobbles its way to the end point. You know what's going to happen as soon as you find out the grandson and step daughter have left without saying good bye.The husband (Costner) gets pushed around by his wife. He should've known better, but she gets her way and ends up destroying many people's lives in the process. However, she managed to get by without a scratch. The horse shooting scene says it all, why did her husband have to do it, it was her horse, her responsibility.People may want to tell themselves she (Lane's character) is a strong independent woman, when in reality she's a narcissistic bully who manipulates everyone around her to get what she wants. At least Blanche is open and honest about being a bee-itch.The cinematography was good, the location was nice, and the acting was on point. The story was okay. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do."
4,"'Let Him Go' is a tense and powerful movie. It's a slow burn to begin with but turns intense 'edge of the seat' white knuckle ride towards the end. A tremendous dinner scene mid way through is also simple fantastic. Great performances by all the actors especially Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Lesley Manville... Lane especially is incredible and she carries the film beautifully. 'Let Him Go' is the Best Film of 2020 that I have scene - A truly wonderful masterpiece with an Oscar worthy performance by Diane Lane."
5,"Kevin and Diane make a good movie couple and they go good together in this western drama set in the 60's. I wouldn't say this is a thriller as almost all the scenes are predictable once they start and the pace is quite slow. The scenery is a nice touch for people who haven't seen the Alberta/Montana area but it's not a reason to watch this.For the most part I felt like I was waiting for the good part of the movie and then it ended and I was left still waiting. There are many scenes with dialogue that feels forced and it just make for an entertaining movie.For all the hype that the reviewers have been giving on here for Oscars and 10stars I can only assume that since the virus stuff has the theaters mostly empty, the studios are putting out their bare bones stuff. And that's what this movie is. Filler. Until things clear up and the better movies can be released upon a paying audience movies will continue to be of this quality."
6,"This new Western blends elements of noir, drama, and suspense to create a generally searing character study. Set in the 1960s, it tells the story of a retired sheriff (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Diane Lane.) Their young grandson has been spending time with his stepfather, whom they view as suspicious and is married to their son's widow. The leading couple leaves from Montana to the Dakotas to visit their step-family and try to get their grandson back, but things go south very quickly. The performances are generally powerful all around. Costner and Lane give clear emotional depth as well as a real sense of genuineness and urgency while in character. They feel haunted with grief from the death of their son, yet also proactively driven by a strong desire to ensure their grandson is properly treated. The film's cinematography of the Great Plains is gorgeous (although it was actually filmed in Alberta, Canada,) and the score is also quietly powerful.In the second half of the film, the dramatic tension is gradually increased both through the slow-burn tone as well as the dialogue. The film's gritty and slow-burn style may remind viewers of thrillers written and/or directed by Taylor Sheridan. Without going into any detail, suffice it to say that characters' instincts may be brought to a boiling point. However, the sudden and occasionally uneven increases in dramatic tension as well as violence do not always feel conducive to the film's tone. As a result, the film doesn't quite comment as starkly on its characters' behaviors or the nature of violence as thoughtfully as it intends to. The motivations of the characters are also rather predictable, and outside of Costner and Lane's characters, I did not find the rest of them to be especially engaging. Even though the characters are well-developed, the roles they play in creating some of the story's suspense are not inherently unique. That said, this is still a well-acted and well-shot thriller that should please patient viewers that know what they're in for. 7/10"
7,"I expected to like Let Him Go more than I did. While the cast was exemplary and the scenery was breathtaking, the movie failed to engage me more often than not. That's a pity. I won't be recommending it to others."
8,"The beginning of the movie is an excellent use of ""show; not tell"" as the dialogue is very spare. The settings are fabulous.The story is really about Diane Lane's character. Her love for her family and what she will do for it.The Weboy family is really evil and very convincing.Lane and Costner are exceptional.The little boy in the movie is now about my age so I really connected with him and his mom.The third act is action packed.I loved all the period details including the Red Owl store in Montana."
9,Okay so I'll say ive seen a lot of movies in very different ways than I'm used to however this is a movie I saw in theaters but it's most definitely one of the absolute best movies I've seen this year it's action packed and to the core so much fun very brief swearing which is another plus I say this isn't a sweet happy Thanksgiving movie for family's but it's a very very good movie for those looking for a action packed good time at the movies I highly recommend it
10,"Some problems I felt with the first half of this movie (before they went on their quest). There were problems with the flow of time. It just seemed like the movie kept jumping around, it was hard to get a sense of when things were unravelling. I mean, I guess that whole wedding thing was meant to be a surprise, since it looked like they were getting dressed for a funeral, but it was just too big of a jump without a good transition. Secondly, some of the dialogue felt like it was being stretched out with either long sections of silence, or for whatever reason, a character would take forever to finally bring up a point or issue, rather than saying it immediately (like a normal person would). The last thing is they never really say what happened to the son. At certain points throughout the movie, it almost felt like it was supposed to be a murder, with an unknown motive (to get the wife to marry a new person? To take over the horse business?). It just felt like they were dancing around it without really saying what happened, or how it really affected the family. The title 'Let Him Go' - was that meant for the Diane Lane's mother to let go? Is that final scene in the burning house supposed to be the 'letting go' moment?
Then the movie changes gears into a Deliverance meets Wind River (the finale), done in a Western style movie. They introduce the native american character, but after finishing the movie, it's almost like he wasn't really necessary. Other than providing the horse near the end. It felt like his character was shoehorned into the film to touch on another issue for the sake of raising it.
At the end in the final confrontation, it was a bit sloppy. I'm assuming the second son running up the stairs was shot dead, because mama had originally told him to go out and get the daughter-in-law. I guess Donnie Weboy died in the fire, even though he was cold-cocked by Costner's character with the barrel of the shotgun. And for a household that was supposedly hard to find from the main road, they had no issues leaving it, and going into it again, in the dark.
Lastly, it seems like they reference Costner's characters history as a lawman many times, but there doesn't appear any payoff, other than the scene at the police station where he asks the other officer to look up Donnie Weboy's family. But he could have done that if he was a well-respected friend of the sheriff or some other known person in town. The cop angle, with the service revolver, seemed unnecessary, and felt like it was done as a setup for something bigger that never pays off.
I got to see this in the theater, so that was a plus. But you may find yourself fast forwarding through many parts, especially in the first half. An okay effort, but it doesn't feel like it was developed really well. More padding just to get it close to the 2 hour mark, and sadly hints of ideas or directions that never materialize."
11,"And I should've listened.The start is rushed and although you get some foreshadowing with the pushy grandma/pushed out daughter-in-law behaviour it left me with no real reason to care about the daughter-in-law. The grandma is annoying in general with her it is all about me behaviour. There is some nice tension, similar to the kind you'd find in a Shane Meadows film, when we finally start meeting Weboys but then we meet grandma Weboy and what a ridiculous character she is. After this meeting everybody's terribleness meter is cranked up to 11 (the policeman in the local hospital being peak we are evil here.)Then the ending. I get that we are meant to see how a guy who can't hold a bowl anymore is so moved by his wife's pain that he decides he has to get his son's son back but I'm pretty sure he would've just stayed in bed if we wanted to stay anywhere near a rational human. Yeah, yeah I know its a film but it was so dumb. The big fire did look quite nice, though.Personally, the film I wanted to see was Mr. Gruff and Mrs. Annoying inviting Pete back home after they first meet him and their new life together skinning animals and breaking in horses.This year has been pretty terrible for films. Vivarium is still the worst I have seen in 2020 and this is a lot better than most from this year but that still doesn't make it a good film. It drags in places, the story is paper thin, and it does get pretty ridiculous.A 4 feels about right."
12,"The stupid wife would prefer sacrificing her husband for the estranged daughter-in-law and grandson is so ridiculous! ""Let Him Go"" in the end means to let her husband go as the horse is such a stupid title that just makes me sick! I don't think my wife would prefer sacrificing me for anybody. We both cursed loudly after the movie ended. One of the worst movies ever viewed during the pandemic lockdown at home!"
13,"Let Him Go is a western-gothic crime thriller with a North Western setting and some resemblance to vintage oaters like The Searchers. The search has elemental film roots with mental and physical violence enhanced by Leslie Manville as a bad grandma and her wicked sons.It's fun to see the bad guys get roughed up. It's also satisfying to see the searching-for-family motif of contemporary super-hero films played out in the Western plains even if it was filmed in Calgary. The craggy mountains and little towns complement the late fifties setting when love and crime occur in simple but stark ways.Retired Montana Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife, Margaret (Diane Lane), search for their grandson, Jimmy (Bram Hornung and Otto Hornung) after the death of their son, James (Ryan Bruce). Former daughter in law Lorna (Kavli Carter) has left abruptly with new husband, Donny Weboy (Will Britain), and grandson, relocating under duress to North Dakota and his family- Weboy territory where matriarch Blanche (Manville) wields absolute power. Very bad move. The chase begins.Lane and Costner are in top-aging form, tough and tenderhearted enough to fight the Weboy clan for the grandson. This is a different, more nuanced role for them when they were Superman's parents. Let Him Go adds an authenticity to the thriller formula by emphasizing the devotion of the loving couple to each other and their quest to keep the family whole, or at least provide a fitting family life for their grandson.The usual Western tropes apply like the corrupt sheriff, bad grandma and sons, the kind stranger, the tough mother, and the epic ending battle. What goes beyond the formula is the sincere love propelling the plot and corralling our hearts. And, of course, the fully-seasoned Lane and Costner.Let Him Go is much more than the genre it represents."
14,"Great acting. excellent screenplay, lovely to look at, but as far as Iam concerned awful ending. For all its production values, I could never watch it again, or recommend it."
15,"Greetings again from the darkness. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner reunite on screen, only this time it's not as the earthy and earthly parents to Superman (MAN OF STEEL, 2013). Instead, this film from writer-director Thomas Bezucha (THE FAMILY STONE, 2005), based on Larry Watson's 2013 novel, features the two stars as long-time married couple, Margaret and George Blackledge, living a peaceful existence on their Montana ranch. Well, it's peaceful now, as George is retired from his career as a lawman.Their son James (Ryan Bruce), his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter, ""Godless""), and young son Jimmy live on the ranch with Margaret and George. Grandma Margaret's devotion to her grandson and judgmental nature sometimes crosses the line, creating quiet tension with his mother Lorna. George's trained eye sees it all, but he mostly keeps his thoughts private, although the communication he shares with Margaret is often through a simple gesture or nod. Their chemistry is one that's only built through time (and fine acting).
When a freak accident leaves James dead, we flash forward three years as Margaret and George attend Lorna's wedding to Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain, who was excellent in this year's BLOW THE MAN DOWN). George senses that Donnie does not possess the highest moral character, but Margaret is hit hardest by the newlyweds moving off the ranch and taking her beloved grandson with them. Concern escalates quickly when Margaret witnesses Donnie being physically abusive to Lorna and Jimmy, and then he relocates them to North Dakota to be near his family ... without so much as a warning or goodbye to Margaret and George.Crossing Grandma Margaret is like kicking the hornet's nest. Poor George arrives home one day to find the car packed and Margaret on a mission to bring Jimmy home. George's feeble attempt to reason with her fails (as he knew it would) and the two are soon on the road through some gorgeous countryside captured by cinematographer Guy Godfree. Along the way, they cross paths and befriend Peter (Booboo Stewart), a Native American who deserted ""Indian School"" for a life of solitude on the plains. It's also on this road trip where Margaret and George are inundated with every possible warning about the notorious Weboy clan of North Dakota. No specifics are provided, but the message is clear ... no one messes with the Weboys.A tip leads the grandparents to Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan, ""Burn Notice""), and he provides living proof that the Weboy clan is rotten to the core. Behind an evil grin, Bill invites Margaret and George to the family ranch for dinner and a visit with their grandson. At the ranch, we are introduced to the twisted matriarch, Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville, PHANTOM THREAD, 2017). This meeting of the families is about as tense as any we've seen on screen. A clash of good versus evil is always welcome, which makes it so disappointing that a film so stellar to this point, abruptly shifts from an intriguing psychological thriller into a ludicrous circus of violence, poor decisions, and absurdity.There is a lot to like here, before it spins off the axis. Diane Lane is ferocious in the role, and Costner is very effective as her 'still waters' husband. It's a hoot to see Ms. Manville lose her British accent and go over-the-top as nasty Blanche, and the early 1960's setting looks great, including the vehicles. As mentioned before, the scenery is breath-taking, with Alberta (Canada) standing in beautifully for Montana and North Dakota. Composer Michael Giacchino is more accustomed to working on superhero and animated movies, and the score is often distracting in the first half, but fits better in the final act. Brace yourself for a couple of tough to watch scenes and a jarring tonal shift."
16,"Simple plot with too many side stories. Who's the Indian boy? Just shows up, for what purpose? The Costner character was a lawman, why didn't he use the law to get the kid back? No husband would let his wife run amok. They go to his hotel room, cut off 3 fingers, self defense? Could have been good, actually funny in some parts. Next time stick to the script."
17,"This is a strong film and a special one I'd say. How unusually unsatisfyingly it unravels, but yet you still totally want to see what happens next. The film is authentic feeling enough to really drag you into it, whether you like where it's going or not. I think for most mature audiences, it will affect them in this way for the most part. Thankfully this is not just another predictable Hollywood film. It certainly isn't unfamiliar territory, not at all, but it's certainly far more uncompromising and the characters are more realistic than most modern Hollywood films; And therefore the film is a breath of fresh air on this basis alone, even though the movies atmosphere is somewhat stifling. It seemed to me that this role was absolutely perfect for Diane Lane at this stage in her career/life. Or is it that she just totally embodied the character and nailed it? Definitely both! In my view anyway. And the Oscar goes to...if I was handing them out. She was amazing in this. I would even venture to say one of the better female performances I've seen out of Hollywood in the last many years. She was that good, and the part was also a pretty interesting one. Subtle and intense I think describe her performance the most accurately. Costner was definitely very understated and subtle himself in another very strong performance. My advice to those with mature viewing eyes, don't miss this film! Best I've seen so far this year.8/10"
18,Great acting. Absolutely amazing scenery. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are both two of the best actors today. It makes this movie worth seeing. It is refreshing to see a movie void of special effects and one that relies on great acting to carry it. The story also was first rate.
19,"Dont believe the hype reviews about this MEH film. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner played the roles of two grandparents you just wanted slap and ask, WTF were you thinking? The story line was weak, the build up was off and the ending was ridiculous. The best part of the film was the score. I'm not sure what these other reviews are even talking about, especially saying Lane deserves and Oscar for this role....huh? Overrated reviews made me want to watch this MEH film. Dont believe them, this film was just ok"
20,I'll make this short and to the point. This movie sucked. So many things were weird and stupid. The writing was definitely from a beginner with no imagination. Kevin Costner(who is the best actor in this movie) had very few lines as if he had an issue with talking. They made Diane Lane out to be some sort of 70 year old sex symbol - totally weird and completely unrealistic. Diane's acting was bad. The story is about taking back a grandson that is possibly abused by his step-father. Costner and Lane go on a road trip and literally show up with a chip on their shoulder and make a bad situation so much worse. The entire story is unrealistic and stupid. This movie is close to 2 hours long - yet there is no substance due to crappy writing. Bottom line - stupid movie.
21,"Covid 19 has been of course a horrible pandemic and we've been living clodef away for the modt part since March. Going to the movies has been my favorite thing to do since i was a kid. I love film, and even though I have a nice home theater at home there us nothing like going to a theater and view a film the way it was meant to be. Of course the studios pulled every big release until next year and when the movie theaters opened they were forced to play older films and pretty much unknow left overs thst the studios had no confidence in. I actually enjoyed watching movies that i already oened on the big screen, but the new releases were mostly average. Utterly forgettable.The trailer for Let Him Go looked very promising. It stars Diane Lane and Kevin Costner Margaret and George. An aging ranch couple that loses their married son in a freak horseriding accident. His wife Lorna who had a son with remarries a guy named Donnie. They move out of her parent in-laws house and move into town. In going to visit them, Margaret witnesses Donnie treating her grandson Jim and Lorna badly. She is horrified but says nothing. The next time Margaret goes to visit, they are gone. Worried, she asks around and decides to look for her grandson. She tells George what she saw and they decide to search together. They find out where Donnie's family lives and go to the Dakotas to look. They find out that Donnie's family us dangerous and are warned to be careful. They are taken to the family house by Billy Weboy slimily played by Jeffery Donavan. They meet the matriarch of the Weboys Blanche played by Leslie Manville. Shevreally is good as Blanche but you know where the movie is going because she is really hamming it up as a crazy, as a crazy domineering mother. The Blackledges see the dangerous situation that Jimmy and Lorna are in so they try to convince her to come back with them. The Weboys find out and tge film turns pretty violent. The weboys attack George and Blanche and warn them to leave them alone or they will hurt their grandchild. The last act is basically a revenge, rescue story.The film is not incredibly original but the performances are very good. Diane Lane is great. Kevin Costner is a good also. They have a good chemistry as an older couple that have gone through alot of pain but still love each other. The focus on that is very good because you care about their situation. All of the cast us very good. They Weboys ate not given much to do but be evil but we definitely hate them!!!A solid new film in a very scarce time to go to a movie theater.Grade: B"
22,I wouldn't have given this movie not even one star.. so sad.. so bad..I didn't know who Thomas Bezucha was but now that I do I will avoid all his films.Not going to waste anymore time on this.
23,"My husband and I both love Kevin Costner movies, but this one was terrible! Not a good story line and a horrible ending! Boo!!!"
24,"There're slow movies where the purpose is to encourage viewers to reflect. And there's this film that provokes one though only: why? Why did they make it? There's nothing to take away from here. I give it 3 points, 1 each to the 2 lead actors and N.Dakota."
25,"""Let Him Go"" was the first movie I've seen in the theater in nine months. It felt good to be sitting in a movie theater again (AMC Westbury, NY). ""Let Him Go"" is a beautifully acted movie. The set design, costumes and location photography are all top-notch. It takes it's time telling it's story but that's fine. It's not a Rambo movie after all. It's a serious family drama. ""Let Him Go"" packs a punch and I'm glad that I saw it."
26,Should've been the title. This one hurt my soul. Kevin Costner used to make great movies. But this..this...I can't wrap my head around. It has its moments but that's where the praises stop. I guess Kevin Costner did his best with what was presented to him. My advice to him would be to either retire or...just retire. It pains me to be so critical of Kevin but I'm not a fan of garbage. Hopefully he can redeem himself and become a household name again.
27,"It was a good movie untill some stupid writing came up.
Most disappointing part was....
You can shoot the bad guys in the end but not when it was needed most. Pure stupidity.You came for your grandson
Lost ur husband
What kind of a writing is this."
28,"Let's be crystal clear. Costner and Lane are so professional and interesting by themselves you could watch them build a garage and still be entertained. But movies have to more than the sum of their parts. Here Thomas Bezucha has written an abomination of a script where the real ""mystery"" -- why the girl married poorly in the first place -- takes place outside the narrative and off-camera almost before the opening titles. In these kinds of melodramas, there are usually story beats developed early on so, that when the climax comes, the audience is tuned in and feels satisfied. Bezucha doesn't care about his audience at all. He tells the story, it seems, to suit only himself. Just like the main villain that he created."
29,Love Diane and Kevin! Two our times best. But this film had nothing to offer. Slow story with a weak plot. Acting was great with the leading stars. But that's about it. This is something I will never watch again. Just not my cup of tea. But will always watch Kevin and Diane
30,"I was really impressed with this film. It was well scripted, well acted, had a great early 60's feel, and the scenery and sets were great. Plenty of action, drama, and more. If you enjoyed Yellowstone, you'll like this Costner flick, too."
31,"Let Him Go was a great movie. Costner and Lane are terrific together. It's a slow burn drama that builds up with emotions and intensity, so if you're expecting non stop action, you probably won't like it. The stars play a couple whose son dies from an accident. The widow of their son remarries into an abusive relationship. The stepfather takes away her and her son to live with his crazy family. The kind of people who would probably kill you if you looked at them the wrong way. Costner and Lane, the grandparents of their sons only son, want to get him and the mother back, and get them away from the abusive stepfather. But they have to go through hell with the stepfather and his crazy family to do so.
A meeting of the crazy in laws at a dinner table is so tense, you can cut it with a knife. A confrontation in a hotel room and the suspenseful, emotional ending had me on the edge of my seat. This movie has a story and characters you feel for and care about. It is so far, the best movie of the year. Diane Lane gives a beautiful performance. I predict her to get an Oscar nomination. Highly recommended. And ignore the reviews that call it boring. Yes, it's a slow burn, but a great movie. I loved it."
32,****SPOILER ALLERT****This is a the biggest waste of time you will never get back. Poor characters dialogue and character development. Lane's character is a totally selfish self absorbed woman trying to live vicariously through her grandchild since her own child died and even if it costs her husband his limbs and ultimately his life. HORRIBLE STORY AND ENDING!!!!
33,"LET HIM GO (2020) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lesley Manville, Kayli Carter, Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan. Still waters run deep while family matters is the crux of this lean and mean low-key slow burn drama cum Western vengeance with Costner and Lane as grandparents to a boy now with a 2nd yet shady rural family led by malevolent matriarch Manville (with her Cruella DeVille do to boot). With its smudged pallet of bruised brown and blue-greys by cinematographer Guy Godfree and a steady helm by director Thomas Bezucha - adapting Larry Watson's novel - makes a potboiler of taut tension a work of art."
34,"Could have been a great film but ultimately falls very, very flat.Several things that bugged me:Laughable ending that makes zero sense. I understand being a bad shot but literally shooting your brother in law in the head instead of waiting 2 seconds for him to move out of the way? What? Blanche's ""suprise"" appearance only to get point blank blasted by a shotgun was so cliche it hurt.George is laughably inept for a 30 year lawman. He goes to the house with zero plan and just happens to find a gun on the porch? How many times did he get jumped and the gun wrestled from him? I get it he's old but he was completely useless the entire film.The dialog and reactions in some scenes just felt...off. Blanche Weboy felt like a bad impression of Mags from Justified and just did not feel like a domineering mother that should be feared."
35,"Nothing really special about this film. The story drags on and on until Kevin Costner gets his fingers chopped off..Terrible scene..He gets man handled and pretty much does nothing. Would of been nice to see George (Kevin Costner) at least take one of the brothers out. Let's skip to the ending. George sneaks off into the night to rescue his grandson. Finally some action. Too bad you gotta wait an hour and fourty five minutes for it to happen. Decent ending but I didn't like that George dies in the end. Anyways, I think the film would of been a lot better if the sheriff and wife shed a bit more blood. The revenge factor just didn't do it for me. 5 stars"
36,"In all millennial movie fashion, this was created for them.Long slow down out scenes to conserve the most amount of money in attempt to shift the focus on deep emotion which only causes frustration and a feeling of being ripped off and robbed of your date night.
The context bleeds millennial PC.
Spoiler alert...............Have the boomer mother repenting to the ignorant young mother who caused all of the problems in the first place as she trades the life of her husband for the grandchild. After all he is older anyway so send him out to pasture.I looked forward to this movie for months as Diane Lang is my favorite actress. I was disappointed and embarrassed I talked my husband into watching such a stinker. Good actors can't make a bad movie good."
37,"Was hoping this might have some of the quality associated with it that Yellowstone does. Wow, that was not the case. Diane Lane's character was extremely annoying. Wondered if she was mentally deficient in parts. She caused her husband to get beat up, badly injured and ultimately killed do to here ridiculous actions and horrible decision making. She was not likeable at all. As for Kevin Costner's character. His character's personality was difficult to like. He was very gruff. He was supposedly a policeman for 30 years, but he showed a complete lact of tactical strategy or situational awareness with regard to the situations that he put himself in. All in all, I'd save your money and your time."
38,First review. I am a Kenneth Costner fan but this movie left a lasting bad taste in my mouth. I watch many foreign films because I am tired of so many silly Hollywood films. She sacrifices her husband who first goes through agony because her daughter in law and her grand child sometimes in the 1950s gets slapped. The ending was ridiculous. Lately I have been looking for American films that I find enjoyable in the 40's etc. Not happy with how Hollywood portrays men. I have lived in Europe and Asia for a long time and I have my biases. Anyway this film upset me. American politics is degenerate and I see films like this as unsettling.
39,"I watched with an ending question...What's most important to you?
Diane Lane in this role as an obsessive, foolish woman with only one agenda - to get her grand child back from a demonic family. In the end...she manages to accomplish her obsession...but what a price to pay."
40,"I'm referring or clapping back at the ""heart-wrentching"" comments that seemed to come up at the top.Its trope trope trope...formulaic formulaic...Just an awful film...missing any level of originality or just something that makes you want to continue.
Its a badly paced melodrama thriller that lacks the direction to be effective. Derivative slop is what it becomes...boring----especially when you know exactly whats going to happen next. The great acting being thrown around by people who just don't know how great Costner can be...while being one of his worst films.
Hard pass."
41,How in the world did they call this a thriller this is the most boring lifeless movie that tries to pull at your heartstrings but only makes things worse with its one extermely simple and BORING plot im actually writing this in the theater as I speak waiting for my uber to come pick me up and....oh gotta go to sum this up in 5 words DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
42,"She made me cry at the end....She is still so beautiful and she doesn't age much.
Kevin is great also!"
43,Someone stop my snoring. Drab diialogue. Best use is to watch this movie on a long flight
44,"Good, honest people, country folks who live close to the land. She cooks and sews, and her first reaction upon learning that her daughter-in-law and her new husband have left without notice, taking her grandson, she packs a pistol because violence is the answer to all familial problems. And this is 1951; how many fathers would have survived if everyone of them who'd ever slapped one of his children received the death penalty?It's good Montana folk against North Dakota trash, except in the book it was the other way around. All I know is either North Dakota people are trash or they aren't. The other people are just filth.I really hate movies that have a big portion of the scenes shot at night so you can't really see much of anything. It's so dark is some parts of this that you may as well be listening to the radio.She treats her daughter-in-law like she isn't fit to be a mother because the water is too hot for the kid's bath? With family like that, who needs family? The next problem is the movie is too long at 1h53m. At least 23 minutes too long, but this might have been OK as a 30m TV episode, maybe.The son dies how? Was it auto-erotica asphyxiation? How was the horse involved? And, no, that isn't funny, my brother died that way. Mama sees the horse return without a rider, and she immediately assumes something terrible happened? Am I missing something? We learn latter that he died of a broken heart, or was it a broken neck? Either way, riding horses is dangerous. I just think that it's a waste of film and screen time to even introduce someone if you're just going to kill him two minutes later. They could have begun when the daughter-in-law gets married again. The book begins with the grandparents packing to go after the kid.It doesn't matter, trimming that bit of fat isn't going to leave you with anything approaching a decent feature film.And can someone tell me how the fire started? I missed that part even though I went back and looked again. It isn't explained in the book either. I don't see what point is being made by not explaining the fire. I guess god did it.In the end, the entire story is just a poor excuse for a bloodbath finale that wasn't interesting in the least."
45,"Very slow pace and idiotic plotline, how many lives can you justify taking for the perceived well-being of a child. What kind of role model are you? Bad people slap a child, lets kill them all. Very strange plot with strange values."
46,"Ok, first half hour was very very slow. Ok, it has good actors, Diane Lane and The Waterworld flop guy. Enter a mysterious long haired Indian on their road trip. Then enter the mean domineering mother, you immediately hate and want to do away witch. Will that happen? Oh well, you've gotta see the movie to find out. But, don't waste your money. Unless, of course, you want to see a disgustingly sick chop chop. But, I think that's what they should do to this movie. Chop chop! Overall, not up to the park of these actors."
47,"This film is partially a slow carousel ride for old people and partially a series of brutal strikes to the head. The first approximately one half is the part for grandma and grandpa. Then it shifts gears quite suddenly and becomes almost something of a horror film. I'm not sure who the target audience is here. It's far too dull (at least for huge chunks of it) for teenagers/young adults. Once the tension starts - and eventually explodes - you've entered a completely new territory that, again, feels like Deliverance or a similar film. I have to rate it lower simply because I did not feel fulfilled at the end."
48,"I mean come on, from all the bad ending, they choose the worst one. It feels you didn't event watch a movie.
Very monotonic and unrealistic."
49,"I thought this was going to be intense and interesting. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner make a good pair but they could not save this movie. The idea/story is very decent but the execution is just miserable. Literally this whole movie goes by and nothing is happening, I was just bored out of my skull. The pace is painfully slow, and I did not feel much for the grandparents, or the grandchild being abused by the father-in-law.
If you want a good version of a movie like this, try Changeling (2008) starring Angelina Jolie. You can prob get it for free on some movie channel or something.It's funny because we saw this movie in a huge AMC theater where there were literally only 4 attendants watching including myself. Hollywood keeps postponing the good movies due to Covid, but if this is the garbage they want us to watch in the meantime, the theater industry isn't gonna make it until next year. RIP Hollywood."
50,"Typical, suspense movie. Depressing, always dark, tiny surprise at the end. And I love Diane Lane! I was not only disappointed but it hurt my feelings because it was so blah."
51,"A movie Kevin and Diane should have hard passed on. This is no Liam action movie. Slow. boring, long 2 hours. Only last ten minutes worth watch. Skip!"
52,"A very well done and emotional thriller drama with a strong story and characters you truely care for.
It was great to see Kevin Costner and Diane Lane teaming up once again as they have an undenyingly great chemistry and you perfectly believe them being an happily in love ""old"" couple. Kevin Costner gives a very warm and fatherly performance. He shares a certain calmness with his character which is quite comforting and needed considering the circumstances the characters find themselves in. A beautiful and quiet performance. Diane Lane shows off more emotions and she follows her characer during different stages of character development making her unpredictable in many ways, although at first you thought its a very predictable character. She really lived it and created it way above of what was written ont he paper. A great performance.
Lesley Manville gets to play a rather loud and kind of cartoonish character but she still manages to perfectly balance it between overacting and giving it depths. She is really good - scary at times and gives yet another memorable performance in a role that could have been easily over the top. The cincematography is impressive, especially in the first half of the film and the score constantly beautiful. Its a well crafted modern Western that takes its time to introduce and develope its leading protagonists before giving the audience the right amout of tension. Very worth to see."
53,"This movie was so slow Very little action until the last 15 minutes of the movie. I wouldn't waste my time, the plot was very weak. The best part was the incredible background of South Dakota."
54,Outstanding performance by Diane Lane she deserves an oscar for her role.
55,"The scenery and old cars and houses are very nice to watch.
Costner plays a typical role for him, he does it well.
Diane Lane plays a slightly overbearing woman that doesn't know when to quit and the story stews on that basis.It's an enjoyable movie, wouldn't call it Oscar material in the script department.No CGI, no fancy dialog or plot twists, it's almost predictable
But it all flows and keeps you watching."
56,"Got busted by the cast and the Action, Thriller category.Instead it should be categorized as drama, western, Boring .Insanly good acting byLane and Manville.Definately doesn't worth the good rating .. and the two hours i spent waiting for something to happen .Did i say SLOOOOOW ?
I do now . Slow and boring."
57,"Not a bad TV movie but not worth paying to see at theatre.Acting is good , story is weak and unbelievable ."
58,Sad to see Kevin Costner so willing to lend his name to a depressing meandering waste of film. The only reason I saw this thing was because of costner. I'm sorry that I did. The plot was rather thin and unbelievable. Every scene droned on and flowed into the other in a slow depressing creep toward an unsatisfying ending. This was the movie equivalent of a low-level sinus headache.
59,"Okay so I'm a big Diane Lane fan she was popping back in the day.. lol. Anyway in this movie she isnt the best person she doesnt treat her sons partner with respect until she wants something from her (grandson). Diana ends up getting her husband killed after playing mind games with him saying shes gona link up with some indian on a horse, extend the house lol this is straight after her actions result in him losing fingers to an axe.... The worst part is alot of people die and I dont think they were bad people maybe just had poor upbringings and hard lives. Its really hard to say who is the villan.. Dianes actions and lack of ability to communicate resulting in a whole family being murdered. TBH nothing much happens in this movie its very plain needed some suspense.."
60,"Was anticipating much better non-gore-fest drama from this period ""family drama"", but it turned out to be extremely low-rent ""worst case scenario you-could-possibly imagine in your worst-ever dreams"" crapola. Boo Kostner, as usual, with Diane Lane's forceful character being the only bright spot"
61,Love Costner & Lane but disappointed with the slow pace of the movie. Was a bit boring except the last scene where it picked up. It would be a movie I'd recommend the rent from redbox. Don't bother renting for $20 on prime.
62,"I don't see the the substance here because we have a bunch of unadjusted people raising a kid (off the grid) ,and a well established grandfather and grandmother, that with one petition to the courts would be granted custody in a heartbeat... I was expecting some of that,like Kevin and his wife winning a custody or partial custody
case,and then add up the action of the other crazy family that wouldn't give the kid up.... but this movie is practically a melee over who keeps a kid without bringing it to reality at least one bit....everyone doing their thing... nobody wins..."
63,"I just watched this and I thought it was good but maybe not something I would buy. It was kind of a slow starter but it did get better. There was a lot of great tension so I would definitely say it's good if you like a good thriller. I found that some scenes were so crazy and intense that I was sitting in the edge of my seat and rubbing my hand together to the point where they started to hurt. This film has some great actors in it such as Kevin Costner, Jeffery Donovan, Diane Lane, etc.... Overall I would say it was a good film."
64,"""Don't stays what you can't finish.""I received a screener for this expecting a basic movie. The trailer kept coming up and it always caught my attention of looking pretty good, but I just figured it would turn out basic. Thomas Bezucha hasn't had the best track record for his movies. Let Him Go must've been a passion project for him because you can see the work put in. He, the cast, and crew put in enough effort to make this an actual good movie. The opening scene felt strange to me because of how well directed it is. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is one of the best of the year, the acting is great, and the direction is good. What got me even more was that it continues on throughout the entire movie. Like I said earlier, this must have been a passion project and you can see it right from the beginning.I came in most excited for the acting and I must say I'm not disappointed in the slightest. We have two leads we've seen together before, those being Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, and then taking the supporting role is Leslie Manville, who I just think is one of the best actresses out there. Kevin Costner has been sort of quiet these past couple years. It's nice seeing him again. I will admit I felt his performance was sort of dry in the first act, but as the movie continues he showed us that he is anything but mediocre. Diane Lane stoke the show for me. I expected Leslie Manville to but Lane has so much to offer. From the very start she puts herself into this role completely and you really feel for her. As for Manville, she's great as always. With this and Ordinary Love, she's had two great roles this year. The moment you first see her on screen, it's a given that this is going to be a great performance.Thomas Bezucha has a certain style of directing with this. It's good but doesn't work all the time. He's going for a quiet, slow burn. That is to be taken literally. The movie is really quiet. The sound design is great, but sometimes it doesn't feel right. It's great for building the suspense, but when not much is happening it feels like you're watching nothing. Slow paced movies are hard to master. In the first act, the pacing feels very slow. Until the main conflict happens, the pacing doesn't work. Even sometimes after the main conflict has happened, it still feels a little slow. It's not awful but when I think about the movie there's only three main events that happen. Those scenes are handled well, especially one with shock value. But by the end it does feel like not a whole lot happened. And one problem I had is with our antagonists: the Weboy family. There's not much of an explanation for them. We just have to except that they're evil. Other than that, this does have a lot to offer. The acting is great, good cinematography, good sound design, I'm going to mention Michael Giacchino's score once again because I've been listening to it ever since. Maybe another watch will help. And that watch won't have me going in thinking I'll be watching a mediocre movie. I'd still recommend Let Him Go as a good thriller and something to go see right now."
65,"It is considered a drama, crime and suspense movie, and this is a great category that offers wide areas for diversification, but the film decides to focuse on one main story without any side stories or any scene that is not related to the main event
The story is simple and almost poor, but I cannot say that this is a problem itself, the problem is it's difficult to tell a story that simple in a two-hour film without leaving the viewer feeling bored, and this is the main defect of the film.
It's Very slow in events and taking more time than necessary To go from chapter to chapter, and that killed the tension that it created very well many times.The weakness of the story along with the slow events affected the level of excitement, but it was rich at the level of drama, it was excellent especially in the relationship between the husband and the wife, and it wasn't traditional and distinguished. It grasps The viewer attention and makes him thinking in order to understand it, and this was impossible without the wonderful performance of the two leading actors (Kevin Costner) and (Diana Lane), especially Diana and I personally consider her to be one of the best actresses of her generation, but the sad thing is no one talks about how good she is. Diana in recent years has presented many roles, all of which are dramatic, supportive but important roles that have a noticeable presence, this time she takes the leading role which is amazing and she was so great
About Kevin Costner, we can say that he acted in the movie with experience. His performance was simple and calm without any exaggerations or moments of explosion, and this easy, reluctant, was appropriate for the character and expected of an actor like himThe directing of the film was simple and straightforward, but it had no problems, and the cinematography was very good with comfortable shots.
The music was also very nice and suitable for the calm events, and I really liked the absence of music completely in the scenes in which the tension was reaching the maximum, because this increased Stress.The film has another important problem, which is the ending, which was very hasty and not at all brilliant, and its flaws were the defects of the script and directing at the same time, so the scenes were illogical and poorly executed."
66,Wonderful old-style film with great story line and believable (for once) real life violence. Sensational acting....this movie MUST win something.
67,One of the best films of the year with knockout performances from both Lane and Costner.The story is the same old revenge/retribution but the screenplay and making is top notch.
68,"I finally thought of a good way to describe this Movie filmed in Montana and North Dakota, it's TAKEN with Lane and Costner sharing the Neeson role vs BIG BAD MAMA except Mama got Son's instead of daughter's üò† Go See the Wide Open Settings for YourselfLesley Manville Mama !!"
69,"After James dies from falling off a horse (1962), his wife remarries a man who does not treat her and her son very well. They move away to North Dakota without telling the grandparents who are now on a rescue mission.The whole plot was silly and far fetched. The grandparents were clearly in the wrong which was compounded by two wrongs making two wrongs. Over the top stupidity.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity."
70,"Whilst I thought this film was good but creepy, there was insufficient description or explanation of why the stepfather (of the child) family behaved as they did? I was left thinking what was that all about? Kevin Costner is watchable any time but I just thought the plot a bit lightweight."
71,"Two very good actors giving a great performance in this story that uncomfortable to watch in parts. Not overly graphic but intense moments that keep this movie on track. I really enjoyed Kevin Cosner's character and the very reserved role that Kevin played. The question is to ask what would you do in this couples position? I think I would've done what Kevin did. Definitely worth a watch, don't go expecting a fast paced action and you won't be disappointed."
72,Power house performance by everyone. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are so good together and should be a couple in all their movies together. Its one of those movies with lots of monologue and slow burn pace but the acting what carries it. Great movie reminds me of Blue Ruin.
73,"I really like both primary actors. But the constant use of flashbacks to make points alludes me. All of the actors are good at their jobs, and make the story ALMOST believable. Who in their right mind can condone the kidnapping of a child? An Ex LEO?
Some will think this a great film, I found the film took the emotions of the story and then crashed them into each other like something different was going to happen. Had looked forward to this one. Now I can look away."
74,From start to finish this had all the makings if a classical western and o boy did it deliver. Kevin and Diane are masterful together. The mood the landscape and the downright audacity to defy everything we enjoy about a western and turn it on its head. Hands down Oscar worthy.
75,"I saw ""Let Him Go"", starring Diane Lane-Man of Steel, The Perfect Storm; Kevin Costner-Man of Steel, Waterworld; Jeffrey Donovan-Burn Notice_tv, Hitch and Lesley Manville-Maleficent, Romeo and Juliet_2013.
This is a slow starter but nice-if unexpected-finisher. It's based on a novel by Larry Watson. The original novel was set in 1951 but the movie setting is a little more contemporary-It's set in 1963. Retired Sheriff Kevin and his wife Diane live on a ranch in Montana with their son, his wife and their new baby. After their son dies in an accident, his widow remarries-she waited 3 years-an abusive man and I'm guessing that she didn't know he was abusive when she agreed to marry him. All of a sudden, they move to North Dakota. Diane-after witnessing some of the physical abuse herself-and Kevin are upset because they were not informed of the move so they decide to go check on their grandson and they soon discover that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Lesley is the son_in_law's mother and Jeffrey is his uncle and the whole family has quite the reputation for being difficult to get along with, with a little bit of abuse thrown in for good measure. Diane and Kevin decide to try and persuade Lesley & family into giving them their only grandson. That's when the party begins.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-I did mention that it was a little slow for my tastes-but it would be a good rental."
76,"Thomas Bezucha's captivating and heartbreaking family drama that is skillfully executed and is based on Larry Walson's 2013 bestselling novel. About an retired veteran Montana sheriff George Backledge, and his wife Margaret, magnificently played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane in two sensational Oscar worthy performances, who's beloved son is killed in a freak horse riding accident, leaving behind his young wife Lorna, superbly played by Kayli Carter, and baby son Jimmy. Lorna soon remarries an abusive man named Donnie Weboy, well-played by Will Brittain, who is viewed by George and Margaret as suspicious, he, Lorna and Jimmy move into town away from George's farm. Concern presents itself when one day Margaret witnesses Lorna and Jimmy being physically abused by Donnie, and then without any word he relocates them to North Dakota to live with his twisted mother Blanche, chillingly played by Lesley Manville in a brilliant scene-stealing performance, and her psychotic family. Margaret persuades George to go after them for the sake of their young grandson Jimmy, but when they get to North Dakota it will soon turn into a very disturbing and dangerous encounter with the Weboy clan that will have some tragic consequences. Astute direction by Bezucha, with absolutely stunning cinematography by Guy Godfree, and a wonderful score by Michael Giacchino. Exceptional supporting performances by Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan, Ryan Bruce, Adam Stafford, Bradley Stryker, and Greg Lawson. One of this year's finest films."
77,"Excellent acting and amazing scenery. The story is heart-wrenching and intense at times. Some reviews say the story is not believeable, but remember it is a movie. For what it's worth and believable is that many of us would got to the ends of the earth for the ones we love, and this movie captures that. Highly recommend it."
78,"Somehow this film is both raw and polished at the same time. I was engaged from the beginning and was made to feel more captivated as the film endured. The film is bolstered by believable acting, beautiful landscapes and character relationships that run deep. It's not a feel-good film, but one that will stick in my mind for a long time."
79,"It starts slow but as it builds, it becomes intense."
80,A very interesting plot the takes the viewer through many emotions along the way. Excellent lead characters who are well paired. You feels as though they could be your parents fighting for your children's wellbeing.
81,"Let Him Go is a new western crime drama directed, partly written and produced by Thomas Bezucha. He has also directed Big Eden, The Family Stone and Monte Carlo.In the movie, retired Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) have lost their son. The two decide to travel to North Dakota to visit their ex-daughter-in-law and grandson after learning that she has remarried. The Weboy family their ex-daughter-in-law is married to appears to be a dark criminal family. George and Margaret are unsure whether it is a suitable family for their grandson and try to save him from this family.This film comes across as an old-fashioned Western with a slow but intense pace where two different families try to keep the grandson in their family. For example, the film sometimes comes across as a long Game of Thrones episode where the characters argue with each other, but if someone says something wrong, it can cause more restless tension.The acting is also done well by the film cast. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane have great chemistry together in this movie and come across as believable as an elderly couple. Lesley Manville, along with Jeffrey Donovan, creates some uncomfortable tension in the film as the Weboy family."
82,"Yes, it's got a gruff, blue jeaned Kevin Costner in the Montana, North Dakota area, but this is a far cry from the fantastic Yellowstone. (But that no doubt helped Costner pick up a pay check for this). More of a boring, downer of a movie. The Weboy family is almost (unintentionally) funny, as bad guy - and esp gal - caricatures."
83,It was a good movie overall. Very graphic and depressing. I cried during this movie. The only thing I didn't like was that it had the typical thriller theme that the protagonist isn't really prepared to take on what they will face.
84,I think best film this year. Loved... Cried little bit. Thank you for making this kind of movies I will give to my mom to watch...
85,"Having just watched this, i'm not sure about all the 'film of the year' and 'Oscar-worthy' reviews on here, but I guess that's because the bar *is* low thanks to 2020 being the worst year for new movies in living memory (yeah i know, covid).However, I digress, this is still a watchable film with particulary fine performances from veteran leads Costner and the ever lovely Diane Lane. Chemistry between the two as an aging married couple is impressive and very believable. Also a shout out to main female protagonist/matriach Blanche Weboy played with evil aplomb by Lesley Manville (Maleficent).To its credit, accurate representation of the era (60s), great cinematography of the stunning Badlands vistas and an atmospheric score add to the proceedings, but alas, the pacing is a bit slow over its linear two hour run time while the outcome becomes pretty apparent once we meet the movie's surrogate family from Hell.The storyline is well documented already so I won't bother going into min-ute detail, but if i do have a major gripe it's that Lane's relentless obsession with waltzing into a perfectly legal if dubious situation focused only on her own selfish motives was rather obviously short-sighted and foolhardy, as you will no doubt see for yourself.All in all not a classic by any stretch, but still a competent slice of old-school Americana with a couple of decent twists and turns by journey's inevitably lonely end."
86,"Defiantly Kevin Costner's best movie of the last 20 years. Very Clint Eastwoodian. Hopefully this is a career revival for him because he was amazing. Diane Lane was also marvelous in this movie.Also;One of the best films of 2020. Stunningly heartbreaking performances by Lane and Costner. The film effuses an honesty that guides the pair through the inquietude of the North Dakota terrain.While the film is classified as a thriller, the undying love between George and Margaret serves as the impetus that guides them. The pacing is masterfully deliberated, as we are granted moments to absorb the significance of the events that ensue.The screenplay is sincere and profound at times, as the meditative quality of the characters serves as a very fitting parallel to the breathtaking Montana skies."
87,"Take a dash of ""Deliverence"", a splash of ""Chainsaw"" and a big helping of Kevin Costner's many fine Westerns and mix in a sweet and tough as nails, Oscar worthy Annette Benning and you have ""Let Him Go"". An honest, bare knuckle look at something way too many families must have to deal with in real life, violence put upon their loved ones who are no longer under their roof."
88,Fantastic film..Great acting..but why Lesley Manville? Are they no American actresses left?
89,"The movie leaves a bad feeling because of the irrealistic scenes. Kevin is a former sherif but acts like an amateur.
Their son dies falling from a horse. Their daughter in law then marries a narsist, who himself also has been abused by his mother. The narsist abuses his wife and son and the new family move to the remote house of the narsists family. The grandmother and grandfather try to kidnap their grandson from the maniac family. The first attempt the grandfather his four fingers gets chopped of by the family. The second attempt the grandfather is forced to kill four or five people from the maniac family and he gets also killed. Finally the grandson gets rescued living with the grandmother."
90,Foreshadows the coming lawlessness descending on the U$ with the polarization of values between the 2 families standing in for the polarized values between Trump's Chump Klueless Kristian Kluxxers & rational people.
91,"The plot is derived from a novel. The story begins well but becomes melodramatic, with an old-fashioned western movie ending.Considering that this story takes place in the sixties, it is not very plausible today. Nevertheless an interesting drama with unfortunate consequences. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane give good performances."
92,"I knew nothing about this film going into the theater. No trailer, poster, nothing. I love the tension in the air from the opening scene on. Even upbeat moments press against the screen. Having grandkids, this just broke my heart. You feel every moment and can't help but walk in their shoes. Masterful acting, subtle storytelling with little dialogue, brilliant directing, beautiful scenery, dreadful characters that you physically fear - not for what they are doing but what they may do, if disturbed just a bit. Nobody kicks a hornet nest, they simply walk past and get stung. One of the best films I've ever experienced!"
93,"Best movie I've seen all year...not sure how anyone could have anything negative to say about it. The ""big event"" happened within the first five minutes and had you emotionally engaged the entire time. Great ending, great action, and fantastic plot. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were incredible. The shooting locations were breathtaking and so was the action. Don't listen to people who give this less than an 8 honestly."
94,"With sweeping vistas and excellent script, plus the outstanding cast, this is the must-see western for the 2000's. Slowing building to a boil, the ending explodes as the two sides clash over the fate of a young boy and his mother."
95,"Tension filled, well acted and gritty; ""Let Him Go"" is the definition of a slow burn with a satisfying pay off.In this drama, a retired sheriff and his wife, grieving over the death of their son, set out to find their grandson who has been taken away without reason.My one issue with ""Let Him Go"" was that it may have been too much a slow burn. It could've been a little shorter and I think that would've worked better. Aside from that, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are incredible. They both deliver intense performances, some of their best in years. Lesley Manville is twisted and delivers a commanding role. Aside from the pace, ""Let Him Go"" is well shot and overall intriguing with a third act that will knock your socks off.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"
96,"There's a way in which this film could have been made in the 1940s. Substitute Bette Davis for Diane Lane, George Brent for Kevin Costner, and Mary Astor for Lesley Manville, and the structure would have been pretty much the same. Because the key conflict was, and is here, between female characters, such films were labelled ""women's pictures,"" which was meant as a derogatory term. But history's whirligig has brought about a welcome reassessment, by way of outstanding revisionist works such as THE HOURS and CAROL, as well as reimaginings such as THELMA AND LOUISE, in which the rivalry is replaced by partnership and cooperation in the face of common goals.In LET HIM GO, there are two strong-willed mothers who fight, by fair means or foul, for possession of a child. There's a nice moral ambiguity: it's not at all clear that Lane's character is any less ruthless than her nemisis, played by Manville. However, on the acting front it isn't ambiguous at all. Lane is very good. Very good indeed. But she's up against Manville, who is great. Very great, and in a mere handful of scenes. It might seem an unfair comparison when Lane's character carries the movie on her shoulders, but that's the way it is. The acting all round is high standard, but from the moment Manville appears she's the one you're interested in.All in all, it's a nicely-paced, old-fashioned movie, raised to a higher level by a knockout performance."
97,"Best Show to come along in a long long while... DO NOT watch the trailer as it give too much away and will lower the surprise factor of the movie. I watched the trailer after we watched movie and i'm glad we did not see beforehand...
Full disclosure. Big Costner fan from Yellowstone."
98,Trumpest vs left liberals western very good goes to show never marry into a right wing nut family
99,"I watching this engrossing film, Costner now in his twilight years somewhat reminds me of Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood in a role what they did best... And while watching this great film I wondered this is what Bronson should of been doing in the late 70s and 1980s.. Using his stoic presence to work around a thriller that will tear you apart. Costner and Diane do a fine job in their rolls and this is by far one of the best films of 2020 next to Boss Level and fatman.."
