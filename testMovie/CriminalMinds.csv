0,"Truly a great series worthy of praise. Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining! Fantastic!"
1,"Ever since they let Thomas Gibson go the writing has significantly gone down. Wish he could have articulated and set a standard with out anger. He unfortunately, was correct. The writers left to own devices are not producing story lines that captures anyone's attention"
2,"Criminal Minds started out really well. A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead."
3,"I loved this series.But, it started a nosedive crash into boredom and sloppiness with the introduction of new actors in place of Thomas Gibson and Matthew Gray Gubler.The new characters are dull, drab, hamming their roles and do not fit with the group nicely.The run-time of the episodes also dropped and they wander off into the personal lives of the characters.Is it just me who feeling the show is going downhill or other fans too?I hope they will come back to bring the show to its former status."
4,"I was a hardcore fan for 11 seasons. I've seen every episode, but this last season is absolutely the s'worst. I don't know if they got new writers, or the writers are just totally out of touch with the fanbase, but it has become ridiculous and soap-like. The Reid-line has taken forever, and it's really painful to watch. I think, I'll drop the show, and maybe pick it up again later, when they maybe get it back to it's former standards. But I fear, that this is it for Criminal Minds. With the downfall, I'm not sure it will survive for a 13th season."
5,"In the earlier seasons of Criminal Minds, specifically season 1, 2 and even 3 and 4, the writing was awesome, and the team actually profiled to find the bad guy. In season 5 I think it started to go downhill slowly but surely, with poor writing. Season 6 has been absolutely abysmal, with getting rid of JJ and Prentiss, and the writing has left a lot to be desired. If you're going to watch Criminal Minds, I really recommend watching seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order and judging for yourself but I think you'll find the earlier seasons are infinitely better than the crap they're giving us now. But it did use to be a great show. Now, not so much."
6,"This is one of the best shows I have ever watched (and I watch some of the best on TV - The West Wing, all of the Law and Orders, House MD). On Wednesday nights, I use to watch ""The West Wing"", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch ""Head Cases"", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled. So, on a whim, I tried out ""Criminal Minds"". I have never made a better TV decision.Criminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law & Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.If you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you."
7,"I have watched each episode of Criminal Minds, and I agree with the writer from Canada about this show (and also about their comments on NCIS, which seems to have more spark and humor than the other CSI shows).Mandy Patinkin turns anything he's in to pure gold, and I hope ""Criminal Minds"" will get a long run! The plots are engaging, the cast interacts well together, and nobody comes off as being too ""preachy,"" as you get with some of the CSIs and Law & Orders.Thanks for the opportunity to support a fine show which is up against some tough competition. I watched ""Lost"" quite a bit it's first season, but finally got bored with it because it never seemed to have any resolution. Just episode upon episode of wondering why it wasn't going anywhere. In other words, ""Lost"" lost me! And I'm starting to get that same feeling with ""Desperate Housewives,"" too. When I was a kid I really enjoyed ongoing serials; but not that much anymore.... Shows like Criminal Minds and Numbers and NCIS manage to make you think you've watched a complete story; and from my point of view, I respond to that kind of entertainment much, much better!"
8,"I have watched every single episode of Criminal Minds up until this past season. I have enjoyed the intricate plots, the character development, the story lines. I have to say that over the last year, the whole feel of the show has completely changed. Too many character departures, too many new character faces, and now Reid in jail? Come on Criminal Minds. I just can't anymore. I am not enjoying it at all anymore and I couldn't finish the season. So, now I have decided that I have to quit you. And in all honesty, I don't know if I'll miss you."
9,"the CSI-ish stuff is solid and intriguing and the acting is good. There are some very nice relationships developing between the team, especially Gideon and Reid (there's a hint of father/ son vibe between them that plays very nicely). Particularly interesting is the character of Reid and how he's slowly growing out of his shell (combination of slight autism and general ""I grew up as a freak"" syndrome perhaps). but there is one gripe that I have. Why is it that the only one of them with a life that we ever see is Hotch. No I'm not saying that Hotch and Morgan should drag Reid to a strip club or to get drunk at a bar. but it would be nice to get a few personal details about these folks. Learn what makes them tick. that said, I'm enjoying the show and certainly want to see it remain on for a very long time."
10,"Criminal Minds shows the viewers that it takes wits to beat the bad guys. The common link between CM & CSI is that the question of ""How?"" is always more interesting.The only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering & collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.Criminal Minds involves more psychology & sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.Another reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.As casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.When I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.For example: Einstein: ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."" Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, & we are capable of anything & everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.In conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy."
11,"What ever happened to decent script writers in America is probably a TV show that would garner an amazing amount of viewers and positive reviews (if they can find the answer), because for the past few years, this show has declined in quality very heavily, in no coincidence to the demise of similar shows like CSI and Law and Order, whilst at the same time seeing a massive surge in quality comedy shows, such as It's always sunny in Philadelphia.The actual attempts to keep the show going are becoming more and more embarrassing, with the current long term cast now unlikely to ever see acting jobs after this show ends in the likely next year or two.The fact they have taken on actors from shows that were canned, more likely due to the appalling acting from themselves, is even more testament to the shows demise.If you really want to watch this show, check out the early days, series 1- 10, and be enthralled by good TV, but after that just leave this one alone, it is so embarrassing to watch that even Canadian TV does better!"
12,"I really love this show. I have always been interested in criminal psychology, and after going to school for a degree in Criminal Justice, someone (my professor) told me that this show was starting up and to watch it.It is so wonderful! It really goes in depth with how profiling really works. It keeps a great story line all the way through, with many twists and bizarre themes. The characters in the show are established very well, with interesting personalities that really hold the show together.Crime+Psychology=Criminal Minds.And that's the truth."
13,"I have watched this show since day one. I am sorry to say without Hotchner this show is doomed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The woman that is now in charge was so-so as just one of the group but as the boss she is pathetic! The three newest ""actors"" are really bad. The black woman that used to be Ross' girlfriend on friends is okay, the hispanic guy is mediocre and the latest guy, the MONOTONE black guy is just so horrible, how could anyone have cast him on this show??????? Just listening to his boring voice is enough to put any insomniac to sleep..........This 12th year should be the downfall of this show. When 2 of the best characters are no longer on the show after such a long run and are replaced by such horrible actors, it is surely doomed. Hotchner was the very best character on this show and without him and the way this show has spiraled into the depths, I think season 12 episode 10 is the final one for me. Goodbye Criminal Minds."
14,"I absolutely hate the inconsistent way they resolve the cases. One of them will, OUTTA NOWHERE come up with some phrase or thought that will magically turn into the solution to a problem they haven't dug for long enough.There's one episode where a kid is missing and the teacher is trying to save them. So when he's interrogated he says ""I was trying to save them"" and one of the cop guys starts going ""save them ...save them"" so he gets excited and writes ""saved them"" on a paper. now that's MAGICALLY the password to this guy's computer. I mean, seriously? who the frack comes up with this bull? I've wrote movies/video games/TV shows 100 times better than this and I can't find anyone to give me an opportunity, but these pot heads are writing full seasons?PS: how THIS show gets as many seasons but firefly doesn't is beyond me."
15,"Hotchner is the legal mind, and the one to keep everything together. The show now suffers without him. ""Wheels up in 30,"" just doesn't sound the same coming from others. Don't get me wrong, I like the other characters, but Hotch was the glue. Egos need to let it go and do what is right not what you can do to throw the playground tantrum to get what you want. No respect for people with money using that as a means of getting their way...childish!!! Hotch started on this show and his character was the most interesting. He needs to be back on the show or I feel the show is going to reach a slow demise."
16,"This is a quality programme, I found it a few weeks ago it was on after CSI Vegas and myself and the girlfriend decided we would give it ago, After all variety is the spice of life. Within ten minutes we were hooked the cast is so well assembled we especially love Dr Spencer Reid, He is comes a cross like a real nervous geek, In his own words he looks like a teaching assistant. I think the stories are very well thought out, and the acting is super. I never thought I could take Thomas Gibson as a serious actor after Darma and Greg. But I think he is so good in this, You can almost hear his brain ticking over as he mulls over any given situation. As for the rest they all gel so well together. This programme will raise the tension so high within the first ten minutes and will leave you hanging of the edge of the edge of your seat until the last very moment. It's amazing. This programme has definitely made it into my must watch TV schedule along with the CSI franchise Cold Case and Law and Order SVU."
17,"I have to say that this is my absolute favorite show on TV. I use to say that about CSI or other shows that touched a little on profiling. But I love psychology. And we have seen shows that we may have liked like the profiler that we know isn't correct. It doesn't happen that way. I will say that I enjoyed it.The only other show I truly miss is Fox's The Inside. That was a good one as well but nothing like this. I have bought at least ten books on profiling that discuss different types of psychopaths,how they were created and the different psychological issues that surrounds their behavior and fantasies. How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like. But many others, like Robert Ressler describe this profession in a similar way as Criminal Minds. I hope it stays on. It is the coolest. Just to clarify, I like learning why they do it. I hate what they do and how it hurts people. I don't wan't people to think I enjoy entertainment for the sake of seeing people pain or horror. I think you will enjoy this show too. The actors have a great chemistry together already. Reid is my favorite. He makes you laugh when he really is meanting too. He give the crew the most character I think."
18,"They always replaced actors in this tv show, and many fans didin't like this (myself included), but eventually some would come back. and in season 12 they simply remove the best actor, agent hotchner (tomas gibson) without explaining anything about it.
And they replaced his position with Emily Prentiss? And not JJ? Emily is the worst character, wasn't missed during her absence in the show.
was the worst decision ever.. I think a lot of fans hated the show after this season. I always bought all seasons and I regret buying this box of 12."
19,"So I've been watching this show ever since it's beginnings and all I can say is that I'm sick of it... 5 seasons would have been enough. But since I have a mild OCD that urges me to see things to an end, I can't stop watching.Joke aside... this has become a painful to watch show. It has nothing interesting anymore, it just repeats the same formula over and over for the sake of ratings and/or money. Next to no story whatsoever, just episodes almost without any connection. Just pick an episode and watch, you're not missing anything. Writers out of ideas? Or perhaps due to lack of ideas, they're trying to turn some watchers into sources of inspiration?But I digress...The thing I find annoying is that although it has an interesting intrigue (actually 2 now) it isn't properly followed through, leaving the viewer wanting more, but all he/she gets is yet another stupid episode on a random subject.I'm going to leave out all the abundant plot holes and bloopers because hey, it's a movie, it's fiction, it's not supposed to be perfect but what they're doing with the ""story"" is just ridiculous.I really hope this show ends soon."
20,"Criminal Minds seems to fall in the category of popular enough that people who loves lazily written, simple to follow, repetitive garbage will watch it in masses, but bad enough that most critics, professional or online, prefers not to acknowledge its existence. I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound cliché enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the ""funny"" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these ""characters"", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually. I'm utterly convinced the writers of this series does not have a creative bone in their bodies.I cannot wait for the day this series gets cancelled cause good riddance and hopefully I can enjoy AJ Cook in something again."
21,"This show used to be great, but after the first episode of season 14 I couldn't stand watching it anymore. I realize that the show was never terribly realistic (who wants to see that?), but now it's just absurd. They solve cases in the most nonsensical, far fetched ways and some of the motives behind the killers are so incredibly stupid I just cringe for the writers (like the dude that used to play pirates as a kid and ended up drowning people. Give me a break).Also, I absolutely love Reid and was always entertained by him being a super genius, but now suddenly everyone on the team is a super genius too and they all know every arbitrary fact about everything in the world? Please! In the first episode of season 14 practically every person on the team knew everything there is to know about the number 300 and use some arbitrary fact they pulled out of no where to find and save Reid. It's more like a magic show now than it is deduction and actual profiling. End the show already!"
22,"I can't in my wildest dreams understand how this show have a rating above 8. It always starts out fairly good, but then in all episodes ever made of the show, the plot holes or leaps in logic begin to come up everywhere. The show is an 8 until 70% of the episode has been played. Then the last 30% ends up in buggery. It's almost always the same. Every episode has a lot of good and smart points in the beginning. I understand, there's some smart writers among the writers, but why must you every time end the episode with lazy logic, simple solutions which are painful to watch logically. When so much else in the series is well thought out, this is sad to see. This series could be so much better, if only they stop the dumb solutions. I understand there is a time limit to every episode, but please, stop the dumb endings. Many other series manage to keep up the logic pace, why can't you?"
23,"I been viewing this show since it started and all I see is the same Plot. ""unsub"" is deranged FBI must come in to help ignorant police and local detectives who cannot point out the obvious but somehow these ""Saviors"" must help us ""normal"" people out like we cannot decipher things out ourselves. Plus we must sit through the ""bad"" agent Derek Morgan work out his demons by beating out suspects (who are somehow related or the actual perpetrators) to reconcile his demeanor. I would only continue to like this show if somehow they would change the setting. like the police in whatever city they are in would not be so ignorant and make a difference. Kind of makes you think of how Hollywood sees the People and would recognize. But I guess if it sells it sells."
24,"The characters in this show rarely talk to each other in a realistic manner. You can divide the dialogue into categories: putting someone down, describing an ""unsub"", delivering plot points (narrative), cool sounding sound-bites and the occasional, extremely rare, actual human interaction.Who ever heard of a team of 5 people giving a presentation to a local police detachment where each team member speaks one sentence in a choreographed verbal merry-go-round. But this happens in each and every episode.Predictable per episode: - the black guy will tackle someone without any assistance just before everyone else arrives (I guess he drives in a different and faster car) - the local law enforcement are idiots and are berated as such multiple times - the word ""unsub"" will be repeated multiple times and other ""technical"" terms will be used to make the team sound extra smart and then the terms will be explained to the locals who are too stupid to understand - one character will walk into a room and ask another ""whats up?"" at which point the other character will explain some detail of the case as if the first person had no training whatsoever. In reality this is just talking directly to the audience and delivering plot points to move the story along according to the predictable fill in the blanks script pattern.Horrible, yet typical crime drama."
25,"The drama/mystery/thriller ""Criminal Minds"" is truly an amazing show. I started only watching it couple of months ago, and I can't believe that it took me so long to discover it. This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them. Since I started watching the show, I am trying to catch up the seasons that I missed, so I watch the re-runs every time I have a chance getting the ""crash course"" of Criminal Minds. What amazes me that watching so many episodes in such short period of time only makes me wanting to see more. I don't recall a single mediocre episode. All of them share the intelligent writing, compelling story, inspired acting from the regular members of the cast (an elite team of FBI profilers - BAU analysts) and the guest stars. I like the music score and the choice of songs is very fitting for each occasion. I also like the famous quotes which one of the team members tells in the end of each episode, which sums up the story perfectly. More than once, I was moved deeply by the way the story was going and its resolution. What keeps me entrancing to the screen during each episode is the brain storm, the collective mind of the team putting the evidence, the small details together, analyzing them, searching for the right question to ask their super computer analyst Penelope Garcia; so she would perform her magic and come up with the one name - of the unsub who must be stopped before he attacks deadly again.I also noticed how masterfully the creators make the references not only to the real life famous cases but to the earlier films and books. I recognized the references to Tom Harris's Dr. Hannibal's books (the horrifying parts of ""Hannibal"" made one of the darkest and devastating two-hours episode) and films, to ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"", to ""Natural Born Killers"". One memorable episode paid homage to both ""Psycho"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Often, the writers find the subjects for the episodes from the latest news. But no matter where they find the topics for the show, each episode comes out as gripping and absorbing from the first moment to the very end. To put it shortly -the must for the fans of the genre."
26,"From the introduction of the first episode, I was hooked! I especially enjoy the quotes and comments at the opening and closing of each episode. Of course, the plot and characters are what make it work. I'm not a ""TV watcher."" This is the only show I watch faithfully. Other than this, I watch the news or rent a movie. ""Criminal Minds"" is what I look forward to on Wednesday nights. The suspense, the variety of characters, the humor - what a nice mix. Pantikin is such a father figure for the cast. Matthew Gray Gubler as the resident genius Dr. Reid is a hoot! The women are gorgeous. Shemur Moore makes a sexy Derek."
27,"I officially stop watching this stupid show tonight after seeing the premise: beating people over the head, tying them to a car bumper & dragging their bodies on the road. I started watching this show 5 years ago because I like Joe Mantegna, but he's only in it for the paycheck. The early seasons had intriguing stories and chemistry among the cast. Now every single episode is about a sick, sadistic man (usually) who abducts people and cuts their body parts off, or tortures people to death because the writers can't think of anything else. In one episode, a killer gouges victims eyes out. Another, he cuts their ears off. Another, he cuts people's internal organs out.The ""team"" look like a bunch of GQ models, simultaneously spouting out their textbook knowledge of Criminal Science, but not actually conversing or listening to each other. They all talk at the same time, and even finish each others's sentences. They act so intelligent, like they have Masters degrees in Criminal Justice & Forensic Science, but they don't get a speck of dirt on their designer clothes. It's so phony, it's ridiculous. I love dark, violent thrillers, but challenging, original stories that we care about, and characters who have conversations, not all talking together as if they know everything. I'm glad everyone else likes the show, but I can't take this same old formulaic, conceited nonsense anymore."
28,"This show thinks it's so smart, it takes itself so seriously - it makes me nauseous.I just came from doing laundry at the laundromat. Unfortunately, there was a TV there, and this awful excuse for a show was on the entire time I was there. I tried to stand on top of a table to try to turn the TV off the show was so excruciatingly bad and annoying, but I couldn't manage it. So, I just had to sit there and wait for my clothes to get done with this trash on.There was a scene in this show where this unbearably cheeky guy was like, ""He was wearing such and such brand of shirt, which indicates he came from the neighborhood of such and such because the socio-economic dynamics of that neighborhood match the victimology of the yadayadayada."" Right. That's how real life works. There would never be any uncertainty, any painstaking investigation, any drawn-out process, any wrong conclusions. Everything, every answer, is right there for the taking and it's found in one second. Yeah, right, that's how things work.This show is absolutely terrible. It's one of the most annoying shows I've ever seen. It's very, very, very bad.While doing laundry tonight, I wanted to rip the TV off of the wall and throw it off of a bridge, this show is THAT bad."
29,"The profilers, out of thin air, magically know the age sex and past of way too many of the people they're chasing. Profiling is one thing but this gets way overboard. And the conclusion always has a hostage with a gun or knife to their neck. Plus how many times do we need to hear someone call out in a dark building ""hello is anyone there"" or say they're calling the police and turn their back so they can get hit. Instead of good scripts the writers take too many liberties and too often the easy way out."
30,"This show is about a team of investigators, headed by a quirky, omniscient father figure, investigating violent murders. Sound familiar? It should. This is just another CSI. And not a very good one. Within the CSI spectrum, I'd place this below Miami, but above NY, which isn't saying much, as Miami and NY are pretty mediocre television.The acting is good, but the actors have nothing to work with- the writing is completely paint by numbers. Each show follows a cookie cutter formula, the plots rarely extend over multiple shows, the character development is feeble and the show has almost no humor. Every episode involves a last minute 'are they going to make it?' type of plot device. Ultimately, it gets very tiring and predictable.Other than the grisly subject matter, this show feels like it it's being targeted towards the elderly. The dialog is slow, the plots are brutally simple/easy to understand, there's zero pop culture references, there's no need to remember details from previous shows- very little is expected of the viewer.I watched the first 12 episodes (on DVD) in hopes that it would somehow improve/develop a life of it's own. It didn't."
31,"Once you have watched one episode, you basically have watched the whole series. The characters are so unrealistic it borders on fairytale. Every episode follows the exact same pattern:
1. Arrive at the office and get a case.
2. ""Wheels up in 20.""
3. Arrive at the crime scene.
4. Figure everything out in 20 minutes making local LE look like total morons. 
5. Fly back on the same jet (minus the goofs with wrong tail numbers) 
6. Listen to a famous quote to give this series some ""philosophical"" je n' sais quoi with corny music to boot.
End of story."
32,"I do not need to go on about how the show is - you contributors with your excellent analysis have all shed light on various aspects of the show. The three main things which I like are 1) the way they deal with violence and gore 2) the way each team member has its own special talents and use them to piece a part of the big crime puzzle 3) The way they look out for each other and act as one cohesive unit. I don't know why this show has not received the media attention , limelight, reviews and attention it deserves. I mean there are no outtakes, no behind the scenes, bloopers, nothing (zilch). Maybe it is because of money problems that the show keeps running into time and again, as pointed out by other contributors. But the reason the show gets renewed season after season every year is a testament to its substance and the talent of its cast.This show deserves more, even more than shows like Castle, Mentalist CSI and all that jazz.Shout to all the cast members. God bless you guys."
33,"I've watched every single episode and watched many more than once... If you are into Crime Drama and you are looking for something to get into, then start at series 1, episode 1 & you'll be hooked... I guarantee it!"
34,"When I first encountered this show, I thought it was brilliant. Unlike any other condescending, same routine law enforcement themed shows, this was a refreshing change in characters point of view and genre as well. Strong acting, well written scripts and great screenplay helped as well. It kept me glued to the screen at suspense. However, after season 2, when the character ""Jason Gideon"", played by Mandy Patinkin, was written off the show, I do not know whether the writers changed or if there was a budget cut, but the show started slipping down a common hit-series' downfall. Actors were given ridiculous lines and the tone of the show turned into very condescending and patronizing, ""We are the true Heroes who does it all"" nuisance. Lines and story lines given to its main Characters made them seem as if they were trying too hard to give that lone wolf-law enforcement vibe, not because they were worn out by the reality they face everyday but because it'd make them look cool. I gave the show ""6 out of 10"" because of these reasons, and each season these vibes have gotten worse with character changes and downgrade of plots. I wish the show would take its true form again, bringing back the refreshing plots and character studies."
35,"Love Mandy and I guess that carried the show for me while he was on it. Once he left there seemed to be a major decline in scripts and actors.Then each actor needed to have an episode about their personal angst. Which could have been interesting if the writers were any good, instead peeking into the agents personal lives just seemed tawdry and cheap.What has finally tipped the scale to where I can not abide this show is the actor who plays David Rossi. This actor is 70 yrs old and looks 80. Since when does the FBI allow a 70 yr old agent to run around the field? Every time he is on I see his chicken neck and unctuous behavior. Rest of the cast has devolved into one of each for PC purposes.Oh, and baby girl needs to learn how to professionally dress and speak or she would have been fired so fast.There is a lot more that has been said in other 1 star reviews so I will end my gripe."
36,"This is yet another show forced upon me by my significant other and....It wouldn't be bad if it was the first of it's kind, but it's not, this is exactly like ALL the other shows she makes me watch.Honestly, you've seen this before, back when it was called ""Law & Order."" What you have here is another procedural. What you have here is yet another in a long lines of crime shows that imitate one another.""Criminal Minds"" is just like ""Law & Order,"" which in turn is just like ""Law & Order: SVU,"" which is just like ""NCIS"" which is just like ""How to Get Away With Murder."" The cast is different, the characters are different, but honestly, it is the exact same show. You hardly even notice the different dialogue between the shows. The differences are so subtle it's hard to tell them all apart.Don't get me wrong, if you are the type that enjoys the soothing, warm, blanket of repetition. If you are one of the people that fears change. if you do not have an adventurous bone in your body, than this is the show for you.If repetitive, goose-stepping, conformity is your cup of tea than this is the show for you. You can rest assured that ""Criminal Minds"" will be no different than the thousand other television shows that are exactly like it."
37,"I have watched four Criminal Minds episodes, including the pilot and, as of this posting, the episode entitled ""Sex, Birth, Death"". As much as I like Mandy Patinkin and the eye candy that seem to always be employed in these shows (Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore), I find Criminal Minds to be a very grim, ugly and, ultimately, pointless crime drama.Considering the very dark subject matter and the fact that a few other current shows that have done a better job in storytelling and creating interesting lead characters (i.e.: Law & Order: SVU, the original C.S.I.), Criminal Minds is just picking up the uninteresting scraps from other police procedural dramas.I noticed that the show is slowly becoming a big hit in the Nielsen ratings for CBS. I just wished the show was of better quality to merit the higher ratings."
38,"My wife and I are avid viewers of Criminal Minds not that we enjoy the violent nature of the show but rather because it shows how our world is evolving. The BAU is supposed to be a talent pool to sort out the nature of crimes and stop them. However, after the departure of Shemar Moore who played Derek Morgan and Thomas Gibson who played Aaron Hotchner the introduction of new actors has left the show sadly lacking. Adam Rodriguez who plays Luke Alvez is fine actor with talent and dramatic skill and we enjoyed his time with NCIS Miami and he is a welcome actor to Criminal Minds. However, the addition of Aisha Tyler who plays Dr. Tara Lewis is laughable at best and downright foolish. she is OK doing the chat show TALK but has absolutely no acting skills and is so unbelievable as the character she is portraying that she drags down each episode she appears in. Also, Damon Gupton who plays Stephen Walker is not convincing as a member of the BAU of the FBI. In the fist place he brings no acting skills and people wonder who in heavens name is this guy. His performance is flat and he is like a hanger-on to the rest of the group. Criminal Minds had a formula that worked and made each episode quality entertainment but since the desire to accommodate the black acting community the show is much less. People like Denzel Washington did not ever need to be boosted up for any part and this what is happening here Carl Stewart"
39,"I'm watching this show for this first time and like all the other crime shows like CSI and Without a Trace, this show is full of grisly, exploitative violence that seems to be there just for the sake of grisly, exploitative violence. But moreover, the writing is full of melodrama and overwrought emotion. The actors are similarly hammy and really pile it on. Mandy Patinkin, in particular, is full of false pathos. I understand that you need to make a show sensational, but does it always have to be child molestation and murder? Maybe this is fun for some, but for me, it makes me feel icky for watching it. I don't care if they catch the criminal; I'm not going to make it through this episode."
40,"Just saw the latest episode of the brown hair women killing people because of the grief of the loss of her son.The only issue I have with this show is the profilers more or less guarantee what they say is true. They never say ""if we profile this person it falls under this category, but on the otherhand, there is a chance this could be a crazy person who just does random things"".Therefore, this show is a mess.Lastly in the latest episode it made no sense for the security guard to go off in alarm when a motherly figure checks on a child if he is OK. This makes no sense as we live in a sexist society, in which the security guard would definitely check on a male who did the same thing as he would suspect child predator but would never suspect on a female as he would think ""motherly figure""."
41,"This show is very difficult to talk about as there are several positive aspects to it. The acting is great and some episodes (especially the first episode) are interesting. Some of the villain's motivations are also interesting and that's really fun. However, I they just explain literally everything. Why does this psycho castrate people? Cause he was bullied and never got a girlfriend in High School. Tragic right? It's not a total exaggeration of everyday life, pretending it's serious. Other villains don't fair better. There's a guy who kills people and makes himself look like a reptile, who's also obsessed with Tattoos for some reason. There's a new villain in every episode. And the crew uses a plane to get to place to place. So yes, the a group of remarkable people use a plane to get to place to place (which is normal) to fight comic book villains l. Which to be fair is fun sometimes but hard to take seriously."
42,"I'm a big fan of thrillers. I have come across many worst shows, but nothing is as disgusting as this one. I have no idea how could someone cast ""Mandy Patinkin"" in a lead role. His every single dialog delivery irritates me to the core. This show does not give any technical details on how the killer works or how the profilers are trying to track killers down, but they somehow catch the killers and we have to assume that these guys are experts. This should be called a magic show... Since actors make some face expressions as if they are thinking really hard and after some time magically they catch the killer, without giving viewers any underlying technical details or facts that they are using to track the killer. Do they think viewers are so dumb...?If you want to watch crime detective thrillers then watch CSI - a great show and Bones or Numbers which are good shows and give complete technical details and facts that the characters in the shows put together to arrive at a conclusion, respecting viewers intelligence. Criminal Minds should not be even considered as a below average show. It's waste of viewers time. Finally, do not waste your precious time on this terrible show..."
43,"This show has denigrated into the biggest stinking pile of garbage I have seen in a long time. This baby boy/baby girl crap between Garcia, the overweight creepy, weepy computer tech. and one of the BAU has got to be the most ridiculous piece of writing I have seen in a long time. Then you throw in Prentiss and the genius geek with all their personal problems and it equals an extremely weak writing staff without any ideas except falling back on the BAU members personal and family problems. Jeez, talk about a big pile of stink. I used to watch and DVR this show when it first came on the air, now I do not even bother, especially when I see an episode with some sort of member problem like Garcia and her boyfriend. Who gives a crap about her personal problems. Do your job, suck it up or start a Hallmark store with Prentiss and the other weak members of your team."
44,"I had never seen an episode of this series before using it as a night light several weeks ago. I was going through a bout of insomnia and had one ear open for the audio. It became clear within the first minute of the show that the writers had attempted to imitate the classic-movie references in NCIS by having the narrator/star quote lines from poetry, and later in the episode lines from some novel. Then, as I couldn't help getting up and watching as well as listening to the horrid scenes, the ripoff was even more evident as there was the blond incarnation of NCIS' lab genius -- comic hair, makeup, and clothing and manner of speech and attraction to the lead male character and more! After that shock, I simply had to watch for a few minutes to try to understand how this less than poorly- written and cast and directed series could have lasted more than five seasons. There is no humanly logical reason! The characters never crack a smile, they speak in monotonic reading style, with not even time for a breath between characters' dialogue. First there is a question as to what happened in a crime scene, then, without pause to ponder, another character comes up with the solution, and, again without pause, another character adds (with conviction) other details to the solution, and on and on.It must be tiring for the lead male actor to be so boring and so solemn throughout taping. Then there is the character who is supposed to have multiple doctorates in courses no one has ever heard of. Why, for pity's sake, would anyone who is not addicted to the classroom ever want so many degrees? Study many subjects, yes; but get degrees? And to top that, work for a government agency? Truly unbelievable. I guess that was a ripoff of NUMBERS.Can't stand even to listen to this show in my sleep! Guess I will have to tune to some all-night commercials; but if I ever again hear that spooky blond woman, who pretends to be a bombshell, that governmental agency will have to come get me and take me to a loony bin!"
45,"I originally came to write this as my stomach would not allow me not to. That's possibly bad English but I'm feeling nauseous so please forgive me. I'm nauseous because my wife watches this ''show'' and occasionally I am in the same room, picking up the corny lines, empty characters and vapid (or is it vacuous?) conclusions expressed by the main leads; it hurts me that this disgustingly non-representative example of how criminals are caught (if they ever are) can be enjoyed by an individual I consider intelligent. That hurts. Apparently this drama is enjoyed by many. Other individuals say it ''rips off' CSI and NCIS. Who cares? I've been subjected to those (and all the derivatives too) and they are no better. I am a citizen of the United Kingdom, I watch the news. From what I can gather none of this is real, at least in its depiction of catching criminals. It's not realistic, it's not factual, but it is unpleasant and designed (the episodes) to nauseate. Mission accomplished? I think not. Burn it."
46,"This thing has slumped to an even keel with Halloweenie ""LIII"", budget must be around $125 an episode. You would be better served by watching re-runs or by reading a book on ancient knitting techniques. this stuff is not even ""camp"" its damp. Truly a waste of fine actor talent. This is still a great fashion parade for Penelope Garcia's glasses, maybe more muscly chest shots from Derek Morgan would pull this stinker out of the mud-hole its bogged down in. Of coarse a few more cute babies from Jennifer Jareau could warm our tear-less hearts.....and where's William LaMontagne. Somebody hire another barber for Dr. Reid and Dr. Tara. Yuck!!! This is right there with ""Once Upon a Time"""
47,"This show by creator Jeff Davies describes the hard-working assignments carried out by the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). The crack team of FBI Profilers undertake twisted cases and analyze the nation's most dangerous serial murderers and individual heinous crimes in an effort to anticipate their next moves before they strike again . The intelligent investigators form an elite group of profilers who use the best scientific and technical methods to resolve killings of extremely violent nature , where the perpetrator is unknown and to get detain the heinous delinquents , utilizing complex profilages and the occasional leap in logic . Using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses to solve the case . As they are mobile , thanks a to their luxurious plane and have the necessary cooperation with local police and other FBI agents . Based in Quantico , Virginia , BAU is a subsection of the FBI who discovers perpetrators using scientific analysis , high technology and solving difficult crimes , as they investigate the evidence from the crime scenes , compose a profile and try to prevent the individual grisly crimes in an effort their next moves before they strike again . With an extreme dedication towards their quest for the true facts , the chief staff , and their underlings investigate the evidence from the crime scenes , compose a profile and try to prevent the next deadly strike . This elite team of investigators work several twisted cases using scientific skills , computers and equipment that are capable of finding valuable tracks from the most allegedly unlikely sources . Majority of the techniques and technologies used in the BAU shown in the series are accurate and true to reality .The nice actors who play these notorious characters from BAU -whose members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members- , they are the followings : 1- Jason Gideon efficiently acted by Mandy Patinkin who inspires great respect to the other members but left the bureau after some difficult decisions . He has a special relationship with the young, socially withdrawn, genius Spencer Reid , whom he mentors . He is divorced and he has a 25-year-old son . He owns a remote cabin in the woods, where he likes to retire . 2- He is succeeded by his operational right hand man Aaron ""Hotch"" Hotchner well played by Thomas Gibson , he was a prosecutor for a time , it allows him to judge when and how it may be necessary to skirt the law to successfully capture and prosecute an UNSUB (unknown subject). He is often a hostage negotiator and has been for over a decade he states that he wrote a book on it . He is often referred to as a drill sergeant , rarely smiles and it is a common joke that he doesn't blink . He married Haley , Meredith Monroe , his high school sweetheart. 3- David Rossi performed by Joe Mantegna , previously retired , rejoins the bureau in an effort to make a difference in people's lives again and follow up on a case he worked years ago . He has been searching for a killer who killed a mother and father in the same house as their three children , the oldest of whom found the bodies . He promised the children that he would catch their parents' killer . He is one of the most experienced and having written a book on the subject. 4-Penelope Garcia amusingly interpreted by Kirsten Vangsness , a brilliant computer whiz who gets access to any database etc. She was put on a FBI watch list that consisted of only a handful of hackers in the world . After an incident in which Derek Morgan , Shemar Moore, couldn't remember her name, Garcia and Morgan talk to each other using pet names like ""sweet cheeks"", or ""hot stuff"". Garcia also has a tendency to answer her phone in outlandish ways . 5- FBI BAU Special Agent Derek Morgan is decently played by African-American Shemar Moore , who was formerly a Chicago Police Officer . After his father died when he was ten , he got into trouble and earned himself a juvenile criminal record . A local youth center coordinater acted as a surrogate father and helped Morgan earn a football college scholarship, but he also sexually abused him . 6- The still juvenile good-tempered Dr. Spencer Reid is excellently portrayed by Matthew Gray Gubler (who also directed some episodes) , he is an erudite on everything except real life. 7- A.J. Cook plays Agent Jennifer ""JJ"" Jareau , she decided to join the FBI after attending a book reading held by David Rossi, at the beginning her job involves mostly doing paperwork, talking to the media and the local authorities and comforting the victims' families ; in later seasons, she participates in field missions more often . She starts secretly dating Detective LaMontagne Jr. , Josh Stewart, whom she met on a case in New Orleans . In 3ª season they reveal their relationship and soon afterwards , JJ becomes pregnant. 8- FBI BAU Supervisory Agent Emily Prentiss was finely played by Paget Brewster. She is fluent in several languages and once worked for Interpol. It is later revealed that it was Chief Erin Strauss ,Jayne Atkinson , who put her on the team, hoping to use her in order to gain inside information against Hotchner . However, Prentiss becomes loyal to the team and, instead of betraying him , she prefers to tend her resignation . 9- FBI BAU Special Agent Elle Greenaway was played by Lola Glaudini, assigned as an expert in sexual crimes, after demonstrating her skills by assisting the team in capturing a pair of killers. In a dangerous mission she panics , compromising the operation and allowing the rapist to walk free."
48,"Two of the three outstanding actors (Thomas Gibson and Shemar More) left the series and left Joe Mantegna to carry the load. The other actors are okay but are not very convincing. The writers have run out of realistic stories and have resorted to unrealistic situations. It's the same story each time. *****Spoiler Alert ***** People get killed, the BAU profiles the killer from unrealistic information hacks into top security systems by Penelope (played by Kirsten Vangsness), and they rush to the murders current location (often found through amazing hacks into personal information) just in time to save the latest victim. Example of pathetically unrealistic story: for example episode S13:Ep4 ""Killer App"" *****Spoiler Alert**** The killer uses a small drone (that can fly through a window) that has a machine gun on it to fly into rooms and accurately pump multiple well placed shots into several victims and not hit the innocent bystanders. Someone did not tell the writers that when a bullet is fired from a small machine gun it causes recoil and the drone would be all over the place, not to mention the weight of 30+ rounds of ammo. Then Penelope cracks into an encrypted telephone message and figures it all out. Penelope also figures out, by her magical instant hacking, that over two hundred children were killed by this company that makes the machine gun drones and figures out it was all the fault of the lady who hired the drone pilots and her boss. And no matter how far away the drama is happening, the BAU is always first on the scene. They often uses the phrase ""wheels up in 20"" meaning that they can order their jet, file the flight plan, get the pilots, drive to the airport, not have to wait behind any other aircraft taking off, and be airborne in 20 minutes. After a few episodes it gets old. It's television fantasy at its.....well, you know."
49,"lame lame show and referring to the bad guys as un sub is silly, they talk you throuh the episodes so it will resonate, but i just decided it was not for me, law and order however were the best. the best part of criminal minds are the airplane shots, sailing thru the air. the acting is good for the most part"
50,"I'm a fan of police procedurals when they're done well. Criminal Minds is OK. It's average. The characters aren't compelling, the Scooby Doo monster- per-episode formula is dull, the dialogue isn't interesting and the acting is hammy. Also, the way they discuss the killers just feels like somebody who has read a few books on Dahmer etc. and keeps squeezing references in to appear legitimate. However, it's easy to watch, is probably a little step up from the god-awful C.S.I. Miami, and they structure the episodes well. I feel like the main disappointment is that it had the potential to be so much better. Morbid curiosity is what attracts us to these kind of shows, but it could have set itself apart from the rest of the forgettable police procedurals the US churns out. Instead it used the serial killer angle as a gimmick and shuffled comfortably alongside the 'rest of them'."
51,"I have managed to finish the first series since I have bought it. Some stories are quite good but unfortunately I find certain characters too stereotype and in fact boring. Dr. Spencer Reid should have some other characteristic to make the character more interesting. He should not be so boring and a little humble maybe. He even speaks in monotone with little facial expression. Penelope Garcia should make her character more interesting and less irritating too. If you have watched ""24"", you will know what I mean as the characters there are very interesting, often funny and likable. I read that Mandy and Paget will be leaving the series. Pity, as I do like them."
52,The start was amazing the first two seasons were brilliant. Up untill season 11 it was still super amazing but with all the cast change less and less point to watch. The stories also are less realistic and something might changed.
53,"I have probably seen every single episode at least twenty times if not more, and yet I still can't stop rewatching it. If that's not a testament to a good show idk what is."
54,"I started watching this show because I loved the performance of Mandy Patinkin in ""dead like me"" and also in ""the princess bride"" (a good few years earlier :)) and wanted to see more of him. After season 1, I got mixed feelings.The basic plot is awfully repetitive, the only suspense element being the survival of the last victim, or occasionally the perpetrator for a change. But that is not a big problem IMHO, it's just fiction and entertainment.The quotations from Nietzche, Ghandi or Lincoln while the CBU jet trades kerosene for honest citizen lives all over America are also pretty weak. Learning that the mahatma or a well known philosopher or a former US president said things like ""when it itches one has to scratch"" comes as a feeble conclusion for the usual batch of visual, psychological and moral violence the show consistently delivers. But well, OK, let's consider it an equivalent of Kojac's lollipops, plus a brave attempt on the educational side.What I really don't like is the way the 'heroes' handle the job. They do their best to understand the victims and criminals, but at the same time they show very little compassion to people who are supposedly suffering traumatic experiences or severe mental disorders. They deliver pretty rash sermons to wrongdoers and victims alike, and more than once relish in violent revenge as if they were some kind of impersonation of vengeful angels. The script often flirts with perversity there.I would say the show could be great with a little less pointless violence, more character development and above all a drastic cut in elderly-people aimed cheap sermons.Despites above average acting and very efficient direction, Criminal minds is just trying to please the average law abiding citizen too hard."
55,"I really tried to stay with this series. I like Mandy Patinkin. The rest of the cast was good. The computer expert is SO annoying. I fast forwarded the disc when she was on screen. The nerdy, genius role is so passé. The dorky shirts, greasy hair, skinny bodied...misanthrope. The characterizations are very poor. They did not seem so blatant upon initial viewing of the first few episodes but they crop up by the fifth episode and remain incredibly boorish. the criminologist who tries to role play what the offender did is badly done. The character is a stereotypical black man seemingly always on the make and women swooning in his presence. The stereotypical female with the great looks and body is a straight steal from any C.S.I. series. Do these women always dress that way??? Watching the inner workings of the teams minds(mostly Patinkins') is a cool gimmick I must admit but over used. I'd rather watch ""C.S.I.:N.Y.""., or reruns of ""Columbo""...you had me for awhile....but you lost me...a waste $35.00"
56,"These were usually interesting stories of the FBI's profiling group called the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unite) in which crimes ares solved by understanding what kind of person commits then. Most often, after figuring out who the killer is, the group goes in and captures him or her. The first 30 minutes of each show are basically cerebral while the last 10 minutes are action- oriented. Profiled and - hopefully - caught are serial killers, usually, there are also serial arsonists, rapists, etc.Co-heading the unit are veteran actor Mandy Patakin who plays the stone-faced, 50-ish ""Jason Gideon,"" and the younger ""Aaron Hotchner"" (Thomas Gibson). The latter is the most stable person in the unit and the only one married with a family. The rest - like most crime shows today - are single people and usually in their late 20s or 30s. I guess, technically Hotchner heads the unit, the it feels more like Gideon does. It's his narration that beings and ends each show.Completing the team, you have the young, nerd-looking ""Dr. Spencer Reid"" (Matthew GrayGruber) who seems to know everything about everything; the volatile ""Elle Greenaway"" (Lola Glaudini); the macho ""Derek Morgan"" (Shelmar Moore), group spokesperson ""J.J. Jareau (A.J. Cook) and he computer geek ""Penelope Garcia"" (Kristin Vangsness).Story-wise, the show has the usual Liberal bent of today's TV but doesn't go overboard with it in most cases. Many of the shows feature a very tense conclusion as someone is being saved at the last minute from some serial killer. Not that it matters, but after watching the complete first season on DVD, I liked ""Hotch"" the best and ""Garcia"" the least.I look forward to seeing the second season on DVD, as well. (I refuse to watch regular TV with all the commercials ruining the shows.)"
57,"This show has been done a million times before. This time they take the same old idea, but dumb it down even more!A couple things that made me really dislike the show. 1. It just seems so dumbed down and downright unintelligent. 2. The whole show seems to be based on stereotypes. 3. Further more to feed the stereotyping, everyone they ran into was accused of drug use in a most ridiculous way.I can't say much for this show, as I only saw one episode but from that one episode , I won't be viewing it again. Take this comment for what its worth, I encourage you to watch it and see for yourself."
58,"So this show is no longer about FBI CSI stuff but more about intriguing little spy stories about Prentiss or some heart-aching skits about each star's private history. By the way, this WAS my favorite show. Mandy Patinkin added so much depth to the show and almost seemed like 'the grown-up' in the room. I kind of thought 'Hotch' would assume that roll after Mandy mysteriously bailed. I guess he wasn't old enough or something – so the show brings in Joe Mantegna. Once I saw his name I just knew there was hope and the program would not skip a beat. It seemed the producers or directors were skillfully plugging a hole. Gideon was gone but there was a skilled veteran to replace him. Additionally, someone was there to corral the children and keep their over-grown egos from clashing. Was I ever wrong? I really thought a man of Mr. Mantegna's caliber and stature could have really moved the show forward. Apply some of that old commonsensical writing and some skilled directorial leadership – the show might have even been better. That is how much faith I had in how they might use Joe Mantegna. Silly wabbit – common sense is not for Hollywood. Talk about tossing a talented, skilled and – most of all – interesting actor under a bus. The powers-to-be relegate him to some subservient roll because he has been out-of-the-mix too long. It almost felt like they were saying, 'You are too old – so you are stupid.' What an insult to this man. And of course with this approach, we opened a couple of seasons that had nothing to do with good police work. Everyone needed their piece of the overacting pie! The show tried making a few 'super – cops' (puke – vomit!) sorry Greenberg &Hantz – I don't mean to insult you; we needed foreign spy intrigue (double agent vomit!) and of course we had to elevate criminals (hackers) to agents. We now have a senior agent (Joe Mantegna) whose character is painted as being too out of date and too old and – well – just too stupid. Well that is enough of my whining about Mr. Mantegna – I am over it. I just hope he finds something on the big screen – I enjoy his acting. It almost seems that the show lacks direction or has too many competing egos for center stage. Derek has chilled out some and is back to being a believable character – sometimes dealing with being a bit of a hot-head – but it is dealt with and not expected. We know Prentiss was killed and arose from the dead; JJ was fired and now she is un-fired and the hacker-and-criminal herself – 'Baby Girl' is now an agent. Sheesh – talk about the need for a huge, 'I Believe Button' installed on my forehead. The FBI is pretty straight-laced and very serious. Think! Would you want someone who jumps at the sight of her own shadow covering your back? What would you say? ""Shaky Gurl! Put down the perp!!!"". The only things Baby Girl has down well are being THE victim, whining and complaining. In all honesty, ever since they moved her on as a 'real' part of the team – she has improved – but remembering her from past episodes just makes her present on screen an annoyance. OK, time to erase the negativity. There are parts of a show's formula that should never be changed. The sad thing too much has been changed. I am happy to see that Reed has not become too un-quirky; Derek is beginning to return to the world or reality and Hotch is still a drab but interesting character (no distractions from the crime). In my book, there is not enough left of this show to salvage. I understand many still watch this show and enjoy it. I do not like change and that is probably my biggest gripe. The original cast (many are still there), I truly liked – but now. Well how it seems like, for the most part, have become camera hogs and scene steelers."
59,"With every prosecution, even a ""positively entertaining"" one, there must be a defense. In this case, a devil's advocate, or public defender for Frankenstien (the monster, not its creator) must step up. Finally we are admitting that monsters don't happen in a vacuum; that monsters are elicited almost invariably with a victim's beginning, one not of childhood abuse, but of torture. The show's writers advert to this showing scenes of the child being turned into a monster, but I notice the scenes are hazy and not very graphic like those which show what the ""unsub"" does later. No cigarette burns, whip marks, contusions, abrasions, stab wounds, etc. They only show the child being shamed, but looking healthy and clean, well fed. The scenes are hazy and fuzzy. Not all abused (Tortured) boys grow up to be monsters, the writers are careful to note. However, the forensic experts fail to advert to what makes the boy-child ""unsub"" different. Cruel torture of a male child by a female adult. Let's explore that, experts. Every coward who preys on the weak was once the weak being preyed on by a ""weaker-sex"" coward. Bottom line."
60,"I've been watching NCIS since it started and I absolutely love it. But once my girlfriend started watching this, all I can notice is how much they've taken from NCIS and how similar this show is to it. It's disappointing and unoriginal."
61,What used to be exciting to watch a long time ago is now too stale.Seem to lack substance in many characters and being here and there without enough development.It is getting too stressful watching the craps like Dr. Spencer Reid.
62,"I absolutely LOVED this show. But like everyone else, the ""Reid in the slammer"" line has GOT to go. Okay, Mr. Scratch (whoever he is) wants to take down the BAU. Got it. But seriously? They can't figure out what happened in Mexico and get Reid cleared? Or have him wake up from this horrific nightmare or whatever. Whatever they need to do they have to do it and get him the heck out of there. I don't like Soap Operas and this has turned into one. Get Reid the heck out of the slammer and get him back on the job!!!"
63,"I first heard about Criminal Minds when a friend recommended it to me, after she heard that I liked NCIS. Sitting and watching Criminal Minds made me think only one thing. I want those 45 minutes of my life back.That one episode I watched, was extremely similar to one of NCIS. The characters are also extremely similar. For example, you have the tough person, and then you have the nerdy skinny person.There is nothing more to say, accept that this movie was awful, and will probably be running strong BECAUSE OF NCIS, for as long as NCIS is still around. And IF NCIS happens to cancel, I guarantee that Criminal Minds will follow too.1 star out of 10, and nothing more. If not, it should be less. This type of junk is what you use as a napkin."
64,Every time this show is on TV I cringe. The writing sucks. The acting sucks. Nothing is believable. It's violent in a bad way. Everyone in the show looks bored. It's just a horrible TV procedural. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
65,This show has always tried to stay up to date but it's kind of turning into a freak show at this point. Kind of rote and formulaic but in a cringe way...
66,"Either way - watch the whole show. It's still good TV. Seasons 1-7 are incredibly good, with interesting cases and heartfelt character driven episodes. The problem came with actors having contract issues or getting kicked off the show entirely. The writing is still really solid but it gets too messy in the later seasons."
67,"This is so sad, the actors on this show deserve so much more! I dont know when they decided to turn what was a brilliantly written and acted series into a Low Budget High school drama written like a Seriously crappy lifetime show with a skewed slightly religious undertone.... it's just Blah now🤬😖"
68,"My biggest problem with this series was that every little detail of the cases were explained to us as though we were dumb idiots. I watched the entire first season on recommendation and the start of the second but then I gave up.It wasn't all bad - I enjoyed the young whizzkid's character and most of the time the lead character but I found too many of the other principal characters to be dead fish and completely uninteresting.The story lines were okay but I didn't need everything explaining, I like to work things out myself.It's not the worse series in the world and I'm sure it will be very popular, like bones, but in the end I don't want to be led like a dumb animal through a series (again like bones). I can find better things to do with my time."
69,"This used to be a great series, educational, amazing cameras hots, literally a great way to tell the stories.. untill Mandy Patinkin left and the gore and violence started to be equalled with ratings, from then on the whole thing went into decline and even my adoration of Matthew Gray Gubler couldn't save it for me. It started to become a sad little charade of what it once was.. that made it painful to watch, even though I did try several times, but the disappointment just grew each time. Do yourself a favour: bingewatch the first 3 seasons and leave the rest to the fans of gore and violence."
70,"This is some of the worst crime drama television, that has ever been produced. The script is terrible, the actors deliver their lines without feeling or even a shade of talent, and the plotlines are so full of clichés and predictable outcomes, that everything becomes laughable and ridiculous to watch. So much of this show is so cheesy and bad, i find it hard to believe the 8.something score, the show has aqquired. Don't waste your time on this piece of xxxx show."
71,"This show seems to have directly copied an earlier version called ""profiler"" from 2007 - also about a set of cops/profilers with an overly talented hacker turned analyst. Have a watch of the original - CM is pretty much an updated carbon copy. I used to find CM good (overall) to watch, it was creepy and at times even scared me. Although there were some plotholes and the storyline has pretty much always been the same - there's a killer, the BAU figures it out, arrives in time to save the latest victim. 
CM was originally not too misandrist (although many blamed it for being misogynistic, I guess because it wasn't overly misandrist..).
However especially in the current season, CM has become extremely SJW (the bad kind), and very misandrist.
Also after the departure of Hodge and Morgan, the characters personal storylines are very weak and boring. 
In previous seasons, all of the characters had very interesting personal storylines, incl JJ, Prentis and Reid.
As the series has progressed, the ways in which deductions are made becomes increasingly unbelievable and nonsensical, how each crime is solved seems to become the least important aspect in each episode.
This season has seen a switch from mostly female victims by male killers, to mostly male victims and/or female killers. I would praise this for showcasing the fact there are many violent females out there and many male victims, however it seems clear the show doesn't intend to highlight the latter, but to pander to the viewers crying misogyny over so many young pretty female victims in the beginning of the series.
It has also seemed to remove any (or most?) cases of rape, and even the word itself. Also I guess to pander to snowflakes.
The show has really gone down hill and the characters are no longer compelling to watch, sometimes they aren't even in an episode - with no explanation. 
An example of the blatant misandry and gynocentrism (seeing women are more important/worth more than men) on the show is the latest episode;
Prentis ""that's extremely viscous for a woman""
Alvez ""don't kid yourself, when American Indian natives couldn't get info from an enemy, they would hand them over to the women""
at first this seems good, Alvez is educating Prentis not to be sexist, that women are just as capable of viciousness and vileness as men (although you'd think she would already know that, working that job for so long and the influx of female perps in this season)However the misandry comes when Prentis looks impressed rather than disgusted and exclaims something along the lines of 'wow, I should frame that little tid bit and hang it in my office'. So its gross when men do it but empowering when women do it? OKC riminal minds..
Also, Rossi declares a guy a misogynist, later assaulting him and violently threatening him (to stop him from threatening/assaulting a woman) - and despite doing the same thing to someone as he's trying to stop that someone from doing to someone else - Rossi is still somehow the hero. It's fine if its done to a man, but not to a woman - seemingly criminal minds' position.
There are countless examples of the sexism within this show all through every episode. They are also extremely fond of spraying around the word 'misogynist' (constantly, in pretty much every single episode) to describe any male character on the show who does anything bad to a woman (although no women are ever referred to as misadrist for doing anything bad to a man), (the word misogynist actually means hatred of (all) women, someone who does something bad to someone of said gender doesn't necessarily hate that gender at all). The show loves to use this word out of context for effect in nearly every episode, I assume they think as their viewership is mostly female it will help their ratings.
This show is also fond of referring to male perps as ""insert bad adjective"" but won't describe female perps in the same negative way. The show has always done this, often comforting female serial killers. CM has and especially is now, a smorgasboard of double standards.Aside from the gender wars, CM is just not engaging nor exciting any longer, and the constant character departures and arrivals over the last couple of years has made things worse, not to mention the increasing laziness on behalf of the writers/directors. 
They could also do with not ramming the whole 'we love this team we are like family' down viewers throats constantly, I keep getting flashes to Dom in the Fast & Furious franchise!"
72,"Please, bring ""Thomas Gibson"" back. Criminal Minds is not worth watching. I only watch the old episodes over and over. I never get bored and I just love it. I tried watching the new episodes, but I'm just not feeling it. It's really boring. It doesn't have that ""ZEST"" that ""Thomas Gibson"" brought to the show. Please, make criminal minds great, wonderful and worth watching again. Bring back ""THOMAS Gibson."" There's no character out there that can play his part. Face facts people, he was made for that part. This vote is for ""Thomas Gibson""."
73,"Prior to the addition of Adam Rodriguez, this show was a 10 out of 10. Just like his horrible performance on CSI:Miami every word from this actor makes you hope this will be the episode they kill this annoying character off. Hopefully other shows stay far, far away from this actor."
74,"While this show had been good to me for many years, and would make a good show to marathon on Netflix, this show is simply trash police propaganda, as with all other shows such as this. I will never watch this show, or any show like this, again. While at one time it was good to me and good for me, it's plainly propaganda for the police and other hands of government that I want no part of. That negates anything else this show has to offer. This belongs in the trash and in the past, as do the rest of the shows like this. The amount of horrific and horrendous acts described and shown in this show for the sole sake of shock value is disgusting and makes this downright unwatchable to anyone with a sane mind."
75,"Used to love this show, then used to like it.....after 12 seasons (that's where I finally threw in the towel) I am sick and tired of the agenda. Apparently, the only place for white men in this show is as the evil serial killer the team is after. Women and minorities are hot on the trail of the latest evil white man and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.Every district office head, police chief, coroner or expert the team turns too is now either female or some minority. Every sick, mentally deranged killer has got to be a white male. The final straw was listening to season after season of quotes from great philosophers, generals or historic figures that have inspired humanity only to hear a quote from Michelle Obamas mouth about the evil of men - putting her up next to Ghandi, Lincoln and Sun Tzu as being on the same level.Simply disgusting."
76,"I was a big fan of Criminal Minds until I realised how utterly ridiculous the show has become! If I hear the word ""unsub"" one more time I will scream!! How many times during a show do we have to hear ""unsub""? Do they get royalties from subway? The profiles conjured up by these so called ""experts"" are beyond idiotic and if viewers can not recognize how ridiculous and wrong they are, then people are slow! But, the profiles can be forgiven if it wasn't for the dynamic of the team! Derek and Garcia carry on like teenagers calling each other ""lover boy"", ""baby cakes"", "" sexy girl"" while a grieving mother is standing within earshot! In what universe is it normal in a work place to call fellow employees sexy nick names while investigating murders? It creeps me out a lot and I cringe every-time I hear it! I could pick each character apart considering each if them has massive emotional and mental issues but it would bore me! One thing I must mention is Garcia's ability to go online and retrieve information from decades ago that wouldn't even be available online! Honestly, the majority of the stuff she comes up with from her ""search"" is insulting to the viewers! Yes, there are excellent hackers around but nobody can retrieve information or personal photos from 1960 that have never been downloaded! I would love to know if the American law enforcement organisation really has personal jets just waiting around! The storyline is often beyond realistic and I really wish shows didn't aim the storyline to is leptons who will believe anything!"
77,"The summary line isn't meant as a reflection of the show AS a disaster--on the contrary,I feel like this is a very intriguing concept of a show with very compelling and accomplished actors filling out the roles nicely--but rather my sense of the meat of each episode,which seems to be a week-after-week showcase of grisly,disturbing crime(i.e. you just can't look away no matter how much your senses tell you to).A group of elite profilers for the FBI,quartered in Quantico,Langley,Virginia,investigate various heinous serial crimes. EAch member of the unit uses their specific talents to pick apart the crimes,examine them,piece them back together and trace them in order to solve and (hopefully)stop further crimes. They are led by a veteran agent named Gideon(MAny PAtinkin,always fantastic),and are anchored by agents Hotchner(Thomas Gibson),Morgan(Shermar Moore),Dr.Reid(MAtthew Gray Gubler),Greenaway(Lola Glaudini),Prentiss(PAget Brewster)and GArcia(Kirsten Vaugness). EAch case over the(so far)two seasons of the show has some sort of effect that is both broadly impacting and(to varying degrees)personally impacting on each and/or all of the members of the team,thus much of the grist for this show's mill.I cannot truly profess a love for this show,but as mentioned earlier,I think that this show is cleverly crafted,well-read and almost irresistible once given a chance. However,a strong constitution and a willingness to explore the darker side of human nature will be required for viewing."
78,"""Are you okay?"" This is a question which the members of this show's FBI profiling team ask one another whenever one of them, after having undergone a particularly grueling ordeal, is looking glum and pensive. The glum one then responds with a slice of psychiatrist's-couch confession, or an ""I just wish..."" speech, to be answered with an apposite piece of wisdom on the order of ""You did your job, nobody can ask more of you than that."" The function of these brief interludes is to demonstrate that the characters have human feelings, which are not otherwise very apparent. With a single exception--the obligatory kooky tech girl--they're characters out of Dick Tracy, or a Dick Tracy anime, and not for a second confusable with real people. The Dick Traciest of all, who is more or less the central character, also reminds one of Norman Bates in a suit, and for a while I believed he was the continuing unsub (the show's word for ""suspect""), only none of his colleagues suspected it. After watching several more episodes I realized at last he was the show's idea of an arch-good guy.When I used to hit on this show while flipping channels, I couldn't quite make it out. The protagonists seemed to be some kind of covert police force or enemy spy cell, and they seemed to be always sitting around tables or inside planes discussing criminal psychology. Only after I got to watching the series in re-runs did I gradually tumble to what it was about. An off network had begun recycling it in perpetuity, back to back with two shows I did understand, Ghost Whisperer and Without a Trace, and like them, Criminal Minds wears well in re-runs: the episodes can be watched repeatedly and still retain much of their effect. So the show is enjoyable to an extent. However, it also generally unimaginative, with stiff, slightly florid playing after the Canadian TV manner; and compared to its British counterpart Touching Evil, or to the Hannibal Lecter movies that spawned this dubious genre, it is dramatically crippled by a structure that almost never allows the villain of the week a big scene in which he confronts his trackers and expresses himself. Typically the heroes race to save the latest victim, burst in in the nick of time, and shoot the villain dead; we don't even get to see him suffer a lingering, painful end; our desire for revenge and our curiosity about him remain alike unsatisfied. Since I don't like stories of kidnappings, stalkings, home invasions, or random shootings, which comprise almost the whole catalog of serial killers' methods, it may be I'm not the best judge of this show. But I don't think it's just my personal taste that finds the best episodes to be those in which serial killings figure only incidentally. Four episodes in particular have impressed me, two suspense and two pure horror. The horror shows--one about a homeless woman locked in an abandoned meat-packing plant and forced through a horror maze that leads to the slaughterhouse, and the other about young women abducted, frozen with paralytic drugs, painted like dolls, having doll hair sewn into their scalps, and seated around a tea table to join a lunatic's collection of life-sized dolls--were two of the creepiest things I've seen on TV, and if I'd seen them as a child would probably have haunted me for life. The two suspense shows were sharply conceived and staged: one was confined to a shopping mall where a little girl was hidden somewhere but the team didn't know where, why, or by whom, and the other, the best of all, in which a killer had targeted the kooky tech girl for an intriguing reason, rose to a taut, superbly staged climax that brought the killer into the team's office and laid it on a hacker, subbing for the kooky tech girl, to alert her via PC without also alerting the killer. This sequence raised the show far above the level of the everyday, or every-week, torture-murders, and made me wish it could have dispensed with the serial killer business altogether.P.S. I didn't know where to put this note, and so I saved it for last: In one episode one of the regulars says ""theirselfs"" for ""themselves."" Why would the show's makers not have overdubbed this? Are they okay?"
79,"Really pretty bad and unrealistic . For instance a typical episode ,little girl kidnapped , who do you call in to take the lead ? The behaviorial unit , yeah right !! NOT !!! Fast forward to the end , the unit zeros in on the location , unit members racing and searching until , oh what could possibly happen ? They find the child , but , there's no pulse !!! The tension rises from zero to .05 !!! The members do cpr as the crying parents are brought on site , that happens all the time after all !!! C'mon Becky or Susie !!!! Cough , cough , oh thank god !!!As corny music plays in the background , the badder then bad guilty party is led off to jail !! Yes the unit has done it again !! If you'd rather not stick your finger down your throat and need to purge , this will do the job for sure , pure garbage !!!"
80,"Just awful, I don't recommend, don't waste your time, just one word can describe and the word is awful, pure garbage."
81,"This is one of the best programmes there has ever been. Never missed an episode since it started. Cast changes make no difference to the quality, although it's sad to see them go. Here's hoping we never lose Penelope or Reid. I realise it will not go on forever, but I certainly hope it is around for a long time. I also loved Criminal Minds: Suspect Behaviour and Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders. Was so upset when they where cancelled."
82,"I used to watch ""Huff"" on cable and fast-forward through all the scenes with the wife, played by Paget Brewster, because I found her so unappealing and such a very bad actress. In my opinion she ruined the show.Now Brewster has appeared on an episode of ""Criminal Minds"", and it looks like they will be bringing her on to replace Lola Glaudini. I guess I will no longer watch one of my favorite crime shows.Another Kim Delaney, an actress who is so out of Andy Patinkin and Thomas Gibsons' league it defies belief is about to destroy yet another crime drama. Delany ruined ""NYPD Blue"" and tried to ruin ""CSI Miami"". Brewster seems to be getting her shot at ruining ""Criminal Minds"" and I will not suffer one more nanosecond of her.Aloha ""Criminal Minds"" - call me when the gal with the enormous eyes who overacts more than Nic Cage has left the building."
83,"Seems like I watch an episode of CM every night. I do watch an episode of CM every night. Why? Because it's just enough to keep me TV-sedated, without getting to much emotional stir on having to interact on an emotional level. The show is just pretty plain. The only character who vokes some response in the imagination-lobe is Penelope, the FBI profiler teams hacker. The rest is a straight line from some initial build up of serial killing (often of women who would easily fit the term ""milf"") to a middle section of profiling and searching, up to the point where Penelope narrows the suspects down to a few and then straight on to the perp as Dr Reed, who looks absolutely d duck with that gun on his hip, has figured out which one of the suspects to go for.As a bedtime lullaby for the wanting to be sedated this set up is just fine. Weaker than valium, stronger than biggest loser. But it's main point is that is tells us to turn off and get a life."
84,"I'm a big fan of detective/forensic type dramas and this is definitely one of the best. I get a little bit annoyed with shows like CSI which can be really predictable, which is why I enjoy watching this show because it isn't so predictable. Often the killer is someone I completely haven't guessed, which makes it a good watch.I also agree that it does seem like Hotch is the only one who has a life - I admire the writers trying to keep the focus of the show on the actual crimes and killers, but I think that by introducing us to more of the characters personal lives and backgrounds, it helps the audience relate more to them and thus empathise with them when they get in dangerous situations.But apart from this, Criminal Minds is an excellent show, and I definitely recommend it to people who are looking for another detective type show that's a bit less predictable."
85,This is like one of the worst shows of all time.Most of the time it looks more like a bad parody of the crime gengre.Dont waste your time with this thrash go watch true detective instead.
86,"Love the show. Well-rounded characters and intriguing story lines. The only things that bothered me were how many of the SSA's were traumatized(statistically improbable as Dr. Spencer Reid would say) & the fact that they have a jet but no night vision goggles in their budget that would have been crucial in their night missions. But, overall, love the show."
87,"I have watched Criminal Minds from the beginning but I am not enjoying it so much this season. I do not like the character Prentice coming back and being in charge, she was fine as part of the team but unbelievable as the person in charge. If Beyond Borders ever gets cancelled I would like to see Gary Sinise take on the role instead. Also I hate the story line of Reid being in prison as it is unbelievable and out of character for the programme. It is hard enough with two major characters leaving (Morgan and Hotchner)but having Reid out of the team as well I feel the whole show has gone flat especially as one has been replaced by a boring character, Stephen Walker. There seems to be no chemistry between the characters within the team like it once had. I hope the show is not cancelled but just returns to how it used to be."
88,"I've tired a bit of the ""CSI"" shows...except for NCIS...and like this show because it deals less with ""dna"" and other so called ""forensic"" evidence...and more with that greatest of all mysteries...the ""mind."" Da Vinci's Inquest is another great ""crime"" show from Canada. Check it out! Now, it seems that my comments are too brief for the management of this site. So I reassert my previous assertion that the television program CRIMINAL MINDS on the CBS television network is a Great Show...Of course Great is a highly subjective term. In light of this, I suggest that you watch the show and judge it for yourself. Did I mention Da Vinci's Inquest? Many Thanks & Take Care!"
89,"I remember watching a few episodes of criminal minds about 10 years ago, I thought it was great. But when i saw an episode the other week, This show is lame I cant believe it's been on for as long as it has, The FBI BUA unit, really Sounds like it stands for Big Unusual Assholes I love movies like Seven and series like True Detective This is the most pathetic attempt to recreate a series from movies like Silence Of The Lambs and other FBI pro filer movies, A dime a dozen these days. I'm sorry to say it's a big thumbs down for me 4/10 And that's being generous"
90,"It once started out as a very good crime/police show with likable characters with integrity analyzing crimes. It was successful, and it looks like the success drove the writers/producers mad, so they thought they could turn this crime show into a vehicle to transport their own personal moral views. Now it's an unbearable BS brimming with the imagined moral superiority of people who seem to have no moral at all. Beside being discriminating in the casting (obviously no white actors are allowed as new lead cast members anymore) and constant baby advertising (in a world with too much people and children in need in every country), it's all a big search for people who fit as and are being built up as mega villains so the creators, the characters and the viewers can hate them. In episode 11-5 the wonderful, talented artist Morpheus/Ellen is not being saved and killed, because she had not stopped an accident(!!) that her baby had while she was painting – ergo: villain, ergo: deserves to/must die. In the next episode however, the villain, a teenage boy, is being shot without mercy allegedly to save the hostage by all means. He is being lied to to get his attention and then without trying to talk to him/talk him out of it, Dr. Tara, whose behind must be painted pink from all the lipstick because Garcia, the most moral character so far, is kissing it incessantly, just shoots him. If a white cop had shot a black teenager like this, the Afro-American community would have rioted and they would have been right to do so except that it does not matter which color the shooter has or which color the victim (yes, victim) has, because this shot was NOT justified, the Criminal minds creators just sell it to us as justified, because their morally questionable message is: he is a villain (and a white one even,) so he can be shot, no questions asked. In the Mr. Scratch episode before Hotchner mercilessly calls a traumatized manipulated victim murderer twice and Rossi calls the suicide of another manipulated victim a fortunate thing. Etc. Etc. Many of the (serial) killers/villains are European, since this way the villains are a) white and b) not American fellow citizens. I welcome if shows embrace the moral responsibility they have in showing different ethnicities/sexual tendencies/genders/nationalities/ on both sides of the good and bad continuum. But this is not moral, not responsible, not about equality or justice, this is the complete opposite, this is a little arrogant, ignorant, power hungry, narcissistic group imposing their moral values"" on the world, this is brain washing political BS, hypocritical, wrong, one-sided, depraved, and has no place in a TV show (about investigating crimes). It actually turns the show into the/ a real crime. No matter one cast member after the next is quitting. No wonder Thomas Gibson went against the producers (I would have expected more to). This is how conceit and arrogance and ignorance can destroy a once good concept. Don't buy it (uncritically)!"
91,"there is a lot to criticize. it is very simplified. BAU team are used to catching killer in a few days, they have a luck permanently. overestimate profile. in real world it is not possible to have so big success with a profile. actors performances are mediocre. many times they catch killer just second earlier than killer would kill someone. its like chuck Texas ranger movies. they could use some reality.Criminal Minds is an American police procedural television program that premiered September 22, 2005, on CBS. The series follows a team of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. The BAU is part of the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime.[2] The show differs from many procedural dramas by focusing on profiling the criminal, rather than the crime itself. The show is produced by The Mark Gordon Company in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television then CBS Paramount Network Television) and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television). CBS announced in October 2009 that Legacy Interactive will develop a video game based on the show. The game will require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries. The interactive puzzle game was released in 2012, but did not feature any of the voices of the show's cast. Nor were the cast involved with the project.[3][4] [5] On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Criminal Minds for an eighth season,[6] which premiered on September 26, 2012"
92,"First off, I don't LIKE 'cop shows' like 'CSI', or 'Law and Order'. They are too 'preachy', all robotic characters, CSI is weirdly violent with the close-ups of flesh wounds, etc., and exactly the same every week.I started watching Criminal Minds repeats on A&E late night. I soon found myself watching 3 episodes in a row. It's also on ION TV as well. They usually show epi's that aired in order, so i can follow the ongoing personal sub-plots much better. CM is NOT always the same formula. They do not always even go after serial killers, or it's often of very different types. They do not always 'get their man'. When they do, it's often by very different ways, by a contribution by a different 'team member', or sometimes by dumb luck.Most shows stories seem taken from actual killers and/or recent events (and horror movies, like 'Saw'), so it stays topical. CM DOES add personal stories and on-going plot-lines of their 'team'. Each major character is very different and has their strengths and weaknesses...they show both all the time. Each episode focuses one one of them the most. For a 'cop show', there is a lot of heart and humor that come from the teams' genuine caring for each other.I like that they use 'brain power' to solve crimes, not fictitious lab work. Sure, Penny Garcia could not realistically find things as fast as she does on her computer...but that adds in some of the fun and humor of the show...and speeds up the story. I disagree to another review's here that say they demean the local cops. They often go out of their way to stress to each other NOT to do that, and get 'dressed down' if they did.I learned to tell which season is which. IMO, S2 is my favorite, with the odd exit of Lola Glaudini's (extremely sexy) character early in the season, then adding of Paget Brewster's new character (almost an exact copy of Lola, but not as interesting), then Mandy P's slow breakdown, then exit in S3. Spencer's (the young genius) role and acting gets much better in this season as well.The original cast is the best, but the production values get better every season. I can tell a S1 episode by it's cheaper looking blueish film quality and sets (and how short Spencer's hair is). I've noticed that Thomas Gibson has become more and more the 'star' of the show after Mandy left. He gets to show more emotion, more personal stories (like getting demoted, getting a divorce), and even get to do some 'butt kickin'."
93,"This used to be a great show, with great characters and story lines. It has more or less followed the trajectory of L&O SVU. The main characters slowly left, they ran out of original storylines and the writing and new casting was taken over by SJW types. Case in point, most stories now have a political agenda like using a different acronym for ACLU starting with an A so there is no misunderstanding and having them attacked by a right wing extremist white supremacist group. Yeah, no political agenda there. And the cast now has no chemistry and is just a mix of token representations of an Asian, an African American, women, wussy men etc. There is no manly men on this show anymore. There are no characters you care about or storylines of any interest. You just get ripped from the headline hit pieces and liberal talking points promoting illegal immigration, knocking traditional values etc. This is officinally no longer on the DVR to record. Not even accidentally funny, just a cautionary tale on what happens when a show goes on too long and is hijacked with PC BS."
94,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows of all time, seriously it is pretty amazing, but they are really starting to screw up season 8. And there are rumors about money issues for season 9 with characters not returning? Come on CBS. One of your biggest mistakes was losing Paget Brewster as Emily Prentiss due to the same issues. I do not like her replacement (a pretty popular opinion from what i've seen) and to lose the others too? I really miss Prentiss and don't want to lose Garcia or JJ either. Prentiss didn't even make a good exit either, just kind of left... Up until season 8 the show was a solid 10. Very nice, but stupid mistakes over money and contracts. Come on CBS."
95,"This used to be great series. These days, terribly boring. Poor script, over acting. The new characters are boring. I don't even remember their names. Penelope Garcia has been made an annoying freak. Why are you trying to remake the chemistry of Derek Morgan/Penelope Garcia to Garcia and this CSI geek? The new ""beyond borders"" agent talks only about his children. Why did this series have to be ruined? The last 5 seasons have been so forced. Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore were too big losses for the series. Good thing this ended, though 5 seasons too late. And in the end all the agents are smart like Reed. JJ is even a sharpshooter (she was an FBI liaison)"
96,"Very boring bringing all old stuff; Team is weak, and subjects go all around with Spence, Criminals are always more clever and better equipped with their smart heads to play well with FBI"
97,"She's insufferable. I'd rather take an ice pick to the forehead than watch one more scene with that character in it.The occasional quirkinesses would be ok, but it's a constant brain screwing that I can no longer stand.It's soooooooo obvious the other actors are struggling to play off her stupidity. Her bouncy comic relief does not work.Unfortunately I looked ahead and she doesn't get killed off, so thank goodness for the ability to jump through her scenes.Plus......she solves all the cases, the others just stand around waiting to be fed information and addresses....they give these elaborate profiles to local law enforcement, but always catch the bad guys themselves, so why bother?...SWAT is useless."
98,It was a good show until season 12 where Thomas Gibson is no longer there and when Shemae Moore choose to leave I should have stopped watching bcz then it was as interesting as Days of our life's Kirsten Vangsness is making it a para comedy if it should have been a believable version of something that COULD HAVE BEEN true well that is too late and I am so sorry I have waisted my time bcz it is like the first 11 seasons is ruined by watching season 12-13 ..
99,"Just started this season - so far focusing too much on the violence. Good actors and plot, but the writers are enjoying the violence too much."
100,"After binge watching NCIS, and loving it, I moved on to Criminal Minds, hoping for the same satisfaction. Unfortunately, the plots are formulaic and predictable, with usually the same conclusion at the end. The team (the serious leader, the hunky black dude, the cute mother, the brainy boyish guy (who I swear is gay, and if not, should be), the retired agent/writer that decides he wants back in, and a rotating mature female) is notified of a serial killer (how many serial killers ARE there?) and take their always available jet to the location ('Wheels up in 30.') Does the team carry around a suitcase for these cases? They are usually greeted by law personnel who grudgingly accept their help ('We're here to assist with your investigation .') They immediately profile the 'unsub' and describe them to a 'T', incredible since most of the time there are few clues. The token wacky and slightly unattractive member stays at the office where she can search online for anything and everything in a matter of seconds ('What do you have for me, baby girl?') The victims all beg for their lives ('You don't want to do this.', 'I promise I won't tell anyone.'). Occasionally one of the team members tries pseudo hypnotism on witnesses and always comes away with some clues to help solve the case ('Close your eyes and think back to that night...') And the victim's relatives vent their anger at the team ('Why are you standing here talking? You should be out there looking!') Of course the team magically figures out who the culprit is and where they are located ('You'll want to see this.', 'You two take the house, we'll take the workplace.') Nine times out of ten, the killer surrenders after one of the team members tricks the killer into letting the victim go by being sympathetic ('I understand your pain and anger.') And with a fitting quote from some famous person, narrated by a team member, they fly back home, ready for the next serial killer to strike."
101,"I have been watching Crime-Thriller seasons ,movies since I was a Kid so I have watched plenty. This thing does not come even close to whats out there. First of All the cast is far away from minutely looking like that they work for the freaking FBI. I have gone through the 1st season and in every episode they just jump to a conclusion all of a sudden, and Boom! the killer has been caught.
The most important thing in a Crime-Thriller series is the drive that pulls you to watch the next episode, this series totally lacks it. They are catching serial killers like they are some bunch of salmons and you just gotta through your net out and bunch of them will come through. If you take a tennis ball, throw it in the air for like 10 feet,and by the time you catch that ball these guys would have caught at least a Dozen serial killers.Disappointed!"
102,"Why does no one seem to notice that in every episode of this show since the very first one Penelope Garcia violates people's CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, along with countless federal, state and local laws? The whole team would be in prison with her by this time and they'd have swarms of serial killers, disorganized/organized regular killers, torturers of all grisly varieties and just plain crazy psychopaths walking out of wherever they have been stored because all the cases would be considered fruit of the poisoned tree(look it up, it's a real legal term). Even the back story of how she got the job (getting caught as the queen hacker of the world or some nonsense like that) is unrealistic at best. She'd be in Federal Prison!Matthew Gray Gubler is very nice to look at though. I hope he doesn't leave, because I'd have no reason to watch this show anymore! I do love this show though, even though they represented Baltimore, MD so poorly!"
103,"It's one of the few series which are predominantly intelligent, It's one of the few series that is mostly intelligent, not always, but the usual diarrhoea principle clearly doesn't apply here. The fact that directors and writers are not necessarily the most intelligent is also true here. The pilot is the worst I know. What I don't know otherwise is a series that gets better and better over time."
104,"I've watched NCIS, CSI and SVU and this is by far my favorite. So much so I've rewatched it for a second time. For me it's the actors. They just become your best friends. Witty , compassionate, funny. My favorite are Spencer and Garcia. Watch it you won't be disappointed."
105,"The only reason I'm giving Criminal minds a 9/10 is because of the ending, and the last 2 seasons. It went from being the best criminal show on tv to just a great show. But with that said I have to say that this is one of the best shows I've ever seen. I've seen it 3 times, and every episode is so well thought through. Just great and interesting. The only show I can think of where the investigation focuses on the mind of the killer/perpetrator."
106,"My favorite show is ""The Office,"" but I started watching Criminal Minds far before that. I have always loved CM, even with all the duddy actors once in a while. Sure, some episodes were too repetitive/the usual, but most were insightful and fantastic. This is my absolute favorite crime show. I watched SVU for years before this, and this still beats it. The acting is superb, the character/actor chemistry is phenomenal, and the whole series is just great. Of course Reid is my favorite, as 99% of people believe as well, but JJ and Hotch have great stories as well. Prentiss has a great story, too. All the other actors (characters) are amazing, as well! This show is so binge worthy."
107,"Used to like the show but it's been going down fast,and the episode they all said the tagline ""Wheels up"" was the jumping of the shark and enough to convince me!"
108,"Talking heads. Am I the only one who is approaching boredom from talking heads? It seems that one-half of the dialog for this show consists of the characters spouting quotations from forensic textbooks. Barely making eye-contact, each chips in data that everyone else on the team must surely know by rote. The camera merely shifts, hops around, from mouth to mouth as the audience sits enthralled by the technical arcana. CSI seems to have begun this trend, though its use has diminished in the Bruckheimer family of crime busters.This is an odd show, even as American crime dramas go. Severe, unsmiling Thomas Gibson leads this merry team. His acting range seems to hover between grim and sturdily determined. Mandy Patinkin's come a long way from his glory days on Broadway. Fatherly, somewhat reclusive, a more accessible profiler for the 21st. Shemar Moore provides - what? Another gun? Matthew Gubler brings the required geekoid element of genius, youth and lots of hair. Think Eric Millegan's Zack on Bones (Fox). You've cast these things before, so you know what to expect. Kirsten Vangsness is blatantly an attempt to rival Pauley Perrette's Abby in NCIS (CBS).Are we so dependent on familiarity of character and device today? We seem to be treated, as an audience, as merely cattle. Easily hooked, easily entertained. Oh, I admit that I watch this show too often. There's a dearth of alternatives on the few channels I receive. But this doesn't stop me from giving it 5 stars out of 10."
109,"Is this great series about to end? The latest episode has almost everyone being shipped off or retired. The new ""boss"" is awful. This show used to be one of my favorites, but after this last episode, if something doesn't change so all the characters get to stay together, I'll probably stop watching."
110,"I don't know why they killed so many people. Have they ever heard of shooting someone in arm, legs and not in hearth or head? And then they say like oh we could not save him. Yes you could just shoot him in arm or any part of the body where he will not die. Every Episode has the same plot twist. They will teach you that every criminal is doing killings because of his sexual release. yea right... If you are dumb civilian you will probably like this show because you never used your brain for any kind of critical thinking.They never show how killings are done, they just cut the scene and boom he is dead. I mean is this show for kids? Like Pegy16?Sometimes they say like killers are highly intelligent but no they are not, they are really nothing special, every team can find them."
111,"This is about FBI profilers from Quantico who are called in by the local authorities to use their knowledge of psychology and using the evidence at the crime scene to put together a profile of the person they think is guilty and using the profile to find the guilty party.I am surprised it has taken till now to base a series on FBI profilers as when I have been watching real crime stories, the amount of times the local police have turned to the FBI and especially the Behavioural Analysis Unit are too many too count.I think this programme is much needed as the rest of the crime based programmes because this time, it is about people who have to go into the disturbing and scary minds of serial killers and this has never been addressed that there are real agents dealing with the filth on the streets and the ways they have learnt to get past what they have seen. The characters in the show are not superheros and that is what I like about the show, we see how hard it is for them, using their skills, the crime scene and evidence to understand that person in a way so they can catch him and then they have to try to get all that person's thoughts out of their head and they find it hard to switch off from what they see.A bonus to the show is the fact it doesn't stay in one location, the criminal activity can take them all over the United States, so we get to see the difference of how the communities handle the crimes and the aftermath in the city or small environments.This is yet another show that has you gripped to your seat. Another good twist is that when the audience think they have figured out who is the guilty party, the show takes another surprise turn and the audience has to start again and try and think who else could be responsible. It is a thinking show and I find myself drawn into it, trying to figure out who has done it. It isn't predictable and I like that.The show has interesting characters, brilliant actors, writers that keep audiences entertained and keep them on their toes and it is just so absorbing to watch, I get totally lost in the programme."
112,"Why Criminal Minds is my favourite crime show on TV: 1. the investigators seem to have empathy, it's obvious that they are passionate about what they do. Even though they deal with horrific things all the time it still 'gets' to them. The investigators know that the victims are real people. 2. Occasionally more 'personal' elements get woven in to the plot & we find out more about each of the investigators. For instance, a lot happens with Spencer - in one episode we find out about a childhood trauma that he has repressed/forgotten that involves his father, and in another episode he gets kidnapped by a 'nerdy' guy who he has quite a lot in common with. The investigators in Criminal Minds are interesting three-dimensional characters who are portrayed with a lot of humanity. Bones is the only other crime show on TV that I sometimes watch - in some ways it is similar to criminal minds (eg. the investigators get personally involved in the plot, for instance in one episode Bones finds out about her parents). Other crime shows on TV are very boring & don't give the victims much respect. CSI and SVU spend too much time looking coldly at disfigured bodies, and too little time developing the human side of the show or the investigators. The investigators rarely seem moved by anything, and the victims are rarely shown as fully human before they are murdered. If they're going to have a person get murdered, they should at least show that person some respect before killing them off by taking care to portray them with compassion, and as fully human. Crime shows are a dodgy genre because they feed off of our desire to see the darkest parts of human experience. Crime programs that don't ask the viewer to really care about the victim before killing the victim off are simply uncomfortably voyeuristic & sadistic/dark."
113,"I absolutely love this show - I've always been into things like psychology and criminology and finally - a show that incorporates both with a fantastic cast! The plot lines are amazing and the characters relationships are brilliant. Dr Reid is one of the best characters I've seen for a while, he's just an infinite bank of random knowledge - and we always get a laugh from some of the things he says - like in the episode where he volunteered to go onto the train to help Elle and the other hostages - they've prepped him and he says ""Do me a favour - can at least one of you look like you're going to see me again?"" I also love Garcia - think she's hilarious! The second series isn't airing here yet (they're re-running series one) so I'm counting the days! Fantastic series - has completely outrun CSI in my books!"
114,"I have always been a huge fan of Shemar Moore's abs. Ever since he was on a soap opera!! But funny what a few years will do to a girl. I've always liked the smart guy, but gone out with guys like Shemar. And imagine, I'm still single.... Now days I am so crazy giddy over Reid! Every time he is on I am totally listening to what he says, because it's funny! He' so smart he's almost socially retarded, but for some reason I find myself thinking, ""I've got to get me one of those."" None of my friends agree. I need some support here. Anyone else??? Beyond this, this is an amazing show. I didn't start watching it right at the beginning, so I am looking forward to the repeats until mid-January."
115,"As a new viewer of ""Criminal Minds"", I wonder where I was when this excellent series began last year! I started watching about a month ago, and am totally hooked. This is finally something to view other than gruesome dissecting of bodies while trying to down a hamburger during dinner hour. ""Criminal Minds"" challenges the mind, which a senior citizen like myself needs in high doses. It offers entertainment from a superb cast. How nice to see Thomas Gibson in a role that seems to better meet his talents. I would like to see more forcefulness from Hotch as the show continues. More blend of each character's strong profiling ability, along with just enough ""personal life"" added to spice their roles should be a winning formula for a hopefully long-running, exciting series.As for the great writing, plots, action, dialog, cast (all of them)...the series will be difficult to surpass. My order is already in for the First Season DVD."
116,"Criminal Minds is by no means an original idea. The story could be applicable to any number of cop dramas and at times even drifts into an ER/Chicago Hope type melodrama (ex. when Thomas Gibson and Mathew Gray Gubler are held hostage in the EMERGENCY ROOM.). However it has received a lot of critical praise and took some awards this year I believe. What makes this show is the acting. Mandy Patinkin could probably carry the show on his own, he's an incredible actor and I've been a huge fan since I saw him in his role as Che. Thomas Gibson has almost redeemed himself as Greg from the nauseating TV comedy Darma and Greg, but at times I still just want to yank him through the television screen and slap the hell out of him for screwing up good scenes with Patinkin and Gubler. Mathew Gray Gubler, the only new face for me from the bunch, has simply bowled me over in his interesting take on a Las Vegas child prodigy. He get's beaten up by Gibson's character pretty badly in one episode and when he tries to apologize Gubler says, ""I was a 12 year-old child prodigy in a Las Vegas public school; you kick like a girl Hotch."" I though it was hilarious, maybe just me. The only other stand out actor is Shemar Moore, which you remember from a bunch of the worst crap you've ever seen. Moore has never been presented a role that didn't require him to stretch this little and thusly he seems to shine but that's only because you just keep waiting from some Day's Of Our Lives dribble to spill from his lips. A.J. Cook and Kirsten Vangsness playing Garcia (YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND KIRSTEN'S NAME! LONG LIVE GARCIA, MASTER OF UNFETTERED OMNIPOTENCE!) are both good scenery, though it looks like Vangsness is going to taking on a much larger role in the second season, she even get's her name in the opening credits where it belongs. As for the cinematography on this one, they pitifully attempt to use CGI, it really is that bad. Some of the shots from the first two episodes where neat, but you see them in every subsequent episode, it's pretty standard hackny-television production values and shots. The plots are fairly engaging but some times un-original and predictable. All in all I would give the show five out of ten stars, not bad but not great. However the characters in this show have really pulled me in and I love some of these actors. I would have to give the show an eight out of ten just because the acting is so good on Patinkin and Gubler's parts. It's rare you see there caliber of acting on television. We'll see you for SEASON 2 SO STAY TUNED!"
117,"I happened upon this show out of curiosity as I had that channel on while awaiting CSI NY, and I must say, it blew me away! Another comment had been made about the darkness about this show, and I have to agree- yes, the unsubs are dark and the crimes ghastly but that is just how some of these criminals are hard wired. I like all the characters, Rossi is great, but I loved Gideon. After watching this on A&E on Friday nights I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to be one of the BAU's relatives- they would be able to read write through you and get in your head, so it would be hard to hide anything from them,lol. I was hooked on the CSI franchise for awhile, but after a while the way they air those things you pretty much know the script as well as the actors. Even if I have seen these as reruns, the psychology of the unsubs makes you feel like when they look into the villains its like looking into that dark room that always made one wary to enter as a child. I recently watched some older episodes online and in spite of seeing them in the past, I was still looking at the story unfold like' that **** is dark and spooky. I highly recommend it to anyone who not only likes a good who done it but the 'why' as well. It can hold its own with any movie I have watched as of late.( spoilers ahead) For instance, catch the episodes about Frank and it will show you a look into how bent the criminal minds can be as well as just what in their past can set them off. Great show! i give it a 10!"
118,"Really a great ensemble show with character and heart as the seven leads show also that they are not one-dimensional characters.They have come and gone like Mandy Pantakin, Paget Brewster, and Lola Glaudini and have them replaced with Jeanne Tripplehorn but still the show's characters really are great in the ensemble.Think when Joe Mantegna come on in, the show began to have an ensemble feel. Like Pantakin a lot but really love Mantegna after getting used to him after a long while.The show focuses on the serial killers most of all, and worst of the worst. As the BAU the Behavior Analaysis Unit of the FBI comes in and the local authorities call them in. With the BAU helping and teaching them what the cities they go in, can expect.As really it is a nice surprise to see them working together and no jurisdiction turf wars as that is very rare for a show like CM.As they are forced to find the Unsubs as they called them before they strike again. It also shows them as humans with emotions. Not buttoned up people like Hollywood does with the feds or arrogant. And shows their family lives as well.Great show, great writing, and great acting!"
119,"I discovered this show after a long while, at the end of season 4, there was something so compelling on the cases, that I HAD to watch from the first season, And not only Mandy Patinkin, there's something, maybe that the show is not about utterly complicated love lives among the characters, is not cheapened with gratuitous sex scenes or nudity, not even as much Gore as they could use, but there's something about this ""heroes"" that feels just right.This show has characters written and developed in so many layers that you notice flaws and scars, and the interaction among them is so realistic that it could be the same interaction among the actors just reflected in the acting, translated in how comfortable the group looks with each other and how you see the grief in them when one of the group leaves.The cases are weird, twisted and leave a bitter taste in your mouth at the end, there's no happy ending every time, they shows us victims, make us like them and then kill them, and the audience has to suffer the loss, not a bad thing, because they actually make you understand what kind of monsters normal/regular humans can be. Even this season (6th) being the weakest has moments of brilliancy, they exploit not only the always intriguing serial killers, but use the most common fears, those threats that we all live with.I thought it'll be another CSI/NCIS/Without a trace show, but is different, the acting even if not recognized with at least award nominations is excellent, the writing is worthy of your time, and the quotes they use at the beginning and the end of every episode gives you a little extra that some shows are trying to copy. I like this show very much, and I enjoy it as much as I enjoy other shows Like X-Files."
120,"Criminal Minds is one of those addicting shows on TV right now. More fun to watch it on DVD with absolutely no interruptions from commercials. Out of all the crime beat shows we have – CSI, NCIS, L&O, etc. this one is my favorite. The acting is superb and convincing. I like the portrayal of a team of profilers that catches the bad guys. For problem solving at that level, you need a team of expertise. I've watched the series from the beginning and at times I do miss the characters Gideon and Elle but their replacements Rossi and Prentiss do a fine job with the group chemistry dynamic.I give much credit to the writers of the show to venture into such dark matters of human nature and how sick people can be. Even with this main topic that weaves throughout the series, there's a careful character pacing with each of the profilers that is believable, something which does not entirely translate as well on the other TV shows mentioned. I appreciate how the show stays relevant to real time, like with episode ""the internet is forever."" Social media network with an evil purpose was never more fascinating and engaging. The episode had excellent twists. I also appreciate the famous quotes on each episode. I look forward to the upcoming season and the conclusion to last season's finale.I highly recommend this TV series."
121,"I love series like this, and Criminal Minds is just so interesting and absorbing. It is very dark and somewhat grim often, but I like that side, it does make the show compelling. I will admit it was a show that started off good, but then got better and better. I love how it is filmed as well, the camera work is innovative, and the locations are always lovely and evocative to watch. The music is very fitting, the main theme is chilling to an extent and the music choices in each episode are appropriate and effective a vast majority of the time. The writing is always intelligent, witty and thought-provoking and the episode ideas are brilliant with moments that are chilling and moving. And of course the characters are wonderful, especially stone-faced Jason Gideon, Spencer and Hotch(as well as Rossi and Prentiss), and they are brought to life brilliantly by a sterling cast, both lead and supporting. Overall, I just love this show, it is true that some episodes are better than others(then again it is like that with most shows), whenever it is on I always watch it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
122,"Absolutely brilliant, best show on TV, I couldn't sing its praises more, characters are excellent, so are the actors, absolutely brilliant to watch the characters and plots come together & unfold.Criminal Minds is like mini psychological thriller movies, that holds & demands your undivided attention, absolutely love it and hang out to watch it each week. If that wasn't enough I now own the first three seasons on DVD the only TV series I own and that's saying a lot!! The dynamic between the cast is excellent, the actors are brilliant absolutely love them all and hope they stay on for many more seasons. Although I must admit I loved and miss Gideon & Mandy Patinkin, so wish he would come back to the show. Rossi is great but miss Gideon!If you love action & thrillers then this is the show for you, keeps you guessing  10/10 - Excellent! Excellent! Excellent"
123,"This is my favorite show. Criminal Minds is one of the most intelligent shows on TV today. Like Profiler (1996-2000) and Un-Sub (1989) before it, Criminal Minds takes the psychology to a higher level than other crime dramas. I love the fact that the agents don't strut or posturize or act superior toward the local police. In most crime dramas, there are always conflicts between the local cops and FBI. In this show, they cooperate.As sexy as Derek Morgan is, I prefer the un-macho, brainy types. So you can probably guess who my favorite character is. If you don't know, it's Reid.The whole chemistry of the cast is great. Without a Trace is a good show, but can be a little stiff. NCIS has great chemistry, too. The Closer is my second favorite show, but it's very close. I don't watch any of the CSI shows."
124,"I've been a fan of Shemar Moore since I was a little girl watching him on Young and the Restless. He was my first celeb crush, so when I heard that he was going to be back on television, I was excited and knew I had to watch it. Plus, the idea of going in the mind of a psycho and figuring out what he does and why was an intriguing show idea. So, I made my husband watch it with me, and we both love it! I love how each show has a quote at the beginning/end of the show. Plus, this show never ceases to amaze me. It frightens me sometimes, because this is real life. The characters are amazing, although I was quite sad to see the character of Gideon go... he is missed!! I've even gotten my co-workers watching it, and they are hooked!! Great show!! I love it! I hope this show is on for a long run!"
125,I will say just 2 things. I love the show and I have a terrible crush on Reid and I am 60 years old. He sure wakes up something that has been asleep for a while.I feel like a cradle robber. OK I will say more. I don't get the people who say that this show is like CSI or any of those other crime shows that are on now. It is so totally different. It makes me feel different. I am trying to think of a way to explain the difference in Criminal Minds and other crime shows. I guess that it is more serious not so much about the characters lives. I mean there is some insight into their lives but not getting into a mushy relationship with someone or like that. It is great and they should just leave it alone.Just don't lose Reid!
126,"The writing is superb. The acting is amazing and the cast is top notch. Although I must admit the story line at the moment with the character of Dr. Spencer Reed (My favorite)is very depressing. I hate the story lines of drug use because they are just so over used and go far to long as story arcs. They drag literally and figuratively. But back to the point give the show a chance it will be well worth you time. It's rare when you find a show with so many good characters. There are some weak links but they only seem that way because the others are just so phenomenal. The comedy of the show is executed by the delightful Penelope Garsea the team's residing tech. The afore mentioned Dr. Spencer Reed is the coolest geek out there. It was startling at first to see Thomas Gibbson of Dharma & Greg to be playing a cold indifferent Aaron ""Hotch"" Hotchner but he's still very likable. I especially enjoy the character of Derick Morgan. Portrayed by Shemare Moore (The Young and the Restles). I'm so glad to see he made it to a show that's just as exceptional as he is. (Not putting down the soap but I'm a guy and we don't watch soaps...often.) Jason Giddian is the head of this little team and he's often enjoyable to watch, I just don't watch it for him. But still good acting. The other two characters are of a different sorts. They are the women and they are the eye candy. I just wish they would beef up their parts and give them a little more depth than they do but still I'm not complaining. J.J. is the person who deals with the media...mostly they've started to give her more to do. And the newest addition to the team. Emily, the raven haired beauty she hasn't been on much but there is definite potential. Over all just watch the show you won't regret it. Promise."
127,"I hate to admit that I binge-watched this show from Season 1 until Season 17. I reviewed a few of the worst episodes, and believe me, there were many! I want to put down my thoughts on the stories and cast before I wipe them from my memory, hopefully forever. 
 First the cast of characters. 
 Mandy Patinkin (Jason Gideon) One of the better characters on the series, I think he finally jumped ship when he realized what a stinker the show was becoming.
 Joe Mantegna (David Rossi) Always reminded me of a washed up Mafia don. He was forever playing second fiddle...always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
 Thomas Gibson ('Hotch') He had no personality and was stiff and cold. Perhaps that was how the producers and writers wanted the character played. When he left, I really didn't care.
 Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) She was the female version of Hotch, no personality and very stand-offish. Again, when she was killed off, I didn't care, but then 'voila', she came back from the dead.
 Shemar Moore (Derek Morgan) So full of himself, his ego was larger than his muscles.
 Kirsten Vangsness (Penelope Garcia). For whatever reason, she really got on my nerves, and she got worse as the show progressed. Did she live in front of her computer? She was always there, no matter what time it was. Perhaps that's why she could pull up any insignificant piece of information, no matter if it was decades old. And who really believes that the FBI would allow one of its members to dress like something from a carnival sideshow?
 Matthew Gray Gubler (Dr. Spencer Reid) And speaking of dressing professionally, did Doctor Reid even know what a comb and shampoo were? This was my favorite character when the show first began, but as the stories progressed into soap opera territory (his prison stay in particular), I cared less and less for him. I think the writers missed the boat by not delving into his sexuality (speaking of soap operas). He would have been the perfect gay character.
 A. J. Cook ('JJ') She could have been such an important part of the series, but mainly she was just window dressing. As a side note, every time her character's husband (William LaMontagne Jr.) was on, I was reminded of KD Lang...LOL
 Jayne Atkinson (Erin Strauss). This was one of the better castings of the series, and the writers did a great job of making her the boss you loved to hate, and then going 180 degrees and making the viewers sympathetic to her character.
 The rest of the cast seemed to be in a revolving door, coming and going, some of the actors were A-list but didn't stay long (Esai Morales, Jennifer Love Hewitt come to mind). I will say that Aisha Tyler (Dr. Taylor Lewis) was subjected to unwarranted criticism by one reviewer in particular. I think she did a fine job with the character she was given.
 I won't go into the plots that were borderline laughable as there were so many. But there were so many overused lines, I feel I must point some of them out. 
""You need to see this."" ""Watcha got for me, baby girl?"" ""Wheels up in thirty."" ""You don't want to do this."" ""Are you OK?"" ""I promise I won't tell."" ""The unsub is devolving, his crimes are escalating.""
 In closing, I am astounded that this series has lasted as long as it has and that so many people describe it as one of the best shows ever made. It is just bad escapism with plots repeated over and over again."
128,"This show is amazing, it has the best graphics any show I have ever watched! It always keeps me on my toes and wanting, no scratch that, needing more! Derek Morgan is hot as ever and makes me wish guys talked to me like he does Penelope Garcia. Dr. Spencer Reid never seems to bore me with his length of knowledge at a very young age. JJ is beautiful and has the most adorable kid ever. Kate Callahan is mind blowing with her knowledge in the undercover part of the FBI. Aaron Hotchner is a hard-ass as ever with keeping the gang in order and I like being able to see how he is with his kid,Jack. Penelope is gorgeous ans shows that you can be blonde and have brains and do amazing things in life!I miss Emily Prentiss the most because of the banter between Derek and her.David Rossi is a bad-ass and has a every soothing voice to listen too. This team of Agents makes what they do seem easy but its not. In Shemar Moore word's : Kicking some bad guys butts!"
129,I love criminal minds I love the mystery and suspense involved in it. I love the fact that it's a unique cop show that brings something different to display how criminals are caught and how the mind of the criminal explains the motive for killing. I love the acting and the actors/ actresses its and amazing and outstanding show that I hope can continue with its profound success and hopefully to make it to see at least 16 seasons I would love to see that. Its my second favorite cop show after CSI:NY but it definitely has proved to be able to compete with others and its truly the best current cop show on television in my opinion. Nothing gets better than Criminal minds because its so different that's what makes it so great and the story lines and plots are just astonishing i hope that criminal minds continues
130,"I've watched NCIS, NCIS LA, NCIS New Orleans, Chicago PD, Flashpoint, Stalker, CSI and many other cop shows, but Criminal Minds is definitely unique. Just the ""profiling"" is so interesting that it has me hooked on the series to this day. From 2005 to now, it's been 10 years and no other show can beat Criminal Minds. I really miss Paget being part of the cast as her character, Prentiss, was one loved by all. When they took her off, Criminal Minds did change as she played a vital role in the show. But, I'm glad they chose to keep the character alive, allowing Prentiss to return any day. Criminal Minds has everything. From the tech nerd Garcia to the genius Reid to Rossi who's been married more than five times. If you watch just one episode, you'll be begging for more. That's the reaction only the best shows have and the best of them all is for sure, Criminal Minds."
131,"This show is very similar to CSI but it is a bit more interesting and it really makes you wonder about what some criminals think and how they act. It is also very exciting and suspenseful! It has great acting, well developed characters and a great storyline. The best part about this show is when they put the profiles of the criminals together. One of the main characters will begin to give a speech on how the ""unsub"" (unknown subject)thinks and how he or she usually acts. They can tell if the unsub is social or not, what kind of job they have, why they commit the crime, and many other things. It is a very original show and is extremely exciting and suspenseful. If you want a new show to start watching and you like these kind of shows, you will love criminal minds."
132,"I'm not a good reviewer and my English isn't good enough to write a decent review but i'm going to make an exception for this show. I am though a hardcore TV fan, i've watched a lot of TV shows and movies in my lifetime so i might be worth listening to.Why am i making an exception? I hate cop shows. Cop shows to me are all the same and usually don't bring anything new to the table. Criminal Minds does however bring a great forensic psychology. Criminal Minds revolves around FBI's behavior analysis unit who specialize in examining criminal minds to find the bad guy. The show does well of keeping you questioning who the bad guy is and once you find out who he is all you want to know is why did he/she do this? And the show usually has a good psychological explanation as to why this happened. You get a peak into twisted criminal minds, get to know their story and the events that occurred that led to their crimes. The main characters of the show are of course important and for a cop show i would rate the character development above average. Its not masterful but enough to fit the show. If you're like me and don't like typical cop shows then i would suggest checking out Criminal Minds, as it was to me better then expected."
133,"This show was made for us. It isn't full of pathetic drama or anything like that it's just real drama with really cool twists. Criminal Minds is dedicated to making this a realistic programme, they actually research what they put on the screen!! The director/producer also focuses on the backgrounds of the characters, but not so much that you get confused with what is actually happening in the real story. The actors on Criminal Minds are very believable Matthew Gray-Gubler, Shemar Moore, AJ Cook, Mandy Pantikin, Thomas Gibson, Paget Brewster, Kirsten Vangsness and Joe Mantegna are all awesome actors/actresses.We love Criminal Minds! The End."
134,"In the wake of all the recent spin-offs of cop shows such as CSI and Law and Order, I was apprehensive when first tuning in to Criminal Minds. I expected another detective show full of gruesome murders and images of bloody corpses that leave nothing to the imagination and whose only device seems to be to completely gross out viewers. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not one such show. Criminal Minds is clever; the plots never fail to intrigue, and those clever writer keep you guessing to the very end. It's always interesting to see what tricks the profilers use to get inside the mind of the perpetrator, and the ways in which they gain the trust of the perp in order to get a conviction. The characters are interesting, extremely intelligent, witty, complex, and very good at what they do. ""Criminal Minds"" will pull you in from the very start and keep you drawn in and on the edge of your seat until the very end. A great watch, I highly recommend it."
135,"I don't know why Criminal Minds director try to show Christianity in poor light. There is lot of falsehood about what shown in this program about Christianity. That is not true. I think freedom in this Country allows one to so anything as other religion in other countries does not allow anyone such freedom. Say anything wrong and see next day. Since Christianity is build on love and forgiveness, they don't look to give it back. I hope one day Criminal Minds mind will change."
136,"Why did good actors change in a successful series !!! Why risk failure !! It started out as a good series and ended up duplicating itself, and it just didn't rise as it should, so it ultimately failed."
137,I absolutely don't recommend it. Unbearable and repetitive.
138,"This show was fantastic right up until it lost the most critical person leading the team (Thomas Gibson aka Aaron Hotchner). Once he left, the writing and the cohesiveness of the team has gone down hill. To make it worse, they brought back Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) to lead the team. She is the worst actor I have seen in a leading role of a major TV series in a long time. She has the same expression for everything that is happening around her. This was most evident in the recent episode. If this show wanted to go for another season, the best thing it could do to help that would be to get rid of Paget Brewster and try some new writers."
139,"First three seasons maybe 4/10 . Second rate acting at best . Shemar Moore is even worse - just painfully bad . A.J. Cook ? Someone must've owned somebody a great favor ...
Just another bland variation on other similar , but much better shows ..."
140,"I randomly started watching this show literally for two reasons: 1. many of my friends watched it and 2. I enjoy the occasional crime drama. What I learned is not to give into hype. I'm almost done with season 1, and I don't think it's worth my time anymore, what with so many better shows out here.I thought uncovering the crimes would be interesting, but there's an entirely different crime and setting from episode to episode, and there's no overarching plot line to keep me invested in the show. The dots connected at the end of each episode by the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit sometimes feel pulled out of their a**es and only impress me half the time.What another reviewer said about how the characters are cliche is on-the-dot, yet there's something still enjoyable about the way they interact, and I genuinely like Dr. Reed. I'm also giving the show the benefit of the doubt, because it started in 2005, so it isn't wholly fair for me to compare to other things I've consumed up until today (end of 2019). I'm also giving this a few extra stars, because the first several episodes were pretty interesting. I was reminded of Quantico, and I was trying to figure out the explanations for the crimes alongside the characters."
141,"Really takes your mind off things and is absolute amazing, very consistent and unpredictable!"
142,The most recent season and the newest cast group are such hot garbage. The show isn't cerebral anymore. It's a soap opera. Make it go away
143,No more problem solving just bs drama and scratch. New cast isn't good either.
144,"Good show to watch to fill in those crime/mystery cravings but Criminal Minds would not be on my top ten favorite crime show list. The plot is alright, fascinating enough to keep you entertained but not great enough to be memorable. The acting is overly serious, there's really no characteristics to the different roles. I feel like I was watching a team of characters that all share the same overly serious attitude, cliched dialogue and semi-dull personalities. I much prefer watching Castle, Psych, Without a Trace and Law & Order SVU.Crime shows aren't just about the solving the case anymore, it's more the character that drives the show. Getting invested in the characters instead of just the crime solving.Overly 6 out of 10."
145,"I absolutely love this programme I have watched every episode and will continue to do so.. The storyline are very well laid out with one thing happening with one member of the team and something else happening elsewhere...If I could have a career choice at my age, becoming a profile would have to be at top..."
146,"Hello there! This TV Show is enticing and challenging like a puzzle in each episode. With time passing by the characters of the Criminal Minds are becoming more solid and better. As a boss, Aaron Hotchner, acts like an old-fashioned supervisor but he is fair and caring with his own people. Sometimes I cannot follow when Dr. Spencer Reid speaks but I know there are people like him. For my point of view, Jennifer Jareau and David Rossi can be added I little more substances on their personages. JJ can be more active in the field and David Rossi more involve in solves the cases since he is one of the people that came up in the idea of BAU. I love the friendship between Penelope Garcia and Derek Morgan. For me, what makes the TV Show worth to watch is the team work. Unfortunately, in the real world we don't see that often. I always like the newcomers but I miss Emily Prentiss character. I am looking for to see what comes next."
147,"Definitely an intriguing show that'll entertain most people. It focuses on a group of people that have a rare skill, which is understanding the most wicked men that walk among us. More specifically, the BAU team works to figure out how certain criminals think in order to stop them and save lives. Watching this group take down evil individuals by predicting what they'll do based on their upbringing and psychology is entertaining enough by itself, but we also get to see the relationships between the team members and each other as well as their friends and family, which allows us viewers to connect with them as people. This dichotomy is what made the show endlessly entertaining for me, and I'd expect most others would feel the same way.The show, of course, has some flaws to it, as with most shows that go on for this many years. Mandy Patinkin leaving the show upset me, as Jason Gideon was the best character IMO. It also can't be denied that the overall quality dips gradually in the neighborhood of seasons 9 and 10. The writing seems lazy occasionally at this point and the individual plots just don't entertain as much as seasons 1-8. I also noticed a distinct repetitiveness in the writing in seasons 9-12. Morgan and Hotch leaving the BAU in the later seasons dramatically changes the team dynamic for the worse. The new characters that make their way into the BAU become very likeable but don't compare to the strong leadership of Hotch and the charisma of Morgan.When it comes to the successes of Criminal Minds, I have many praises to give. I found the music and visuals to be excellent on a consistent basis. The individual members of the BAU are all charming in their own ways, and each offers a unique story and perspective to the team. Nearly all main characters have many outstanding acting moments and the writing is outstanding at many points. While the overall quality dropped around season 9-10, I thought it did rise again around the end of season 12. The best episodes will have you on the edge of your seat and hoping with all your might that the team can pull off the necessary rescue or stop the antagonist's plans. That is, after all, what a drama should do, which is why I hold this show in such high esteem."
148,"Love it, but the flying etc. Is weird, in 5min from one city to another is very weird haha.
Another point is Reid, a bit too much for me (even though I understand it).
Otherwise, good series though."
149,"This show has certainly had some great episodes, and some seriously forgettable episodes. I did not watch this show when it first came out, I'm watching full seasons years later and I'm currently in season 12. I get that this is the season we lost Thomas Gibson unexpectedly. His presence is missed, as is Shemar Moore's. I'm not sure I agree with the decision to make Emily Prentiss Hitch's replacement. JJ would have made more sense. By all rights this series should have ended by now, or perhaps at the end of this season at the latest. The addition of Damon Gupta has been a total waste of time. He's a horrible actor...he has one tone...that's it. And Spencer in jail and the decisions he's made to get there and along the way are maddening. This guy IS a genius, right? I'm almost to the point of fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes of each show to see how it all gets wrapped up."
150,"Absolutely superb series that progressively was dumbed down by way of explanations in the script and also the introduction of Adam Rodriguez and Daniel Henney (who both can't act for toffee). The earlier series are classics: well scripted, acted, shot and thought through - a must for anyone with a slightly inquisitive and macabre mind - go on treat yourself to a bit of darkness."
151,"It's a great series, love the stories etc. But there's one big problem. The lack of a big storyline...
I believe if it was rated R and with a bigger, more believable it would've been great.
I know it's not trying to be like true detective but yeah, at least 2-5part stories or so would do a lot in my opinion..."
152,Each one is different and some times the serial killers are in multiple episodes
153,"After the dramatic 13th season when some police social climber in the FBI had decided to take over the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) and get rid of all the confirmed members, this 14th season is back to normal: one case per episode, though one case in the 12th episode is not solved since the killer is still running free, food for the next 15th season I guess.The cases are simple all the time and the solutions are always a lot of data and information thanks to Penelope, and a lot of profiling thanks to all the others. But that sounds a little bit humdrum and it is. The only suspense we have is the details of the cases, the grossness and gruesomeness of the cases, and the creative way out of a mess designed on purpose for an elegant and brilliant solution to come up in a moment.The concept that this unit of FBI profiling work is a family is both banal and probably true. But true in an unwarranted and unforeseeable way. It is a family because it is the only circle of people who know what horrible monsters they are fighting against and what horrible things they are obliged to perform to win, and they are not allowed to lose. So the colleagues are the confidents and the siblings everyone of them needs to have in their professional life and in their everyday life, for life in general not to become a nightmare because a few people know exactly what they have done and are ready, all the time ready, to listen and provide solace, comfort, confidence and support.But after many seasons I must say there is little to discover that has not been seen and experienced already. This series needs some real new blood to become something new because it is getting old and old age always means decrepitude. The other solution is to get a beautiful last episode in next season for the story to come to an end.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
154,"Every series has their ""blah"" episodes, but Criminal Minds stayed extremely amazing throughout all the changes. When Thomas Gibson (Hotch) left, it sucked. But they picked up, and did well. Rossi was a great addition after Gideon decided to leave, and ended up being one of my favorite characters. JJ's growth in the show is undeniably inspiring. Reid is just jaw dropping gorgeous, brilliant, and hilarious. Emily Prentiss is probably the best addition to the show. When she left those few times, the show dropped in quality. She ended up making the show what it is. Penelope was the light in darkness, and fantastic at playing it. Aisha Tyler (Lewis) was a GREAT addition. She became one of my favorites very quickly. So smart, beautiful, strong and fit in well. Luke and Matt were always great, but felt a little rushed in their character growth stories. This show is genuinely fantastic. Unlike most criminal focused shows, it adds depth, love, and happiness. The episodes aren't always great (as any show), but they did so well making 90% of the entire series absolutely amazing. I used to think SVU was the best, but changed my mind quickly when I started Criminal Minds. I've seen the whole series several times, especially the first 9 seasons, and will forever credit this as my favorite series."
155,"I absolutely ""like"" Criminal Minds. Now I love CSI -- and the difference is in smoothness of both the characters and the stories. The one thing JB did for CSI was to not give us too much information about the characters in the beginning. We got to know them over the years like we get to know ""real"" people. You would never meet a person and have their psychological history spilled out before you, but you would find out about them slowly. It took several seasons to learn about Grissom's hearing problem and his mother's deafness. We found out as a matter of course and not because we were told.I love Mandy Patinkin (just the fact that he is brave enough to still feel OK about being called Mandy says a lot about him). And I wish the show the best -- I will watch every episode and hope to find out more about these characters over time and via their actions and not by being told everything about them from the other characters."
156,"This is one of the best shows on television and here's why: Profiling: Profiling serial killers and other psychopathic criminals is an absolutely fascinating science and every episode is like an entertaining 101 in criminal psychology.Writers: The writers on Criminal Minds are the champions of scripting realistic story lines that (unlike many other shows on television)does not always have happy endings. What makes Criminal Minds so good is that rather than making the characters emotionally superhuman we get a real take on how a job like theirs really affects the human psyche and how normal people go on doing a job like that.The viewer also gets more up and personal with the killer because unlike, say, NCIS, we get to know the killer more intimately because of the profile. Which is a very interesting aspect to the show.The cast/characters: Hotch, Rossi, Reid, Morgan, JJ, Prentis and Penelope Garcia form the perfect unit and without one of them the show wouldn't be the same, as shown by the outcry from fans all over the world when both AJ Cook (JJ) and Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) were forced to leave the show during the shows sixth season.In closing I would just like to urge anyone who hasn't already checked out Criminal Minds to do so. Just make sure that you don't have plans for the rest of the week because you will be transfixed, go out and buy all seasons on DVD and forget that there's a world outside of your living room. Consider yourself warned..."
157,"I can honestly guarantee that criminal minds is like no other show on t.v. It's not a cheesy series of cops, it's intense and what makes it special is that every episode is different, you can watch any episode from any season (even if you have never seen it before) and you can still follow the story easily! You might think that's a bit stupid but it's really not, it makes it more intriguing as you don't no what to expect in the next episode.Derek Morgan, Dr. Spencer Reid, Aaron Hotchner, Penelope Garcia, Jennifer Jareau, Jason Gideon and Elle Greenaway are all simple yet sophisticated characters, there apart of the BAU team for the FBI, there profilers who lurk the ""UNSUB"" judging by the behaviour of the criminal at the scene of crime. What's so different about criminal minds is that the show never ever goes into dept about the characters, there is no real personal story for any of them (so far that is!) but that saves all the drama which is stored into the creative writers behind the scenes who keep coming up with different crimes, murders etc every episode! Criminal minds is almost flawless, the writers deserve a huge round of applause. The show is so believable. Imagine every type of murder you can think of, or better yet every type of criminal you can think of... Done? Criminal Minds is basically all type of criminals, all different murders put into 6 seasons.The intensity is immense throughout the whole episode! It's always a journey and it's so interesting to step into the mind of a criminal, even for 40 minutes! Once you watch the show, you will most probably say, who would of known there were so many ways someone could get murdered. It's like a treasure hunt, expect the treasure is the killer.What more could you ask for? It's full of twists, wittiness, great drama, kick ass FBI action, intense confrontation, mind bobbling, creativeness and awesomeness! The only fault i can see happening in the future (maybe!) is since every episode is different (so far!) they must run out of ideas soon, but fingers crossed that they won't.All in all you can enjoy this at any time, with or without a person. It's intense and different, you won't see another show like this, i promise you. It's like your actually there at times and after a couple of episodes you will actually start believing its real. Looking for something fresh, interesting, thrilling and different every episode, then this is the show for you! Be warned it might leave you paranoid!"
158,"Not only is the script well thought of and well written, but the actors pull it off tremendously too! Usually i find an annoying character, but in criminal minds they are all fantastic. The programme keeps me watching and I'm so in-patient to see the next one the following week. Thing about criminal minds is that the suspense and mystery is different from other dramas like it and i love it how it finishes and starts a different investigation each episode. The physcological in-depth of the programme is great, it gives me a great in sight of analysing people, and its a programme of its kind as i haven't seen another programme like it. Without a doubt Criminal Minds is one of the best programmes around at the moment, and I just can't wait for my Friday nights to watch it!"
159,"Criminal Minds is by far THE BEST TV SHOW.Criminal minds is one of those realistic as it gets Criminal Chasing TV show's. Whenever you watch Dr Reed and the team put a profile together.. its breath taking. This is one of those show's you just don't want to stop watching. I overall recommend this to anyone that enjoys watching criminal chasing TV shows with TOP OF THE CLASS so to speak characters. They are all extremely professional. Unlike these other TV shows with wanna be THUGS. 10/10 rating. 10 star.Mathew Gubler and Thomas Gibson put on the best performance, every episode Over and over.. This is one of those show's that never disappoints. Gibson is the ultimate team leader, this guy could never get replaced, and Mathew Gubler i would have to admit is one of my top TV show actors out, his performance in Criminal Minds.. is Superb. Without these two characters.. Well let's just say I know MANY people that would not watch the show."
160,"What makes criminal minds special is that every main character has an own, well developed personality. Nothing is more boring then to watch some guys who solve crimes but obviously don't have anything else they exist for, so when the case is solved they just disappear until the next one comes up. Of course, the main part of every episode of criminal minds is dedicated to the crime or rather the criminal the BAU has to work on this time, but there is often time for interaction between the team members or insight in someones mind. This series doesn't forget to show some of the emotional effects this kind of work no doubt has. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any episode of season 4 yet (Germany is always 1 year behind) and I didn't like a few things about season 3, but that doesn't change that this is the only crime drama of which I don't miss a single episode."
161,"This i have to say is the most addicting movie/series i have ever watched.2nd's would have to be Reba(series) and cheaper by the dozen 2(movie). I Think it is a great series and after watching one i have watched everyone since. It is just an amazing series. I think everyone should watch it it caters for a lot of different people. It was excellent amazing i really cant think of any words that are good enough to say. I just finished watching so yeah.... This is on, Thursday's in New Zealand on channel one 8.30-8.30. Thats the only country i know so yeah. And this is a different subject, but i think the rule that the comment has to be 10 lines is rather stupid because otherwise people have to ramble on like i am. so i am going to summarize i think that the series Criminal minds is really cool and that everyone should at least try it. DarkFlame"
162,"This show is about the members of a particular FBI team, the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit), which is dedicated to track down and find authors of serial crimes, be they kidnapping, murder, massacre, poisoning, arson or others, using the (not 100% exact) science of Psychological Profiling.The team members are quite different; Aaron 'Hotch' Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), a married father of one; Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), a well-known authority in the world of Profilers; Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), specialized in obsessive crimes, who somehow manages to maintain his happy-go-lucky nature; Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), specialized in Sex Crimes, who's tough as nails, Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), a child prodigy, kind of impaired socially, Jennifer 'JJ' Jarreau (A.J. Cook), the Unit's press liaison, who is one smart gal, and Penelope Garcia (Kristen Vangness), the Unit's computer expert, who also is a bright spot in the dark world they often have to visit.'Criminal Minds' is probably the first show to have the figure of the profiler as main character since NBC's CSI inspirator 'Profiler' and FOX's 'MillenniuM', which though treated the profiling as some sort of supernatural gift (Profiler only did this from season 3 onwards, though).This time, though, it's all very realistic, including the stress and the burnout of the job; the scripts are really thought out and well written, the actors do a very good job, and everything else comes together to create one of the most engaging series on TV now.Criminal Minds: 9/10."
163,"Criminal Minds is the best show ever. I was hooked from the very first time it was advertised on TV. Then after watching the first show I knew this would be my all time favorite show. Im a big fan of the show years ago ""The Profiler"" I loved Sam and the team but I must say that Criminal Minds is even better. I love the whole team everyone has their own style of what they do and how they do it. Every show just has me on the edge of my seat and waitng till the next show. I just cant say enough good things about this show and the members on it. I sure hope that it stays on for a very long time. I love it!!!! Please keep this show going on and on."
164,"First of all, to address those individuals who called this show cliché, I like it because it different from the cliché procedural shows on TV. CSI is all good and dandy, but I grew tired of it after only two seasons. The gore got to me, and I found the plots and sets too pristine. Life does not always resolve itself in cut and dry fashion, and sometimes crimes cannot be solved with science, given the absolute lack of physical evidence. Criminal Minds looks at the psychology behind the crime, and not all of the cases covered are murders. I like the quotes given during the show because they allow for post-show contemplation and investigation. I started reading Neitsche and books on psychology because of the show.The actors are superb! Thomas Gibson is 100% believable as Hotch, but I guess since I've never seen Darma and Greg, I don't have to adjust my perception of him. Mandy Patinkin, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Shemar Moore are just awesome (It doesn't hurt that Shemar is so easy on the eyes.), and Kristen Vangsness adds the right amount of comic relief. So far, I like the Paget Brewster as Emily Prentiss. She is quirky, her arrival was mysterious, and already I have questions about her background (why is she so good at 'compartmentalizing'?) I also like how the story is evolving, with episodes focusing more on the characters. Profiler, Profiled gave us background on Derek Morgan; his expertise on obsessional crimes stems from his own childhood encounter with a child molester. The two part Big Game/Revelations focused in on Spencer Reid. And then there was the implosion of Elle Greenway in the episode Aftermath, where we learn that her father was a cop that died in the line of duty. Some episodes have been less than stellar though, so that's what kept me from giving a perfect score. Take for example, Riding the Lightning. I had to force myself to watch that episode all the way through. It was leaning a little too close to soap opera drama to me.Anyway, check out the show, and if this show just doesn't do it for you, check out my other recommendations: Numb3rs, Law and Order(original--though SVU is okay), and Bones."
165,"My mom & I just love this show. It's quite fascinating when you think about the severity of the crime investigated as well as the aspects of the mind of the ""unsub"" that make them commit the crime in the first place. Some of the reviews I've seen for this show say that it's sort of like CSI. I would have to disagree on account that, yes, both shows deal with crime, but CSI only goes into the crime scene and evidence (which is interesting in and of itself), while Criminal Minds focuses on the suspect and the reasons (some of which are kind of sickening to think about) behind their actions. Besides all that, all the characters are superb, especially Gideon, Hotch, Garcia, Morgan, & Reid (the last two are my mom's and my favorite characters). There are some episodes in this show that require a good stomach, as well as a open & sound mind . . . so be prepared!"
166,"WOW, This summer I moved from Fort Leonard Wood Missouri to Fort Lewis Washington and this show became my Obsession. Being in the Military I hardly ever watch T.V.but during the move and taking leave I did. I watch every episode in the space of 3 weeks by using DVR and DVD. What prompted me to write this review is this weeks episode. I cried at the end. I'm a single mom and it had me thinking about what if I were to put myself in that mothers shoes. WOW, it was moving. In the end when she came back and thanked the team for believing in her was rare. Sometimes Thank you isn't enough in this world, and that true. I always walk away learning something from your show. Whether its not leaving the Middle door to the Garage unlocked or so many more. Well, I look forward to the next episode. Thanks for a great show. I use to be an active Law and Order SVU fan but your show took over by far."
167,"Watched 4 episodes (will not a 5th). Terrible acting, e.g. black actor playing Derek is just awful..., cringey preachy quotes blabla once said blabla, poor screenwriting,... Incredible 14 seasons. If compared with other series like 24, at best mediocre."
168,"The addition of this character and story line have taken this show as my favorite to, I'm not sure I want to continue viewing. 
This is worse than the Spencer in prison saga. You're going downhill fast!!"
169,"I've read through a lot of the reviews and its amazing regarding comments on ""affirmative action"" attempt with the show. I've watched since episode 1. The show has gone down because of affirmative action... REALLY!? When there were 6 white actors and 1 black there wasn't an issue. Now with 3 non-whites and 4 whites it's all about hiring ""affirmative action"" actors. What is happening to people? It's always about race. People can't look at another person without it always being about that. Now let me say I'm a African American female so let's put that to rest. I'm not ignorant to the issues in our society but why can't we not like a person because they're a jerk or butt hole and not because they're black or white? Okay I'm off my soapbox. Now to the show...Completely disappointed in the show. Sometimes change to a shows actors is an adjustment. I gave it a chance after Shemar then again after Hotchner. I don't have a problem with Prentiss because I've always liked her role but would like her to be a little stronger. The writing is horrible. Putting Reid in prison is completely crazy. Someone mentioned they didn't like his character but you have to realize that all law enforcement persons aren't tough you have to have the analytical type that can look at issues from all angles. So his character is needed. But him in prison, just STOP.I've never liked Aisha as actress and when they put her on the show I LAUGHED. As for the new monotone guy, I agree his tone is a turn off. i think his tone is trying to emit concern and compassion but he comes across passive. Now the new Hispanic guy is okay but trying to build a relationship between him and Garcia like Derek and Garcia had, again...STOP!So CBS and Criminal Minds if you want another season, change writers or reign them in. I don't get excited to watch the show anymore. It was my #1 show now it's around 7 or 8. I leave it on my DVR until I have nothing else to watch.There are a lot of good shows out there. Bring back the show that your fan base has come to love. It's painstakingly hard to watch Criminal Minds anymore. As for CM: Beyond the Borders, I really haven't bitten given it a chance because I'm almost done with the franchise."
170,"It dives into the deepest and darkest places of the human mind and helps take a shot at understanding why criminals do what they do. Diving into the 'Criminal Minds' and trying to understand them is the only way to apprehend or better yet prevent criminals. Although the reliability of the science of Profiling is debated it is implemented in reality by authorities of various countries. This show unlike many other crime based shows is not focused on how the characters react to the unfolding of events rather how the characters anticipate and unfold the events on board before they really unfold thus getting ahead of the criminals. In spite of the premise being rather grim, the show continues to maintain a story- line of the life of the lead characters in it. In addition, every episode has quotes by great thinkers to neatly sum up that episode which often makes you have a brain orgasm. The show does seem to get a bit repetitive if you binge on it, but it's perfect for a once a week watch. Although the members of the elite team understand the human mind better than most thus assumed to be above most of what normal people feel, they're all shown to have flaws, feelings and a bit of pettiness in them, making them believable and very much relatable."
171,"In the episode The Gathering they come to St. Paul, MN to work a case. In one scene near the end they are looking for the character Peter. They said he is in Rosewood just outside of St. Paul.Roseville is just outside of St. Paul, you just cross the street and there you are. Rosewood is 332 miles north of St. Paul.Watching this I wonder if they filmed any part anywhere near Minnesota. You see this in almost every show, most being filmed in Canada. As if no one will notice the mistakes. At least Mary Tyler Moore filmed several locations in the twin cities to cut in to the show filmed on a Hollywood set.I have watched several episodes in repeats and in every one I was able to identify the killer right away. Just like every horror/murder show done since the first Jason and Freddy movies you can see the formula and see where it's going in the first 15 minutes."
172,"Lola Glaudini was edgy and exciting and was one of my favorite characters. I love this show and am a fan of all of the actors on it except for the new girl, I keep wanting Elle to return!!! I would like to see the show include more of the ""unsub"" in the story line. I know that part of the show is the mystery and unfolding of the unsubs character but at the end I always want to know more. We get a lot of the crime information and the act itself but I think that knowing more of the why of the criminal would be interesting.I have always believed that part of the character of a sociopath comes from an interruption of personality development in the infant. Feelings are huge then and could cause the infant to learn to shut down emotion in order not to feel pain. Maybe that is why you only see depictions of sociopaths having sorrow only for themselves, mirroring the self absorption of an infant. What about that type of revelation on the show?"
173,"I want to start off my saying i like this show. BUT season 2, ep 18, the New Orleans episode was so LOL. AND a big cringe fest! The accents!!Are you serious? The detective said daddy 100 times and another detective said because a girl wore so many beads on Mardi Gras (about the only not dorky time to wear them) she was exposing herself and asked to be raped. WHAT?! Also, ONLY tourists show their tits for beads.It was also filmed on a lot or in L.A. Come on, don't be so cheap, at least get some exterior shots. Damn. And learn how to pronounce New Orleans if you're doing a show about the city.It was done really lazy and I am disappointed. I may stop watching the show."
174,"I must say, this is one of my favorite TV shows. I look forward to 'catching up' with the BAU every week. The script is well written, and the characters balance each other out just perfectly. Love the dynamic between Morgan and Garcia, and love Spencer's character!Hodge is also great, as is Rossi. Morgan kicking down doors cracks me up every time, no wasted bullets there! Want to see more new episodes (I've seen pretty much all episodes from the 8 seasons to date) =D"
175,"Not many shows achieve a *perfect cast*, but Criminal Minds has managed to do so. You have incredible writers, and an incredible cast that delivers it all perfectly. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS! If I had to pick a favorite I would be in trouble because each member is invaluable to the show being top notch. As far as writing content, it's not *over the top* gory and disgusting, the team is absolutely professional and extremely capable....and there is no back end garbage going on. This is perfection in my book, I hope you continue in this vein for the life of the show and may it be a LONG life. It's a refreshing change from all the ridiculous shows that litter the airways, please please don't change a thing. You got it going on!!"
176,"I thoroughly enjoy watching Criminal Minds. Right now it is a program that gets and keeps my attention. When watching the program that aired on February 7,2007 my heart went out to Spencer Reid. He is such a talented young man and he brings freshness to the show. I was sad that he endured so much especially the drugs and I was totally disappointed when he took the vials from the villains pocket. I am hoping that he is able to work through what happened to him and not going to become a druggie. We don't need that to happen to him. If that is the plot for further shows, I hope that changes. You have a great program and we don't need the good guys being bad."
177,"Yep, this is similar to other shows ""Profiler"", ""NYPD Blue"", "" Hillstreet Blues"", but it was an OK pilot. Was I impressed? Both yes and No. They spun a bit of originality in this one by having the character of Gideon be sort of poetic cop who likes to recite lines from Emerson, Nietzsche "" If you look too deeply into the abyss, the abyss will look into you."" Gideon is definitely out there.His two partners Agent Aaron Hotch (Thomas Gibson), Special Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) are the standard ""by the book"" geeks, who sometimes miss the obvious points in an investigation thus their recruitment to get back Gideon into the FBI/Priofiling field. I did like the character of Elle Greenway (Lola Glaudini), she's tough and speaks her mind.She and Derek have this gender battle going which is funny. In the pilot, they are tracking killer who likes to keep his victims alive for seven days before killing them, thus exploiting them. The killer is pretty clever, and eventually the team realizes that their profile (like most agents will tell ya) are wrong, and thus they start back to the drawing board.They hit pay dirt with by tracking some geek who doesn't appear to be a killer but upon further inspection (he has clippings of Gideon's past work as an agent and rubs it in), and thus the case is broken wide open. However it's not over, Gideon doesn't think by the profile that this kid is as crazy as he seems and his right, he eventually comes up with a theory that they are two killers.The next couple of scenes are well executed, yet very familiar. They play the good cop/bad cop routine, and use the familiar, ""your partner squealed on you bit"" to bluff one idiot to reveal the whereabouts of the other. Yes I know it's standard stuff but actually this is still part of the strategy of most profilers.Overall it looks like an OK show. will it last? Well CBS is already filled with cop shows and investigations ""Cold Case"", ""Without A Trace"", ""NCIS"", ""CSI"", and it's crappy ,crappy imitation ""CSI New York"", so it may not last due to the fact that they're plate is full but I would give it a look.The time slot for this show is perhaps it's biggest mistake, going up against ""Lost"" will most surely mean it'll get creamed in the ratings. Why not air it on Mondays when CBS has it's crappy comedy lineup is beyond me, but you can't never tell what goes in the execs mind, maybe they want to kill it before it has a chance, or maybe they have deals with the sitcoms, although in my opinion, the comedy sitcoms (aside from Everybody loves Raymond, King of Queens) is pretty damn weak and pathetic. I mean look at their lineup half of these shows are lagging in ratings, and more than half are new shows that most likely will get canceled However, if you're a fan of this show, and want to have your cake and eat too, you can always record lost and watch this show, or vice versa."
178,"I started watching Criminal Minds hoping it would be an entertaining and HONEST look at criminal profiling and investigations, but unfortunately it is anything but. To start with profiling isn't an exact science, just because one ""unsub"" acted a certain way doesn't mean that every other person that commits a similar crime can be categorized identically. This show deals in absolutes, and the investigators are NEVER wrong. The profile always fits down to minute details that are impossible to discern. They always show up in the nick of time to save someone, and the roles of the characters are so ridiculously specific it becomes laughable. On top of it all the character development is awful. Do you know what makes a good character? A good character has faults just like the rest of us, they aren't perfect, they have defects beyond what this show depicts. In this show imperfections are not being able to be perfect enough, not catching enough bad guys to save more people, a bad call at work that led to coworkers being killed, being so smart you can't relate with others, that kind of nonsense. Where are the drinking problems? Cheating? Getting in fights? Vanity? Greed? Any of the number of things that makes a person REAL and human? That doesn't exist in these characters, they only exist in those they chase. If you want characters that people can relate with they have to have the same demons that everyday normal people struggle with on a daily basis. Having and giving in to those demons doesn't make you a bad person, it gives your character the feel of reality. We have seen enough shows with the stereotypical roles displayed here, we don't need another. If you're interested in the same plot with the same characters with the same condescending view of reality that won't challenge your perspective or go beyond anything that is black and white than this is the show for you, but with the enormous amount of content out there that does a better job of depicting ""cops versus robbers"" take it from me, you can spend your time much better."
179,Absolutely obsessed with this series! Every episode is interesting and thrilling. Highly recommend
180,"So repetitive
So repetitive
So repetitiveYou get the idea...."
181,"Hate this show already . They let Hotch and Morgan go but still no issue. Started marking stupid directing mistakes still no issues and now last season starting to change everyone's personality all of the sudden and making two most liked characters to like each other whatttt!!!???? And have one ""FBI"" agent To put two suspects under arrest without her asking for backup and one little girl having such a good aim to hit JJ . Screw this show . Bunch selfish writers . Loved the show up until last few seasons"
182,"I don't need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don't know already that if you go to ""talk"" to the investigators that you don't just say ""I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer"". And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent."
183,Though it takes a while to get through some of the seasons this show is absolutely worth it. i have never loved a show or cast more (matthew😻) but the show has such good writing and plot twists. i'm so sad it's over after 15 good seasons and i'd love to see more but if u love crime shows and don't get as grossed out from gruesome things watch it 10/10
184,Sad to see this series end. Compelling and intense.
185,"I've never rated anything before with 10 stars and I doubt that this gonna happen again!
I can't tell anything about criminal minds without having millions of hearts popped around me!
These have been an amazing 15 years with criminal minds! A series to be remembered always! As my favorite ever!"
186,"The first criminal show I saw. love all casts. can't believe it has ended. Hopefully see you guys again.
Reid is the favorite character. He is so talented and thoughtful. He is so lovely. I will definitely watch this show for many times. Thanks for showing us such a wonderful criminal show!"
187,"Very supensful series, would recommed to anyone. Will keep you wanting more. It will have you telling at your television."
188,"Best crime tv shows of all time. Every episode is able to surprise me. There is amazing plot twists and amazing drama between characters, but it does not matter if you dont watch every episode. You can still keep up with everything"
189,"The Behavioral Analysis Unit (B.A.U.) is a premier investigative squad of the F.B.I. They are sent to create profiles of criminal suspects around the country. Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) is the original proponent of the squad. Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) is the leader at the start of the show. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) is the brains. JJ (A. J. Cook) handles liaison. Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) is the computer support. Over the years, some of the cast would be replaced although the main cast is surprisingly stable over the show's 15 years run.It's a standard network police procedural concentrating on gruesome serial killers. It is a solid show and 15 seasons is an impressive run. The cast is terrific. It maintains a certain pacing and tension with its brutal gruesome crimes. Procedural is not a dirty word if it's done well and this is done well. The show did spin off a couple of failed shows. The missing ingredient has always been the characters and unlike those police acronym shows, this is not a show based on a location. It makes it harder to spin off. Otherwise, this is a very successful network show."
190,"The first seasons of this show were incredible, a new way to do crime shows which for a while had become essentially all the same. The problem this show had was that it was great from the start, you love all the characters and get very attached to them and that becomes an issue because over the course of the first 6 or 7 seasons in particular many of them don't make it for one reason or another. At the start they kind of got away with it, they replaced characters with more good ones. But in the end many of the fan favourites have disappeared and it has damaged the sort of family bond that those characters had making the show move away from what it originally started out as. In particular cutting Gideon, JJ and Prentiss really hurt the show and somehow seemed to damage the storylines with it (somewhat covered for a while by Hotchner and his story which for me was the last brilliant one). Now it's become somewhat unrecognisable and it's a shame, but the first several seasons alone are worth watching and why i'll still rate this show so highly much like The Simpsons it would be unfair to condemn the whole series and ignore some excellent parts."
191,Hopefully they make spin off about Spencer Reed. Im going to miss that character...
192,"Absolutely disgraceful how they handled the whole Thomas Gibson issue, just words cannot describe how insulting and disrespectful how they handled the whole situation.They continue to try and replace characters left with similar type characters, instead of giving them their own backstory and developing their story. Letting Mandy Patinkin, Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore go was beyond amateurish and showed lack of leadership and quality from the hierarchy.One character that they handled well was Paget Brewster's character. She was clearly a fan favorite, one that had a great dynamic and chemistry with the rest of the cast. And the fact they kept bringing her back despite her leaving the show numerous times, was clever. Would have been better if she never left
The first 6-7 seasons were as close to perfection in terms of a tv show that decided to destroy itself due to poor leadership from executives"
193,"Another clone of the CSI/NCIS model, with the requisite carbon copy cast members - older fatherly/motherly leader, attractive and badass lead field investigator(s), slightly quirky but still attractive younger field investigator(s), and very quirky support personnel. The high turnover of cast made it hard to really care about any characters, but there were some surprisingly good actors for such a formulaic pulpy show with pedestrian acting. One actor who was NOT good - Paget Brewster. Don't get me wrong, she's hot as all getout, but her super-serious-emphatic-stern-badass-woman line delivery is so over-the-top cartoonish, it pushes the whole show into unintentional parody of the genre."
194,"Some episodes are good, but others are so difficult to stand..."
195,"It's s a great show normally wth compelling and exciting episodes. It doesn't need the super villain.In fact this a class of villain which i call the omnipotent villain. In scifi there presence is arguable depending on whether they obey the rules or premises established by the story, but in reality based fiction they are by default unacceptable,The writers justify some of his ability with the smoke and mirrors of Garcia's game but it still leaves too much beyond anyone's abilities.Some shows need to raise the stakes, but this show doesn't, yet they will do it again many times."
196,"First of all: I'm not commenting on whether or not what Gibson did or didn't do deserved the punishment he got. Not my place. I wasn't there and I have no business judging. I just miss his character. Full stop.Right or wrong, the show sucks without Thomas Gibson. I tried to like it. I stuck with it for awhile, but I just can't get into Paget Brewster. She annoys me. I don't know why. Maybe just because I think the role of team leader belongs to Gibson. Mostly though, I think it is because she is so quick to break all the rules. She would never have survived in any government agency long enough to become a team leader -- at least not from my experience. Then Gubler's character went AWOL most of the time and Shemar quit and I gave it up completely."
197,"I have to say, when I first watched the serie, I really liked it. It was the first tv series I had watched all episodes, Reid was awesome, Hotcher too, even Gideon had an interesting personality, as far as I remember. The thing is, they were the key role to the show, when they ""killed"" Hotcher (I know it was some background stuff in the sets), it started to lost purpose, but now (the little I remember from season 14), even Reid lost space. The thing is, the relashionship between the team was constructed well in the first seasons, and then it just change most of the crew. It was a good formula, it was a good cast, it was well writen, but know, lost characters, lost the impressive stuff about Reid, became boring, comon."
198,"Perhaps because of it's title I was expecting something a lot smarter from this show. A special group of FBI agents are assigned a case each episode. Usually some kind of serial killer or severe criminal of some kind. Each week they go through the usual steps and usually get their ""UnSub"". Character development is not a big concern as it is more about what they do. Some of the stories are far fetched and perhaps like many shows this one has outstayed it's welcome?Just another boring Police procedural."
199,"Criminal Minds was an amazing show, especially in its first 4-5 seasons. As someone who has always enjoyed cop shows, Criminal Minds was right up my alley. While initially intrigued by the psychological profiles of the BAU, I quickly got hooked, looking forward to each new episode. This became my favorite show, beating out L&O SVU, CI, and CSI:NY. The chemistry among the cast was great, even amidst the season 2 and 3 cast changes. While I was sad to see Elle and Gideon's characters leave, the introduction of Prentiss and Rossi's characters helped fill those voids. For me, the showing started going downhill mid season 5. Garcia started getting pushed more to the forefront, and other characters started getting less screen time. What was once cute and witty banter between her, Morgan, and the others was quickly becoming tired and old. It seemed as if the writers were trying to make her more of a central character, as she would appear in scenes that didn't require her expertise (hacking). In season 6, when JJ's character was written off and Garcia's character got even more screen time, I stopped watching; but returned in season 7 when the cast was reunited. Seasons 7-10 were solid, although the departure of Prentiss left a void that Agent Blake couldn't fill. I don't know if it was the writing or the actor, but I just couldn't seem to care about the character. Now in its 13th season, I must say the show is a shell of what it once was. I no longer look forward to watching it every week, but if I'm awake and nothing else is on, I'll try to tune in. I think the biggest problem the show currently has is that the writers and/or producers keep trying to replace pivotal characters. I think Dr. Tara Reid (played by Aisha Tyler) would better serve as Unit Chief instead of a member of the team. I'm sure replacing Shemar Moore's character with Adam Rodriguez seemed good on paper (both are nice to look at). However, like Agent Blake in seasons 8 and 9, Luke Alvez brings nothing different to the show. Likewise, when Thomas Gibson was fired, they brought in Damon Gupton as a replacement, but that too was a bust. Personally, I would prefer the BAU team to now consist solely of JJ, Reid, Prentiss, and Rossi (and Garcia with limited screen time)."
200,"I have been watching Criminal Minds from the very beginning, and I loved this show when I was a teenager.Now however, I'm kind of tired of it. Almost every episode follows the exact same pattern: there's a serial killer, the team profiles him/her, the killer abducts another person, the team finds the killer just in time and save the victim. In the finale of each season, one team member is in danger, and the rest of the team rush to save him/her. This is the show, there's pretty much nothing else to it.The problem with this show is that the characters are strictly divided into ""good"" and ""bad"" people. The team members are all good-hearted heroes with absolutely no flaws, that are willing to risk their own lives to save people whenever necessary. They are just way too one- dimensional and do not give a realistic portrayal of people. Also, it's ridiculous that the team is always the first to find the killer, even though they almost always work together with local police forces. I'm not mocking the art of profiling, but seriously... This being said, the show is quite entertaining to watch and suspenseful here and there. It's just not very deep or intelligent and not for those who want to see realistic, complex characters. However, I still think this show is a lot better than all the CSI-crap. I've just kind of ""grown out of it"" if that makes sense.Hotch was probably the best and most believable character on the show, but he recently got kicked out of it. I think time will tell how the new team members change the dynamics (and my guess is that they don't; the show will continue to follow the same pattern over and over again). This show could really benefit from some continuity and longer, more complicated stories, rather than a new case in every episode. I'd like to see something completely new and get to know the characters better. The happy endings in each episode should be ditched because they make the show too predictable and just don't represent real life, even if we want to believe they do... This is a show that I might watch if I have nothing else to do, but most of the time I will find something better."
201,"I was watching some episodes of Season 12 when I noticed the absence of Thomas Gibson. The story line that he is not coming back sounded a little strange. Then I read here all sorts of pros and cons on the firing of Thomas. Surprisingly enough, and coming from ""pros"" is that CBS/ABC Studios seem to have only taken a look at a little corner instead of the entire picture.I have watched each and every episode of the entire series since Season 1 and one of the strengths of CM is the great chemistry that existed between the cast members. Sure, some agents came and went but that was OK because the main characters were always there. The resignation of Mandy Patinkin was a hard kick in the main structure of the show but, thankfully, Rossi's arrival ""fixed"" it.Then, Shemar Moore left and you could tell there was some kind of gap somewhere. Now, Thomas Gibson was fired and swiftly replaced by Paget Brewster. What is a very weak link here is the fact that Emily Prentiss has been working for Interpol for awhile and she was over in pursuit of a criminal. Realistically, agencies like the FBI don't simply grab an agent from another agency PLUS puts him/her in charge of a division. There is something called courtesy between agencies of allied countries. It would have made a lot more sense, since Rossi did not want the position, to give it to JJ, a regular field agent with seniority from the beginning.A structure can only take some many kicks to its heart before it crumbles. Ratings are unfortunately weakening, fans are boycotting it and Season 13 is a huge question mark. The stupid CBS/ABC Studios and their executives should have thought of that instead of their idiotic macho pride. Sometimes ""pros"" do not stand up to their title."
202,"my problem with the show: predictable writing, predictable twists, and no real interest on my part for any of the characters (as much as a like the principal actors).i saw episode one. that was enough. too bad, i was hoping for more. but, because the writing is basic and clichéd, it will probably stay.oh, well.other shows coming out this year are better, but, i doubt they will stay. killer instinct is not bad - i like johnny mesner, but i don't think they will ever find something for him.too bad."
203,"Anyone who thinks this show is good, is sick. Even one of the stars, Mandy Patinkin who played Jason Gideon in 47 episodes, regretted it.If you don't believe me, Google ""Mandy Patinkin Disses CBS 'Criminal Minds': ""My Biggest Public Mistake""."" The program glorifies sick, gory death and the criminals involved. I have tried to watch it more than once, but it is so obviously geared towards satisfying the people who enjoy watching and hearing disgustingly gory deaths, I just have to switch over.Today I gave it another chance. A story about someone scratching Roman numerals in the mouths of victims. And then they showed in all graphic detail someone in a wooden crate being burnt alive. Even a shot from inside the wooden crate as the petrol outside was burning into it.Wow! That should get the ratings up! That should get all the sick people watching dribbling with glee.Jesus H Christ, what is the matter with the people who make this disgusting rubbish and the people who enjoy watching it.If you don't feel sick watching these scenes then there is something wrong with you. The people who make this should be locked up."
204,"I have watched all episodes of CM since Season 1 up to now. This is my number 1 favorite show ever. The best seasons so far to me is Season 1, 3 and back to 7. Now in S08, with the loss of Paget Brewster (Emily)(she went on to do another crime series, not sure which network), this show is slowly deteriorating. It is becoming very repetitive and less interesting.I have nothing against Jean Triplehorn (Blake), I think she's a good actress, it's just that she's not right for such a role. Or perhaps, they just need to make her character more interesting. Her character is not helping the show become more interesting.I love the way Matthew Grey Gubler directs some of the episodes and I really hope they do something to save this show because it is becoming really boring. I am hoping that they last another season, maybe make it up to season 10 but they really need to put on more creative ideas here, intensify scenes they way they were in season 1 or at least 7. This show needs to be saved for the sake of ever LOYAL FANS out here like us!!!! Please!!"
205,"I like the cast, the plots are interesting and the acting is great. BUT I had to stop watching. The reasons are the following. Number one by far the majority of crimes involve women victims, in fact serial killings of women. Blacklist me, as long as the producers get this feedback. The crimes that you are featuring are also disgustingly awful and of course are discussed repeatedly. I think in fact maybe you might give ideas to the perverted. Anyway I had to stop watching it which is too bad.Also you repeat episodes too often for those who watch a lot. Maybe you shouldn't do so many marathons.If you find a lot of people padding their reviews it would be understandable. Your minimum length is way too short for anyone who just wants you to receive honest feedback about your show. If you are aver professional reviewers then just say so up front. ""those of you who are just ordinary viewers might as well not waste your time"". Might be a good line to put."
206,"I have seen the first 2 episodes of this show so far, and i think its pretty good, and definitely take a different stance to the lab-based crime shows. However, I have also read all John Douglas's books, and to me, they seem to be actually quoting his writing a lot of the time! The lead character seems to be based on him, but John Douglas isn't mentioned in the credits (if i am wrong here, please correct me) From the shorts I have seen for episode 3 (with the 2 sisters), it looks like it is based on a true crime which John Douglas wrote about...and I wonder if the usual disclaimer will be there claiming that the characters are entirely fictional and not based on any real life people etc etc...."
207,"The story is OK. But the relationship between Penelope and Derek is about as realistic and inspiring as Donald TrumpAlso the episode 11.16 could not have been worse if Trump. Bush,Hitler, Pol Pot and the North Korean Dictator co-wrote!It irritates me that the chars are so half painted. Rossy is always OK. Penelope is always stressed. She is a cheap rip-off of Abby-the NCIS Goth girl- and all that Penelope portrays convincingly is that she's is overweight, like me!Hodge has the character of a half-baked brick And Spence reminds me of the kid who never stops peeing his pantsThe other chars have not been convincing enough that I remember their names even though I have watched every episode TJ. Yes the disappearing blonde is TJ In spite of all this criticism I keep on watching CM and am grateful that they stop the Chinese rip off with Forrest ""wandering eye"" Whittaker"
208,"I was a bit late to party with Criminal Minds, I only started watching it about a month ago and have already seen all 8 seasons. From the first episode I was hooked, a combination of story telling and characters made this show very enjoyable. I just hope this show continues to get the credit it deserves and I'm crossing my fingers for many more seasons.The storytelling - Very well written, especially the first four or five season. The later seasons are still very good though.The characters - I think this is the best part about this show. All the characters are very memorable, good guys and bad. Each character has a very distinct personality which lacks from a lot of other shows.I have recommended this to friends and recommend to anyone reading this that might be contemplating whether or not they are going to take the dive. It will hook you straight away."
209,"The summary pretty much spells it out. will they sell the DVD? I love this show but i haven't seen most of the episodes....I would really like to know the answer to this so I'm going to have to fill up the spaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccce because Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii just found out that you need ten frigging lines of frigging text!. Hoooooooooooooooow can they expect people to type that much. I can't do it/ I like to keep things short and simple. please reply because there's a burning question in my mind needing to be answered and it's this one. I did it! ha ha! 10 lines of nothingness!!!! well, not really... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
210,"Have to say I feel like I've watched this show since forever. So sad that I just watched the last season. It was a great show, every season was so good with great plots, excellent cast and everything.Gonna miss this, so I'll probably rewatch"
211,"We were robbed. jemily was clearly supposed to happen. I will never forgive the writers for that. in my opinion, they totally hooked up in paris"
212,"I like the bit where, instead of saying let's go to the plane, he says Wheels up in 20"
213,"The conversation between Reid and his mom made me cry so much:
""I'm afraid of losing you, it's not because I love you. It's because I don't think I know who I am in this world if I'm not your son.""
""You're so much more than that.
Who we are in the world changes. It's part of life."""
214,"""Criminal Minds"" is one of my fav TV shows. Everything is perfect until one or more of the team got out... That's why you must watch it since season 1.
Hotchner, Prentiss, Reid, Morgan, Penelope, JJ.... later, Rossi.... You will love them all! Some get out and comeback... Start with season 1 or you will miss the best of Criminal Minds. Presently, I can't say this show is great anymore and for those who watch it from the beginning you know why..."
215,"I really dont know what to say after, i dont know 300-350 episodes wathced.
First, the concept of Criminal minds are amazing, it is so brillant. They stayed almost the same from first to last episode. There are a lot of action and drama. Also a lot of great actors, every, but every main charachter in this series was so good. Every main charachter have a good story behind him. It is stupid for some things, like Aaron Hotchner left series because he had an argument with his boss, i felt really sory for this.. But then arrived a new charachters who are also really well. Bad guys and some people in police was sometimes some popular actors and i was happy to see them in some moments. Other bad guys were in 95% of cases really good acting, like they are really serial killers. Some episodes had a few parts like Aaron Hotchner and his like, Spencer in jail, Morgan and his wife and a lot others.I can say a lot of things about this series... I am waiting for last (15th) season, and during that time i will surely watch it once more! 😄"
216,The constant change in characters is less than desirable.
217,I liked the show from the start. It got better when Mandy Patankin left and the actress that played El left. It was sad when Thomas Gibson left. All in all it is a great show
218,"If you are going to use props like a Tact Vest, make sure you put plates in it. Vest alone(without plates) will BARELY stop a 9mm bullet. Just a few of the stupid Hollywood stunts I've seen. But seriously, if you are going to do something, make it authentic................................"
219,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite show ever. Sure it's very dark and often repetitive but what I'm more interested in is the relationship between the team members.They are more than a team. They are quite a family and they care for each other when one of them is struck by a tragedy. This strong relationship is their strength and they always face the danger together.I also like the little snippet into the family life of the characters, seeing them acting with their children and companions. It's refreshing and a nice breakout of the huge darkness surrounding their work.The atmosphere is sure very oppressive and intense as we see the agents trying to enter the minds of the most twisted serial killers of the country to prevent them for murdering another innocent people. How the investigation is unfolding is shot in a very intuitive way almost making us a part of their audience. Sometimes I found myself making deductions to understand the motive of the killers even if most of the time I got it wrong. Not everybody has the mind of a profiler. But that's OK as I don't intend to become one. I wouldn't have lasted long in that line of work anyway.That wont change the fact that I wish this show lasts for several years and please make Derek and Penelope a real couple. They are so cute together."
220,"I'm sorry, I don't want to slam Jeanne Tripplehorn, but she just doesn't work in this show. At all. Period. And yet the producers try to force her into the limelight; obviously, because they know there's a disconnect and casting her wasn't right for the show. When you have a program with this long of a history and so many loyal fans it must be incredibly hard to find someone new to add into the cast - because of course, there was no 'replacing' Paget Brewster - but this choice is a miserable failure, and after many years of committed, almost rabid viewership, is turning me off what has been for a very long time, my favorite television show. It's not like replacing Mandy Patinkin with Joe Mantegna - THAT worked, and viewers were able to accept it. Even the short- term replacement of Rachel Nichols was better than this situation. Better to have not replaced Emily at all. Oh how I wish.I have loved and laughed and cried with Hotch, JJ, Morgan, Penelope, and Spencer for many years. It's deeply disappointing that our relationship is coming to such an unsatisfying end."
221,"I am only in season one and there have been some glaring mistakes, like an agent with a case file open on a public train and holding it up so everyone can see what it is...not even bothering to have a blank cover! Overall though they seem to be trying to cram too much from crime event, with each crime having to be complex enough to call them in, to solve into a short time slot and that makes it quite unbelievable while also affecting the ability of the actors to employ any subtlety. Some series I couldn't even try to watch due to their up front premise,(like ""Lie to me"" because in the trailer the claim is that the main character is the first ever to do what I was trained to do in college in the 80s) but this...good lord how did it last 210 episodes? Maybe everyone else is using as I do, a show that I do not really have to pay attention, or be in the same room..i can be doing a renovation project in another room and still keep up. I like the explanation of the psychological reasons for UNSUB behaviors as a clue to figure out why something is done. I feel the the general population often does not understand this side of things and why investigations may proceed in a certain way, and this does a good tutorial job for why jumping to a conclusion is not a good idea. Having studied some of the same things, at times I found myself correcting who the UNSUB may be be before the show figured it out, which is typical of a lot of shows and good because it is true that often investigative agencies may get stuck looking in the wrong direction too early.Overall it is a decent show so far and I will keep putting it on in the background while I finish the renos. My highlights are the way that Garcia (?) answers the phone and when any character who does not specialize in something gives another way to look at an item, behavior or other element, that puts another puzzle piece in place. That simple mechanism makes it much more real, because that is something that happens to everyone...the need for someone looking from outside to say, hey ""why not this?"" or ""why that?"""
222,"We got some dumb reviewers here too. The one person that says JJ was fired is dumb. She was never fired, she was hired for a job at the pentagon. OMG, how stupid are you? Man, I read some dumb reviews, but the person saying JJ was fired, was the dumbest or one of the dumbest things I ever heard, when I have seen every single episode more than once. I would know, since she was never fired. She was forced to take the job at the pentagon. She wanted to stay. Get your stuff together, dummy.I am a horror fan, and I guess that is why I love this show. They the characters had their ups and downs in different times, but it happens to all shows. For the people that say this is rip off of NCIS. Hello, more dummies. NCIS has nothing to do with FBI BAU, its NAVY. Just cause characters are put in as like them, does not make it the same.One thing different is the horror aspect of Criminal Minds, and none of NCIS. NCIS is about terrorism, and Criminal Minds isn't. Why would a show called Criminal Minds not have horror aspect if its all about Criminals and how bad they can get? Because, we got dummies out there that think when Criminals, means it has to be like CSI or NCIS.Out of all the shows of NCIS, CSI, Bones, The Mentalist, and any cop show. Criminal Minds is way better, because we get to see how a Criminal may think to why he or she is doing what they do. Those other shows mentioned are just about catching someone, and not explaining why.Don't get me wrong I like the other shows I listed too, but just not nearly as much as Criminal Minds, and for those people that like to say outrageous things of what is not true about the show or characters, then watch the shows or episodes again, and then say what you say about it. Making crap up just to say how bad the show is, is just making you look dumb.If I had the money to put out. I would buy all the Blu-Ray discs of Criminal Minds, and I hope this show continues. I keep seeing the best shows canceled, and the trashiest shows get renewed. It is stupid."
223,"This show is definitely a great watch! I've stuck with this show since season 1(episode 1) and its now at season 8! I really enjoy this show, it is very interesting, but the part of love the most is the chemistry amongst the cast!I feel like the writers/producers/directors could not have come up with a better cast. They are all very talented and lovable. My personal favorite is of course Dr Spencer Reid. Whoever is skeptical about the show, definitely should watch more than one episode to judge it! the actual cases that are presented are interesting, yet do make you think about what really is out there in this world. It is definitely a must watch!"
224,"I've always enjoyed crime/drama shows on TV. My favorite for the longest time was CSI: The original. It was like the first time ever a team had been put together to do a show, but actually had to do their homework first. It was the first of it's kind, that, as you watched it, you actually felt like these were GENUINE forensic scientists!! Very impressive. I never missed a show. But then, a new show came along called ""Criminal Minds"". Well, the previews caught my eyes at first, and then I started recognizing different faces, like Shemar Moore (HOT!!), Joe Mantegna,, and Thomas Gibson. That was enough for me to mark my calendar! I don't remember when the pilot aired, but I was on it! Of course, ""Rossi"" didn't come into the show until later, but even the original supervisor,(sorry, his name escapes me right now), was excellent. That very first show finally gave me hope, that there could actually be shows that made their casts appear completely professional- as if you were watching a real doc. episode, as opposed to your average ""Oh, yeah, right, like that could happen in real life!"". You know what I'm talking about. Aside from all of that, I had never watched a show where there wasn't at least ONE character I just couldn't stomach- especially females. This cast clicked from the beginning, and is far from quitting. The funny thing is, there's this Matthew Gray Gubler out of no where, who kind of seemed odd at first, but then I began to realize that he had a certain sex appeal to him( me being a 45-yr old female!). He started to be my favorite character, but I admit that just looking at ""Morgan"" was a treat Then there's this ""Hotch""-very distant, but very handsome!! And I found that the female characters seemed to blend in, rather than just being thrown on the show as ""eye-candy"", as so many producers do. This is not the case at all. In every single episode, they each have a job to do, and they work that job as if they ACTUALLY WORKED for the FBI!! This show never fails to interest you, keep you watching until the end, and you can not NOT like any of these characters. And, my God, look at ""Rossi"" at his age! Still sexy as hell. ""Garcia"", of course, always seems to break the ice w/ her humor, but kicks butt on those computers too!! What I've noticed the most in the last season,though, is that, in the beginning, ""Dr. Reid"" always seemed pale, sickly,nerdy, and in bad need of a hair cut! Well, he's grown up, I guess- he is extremely HOT w/ that longer hair, he gained weight, and he looks healthy- yummy!! So, I have a most favorite show that nothing else in this world could take me away from come Wed. nights. This show rocks- has everything. A totally compatible cast and an original,edge of your seat (almost) episode every single week. It's ""real"", it's suitable for a fairly wide-open fan range, and it just never seems to get ""old"", like most shows do after a couple of years. I hope ""Criminal Minds"" is around for a very long time. If you've never watched it, and you enjoy realistic(sometime's downright gross stuff),crime dramas w/ a LOT of action, then you owe it to yourself to check out this show- I promise you won't regret it!! I guess I owe my biggest thanks to the writers of the show- Whoever you are: Thank you, thank you, thank you!! You should get an award, or at least a nod at a nomination when it comes to all of these hyped- up award shows. Best cast ensemble?? DUH!! How about some nods for best acting? Well, you'll always have my vote, and I would like to think that there are a lot of other people out there that agree with me. If so, show some love- send in some comments!1"
225,"This show is excellent, it had me on the edge of my seat all of the time i was watching it. It was a great show with lots of surprises and kept you thinking the whole time. Also it is very realistic and not out of reach ideas. Highly recommended!!! I enjoyed the arson episode the most. It was suspenseful! The acting is very believable. The scenes make you think and to secure your doors! I love this show and I will definitely. DEFINITELY WATCH ALL OF IT! I hope this show will be on for a long time to come. This show has me on the edge of my seat and will continue to do so. I hope that i helped to convince some to watch because this show does not disappoint."
226,"In my opinion, Criminal Minds is, currently, the best show on television.An avid fan of crime drama, I started watching Criminal Minds when it aired for the first time in 2005. Unlike shows such as CSI, Criminal Minds delivers a psychological aspect to each episode. By profiling the ""unsub"" in each case, the BAU team predicts the criminal's next move. Anyone who has taken a psychology class will be amazed by all of the elements this show contains.If you have never watched Criminal Minds, I highly recommend you give it a chance!"
227,"I happen to have caught this show a few episodes into the series, from that point i was hooked. Already being a CSI fan i was looking forward to more of the same, but this did something else it looked at it from the behavioural profilers point of view. Having read this premise in a right up I was expecting another cracker clone, but this had action in it as well. As you may guess from the way this rambles somewhat i am hard pushed to pin down what precisely I like about this show, all I can say is that I do. It is helped by the fact that the cast play their respective roles superbly, led by the much underrated Mandy Patinkin. I would recommend anyone who likes there police programmes to look at it from another angle give this a try."
228,"I've just started watching this show and by the time the Pilot was done, I was hooked. The witty lines and amazingly suspense plots work together like two pieces of a puzzle. Even though I'm only on my second season, at the moment, I already call this one of my favorite shows. I literally sitting on edge as i watch and gasp at the cliffhanger. The writers always leave me craving for more and I'm really glad i don't have school anymore because I would probably have fallen asleep during ever class since I practically spend all night watching more Criminal Minds than any sane person should. To say I love the show would be putting it too lightly but it's the best word I have for now."

Excellent cast, story line, and directing, keeps me on the edge of my chair from start to finish! Very well done, a rare thing these days.

230,"Before watching this television series, I had no interest in Behavorial Analysis Unit of the FBI, now I am obsessed and possibly getting a career in it somehow. This show is one of the best shows currently running on television, of course besides ""Dexter"" but it's not on Season right now. I guarantee you Reid will move you, Hotchner's genius will stun you, Gideon's insight is unbelievable. This show makes you believe, almost like it's real. Amazing show I give 10 out of 10 I have a quantity of episodes stored up on my DVR =] But if you ever get the chance to see this show take it because I am almost positive that you will take up with it like me and my whole family did lol, so ya take this review to heart and tune to CBS and A and E on Fridays and Saturdays and lounge and watch the best show running, even if you do run in to some reruns."
231,"I've been watching crime dramas practically all of may life, I've seen many different concepts of those shows, but I can honestly say that Criminal Minds are truly one of the best crime shows that were ever on television. The stories are interesting, the development of characters is great, you can see all those different personalities working together with the common goal of defining psychic potentials of criminals.The most impressive episodes, I must say are the season 3 finale and the continuation of that episode in the first one of season 4. Those two episodes left me on the edge of my seat and I would say, action wise they are even better then many things we saw on 24 with Jack Bauer. I was thrilled and I will watch it a few more times just to see it again. I would recommend it to everyone.Good luck to everyone!"
232,"When I first saw this show (witch was with my friends), we just turned it on and started watching, we din't know much about this show, at first, I thought that it was another one of those cheesy cop shows, but in the end, I really liked it. I'd even say that this is better then all CSIs because it's a bit more realistic and the episodes are all very different, as for CSI, it's someone gets killed, someone finds the body and freaks out and calls the cops, the CSI team comes, they take the body and they exam it. They magically find something and they continue until they magically finds the real culprit. Criminal Minds is different, they play with the findings of the crimes, mainly because the crime isn't always someone dead. The people on the team are all very different (it's not all skinny nice-looking actors) for the actors, and perfect-life, stress free people, like the characters.The team is constricted of peoples: Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), the leader, the one who's the most experienced.Aaron Hotch (Thomas Gibson), the boss Derek Morgan (Sheemar Moore), the crazy people profiler Elle Greennaway (Lola Glaudini), the sex-offended victims profiler.Dr.Spencer Reid (Mathew Gray Gubler), the smart-ass genius who happens to know everything.Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangness), the computer magician Jeniffer ""JJ""Jareau (A.J. Cook), I have no idea, she does not do much, she only talks to the press.I Also prefer this show because this is a real organization (FBI) and not some made-up one (CSI), and they are actual cops."
233,"I used to watch it years ago and stopped bec there was so much sadism & depicted raw violence & tortured. why did I want to spend my time invested in this?
so catching serial killers, spree killers, violence against women, understandable, but it just depicted too much.I liked mandy potankin, he left. by now 3 other key figures left-
since I was having trouble finding something on netflix, I decided to try to watch Season 11 & 12 {13-15 not shown)really, the procedure is just plain silly.Garcia (previous hacker, FBI tech expert) given choice to work for FBI or go t jaii) explains why she is so offbeat- not FBI hire, finds things on information systems that truly cannot exist. you cannot access information that is not imputed.I would have to believe that all cities, rural, big, have complicated information inputted on all it's citizens. In extensive data banks. it's not that I don't think Big Brother is watching (George Orwell's 1984) I just don't think ""He"" has the man power and extensive band width it would take. and that much coordinated information on everyone living or dead. The way she ""narrows down"" the suspects with cross reference....find who has ""a rare blood disease"" by those who live near old warehouses or dropped out of school, aised by abusive or neglectful single parent....AND with current photos. often clear full on, within a limited mile radius, with a certain age range (sex)generally almost exclusively it's men. Often with religious compulsion. Usually a loner which is often not the case- GreenRiver Killer, BTK killer, and Bundy, all integrated into the community..In a few days, they manage to locate serial killers, some working for 20 years (let's make it realistic) resurfaced, or new bodies discovered, and OFTEN in a few day to effect a rescue within minutes of death.so much of their story lines and plot points are based on some kind of made up science. and statistics they couldn't possibly have.this last season 12 on Netflix, (I can fast forward) the long story arch, with Spencer Reid, and his Schizophrenic Alzheimer mother, who is by alternatives, loving lucid, and blank violent crazy. It is so silly on so many levels. to try to keep it interesting, they've gone into science fiction, mastermind, world conspiracy territory. I wanted to see where they went with it. but it was really hard to stomach"
234,I absolutely love this show. I am shattered that the final season is shortly upon us.
235,"Every character is unique and the episodes are very well produced.
It is really a marvellous TV series."
236,"This show is taking a nose dive with some of the new characters. Linda Barnes character is seriously hard to watch. All over the place with her storyline and her acting skills. Oh, lord! I hope the show can turn it around or it's the end."
237,every scene of this movie is good.the dialogues of this movie is amazing.the emotions given by the actors are excellent. it is a best movie to watch . this is one of my all time favourite movie.all characters of this movie is amazing . the director is doing well in this movie.this is also a suspense movie to watch . good movie to watch and watch it at http://www.themovielinks.com
238,"Criminal Minds is a good show. It is (almost) never fantastic, but it never really drops either. A show which is almost on top in every episode for this many seasons when almost every episode is the same has something special. Yes the actors are great, but it is the directing and scripts that make this show wonderful, or at least it was, the high average level of quality is starting to drop with the last couple of seasons. The first 5-6 seasons are the strongest, season 4 is especially strong with the great 11th episode and also episodes 25/26 at the end of the season. On the minus side of things we have the characters personal lives which are sometimes too much in focus, and as profilers they are involved in more shootings then Rambo, which never feels quite right to me. As the seasons passes, a lot of the main characters are also exchanged, mostly for the worse. I use criminal minds as a show I can always watch. Whenever bored, or nothing else have my attention this is usually where I go. It will not go down in history as top 20 or anything like that, but consistent performance, very good entertainment and a lot of exciting great episodes make it worthy of your time, although, as mention at the start, the quality has started to drop with the latest seasons."
239,"I like cop series, CSI, etc. Recently I began to watch Criminal Minds, from the first season, and I really love it. Unlike other series (like The Big Bang Theory) I like how the characters evolve in Criminal Minds. The newest episode I have watched is Entropy. All the characters are attractive, even with their peculiarities. Dr. Reid is lovable (so says my wife) but each of them has something special. Of course, the cases they investigate are complex and it is interesting how they combine CSI data with their combined profiling of both the unknown subject and his or her victims and, of course, the informatics magic of Penelope to close the net around the unknown subject. I particularly enjoy when the initial profile is wrong and makes them to think hard about any missing clue until they get it straight. Highly recommended!"
240,"I've watched every episode of Criminal Minds and I loved the first few seasons but I think the latest seasons have lost some quality.The first 2/3 seasons I think are amazing. They're intelligent, gritty and its extremely interesting watching how FBI profilers hunt down serial killers. In the early seasons they go into a lot of detail on how these people are caught and the stages they go through to catch them and the writers actually used ex FBI agents to find out how its all done. The characters are also all unique, realistic and interesting in the first season or so. The only down side to the first few seasons is that there's not much personal character development like there is the later ones. The last few seasons have really been hit and miss and overall barring a few episodes are not as good. The episodes got less gritty and smart and more 'Hollywood'. Now all the episodes involve the profilers making these huge leaps in their case that have bordered on ridiculous and every episode ends with an action sequence of them saving the victim 'just in time'. Some of the episodes jump so fast that you just completely lose track of what they're doing. I like that we get more of a glimpse into the personal lives of the characters in these later seasons but the characters themselves have become less realistic and interesting. JJ has turned into the 'I'm a small pretty blond but I can beat up a grown man' character which came out of the nowhere and Morgan used to be an expert in obsessive crimes but turned into the typical angry character with muscles. When the characters are together they all contribute ideas in order and all profile in rotation in a monotone way. They've lost some individuality.The latest seasons haven't been all bad though, occasionally there will be an amazing episode out of the blue but its a shame that these are few and far between. Also they are now on their 12th season so I think they are struggling to come up with cases that we haven't seen before. I really hope that season 12 is good and they start bringing back more intelligent profiling."
241,"CBS was the most watched channel on TV while Criminal Minds of old was still one of your top shows. I just subscribed to Netflix so I could start from the beginning and watch all of the shows that Derek Morgan was in. Even though all of the shows were amazing, the greatest to me were: when Emily returned, the devastation of Hodge losing his wife, Rossi found out he had a daughter, when Reed survived his capture, JJ survived her capture etc. but the most amazing of all was the Derek Trilogy, Season 11, Show 16- Derek, Show 17-The Sandman and Show 18, A Beautiful Disaster. The show has not and will not be the same without Derek. He is the handsome knight that every show needs to captivate its' audience. The show is not the same without him. I loved the Tribute with Emily's return and the one with Rossi's wife returning but the ""family"" is not the same without Derek. We want to see the baby grow up and him protecting them constantly at all cost. We know he just married so if that is the problem, give his wife a part on the show. If he wants to be in movies too, give him a dual contract where he can do both. We don't care what you have to do but you MUST get Derek back on Criminal Minds before the new season starts. There are MILLIONS like me out here that feel the same way. Pleaseeeeeee"
242,Such a fantastic show! I can't get enough of the show Wish I could watch it more and more and more everyday My favorite Wooooooooooooo Great My Favorite Show Ever Can't Wait To watch More I'm not sure what to say that I can see it as a result of result is a good very great to have see the same new is so true I that and I have no a to do that it would be have mean two the I pad is and what is I have no a good time with the best of the day before I get a good time with the best of the year and I don't think that I can get it right away with the same thing to say it was the best thing to say it was the best thing to say it is not the same thing as the first half of the year and I don't think that I have a great way of life and the best of luck with your friends to the point of of view where you can at all times and it will was is it that I can see get a new one is the best of luck to all the time I get my money and the other hand is not an
243,"Overall I still love the show. It is reminding me how I still don't like the Rossi character. Not sure if it's because of Montegna or his character, probably both. Came on too brash, took over from day one.Just not the same as with Gideon. He was the analytical one with the even temper. Still miss Paget Brewster/Emily Prentiss. Hewitt has also seemed to have changed the production also. Though even for me sometimes the blood and gore was too much, it still is/was an important part of why the team was in the first place. now it seems too tame by comparison.Now I read Montegna is infusing his personal agenda. That keeps happening they will loose me after 9 plus years."
244,"I love series like this, and Criminal Minds is just so interesting and absorbing. It is very dark and somewhat grim often, but I like that side, it does make the show compelling. I will admit it was a show that started off good, but then got better and better. I love how it is filmed as well, the camera work is innovative, and the locations are always lovely and evocative to watch. The music is very fitting, the main theme is chilling to an extent and the music choices in each episode are appropriate and effective a vast majority of the time. The writing is always intelligent, witty and thought-provoking and the episode ideas are brilliant with moments that are chilling and moving. And of course the characters are wonderful, especially stone-faced Jason Gideon, Spencer and Hotch(as well as Rossi and Prentiss), and they are brought to life brilliantly by a sterling cast, both lead and supporting. Overall, I just love this show, it is true that some episodes are better than others(then again it is like that with most shows), whenever it is on I always watch it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
245,"Criminal Minds is one of the best series i have ever watched. The cases actually make you understand what kind of monsters humans can be. I enjoy watching this show because it isn't so predictable. Often the killer is someone I completely haven't guessed, which makes it a good watch. It's always interesting to see what tricks the profilers use to get inside the mind of the UnSub. This is one of the best crime shows, great acting and you begin to feel for all the characters. The main characters are great. I love Morgan and Garcia, Reid is unique. I have recommended this to friends and recommend to anyone reading this. I really enjoy this show, it is very interesting!!!!"
246,"With the addition of JLH, it might work. Whatever happened to character development. JLH walks into the show and all of a sudden the entire show and most of the scenes seem to be based around her character. And everyone else was background. I have never written anything before, but I had to write this. If the next episode is the same. DIVA! I might not watch anymore. I use to like JLH, but not so much now. I am not a fan of famous actors coming onto a show and taking over.I have watched this show from the very beginning.I have never missed an episode and have watched ever season twice now. Thanks I will most likely keep watching though"
247,"this was at one time in my top 3 favorite shows, but over the last 3 seasons, it has progressively declined. there is not the intensity and complexity that there used to be, and everyone is constantly consoling each other. it's turned very ""brady bunch"" and seems very unrealistic. like everyone has to be comforted and praised all the time like they are dealing with children with emotional problems or something. also, the cheesy corny constant flirting with garcia and morgan has always made me push fast forward. enough already, get a room. it's just lame. i keep watching, hoping it will return to what it once was, but it doesn't appear to be so. i doubt the show will last much longer, and i bet the ratings have declined in the last few years as well. one last point, they have ""dumbed the show down"" like that all of us have to be led around by the nose to be able to figure out what's going on. this used to be such a smart show. maybe they decided their target audience is different that what it used to be. but i say, for the first 3 seasons maybe even 5, there were few shows that were as good as criminal minds. this is no longer the case. its a shame that there is no intelligent TV on anymore. i guess they think everyone's mind has turned to jelly, and maybe they are right."
248,"I love the story line for the Boise school bombing reunion, BUT if you are going to base a story in a town such as Boise Idaho at least do your homework and pick a restaurant that is in the town or at least put a couple of that towns landmarks in the show. It may not ruin the story for others around the country but it does make the show unbelievable to the locals of the area. Just think if you were watching an episode that took place in your home town wouldn't you sit and say hey that high school isn't here and that restaurant isn't here and hey the plants on the street where the mom lives don't grow here. don't you think it would ruin the show for you?"
249,"Duh duh!All of these Criminal Minds, CSI series etc are just mindless drivel.
Can't watch any of them."
250,This show is getting so bad with trying to discredit conspiracy theories and obviously the writers are working for deep state.
251,"Each episode has a great little story about an ""unsub"" but it always gets ruined by the BAU team coming in at the end and the Penolope Garcia character almost makes the show unwatchable."
252,Absolutely love it! Have watched every episode and never get sick of it. Thought it would lose steam once Morgan and Hotch left but nope! Still awesome!!
253,"I use to love this show. But recently it seems to be over crowed with people. I can't explain it, maybe it has something to do with the rotation of characters coming in and out of this show. One bigger question though. I keep seeing episodes of joggers/runners being attached or kiddnapped. You would think with all these people running, that some of them would out run the bad guy and to get away.Don't know if I'll continue following this show."
254,"It's hard to believe that this show - which had gotten tired as hell is actually improving and worth tuning into again.The back drop stories work well - and are actually better than the main theme story lines - Nevertheless I find myself looking forward to this program once again rather than ""well there's nothing else on...""Check it out -Alex Rodriguez adds to the show what Shemar Moore departed with. Paget Brewster hold her own with Hotch's departure. Matthew Gubler please don't leave the program / Kristen you 2 Please forgive me if I have messed up any of your names.THANK-YOU FOR SOME BETTER AND MORE INTERESTING SCRIPTS - YOU HEARD ME SNORING IN MY CHAIR - Good Work!!! All the old crew still awesome. The new crew leaves something to be desired.Keep up the good work -"
255,"This show is really addictive! I think it's the best crime show on television. It has the right amount of action, suspense, and comedy. I love how it can draw you in and keep you guessing. Another thing I liked about this show is how relatable the characters are! You have the tall, serious guy, the young smart guy, the adorable funny one, and a whole bunch of other relatable characters. Not only are the plots great, the people who work on this show are very talented! The actors portray their characters fantastically. The only con I have about this show is that it's not long enough! So, if you're into the dramatic and suspenseful crime shows, I totally recommend Criminal Minds."
256,"When I first started this show, I didn't really expect to like it so much because I wasn't into the whole crime solving shows. This show, however, blew my mind. It held the right amount of action, mystery, and humor. I loved this show because each crime is different. I also love this show because of how much you can relate to the characters. You have the cold and quiet detective, you have the overly smart one, you have the funny one, you have the adorable one, etc. This show is easy to fall in love with! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good crime.Compared to other crime shows, I believe this one is definitely the best. The only con about this show is that it's not long enough!"
257,"What can I say? How to even start? Definitely one of the best series I've ever watched and I watched a lot of them, believe me. I maybe can't afford it and say that this is the best series i ever watched, but I can definitely afford myself to say that this is the best crime series ever filmed. I literally watched the series, all 10 seasons in perhaps a month or two. I just couldn't keep away from them. Chemistry between the characters is amazing, and the characters are so well designed that each character is special and mysterious in its own way. Simply delight awaits you from episode to episode. So many trades, so many new fantastic evil characters and stories that will leave you breathless. With this series I laughed and cried. I don't know what words to use and are relevant to describe this phenomenal series and how to even describe this series, because honestly, hand on heart, this series can not be describe in words."
258,Just like all crime shows it's all the same. Get bad guy. Have subplots. Mess up. Create another subplot. More subplots get bad guy. End in cliffhanger. Get bad guy.Same old mumble jumbo.Verdict: you are under arrest for doing this too many times.
259,"They are making the biggest mistake taking this series off the air. They are a family truly a family and it's one of the best tv series made. The reason it's not getting the ratings that they want is because everyone is watching by bingeing it on Netflix. And no wonder, how many commercials do you have on the tv every 10 minutes. On Netflix, each episode is about 43 minutes long. That's almost 10 minutes of those damn commercials. And then there are 10 to 12 of them. No thank you I will miss them and I hope and pray that someone else will pick them up or something else, but I will continue to watch tv on the stations that don't interrupt you every time!"
260,"It's the best crime TV show and one of my favourites. Unlike Elementary or other shows, criminal minds show clearly the reason why murder occurs. This is the only fact that keeps me watching. Well done!"
261,"I have been watching this show, since episode 1 and am really disappointed in this season. I was so glad when they brought Brewster back and I was happy to see her be put in charge because I think it is good to see a female in that role once in a while. I do, however, think she should have been eased into the role. You could tell she did not feel as comfortable in the first few episodes. It had been a while, since she played a role as a detective and she only got that role because Gipson was fired, putting her at odds with all Gipson fans. She was one of the most loved actors on the show, but many fans of the show resented her only because they loved Gipson. I did not care for Gipson to be honest with you. He did not do much on the show, but order people around. Three downfalls this season:1) Affirmative action: Of the new cast members: two are black and one is Puerto Rican (near black). Damon Gupton plays as a psychologist in Bates Motel and that role makes sense for him given his soft voice. He is just not believable on this show. The female does not know how to act in this role. You can tell she is not comfortable in it. The show lost two good characters, so they replaced them with the worst actors they could get. I am guessing whoever is in charge of hiring is black, since I do not see any Asians/South Asians being brought into the mix. This is the reason why ratings are so much better for Hawaii Five 0 in comparison. If you want a mixed racial cast, it has to look real, not forced.2) Spenser Reid. I never cared for this character. He never seemed like a detective to me, but he did not do much in the show, so he did not annoy me as much as this season. Him being jail is just too much. Every episode, they keep showing how pathetic he is as a prisoner, further supporting my opinion that him working in law enforcement is totally unbelievable. He is a ""wimp."" Even jail cannot toughen up his character. The jail segments over the last four episodes are killing the show. I had really hoped they would off his character in the last episode, but no, I will have to endure seeing more jail segments over the coming episodes. In addition, I will have to watch more segments of the team being distressed over his poor treatment in prison. The Alvez visiting Shaw part in last episode was too much! The Hispanic's acting job was laughable. The show is going to down hill, and it isn't because Gipson is gone. It is bad acting, Spenser and3) Bad writing. There is not enough time to build cases because 15-20 minutes of every episode focuses on Reid being in jail, and the team all upset over him getting beat up in prison. It is so annoying. This is a crime drama, not a prison series! The beginning of the last episode was like I was watching a gangster New York movie. It started with gangster rap music and prison. This week, it just got worse. They need to hire new writers for the show to save it, and a new manager that does not exclusively hire actors because of their skin colour, but hires actors because they fit the role and are experienced actors/actresses."
262,"I'm just waiting for the episode where one of them flies an F-22 through downtown Manhattan (between skyscrapers), defuses a nuclear weapon, or builds a rocket to fly to outer space. Has anyone fired a bazooka yet, or drove an M1 Abrams through a building to help capture an ""unsub""? WHY NOT???!Believability is important to me...not just ""entertainment value"". It's a bit of a slap in the face for real criminologists and psychological profilers--this kind of over-dramatization. I can only imagine that they sigh, wonder ""as if"" for a moment, and then change the channel.For those of you that get sucked into this drama, please pull your head out of your ass and wake up--I feel sorry for you. It's sad that so many Americans need our cookie-cutter heroes during evening television to cure the daily minutiae....right?"
263,"I have always been ambivalent about police drama's. Primarily because of the underlying message many of them send. Criminal minds is well cast, if a little corny and at times entertaining. Its also highly formulaic and as is often the case with US based shows of this kind conveniently ignores genuine social problems. The baddies are simply bad. Explained away as simply being rotten people to start with or genetic misfits compelled to follow their flawed biological programming. Larger social issues that contribute heavily to crime such as creeping inequality and entrenched poverty are, from my time watching this show, rarely, if ever mentioned. For this reason I don't rate criminal minds. It comes across as unconvincing and saccharine. It does not accurately reflect the world as it really is but instead offers a one hour placebo that tells the ""haves"" they are protected from the ""have nots""."
264,"Criminal Minds is probably one of the best series I have ever watched. Amazing story line, intense murders, so much more.What I love most about this show is how everything is still believable, how the scenes and their way of thinking aren't too much or don't go overboard.The cast is perfect as well. They are one of the reasons why you get so hooked on the show, too.It's a drama, a thriller, with romance and mystery and a touch of comedy all rolled into one.Really, one of the best shows to watch."
265,"As I have a big interest in true crime books,films and documentaries often crime shows and films have a lot missing for me. I mean I generally enjoy films and shows about catching serial killers (true or fictional) but often they don't really explain the motive of the killer or why his modus operandi (method) is like that, they skip over that part and just catch the killer. Where as Criminal Minds is all about the studying the psychology of the killers and why they do it, which is very interesting and a nice change. A lot of Criminal Minds episodes are clearly based off real serial killers, although they change there names and often locations such as the episode ""Unfinished Business"" is loosely based of Dennis Rader (B.T.K) and they often quote facts about serial killers so it shows the writers are more than likely true crime fans as well.This is one of the better crime shows out there, great acting and you begin to feel for all the characters, I love Gideon from the early series and Reed is just a cool unique character. If you're into true crime this will be right up your street, its about looking into the mind of the killer and working out his next plan of action rather that just turning up to another crime scene dusting for prints which I see to often on TV, yes i know its a important part of investigations but it's nice to see the other side of the investigation which is rarely seen, they do it in films like Manhunter/Red Dragon."
266,"I love the show, you know so much about the characters. You feel for them if they are hurt or upset which it good. The stories are good like why the killer is killing. But like all shows like this its unrealistic. I know a lot about criminal justice and the FBI, I have gone to a youth academy that shows teenagers what its like to be in the FBI and they tell you how much shows like this are not real. I've studied and read much about profilers and one thing is clear they are not like they are in the show. Profilers don't use guns and they don't do all the hardcore things like raid houses. They do help police but they don't really do the tactile things they do in the show, but they are trained to. Also the cases are solves very quickly, I know its an hour show but they could make the episodes over a longer spand of time. Also the team members come up with answers out of the blue. They will randomly think of something and it happens to be right. I love this show but its a lot of action that is not what its really like. But the action does keep people watching. If you know a lot about the FBI and know what they do it will annoy you a bit but I still think the show is good and entertaining"
267,"I LOVE this show, but when I first started watching I didn't know the term ""unsub"", I had to ""google"" it. I think there should be more time dedicated to using the full term & / or explaining it. Also, the fact that when the team is presenting, the alternating of partners is very contrived. Hotchner speaks, then Morgan, then Prentice, etc. ~ very fake & not at all like real FBI workings.Otherwise, I'm almost addicted to this show. Except for the fact that the Thomas Gibson character, whom I first enjoyed as 'Greg' in ""Dharma & Greg"", is entirely too serious. Smile, already,. Or at least, relax those brow muscles - no one should be so serious."
268,"Although I am a newbie to this wonderful show (I just started watching it in Jan 2014) I've been able to catch up with the episodes via the many stations that carry it in my area. One of the things I like in particular, is the fact that the audience learns something about each character as the show progresses. I've watched many programs in this genre, CSI, Law and Order Criminal Intent, NCIS, as well as Cold Case, however, although we get a glimpse of the background of the main characters, none is as in depth as CM. Last night I watched the episode where Reid discloses his nightmares to Morgan, he feels betrayed when Morgan tells him Gideon and Hotch know about Reid's nightmares. Later in the show, both Hotch and Gideon discuss the fact that no one could do their job without having nightmares. The personal lives of the agents make the characters come alive, and seem more realistic,as when the team is facing down the young man, Owen, and Reid talks about his own experiences being bullied, and therefore the audience can empathize with the unsub, even though he will be arrested. The sociological and psychological aspect of the program gives the audience an insight into why an unsub became the became a criminal. The history of the team becomes a subplot in the main story line, and that makes the show more interesting and well rounded. In some cases, as in the story about Owen, it also serves as a warning for people who ignore bullying (a lot of kids go through that, it's part of growing up) mental illness (we don't believe in that big city psychology stuff) child abuse (we mind our own business around here), and so on. One thing that disappointed me, was killing off Reid's girlfriend, he has had so much tragedy in his life, would it hurt to let him have some happiness? I'd also like to see some mention of Morgan dealing with his sex abuse issues; I think it is important for males especially to see the value of therapy or even a support group. As was disclosed in the episode about Buford, ignoring trauma can have devastating effects. I do find Garcia's sexual banter with Morgan annoying, and quite frankly a bit offensive. The writers should always have her assume that when she is talking to Morgan in the field that she is on a speaker, as per the situation when Strauss was with the team, and she said, ""talk dirty to me"" It's gets a bit nauseating after awhile, and I wonder if the ""instigator"" of the sexual innuendo was a man, if he wouldn't have been reported for that."
269,"Honestly I've watched CM for years, it's always got a different twist and the stories are amazing. The 100th and 200th has me on the edge of my seat, and the acting to me is first class. Although when Paget left I never really found it the same but continued to watch hoping to warm to the new character. That was almost impossible so I hardly watched any of season 8, although I watched mostly every episode in season 9 because of the 200th episode airing and Pagets brief return. I was really glad at the way they brought her back, and it really showed the relationships between Emily and he rest of the team. Jeanne left at the end of season 9 so I am hoping that I'll enjoy it again, Jennifer Love Hewitt is said to be joining the BAU and after seeing her guest star in SVU and on the Client List I'm really looking forward to season 10, hopefully CM will continue to impress us and we'll see them celebrate the 300th episode."
270,Criminal minds is one of my favourite crime drama shows. All the cases are really unique and interesting and I never feel like they are running out of ideas. Each character plays their role perfectly and even though they are all different they all fit well together and it creates a realistic bond/relationship. My favourite character is Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler). He is just so adorable and naive yet incredibly intelligent and intuitive. But all the cast is great.I may personally love crime shows but Criminal Minds is a more accessible show for the masses. It's great that a broad audience can experience the excitement that a crime drama can create without feeling overwhelmed with too much focus on procedure.
271,"I love Criminal Minds. The show has always got original plots, and always has you at the edge of you seat with new unsubs (unknown subject), on each episode, and sometimes returning unsubs that come for revenge! The best thing about it is, that it's not repetitive where they fight a new unsub every time, they also go on about the special agents' personal lives, bringing out the dramatic bits of the show. Getting us closer to the characters, who are amazing and they can really grow on you. They have the most talented cast playing the current main roles. The gruesome and exciting scenes, really has your adrenaline going. With really great special effects, helping the scenes look more realistic. Which is another brilliant thing about the show. Nothing is fake, everything that goes on the show, are things that can happen to people in real life! Then the crazy twists, really get you thinking.... ""Did they catch him?"" ""Did she survive?"". Criminal Minds, in my opinion, is the best TV series ever made, and I recommend this show to everyone!"
272,"I have loved this series since it started and it's just gotten better with time. The characters are whole people, they bring their private lives and past experiences into their work and this makes them relatable. They aren't detached and objective about everything so you get drawn into the cases with them. This series is very different from the other crime dramas because while they look at the crime itself and physical evidence with a focus on getting a conviction at trial, the BAU look at who the criminal is and aim to prevent there being more victims. You may never know the out come of the trial or even what happens after the arrest is made, but you know who committed the crime and sometimes you might even find out why.The only small criticism I have is that having watched 6 series back to back, the American misunderstanding of English killers is really beginning to irritate. For example, talking about the Krays as a killing team in comparison with gang related violence, the Kray twins where the heads of a London gang, therefore the crimes they committed were gang related. And labeling Jack the Ripper as a sexual sadist when most of the profile doesn't fit the facts of the Ripper case. I realise this is past pedantic considering the length of the series and the general factual accuracy, but as a Brit I feel that if they are going to use British cases as examples they should research them properly."
273,"Criminal Minds is one of the best procedural crime shows on TV. It's mostly self contained episodes without a serial element to the show which normally isn't my favorite way to do a drama type of show but it works great here. The show is about the FBI BAU(Behavorial Analysis Unit), in other words they investigate cases involving serial killers only. They're not investigating just simple murderers who only commit murder once out of a moment of rage, but people whose very nature makes them want to kill repeatedly. The team goes all over the country with the help of local law enforcement trying to hunt down these predators. The show has a great cast headlined by Thomas Gibson and Joe Mantegna."
274,"Pilot episode is a shocker and throws you into the world of the Behavioral Analysis Unit. From there every episode has you on the edge of your seat.By Season 3 I stopped watching it for the profiles of the killers and was hooked on the characters.(But then again I could watch 1 hour of Shemar Moore just staring back at me from the TV and I'd be happy). They are all so well developed you yearn for more hints of their lives outside the FBI.By Season 6 they were the only thing keeping me watching, I don't know what happened to the brilliant writers of Seasons 1-3, they didn't reuse plots. They just stopped explaining the WHY behind the killers behaviors and just focused on the HOWS. I was left at the end of episodes going ""But..why would he do that?"" Now I'm on season 7 and I have to say I'm VERY happy. Seems the writers woke back up. The plots are just as good as the report of the team and the characters side stories now. I'm back to being hooked.All and all a great show, brings a COMPLETELY different view to the regular cop shows. I love the twists, the facts, how they breakdown the case by studying just the killers behaviors.GOOD SHOW. Worth the watch....Did I mention Shemar Moore?"
275,"I've never had a favourite TV show or movie or even a favourite band. I've always been one of those people to have a 'favourite right now' show/movie/band. But this has converted me! I now have an all time favourite show! I randomly watched an episode a couple years ago while trying to kill an hr, and instantly got hooked. I went right out and bought the previous seasons and watched every episode back to back until I was caught up. From the amazing characters like Garcia and Reed, to the thrilling story lines that get you thinking, this show is incredible. It drags you in and won't let go. The best characters in my opinion are Garcia (because she's so talented and unique, and just has her own style and way of doing things). And Dr. Reed, I just love his quirkiness and he's like the little brother... I of course have a soft spot for JJ and Hotch as well. Overall, everyone should watch this show :)"
276,"I've been watching CM since i believe Summer of 09. One day I was just channel surfing and I stopped when I saw this cut guy on the screen. It was of course Reid who I saw. It was the end scene of Conflicted, with Reid and Morgan on the roof.Ever since that day I have watched CM. I own almost all the seasons. I'm in the process of getting season 7.I have a favorite episode for every season. But my all time favorite episode is, Season Five Episode One, Nameless Faceless. I just love Reid in this episode. He's so brave.My least favorite would have to be Revelations. I can't stand the torture Reid is out through. It's so painful to watch. I force myself to watch it every time it's on in attempt to not cringe at what's going on. But I fail each time.I write a lot if fanfiction about CM. https:// m.fanfiction.net/u/4359991 this is the link to my stories is you are interested in reading them. All of them are Reid ones though. He's the only character I write about"
277,"Im a massive fan of Criminal minds. Ever since it came on TV, i've watched it. I've never missed an episode. I love how the characters at the start that I didn't like left. Like the girl before Emily - she just wasn't suited for the role. And Gideon. I didn't like him. And then Rossi and Emily came in. I loved Rossi right from the start, he fitted in better. And Emily is okay. Also its really good because the cast has had no major changes like other shows. And the cast look like their best friends off set, which is really good to see Criminal Minds also i for a little comedy. Like with Spencer not knowing what Twilight is. Another reason why i love this show is that how they go about finding the killers. Its like real life."
278,"I love this show, and Iam so glad that they kept it. I really fought to keep it,I like the cast a lot. My favorite character is Reid, because he reminds me of myself. His life is a lot like mine in many ways. His torment is a lot like mine, from his mother's madness to not knowing if he will end up like her; going mad. That is my mom's take on the hit suspense drama! Mine is , I too love this show . It is intense, suspenseful and it shows the ugliness of human nature. And inhumanity in this world! And in a way I can relate to his character in different aspects. Of his life, all and all this is what good drama is all about. Drama, the human elements, suspense . Though due to content and violence this show is not for everyone! But if you love a crime show this is a must see!"
279,"The person above should return to the third grade and get his diploma before attempting to write anything further. I'm just glad the show is not written by the likes of that person! Proof read your stuff, dude! Anyhoo, just because the clown above can't spell or compose worth a hoot don't let that stop you from tuning in. The only thing which will deter some people from watching in the future would be the absence of Lola Glaudini or ""Elle"". Guess she couldn't stand the smog in Los Angeles any more and split back to NY. Don't know it that is a winning or loosing proposition for her but she will definitely be missed by this viewer in particular. Oh well, think the show will survive but it will surely be a loss without her."
280,"This series is so close to the real thing, The main characters are great. We all love Garcia, JJ is amazing, Reid is unique, Gideon is intense as is Hutchner, I love them all. The story lines are excellent, I have read quite a lot of true crime and the writer is doing an excellent job creating these serial killers. I have series linked this show which I do not do often. There are not too many series that are worth watching every week but this one is. I actually cried when Reid's girlfriend was shot. We all like some real in amongst the fiction and the writer and actors have manged to do this extremely well. I never write reviews, this is a first, so well done and keep up the suspense."
281,"No telling where the neo Nazi influence of this sick TV series is from creator Davis or star Mantegna, but it can't be denied. It's strictly preaching hate and neo Nazi ideology. All that I've ever seen on this TV show is the relentless butchering of young beautiful women with dark hair, eyes, and skin. It's completely depressing to the men who aren't totally brainwashed already by the neo Nazi Hollywood agenda, though no doubt the women love to see the preaching of wiping out the competition.
One would think the dialog itself would turn people off. Like all the other such shows, the dialog is ""unnatural"", poorly written, and the actors and actresses speak way too fast to possibly be understood, let alone natural. It is literally impossible to understand people speaking that fast. The show relies totally on closed caption, and there one can plainly see the poor writing of dialog.
This is no surprise. The poor writers were long ago inducted into the highest positions in Hollywood, and now they are the ""judges"", so only poor writing of dialog makes the first cut to begin with. Creativity, talent, and inspiration go totally out the window due to the jealousy of the idiots in the board rooms.
There is nothing credible about the show, and to top off the horrible dialog and horrible delivery, there is the horrible ""contrivance"" of plot to fit what the feeble minded people involved want to preach. It's all terribly contrived to fit their narrow scope. You cannot possibly watch this without groaning, unless you are on the same drugs that the cast and writers are on.
Hard to get worse than this, and in 20 years, when the idiots involved in this crap are venerated as ""experts"", they'll continue to advance more lack of talent, more lack of inspiration, and more lack of excitement. One would think their dullness and relentless self righteousness in their dullness would end their careers, but the emperors have no clothes, and these emperors are ugly."
282,"Plz do give subtitles, for more better understanding..."
283,Best show I have ever watched. there is lot's of crime and mystery but also lots of drama with the characters. all the characters are amazing. so many interesting crimes too. 100% recommend to anyone.
284,"What the hell happened to this show ?.
One or two good episodes in each over long seasons.
A private Jet zooming these agents at a moments notice.
A tech savy computer whizz solving cases in seconds,with only pressing the same 6 keys on the keyboard.
A kid Genius who is basically Colombo, Sherlock Holmes and every sleuth under the sun ,speakung so quuckly he sounds like a robot.
Oh, at 32 minutes in EVERY episode no matter the case ,is solved !!! Time it.
The blood special make up effects are made with brightest raspberry jam ever made.
The older more experienced actors make this watchable.
Better shows out there..oh and wait till they arrive in Police Dept..and give their theories to cops...so funny.
2 or 3 of the main cast ,cant or wont smile no matter what.
No way im trying to get through to season 15 or whatever."
285,"Seriously, Hollywood has no ideas how to portray criminal profiling in a realistic sense. As a young adult this show is full of BS, groundless analysis that purely based on assumptions as to fit the average running time of each episode. Yes it is entertaining, thats why I laugh a lot at how unrealistic the investigation process is. Why don't make it more epic? At least epic genre adds more spices to the show."
286,"I like this show so much, I watch 12 seasons in a half year !
But what happened to season13? every thing is changed and it only feels like an action film instead of CRIMINAL MINDS."
287,"Is you set aside the sexual harassment from Garcia it's a terrific dynamic, with great characters and some weird and wonderful plots. Highly recommended."
288,"Criminal Minds is, by far, the best crime show made. The chemistry between the characters and actors is enjoyable and makes the show better than others in that sense. Of course if criminal profiling isn't interesting to you then you won't like the show as it's more focused on that than the action aspect of being an FBI agent."
289,I've lived watching this through the years and still watch it on reruns
290,If you like crime shows you'll probably enjoy this one for its darker grittier subject matter.However the show is incredibly formulaic so once you've seen an episode you've pretty much seen them all.
291,I like sweet girl. She is really cool. so cute and interesting. I love her
292,FBI catch serial muddier. That is only what they do and it is very boring. Too many violence scene and that don't made me feel fun.
293,"One of the best seasons of all. I've watched them all at least 5 times. Series finale was very well done. Everyone had a place to go, no unanswered questions. I will miss this show."
294,Had a good run for 6 seasons after that it became all of the same. So predictable. Boring cases.
295,"In the episode this is based on, Scott McCarty was a screw-up in the LDSK episode. He was being 'punished' when he was shot. Loud mouthed, popping off with insults and bad jokes during the briefings and phoning reporters giving out information but in this one he's a dedicated and honored police officer? NOT hardly. Just to make sure, I was not getting this wrong I pulled out my DVD and watched it again. YOU NEED TO TRY HARDER>"
296,This has been THE BEST show on TV for the past 15 years in my opinion!
297,"My husband and I love Criminal Minds except when we watch any episode where they reference Correctional Officers as ""Prison Guards"". My husband is a Correctional Officer / Peace Officer and any CO or Law Enforcement Officer should know that they are no longer referred to as Prison Guards.My wish is that one day all criminal shows will learn, realize and change the way the shows are written. Present Correctional Officers as they truly are and not how they are thought to be. When someone is surrounded by 200 murderers daily without arms they are not simply ""Prison Guards""."
298,"💗 Love this show, love most of the characters, past and present. Will miss the series when it finally ends... Love Dr Reid, love J.J., love Garcia, love Prentice, loved Hotch, loved Morgan, love Alvez, and LOVE my main man, the gorgeous David Rossi... Fanbloodytastic cast, fantastic series. Not a dud episode or season yet. This show along with my Law n Order svu, and my Chicago fire, med & p.d will ALWAYS be my ultimate ""go back to"" shows. Never gets old, never get sick of 'em. Just wish they would keep 'em comin... 💔 😭"
299,"Dr. Spencer Reid is simply too incredible to be true: a genius, sure enough, but completely devoid of social competence and totally lacks the ability to interact with others. Yet, he is sent to crime scenes to interview victims and gets to talk to family members of crime victims. I hope that, IRL, nobody like him would be used on the field (if recruited by the FBi at all, that is) but remain locked up in an office analyzing computer files.It's often pointed out that he is a genius, but his skills don't seem very useful in his line of work. Often, he is just enumerating statistics or quoting from books and the other team members have to explain to outsiders what he really means."
300,"One of my favorite characters was El. She was the counterpoint to the rest of the regular cast. She was known for going rogue. Her actions were met with proper disdain when she shot a rapist, thus the morality and integrity of the plot line remained intact. Bring me back an ""El."""
301,It is really good and I really enjoy the show. However there are many episodes which I recommend not showing to children or anyone without a strong stomach.
302,"This is my favorite show of ALL time, with the original characters. But then Kate arrived, aka Jennifer Lawrence and it went all downhill from there. She had no business in this soap/serie, ofcourse I will always hope they will pick Criminal Minds back up, with new brilliant episodes. But then, please leave Jennifer out of it."
303,"Love the show, it's my personal favourite, yes some crew left the show, was disappointing, but I still loved the show. Sorry to hear its ending"
304,Paget Brewster has the most amazing nose in all of tv.
305,"Such a great show and it got even better after Hotchner left. No offense to the actor I just really hated the character he played.
I do with Morgan would come back but it's still great and I wish it wasn't ending"
306,"Like many long-running shows, it has its ups and downs and tends to be formulaic. Having said that, there are many memorable characters and you get invested in them while also watching them deal with the worst of the worst. I hung in there for 10 seasons before losing interest."
307,"Really interesting and a great cast, been watching it for years"
308,"This is my favorite show
Love new episodes
And can watch repeats too
Hope another network picks this show up been watching since the beginning!!!!"
309,"Since its 15th season is confirmed to be ""CM""'s last, I figured I'd finally write a review.
I'll admit first, I was never really one for crime shows, until I saw this show. They're so violent and gritty, they never appealed to me. But when my sister first turned me on to ""Criminal Minds"", well, I had to eat my words. Crime and cop shows aren't all ugly and terrible: they can sometimes be fascinating. (Just like when I suddenly became a Grey's Anatomy person after years of avoiding medical shows...)
Yes, yes, and yes, this show is very dark, gritty, and violent; but the earlier to middle seasons, at least, weren't so cookie-cutter as See bad guy, Catch bad guy, Roll credits. No, because these people, elite members of the BAU, are trained to work out the psychology of these bad guys. What makes them tick?What's their trigger? When will they strike again? In my personal opinion, the show peaked between seasons 1 to 6. (even though I'm not a fan of Mandy Patinkin) Maybe it helps that I've long been interested in atypical psychology, and criminal dynamics, but these seasons actually featured the BAU trying to crack the cases using psychological profiling, which is, to me, the reason to watch. Anyone can see a bad guy, catch a bad guy, and roll the credits, but isn't it kind of more interesting to go deeper than that?
For some reason, (mainly contract disputes, and salary negotiations) after about season 7, the main cast is constantly shaken up and changed around, which causes a loss of chemistry between the actors. Sadly, it shows. And worse, just as the fans begin to adjust to the new actors/characters, they seem to be yanked: disappointing. Hand in hand with this, is a major change in writing, apparently, since the current episodes feature almost no criminal profiling: what should continue to be the highlight of a show called ""Criminal Minds"". It's now definitely more of a cookie-cutter See bad guy, Catch bad guy, Roll credits, which is frankly sad, especially when this show started out as so much more.CBS really shot themselves in the foot with all the actor/actress shakeups and departures. But at its core, ""CM"" is a pretty solid and unique show considering its competitors."
310,I love the psychological aspect of the series. The characters are believable and likeable.
311,Really amazing love all the characters it's a great show
312,"I think this is great TV - thoughtful, challenging and unique"
313,Love the cast and the show. I hope it never ends!!
314,"This is my favorite show! I heard there's a chance of it ending after season 14, so I decided to give it a rating to boost its chances of continuing. This is an amazing show. It brought me and my friends closer together after bonding over the show. I really hope that it's not canceled. This show is a lifesaver"
315,"This is one of my favorite show! It unique and interesting yet dark. I couldn't help to watch it and think about our real life that how can we do more to protect our children ! What I really don't understand is the producer ... they have such a good team there , why do they always try to break it..."
316,"These two episodes were awful , and a horrible misuse and chop-up of Leonard Cohen songs. Yuck."
317,I've started watching season 4 but david rossi character seems to think he's in charge is annoying as he only came in at season 3. I hope he's not getting paid more than the others even if he is first billed in credits. Have the writers heard of plagiarism as some episodes are familar from movies/tv shows.
318,"Then you realize that their tried and true algorithm for success gets a bit drab...you can actually call who loves and dies...when they cut to what scene....it's well done....but it's time to hang up the hat. Fantastic run, please stop now."
319,"Diving into Part 2 of Hardcore Henry what UK has filmmed or came by earlier 2000' this serial 2 is not ultimate. Capitol Records and Universal direct, too amazed over praise is not done yet, many sees the rest has to be in to continue over the hood story of Hollywood criminal minds, suspenseful and great. Performances Chris Angel and his magic, a camera man on his face kills people by shoot guns, arrives to Eric house, and expose its inside! Cliche lets us see fireborn trees, too awful direction not for entertine."
320,"Let me start off by saying that i am only on season four, so i cannot thoroughly rate the show. however, i want to say that i think it's a good show for entertainment. yes, it's not realistic in many ways, but once you get over that, the show is intense in all the good ways, has interesting enough characters. i see so many reviews complaining about how things some of the characters do could never happen. this can be slightly annoying at times, but it's a TV show, just enjoy it! 9/10"
321,"The FBI's BAU unit started in the basement after Hoover left and new thinking was needed to bring it into the 21st century (see Mind Hunters / Netflix) as this show with its cast has been at the forefront of my viewing since its inception. The cast chemistry has always been important to the shows success. That alone explains why the two spin off shows didn't pull through the ratings quagmire. However I must express that the cast changes these last 2/3 seasons is somewhat disturbing. Mandy Potemkin we understand, he didn't want to give criminals any ideas, although his headlining role on Homeland is similar if you ask me. The new cast of Tyler, Rodriguez from CSI Miami and Henney from the Criminal minds: Beyond Boarders, just doesn't work for me. Derek-Shemar Moore is Sorely missed as is mainstay Thomas Gibson as Hotchner but bringing back Paget Brewster was a smart move to steady the overwhelming changes. The show itself has handled the crimes and each other admirably over the years and has brought issues to the forefront that people just don't want to recognize is out there. Whether we're hearing about it more as a result of social medial is a point unto itself, the fact is that this show has always confronted these crimes in a logical format with a trust-able cast presentation that we all came to ""trust"" and that chemistry has been damaged by the three new cast members. My personal viewership has dropped since 2011 and the dismissal of Thomas Gibson (Hotch) and then Shemar Moore (Derek) Tyler is not believable to me and I didn't want nor need a CSI injection. While Henney was good on Criminal minds Beyond Boarders."
322,"Best known (at least to a number of older generations), as Inigo Montoya in the cult comedy classic 'The Princess Bride', Mandy Patinkin is as progressive as they come in the movie business, and has long been an addict of the Sunset Blvd., liberal Kool-Aid for decades. However, he is & remains to be an exceptional actor, and admittedly has been, instrumental in mutually securing a solid foundation for Criminal Minds' initial launch in '05, as well as, its record-breaking longevity that, few TV Series contributors, ever even imagine (much less experience).Patinkin is joined by a cast of fine actors (many new) that, seem to possess that rarest of rare dynamics that, all actors and directors look for in every film production, in that, there is a great deal of chemistry between all the casts members & it seems to be a two-way street for each actor complimenting the other.Criminal Minds is essentially a movie in a bottle (just add water), and in many cases, this series is able to pull off in approximately 50 minutes, what many full blown major motion pictures fail to accomplish, when provided 120-minute + film time.If there is only one word of caution about watching this series, its to those that have yet to invest in watching a single episode, as its important to note that, this is the type of TV series that will likely appeal to easily addicted binge-watchers (and there is over a decade of multiple episodes to consume - don't overdose the first week)."
323,"Yes, there are so many, but this one is the Sheldon Cooper approach to Drama-Crime-Mystery police shows.What I like about this show is how you relate to all the characters, the entire BAU and the criminal they are chasing. The entire BAU ensemble has a nice mix-up of characters that work very well together and have great chemistry.I'm happy this series keeps getting renewed season after season and I hope it stays on air for a long time.It's a 9/10 form me!"
324,"I have only watched this programme from about the beginning of season 4 (it is now nearing the end of season 6). I enjoy MOST episodes of the programme. When I say most I mean I cannot get over the fact that VIRTUALLY every episode that I have seen has at least ONE boy somewhere during it. If he is not part of the story line, he is a character in the background or, in a picture. I find this a bit weird as if someone who is connected with this programme has an obsessive perversion to little boys. I would have thought a programme that deals with so much violence would keep the roles of children to the very minimal with only the odd episode having an appearance."
