0,"Sorry for my English, I come from non english speaking country.When someone looks guilty-he/she frequently is.
I liked the ending....it is simple, obvious but in life it often is. The series shows how we often try to find complex answers and put things on a higher lever, when they are often more simple.
I agree that many things were not explained, but I dont mind thar so much. The feeling of unsertainty and swiching to another suspect in every episode was interestig journey for me.
Im surprised when I see so many dissapointed reviews. What did you want-Henry to be a killer?
I think Johnatan being the murderer is somehow unexpected, he was in some way the only one we didnt suspect from episode 2.
What I like the most about the author of the series in capability to creat such atmosphere of hollowness in wealthy and perfect life. From the episode 1, we see the perfect family, but somehing is off...we can feel it.I dont know...for me the series is good. Not the best I saw, but still pretty good.
The cast is also amazing, and so is camera, light, music(so and so), editing...I would recommend it, definitelly"
1,"So much potential but the last episode sucked, turns into a jumbled mess of bad acting, bad writing and just bad. So many ""twists"" that mean nothing so many ""clues"" that go nowhere...what a disappointment..."
2,Really enjoyed the series thought Hugh Grant's performance was fantastic but so disappointed in the ending and some of the stuff that happened in the last 10 minutes. Was totally hoping for a twist but just a big anti-climax in the end. Such a shame could've been so many different scenarios that could've played out
3,"At the end of the most recent episode, ""Do No Harm"", police show Kidman camera footage of her near the crime scene on the night of the murder. She says, ""So I was out for a walk, I talk walks, I didn't even know where she lived."" Actually, the murdered woman mentioned to Kidman at the auction party that she lived in Harlem. Kidman doesn't live in Harlem, so why would she be caught walking there?"
4,Very shallow and boring. The only quality the show could provide was to picture a real narcissistic person. It had enormous potential with good side characters like the grandpa or the friend woman but it was like a big colourful cake which looks tempting but when you taste it turns out how bad it is inside.
5,"Because we can get easily bored in a Covid world, we can find ourselves devoting 6 hours to bad writing and all kinds of unrealistic twists and turns just to see who did it. This was painful and would have been much more tolerable to wait for 6 weeks and then binge watch the whole thing, with lots of fast forwarding. I agree with most of the low rated reviews that provided details, especially about episode 6."
6,"HBO yet again delivers with this suprisingly thrilling and emotionally hard-hitting miniseries.It has the typical matte and muted color scheme of an HBO drama, but that works rather well considering this world and story is far from colorful. A good score from unknowns Sacha and Evgueni Galperine also enhances the ominous and depressive mood of the 6 episodes. Acting performances, while mostly very one-note, are actually quite good, with Hugh Grant's playful tongue in cheek-humor and painfully delivered sadness being the standout. Nicole Kidman, however, is a bit dissapointing as the lead, as she doesn't seem capable of delivering much facial emotion outside of her eyes and slight twitches in bodily language. Donald Sunderland has a massive screen presence but the performance is, as I've said, very one-note (this, of course being an issue on the writing side only).Speaking of writing, in terms of a murder mystery, the show never really delivers any mystery until the last two episodes. The drama is well-written and compelling but it falls flat as a crime thriller. However, one has to give them the success of the ending, which instills a suprising amount of emotion and uncertainty regarding the outcome. 'All in all, a good watch. HBO continues to deliver with this type of show, and while not without its faults, it brings some serious entertainment."
7,"Obviously I'm in the minority here, but this show is as dull as lead. Starting with the first episode, so much feels so amateurish, like the lady guests all taking a turn at a line at the party. And there is just so much useless footage, with a staggering amount of cutaways (I don't need to see any more cityscapes or puddle reflections, thanks) and even useless scenes, like Grace fainting and going to the hospital. Ten minutes wasted right there. I usually adore Nicole Kidman, but she has about three expressions these days that are so odd that I can actually do an impersonation of them with my friends, who also hate this show. In fact, we're actually enjoying how much we hate it.I know David Kelly wrote it, which shocked me as he also wrote Big Little Lies (we liked season one, not season two), but this series feels more like one of his shows from the '90s, written as tame storylines with commercial breaks in mind. The story is just dumb, I don't care about any of the characters, and the whole thing feels wooden. And there have been more than a few scenes where I was embarrassed for Hugh Grant as he attempts to cry. And no, that's not his character faking a cry. That's him trying to emote. Ugh... just cringeworthy. The entire thing.After watching this on the heels of a three-season binge of Penny Dreadful (one of the best shows I've ever seen), the contrast between riveting writing and the phoned-in kind is keenly apparent after watching The Undoing."
8,"What a terrible miniseries. I started watching it because I'm a fan of Hugh Grant but it was so bad that it was painful to watch until the end. The writing was so lame and full of clich√©s. We spent 6 long hours watching it and waiting for an interesting development but instead we get an obvious one. The last episode seemed like it was written in 15 minutes and even the writer thought it was to ""meh"" and decided to add that final incredibly long annoying and unnecessary scene. It's amazing that I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, probably only the victim's son, Miguel. All the others were so badly developed and uninteresting only trying to look like suspects to keep our interest. And why, oh why all the actors performed as if they had just got their degree from the Joye Tribbiani acting course?"
9,"The Undoing has shown at last that Hugh Grant is not a one trick pony . He shed his English foppish acting style and turned in a really good performance .Helped by a strong cast ,it made compelling viewing. I hope Hugh continues down this path . The Undoing is well worth binge watching . Enjoy Bruce"
10,"What a great show with some fantastic twists already and superstar acting. However following Nicole Kidmans most recent unnecessary self imposed changes to her face it makes it difficult to know is she acting , is she sad , happy , frightened .... otherwise very good show"
11,"So much garbage out there, but The Undoing in quality. Well made , well acted and a gripping story line. We need more quality shows like this HBO."
12,"Most viewers classify this show as a whodunnit murder mystery. But it is not. It is a psychological exploration of the self.Based on the evidence, it was clear who committed the crime but what was lacking was whydunnit, the specific motive. And this is why there were so many speculations about possible suspects, when in fact, one person is on trial. So the question is: is he guilty or not? The real question is actually: why would you acquit him. And this shows how the process of doubt and people's perceptual biases work. The more you think about it, the more complex and even unrealistic solutions come to mind. Is the straightforward explanation not believable, is it too obvious? People seem to think that their first instinct is wrong and they end up unknowing/overlooking what they should have all along. It is one thing to be inquisitive but another to see what you want to see. And most wanted to see someone else commiting the crime. Why?"
13,"This tv drama could have been enjoyable but once again Hollywood produced an incredibly unrealistic piece of garbage.The show was moving along nicely when the following key moments made me want to vomit incredibly without the assistance of any alcohol.I would like to ask executive producer Nicole Kidman and the like just how realistic is it to think:1/ Nicole has found out her husband has been cheating on her & subsequently asks her rich father to bail him out for 2.50million2/ Nicole's father agrees to bail him out for 2.5m knowing full well he has cheated on his daughter (what an incredible generous and forgiving family they are)
3/ on the final day of the court case, the husband flees with son in car and fails to appear in court at which point, Nicole and dad casually get into his private helicopter (which is apparently just on standby with a pilot) and amazingly finds his car from the air and follow its journey to a bridge.4/ Even more amazing is the helicopter just casually lands near a bridge on a busy metropolitan day and Nicole runs onto the bridge and saves her son before casually boarding back onto the helicopter.And finally a note to myself, never watch any more tv shows made by any of the producers of this show."
14,"The first episode of this installment has much of what a person will want in a murder mystery: suspense, intrigue, eroticism, and classic ""who done it."" Nicole Kidman is an underrated performer, and she does not disappoint is this first episode. Her genuine display of humility, kindness, sincerity, and appropriate assertiveness are all characterized. It's worth a look."
15,"By now everyone knows by default description that this is a murder mystery 'whodunit' crime thriller. It can always be a very tricky genre if the writing is sloppy, and leaves room for one to predict who the killer is by having below average intelligence.The Undoing is certainly not one of those mediocre murder mysteries. The twists are done subtle but very well, that when a episode ends your brain refuses to accept that you have to wait a week for the next episode.The only negative thing about this show is that you can't unwatch it. Not knowing is what makes it so gripping. Don't think it would have the same impact if you watched it for a second time.Casting couldn't have been better though. Hugh Grant was an excellent choice as he had a real life infidelity-public/arrest and divorce way back, it made his cute puppy eyes go bad boy overnight. So glad he is back in the game, I like him much more now that he is older. He appears less forced and more genuine than he did back in the romcom 90's.Nicole Kidman is annoyingly brilliant as always, even her singing the opening song adds great atmosphere to a superb high quality and well executed show. Lily Rabe is one hell of an actress since her American Horror Story days. Perfect supporting lead alongside Kidman with great chemistry.All and all brilliant! We need more shows like this HBO!"
16,"It's been a long time since I last watched a show that kept me on the edge of my seat like this. Absolutely brilliant acting from every single one, great writing. I'm so amazed by Noah Jupe, Henry, his acting was so captivating and believable. The show manages to create a certain atmosphere - the music, pictures, the way it uses the city, New York. I love how I couldn't figure out who did it, and watched the finale all nervous and sweaty üòÖ I'm definitely going to rewatch this!"
17,"The perfect mix of interesting characters, thrilling plot and good ol' escapism. Perfect for binging when we all need to stay in. Loved Nicole and Hugh...
As a costume nerd ... could I get one of Nicole's coats please? Stunning"
18,"I didn't have high hopes for this series.
But the high level of acting by Hugh and Nicole really sold this for me!
I love Hugh's personality coming out as an actor. His dry wit and sarcasm as he has in other films. Totally himself.
Great viewing."
19,Good cast good story i love everything as much as nicole kidman loves long coats
20,"Nicole Kidman has clearly had cosmetic work done on her lips because she now has that Joker look where her lip line extends when her face is in rest mode. In episode 2 she appears to be shocked at certain revelations, she huffs, and her cosmetic work makes her features appear frozen. At first I thought she was just a bad actress but I'm now convinced she's the murderer."
21,"I know I'm out on a limb here, but I thought this series totally contrived, with poor acting and unlike (from reviews) most people didn't captivate me at all. I really hoped it would improve, but it didn't. I find Nicole Kidman very unconvincing in just about everything she does, with the exemption of Paddington."
22,There is so much drama based on so little script. The story is contrived that some the stupidly of the written characters made the undoing unwatchable.
23,"I've enjoyed Huge Grants silly films, but it's nice to see him playing a part that is polar opposite of anything that he has done before. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place, Ford v Ferrari, Wonder) is a remarkable actor and we will be seeing a lot more work from him in the future. Nicole Kidman can play all character types. She is brilliant. Edgar Ramirez is beautiful and brilliant. I've never seen Matilda De Angelis before and I am certain we will be seeing a lot more of her beautiful acting. Norma Dumezweni is a Force! Incredible! Beautiful! Now who do I think killed Elena.... one of my favorite actors of all time.... Donald Sutherland. We will all see next week if I am right."
24,"I must admit I was wrapped in the first episode and was looking forward to what appeared to be a well made and acted series. But the 2nd episode is probably more likely how it is going to go from here and I won't be watching.The second episode is full of cliches, inane expressions close ups of eyes and twitching mouths and other odd camera angles and the last scene with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant is so fanciful, melodramatic that bad overacting just makes it almost comical.What a pity!"
25,"I'm on the 5th episode now. I had been wanting to review at the end but had to write my thoughts.This is such good television. Every one is on the edge from Kidman, to Grant, and Sutherland and the preternaturally gifted Noah Jupe. I've never seen a better performance from Hugh Grant.The story winds around the secrets that unravel slowly, deliberately. The tension is real and unflinchingly. But the writing is the true star here. Kelley certainly knows how to put a series together, but this feels like new ground for him. He does a great job of keeping everyone guessing.I don't know who did it. I have my suspicions. It sure is fun watching them play out!"
26,"Great cast, plot, directing make for entertaining watch"
27,"Such a beautiful charming New York drama, very well made! The acting is impeccable seems to be about a committee, therapy, crime, and business. Nicole Kidman, Lily Rabe, Hugh Grant, and Edgar Ramirez are excellent! I hope others enjoy it as much as I am, the pilot was very promising."
28,"Didn't read the book, but wasn't impressed by this. Rich people acting haughty, nothing new. The ending was a disappointment, no surprises twists or turns. All the evidence points in one direction, you're led along on a wild goose chase to think (maybe?) otherwise, and then find out you were right all along. If you like long drawn out stories with snappy dialogue and no ultimate point other than people can be evil, then this is for you....otherwise choose something else to spend your time on."
29,"This is a must watch. Well written, well acted and an overall winner. Nicole has to find a series where she is not so screwed over by her husband lol"
30,Felt a little rushed in a couple of places but otherwise very watchable.Ruined only by some unintentionally comical moments when Nicole Kidman attempted to convey fear and other emotions on her overly botoxed face.
31,"Well for all those reviews labelling this show 'boring', I disagree. This series is for those who like to use their little grey cells to solve the mystery themselves. It is not 'spoonfed' to the audience. My husband and I rewatched the first three episodes last night to see if we missed clues. As for the reviews not reviewing the show but commenting nastily on Nicole's face: I, personally, see no signs of work done (she has admitted to having tried Botox, but (like me) decided it was not for her. She is a very intelligent actress playing a specific character. It's almost like the naysaying reviewers have forgotten that acting is pretend... It is a very talented cast. The young lad playing Nicole and Hugh's son is on track to a long illustrious career in acting (I hope)."
32,"Great series with Kidman and Grant playing the lead roles.
Well paced and against a great New York City background.
Kidman gives an outstanding performance and the film increases in intensity as the series progresses.
Well recommended"
33,"Who was the other girl that Hugh Grant had an affair with? They mentioned this in passing but never revealed who. I figured it was Nicole Kidman's best friend, the blonde woman."
34,"Thrilling thriller so far! The second episode really got me wowing and tense and crying and tense all over again.I've seen a lot of bad reviews because of Nicole's facial expressions, or bad acting. I honestly have no clue where these people are coming frim. She does nothing but add to the show, and plays the part of the wife that should have known very well."
35,"This show is gripping from the start of the episode to the end. This show is heart breaking, mysterious, confusing, exciting- I just find it incredible how 50 minutes can make you feel so many different types of emotions. 10/10 watch this"
36,Everything this woman touches is gold. Such a great actress. On episode 3...a great mystery thriller.
37,"Does anyone notice that Nocole wore only two coats ""red or green"", this might be a hint for something about her personality. And one more strange thing, Henry, the son, acted more closer to his father even his father is in jail, and always kept distance from Nicole. The son might be knowing something, just not so sure and too young to understand."
38,"Who has given 8/10?
Imagine some angry hausfrauen of Manhattan docudrama set in (another flop) ""What/if"" scenery. Big names, yet pathetic dialogues and shallow characters. Stereotypical New York elite or rather a take on it ...accordingly to the creators' optics. Eyes Wide Shut version for Hallmark and PG12 plus criminal plot from Law & Order episode. Add to it Vivaldi music as a soundtrack and you will have a perfect tv commercial of some luxury chocolates or brandy from early 1990s.
Skip if you value your time. Bad is an understatement."
39,"Kidman, Grant, Sutherland
1st episode was 10 stars, Intriguing and suspenseful, it's great to see actors you love as they get older, as oneself, still acting. I'll definitely watch the rest of the miniseries."
40,"Rather slow burner, but not in a dull way.Reading some reviews about it being lazy writing and a pointless waste of time, are probably just annoyed with themselves. The got duped by the man they were rooting for.
I'll be honest I was annoyed at myself too, this man was introduced as a disarming gent, who could get what he wants, they told us from the get go that he manipulated people and lived the attention and power; yet I allowed my self to be fooled by him, I fell for his trap. It's a painful and all too raw reminder that sometimes people lie to us, they trick us and hurt us so deeply, with no remorse.
The acting is wonderful; Nicole, anything she touches is gold, Donald Sutherland too; just legendary.But Hugh Grant? Wow, he really surprised me. Such depth of character, and again, he fooled us all.Bravo to all. Forget the hate."
41,"Looked like a twist at the end... it wasn't. Really disliked Nicole Kidman's acting, thats usual however, can't really say I'm disappointed with her though- can't get disappointed if you don't expect anything at the end.. Hugh was great. Storyline was great until the end - last episode ruined it..."
42,This is basically Big Little Lies set in New-York... C'mon isn't there more creativity in American TV series anymore other than recycling two year old series that happened to be a big hit... Lame.
43,I was hopeing that he was not the murderer but at the same time I was afraid that he will be.
44,"I'm on the edge of me seat, I can't figure out who did it. Everyone delivered excellent performances, especially Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant. The most notable was Donald Sutherland. I paused my TV several times just to marvel at the change in expressions on his face when he went from sad to angry to contempt. It's truly amazing to behold."
45,"The episodes are gripping and offering lots of possibilities for suggestions, suspicions and plot twists which never come to anything. Some actions are strange and get an inside ""why???"" response. Nicole Kidman is playing too young a character."
46,The first two episodes got me hooked but now it's feeling a little flat and typical of who-dunnits. There is every reason to suspect the husband of the murdered woman yet he is not being investigated as one would expect.
47,"I've just finished watching the series finale, and I guess based on the ending there'll be no sequel I think. But still, the series is gripping TV, with each episode dropping a bombshell that gives you emotional whiplash. Hugh Grant is deliciously in his element as the father, and you really want to believe his innoncence!"
48,"Brilliant story with a disappointing end.
Till the last 15 mins the story and everything was perfectly scheduled and processed but the wife's testimony and the running just not good enough."
49,"Fabulously made and cast, this drama catches you after about 45 minutes of episode one. The acting is, as you'd expect, excellent, but the awards will deservedly go to Sutherland who positively crackles through his on screen moments. In a scene I won't spoil, I almost broke into spontaneous applause. Nothing is as it appears and, whilst only halfway through, I already know enough to predict that this will be loved by those who invest their viewing time in it."
50,"I know I shouldn't write a review about a series I haven't finished yet, but I had to jump in because this has totally captivated me, and solely because I have no idea where it's going.
I see the similarities to the book and even some improvements - one thing that always bothered me was the fact that the murder, the father's behavior and the resulting lifestyle changes had little to no effect on the son, and at least here the son is shown reacting and dealing with the situation in a realistic manner. There are almost none of the plot devices from the book in the series and they really aren't missed, either.
This is almost an entirely new story and I am enjoying it so much more than the story it's based on, so I hope it continues to be as intriguing and engaging as it now appears four episodes in, with I believe only two to go..
I will say that the Renfair outfits Nicole is wearing are a bit distracting, nobody dresses that way in NYC, but maybe those serve a purpose also...? I guess we will wait and see.."
51,"This is a ""Oh my God, don't say I have to wait a week until the next episode"" kind of show. Great thriller. Great acting by Kidman, Grant and Sutherland. Well worth setting aside an evening just to watch."
52,"First episode was intriguing and got my attention to watch more episodes.
The casting and acting are superb.
But, the scene stealer is the amazing, sultry, captivating performance by Matilda De Angelis!"
53,"I have watched till ep 5 and can't wait for the next episode. There was never a dull moment in this show. From the starting it got me intrigued and I haven't read the book so I don't have anything to compare. All the actors are great but I wish they would have casted someone else instead of Hugh grant, it's not that he is a bad actor but he isn't great either. Not exactly fitting for a role like this. He gets overshadowed by Nicole in every scene. I don't get how some reviewers are calling her a bad actor? She is nailing her performance like she always does.The best part is I still don't know who actually did it, I am suspicious about a few ppl but the show is keeping me guessing. This is exactly what I expect from a psychological thriller."
54,"GRACE'S 'Scarlett O Hara like' PORTRAIT as found at Alma's 'studio (???)' and shown by Detective Alves to Grace?
Well.... ?
My theory :
I am so frustrated. Have not seen the portrait mentioned anywhere !
So... I propose this...
What obviously controlling character seems to be found looking at works of art in the show and who has a huge portrait likely of his dead wife and Grace's mother in his palatial East Side Penthouse front and center?(And btw how did she die exactly ?)
Who may also have had a connection with Alma Alves-
The long admitted cheater who sees himself above the law :
Franklin Reinhart. Grace's benevolent and oh so loving....father.
Finding out about loser Jonathan's said affair, paid her a visit under the guise to commission her to do the portrait of Grace... then had her killed for obvious reasons. Maybe he slept with her 1st...And could son Henry have been his willing or unwilling of Grandfather's accomplise?
Henry does seem to have been way too calm after Jonathan's disappearance. Also close to Franklin in conspiratorial way.(If they just drop that portrait, it will be a huge disappointment to me)
And here's my 5 star sheer brilliance award to the magnificent Donald Sutherland. He is an American acting LEGEND."
55,"I thought this was good up until the last bit of it.
The ending was boring. No real twist or anything. The way it built up I was expecting some crazy twist, and was very disappointed that it ended without one. Just a ""yeah, he did it.""
Also, just as a side note, the kid hides the murder weapon, cleans all the evidence off of it because he didn't want his dad to get in trouble, but then all of a sudden he's shocked to find out his dad killed someone?"
56,I have one criticism. The little boy should never have been questioned by the police without an adult being present. Everyone knows that so why did it happen???
57,"Do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this one. Unless you like ""so bad it's good"" things HBO is airing. Kidman and Grant are so washed up has beens that they are simply painful to watch. Poorly written and directed tedious whodunnit with two redeeming factors a New York background and a real actor named Donald Sutherland. Even those two were near to fail as the cinematography special fish eye effects are repetitive and Sutherland who I deem a supremely gifted actor has got ""doing it for the paycheck"" written all over his face. All in all a crazy looking Botox drenched Kidman and a wrinkled, writhing, sniveling over the hill Hugh Grant look totally out of place and lack any chemistry with the script and each other. Both are difficult to watch.Avoid it like Covid 19."
58,"So The Undoing has been gripping the British public for the last six weeks and it has now finished and I have watched it all and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a woman's life be turned upside down when a friend of hers is killed and someone close to her is the main suspect.Main Character
Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she does a great job in the show. She is the character that we are meant to see the show through and it was done effectively because of her talent, as the world around her gets crazier and crazier Kidman does a great job in just showing how everything is spiralling and how her life is truly being affected by this whole ordeal.Supporting Characters
Hugh Grant has really had a great career renaissance the last few years and he is truly superb here, the guy is so charming and likeable but manages to show a real depth and intrigue to make you wonder what is exactly going on with his character. Donald Sutherland plays her father in the film and he is great, he plays the concerned father well but he also has that intensity when he needs it and he just fills the role incredibly well. Noma Dumezweni plays a lawyer on the show and she she does a great job, she is just a great character and she nails it in the courtroom scenes and she has just such a presence on screen, which is impressive when you see the talent with her. Now it has been a tough year for Edgar Ramirez, he has been in some terrible films but he plays a detective here and he does a really good job and it is just nice to see. He plays the detective really well and it is just a role he slips into very easily and he adds plenty to the show especially in the opening episodes.Story
The story is a classic murder mystery and it is executed very well, it keeps you questioning throughout and does a great job having interesting characters that makes you wonder what exactly is all the characters motivation and whether they can be a suspect in this case. But this show has a main issue and that for me is the ending, the reveal is fine and executed pretty well but the show ends so abruptly, it feels like the episode needed 10/15 minutes longer in order to properly wrap up this show as there is no real room for a second season of this show.Script
The script is great, the dialogue has a really intense feeling due to the subject matter that is on show. But these characters feel real, they have a bit of humour but tons of darkness and drama that makes you interested and invested in the overall feel of the story and the show.Style
The style of the show is pretty full on, it is intense and shows off the indecency of the characters and something that feels very real whether that is violence or sexual. There is only 6 episodes and that feel appropriate, I mean it doesn't feel too long and the episode length feels appropriate. But I felt like the first couple of episodes were pretty slow, I know that it has to build the story and the characters but it does it in a really slow boring way. It does get much better as it goes on but it does take some time to get going and get particularly interesting.Overall
Overall, this is a great thriller with a top notch cast. If you are a fan of murder mysteries then give this show a watch as it is a great 6 episode series."
59,"This is a case that Detectives Reagan and Baez probably would have wrapped up in an hour, in time for Danny to sit down to Sunday dinner with the rest of the Blue Bloods.""The Undoing"" takes its time, but I must admit I was hooked from the start and looked forward to it each week. I resisted the temptation to wait until it was finished and just binge it.I think Nicole Kidman is actually better in this than she was in Season Two of ""Big Little Lies"". Possibly the presence of Meryl Streep caused disturbance all around. When Meryl did that scream at the kitchen table I knew there was some sort of theatre sports going on.There's no such pressure here. Nicole, as psychiatrist Grace Fraser, projects a certain calm. She does a lot with a look, no need for words, and she looks fabulous.Having only one murder to solve in stories like this often allows deeper exploration of the characters and gives the twists more impact. TV series such as ""Vera"" and movies such as ""Anatomy of a Murder"" prove the point.New York is also a star of ""The Undoing"" whether seen from above or down at street level. Along with the deep focus shots of the skyscrapers overlapping each other, we get the feeling that the city is a dispassionate observer.My wife and I almost spat out our evening coffee when a stark naked Matilda De Angelis as Elena Alves brazenly addressed Nicole's character in the gym change room. My wife, more of a cubicle changer or under towel changer, said she always found that sort of behaviour in the ladies change room overly demonstrative. Still, the scene was not as gratuitous as it seemed at first, making more sense as secrets were revealed.With such a small number of people in the cast, one hoped the ending would not reveal a perpetrator that defied logic. The last episode is eventful and we do get a resolution, but as is often the way when a series ends, we realise it was actually the journey that was the most satisfying aspect all along."
60,"It's very rare I Score a mini series a 10/10 but I can't find fault with this 6 part ""whodunnit. The performances are top notch I'd go as far to say it's one of Nicole Kidman's finest ,she's at the top of her game in this . Hugh Grant has developed into a fine actor he is cast as Jonathan Fraser respected and dedicated child oncologist married to Grace (Nicole Kidman) a successful New York therapist. They have a son Henry played brilliantly by young 15 year old British actor Noah Jupe.
No spoilers from me as this story needs to be experienced from episode 1 to episode 6 if you have the same experience as me you'll sit on the edge of your seat and change your opinion of the key characters many time.The Undoing is an American mystery psychological thriller miniseries.
Based on the 2014 novel You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz, the miniseries premiered on HBO on October 25, 2020. It is written and produced by David E. Kelley, and directed by Susanne Bier.Women Directors have been egregiously overlooked in Hollywood for decades and I hope the current crop of great women Directors like Greta Gerwig, Andrea Arnold, Julie Taymoor, Jane Campion the list goes on and on and I'm adding Susanne Bier the Director of The Undoing to this list . Susanne Bier also directed the equally excellent 2016 series ""The Night Manager"" that starred Tom Hiddelston."" The Undoing "" looks fabulous the interior sets by Keri Lederman and Production Designer Lester Cohen feature the most beautiful Manhattan Apartments,especially Grace's wealthy and very protective father Franklin Reinhardt perfectly cast by the wonderful Donald Sutherland. He lives above Central Park in palatial splendour and when Grace and his grandson Henry's seemingly secure and life is turned upside down takes them both in under his stylish roof.Of course there's a crime to solve and a trial to consider your verdict so I must mention Noma Dumezweni the Defence Attorney I'd like on my side if I was accused of a crime, she has attitude and her performance is one of the many highlights of this fine series.
I was so impressed by this series it had no dull spots for me and each episode ended in a cliff hanger which makes the viewer want more because as I said earlier it's due to many great acting performances ,however it's the chemistry and intelligence of it's two stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant that won me over from Episode 1 to 6 .
The tension and cinematography of the final episode is breathtaking and tense.
I can't recommend ""The Undoing."" highly enough ."
61,"""The Undoing"" (2020 release; 6 episodes of about 55 min. each) brings the story of Grace Fraser and her family. As Episode 1 opens, we see a boy running in the street towards a shop, and as he enters the shop, he makes a gruesome discovery. We then go to ""Two Days Earlier"", as Grace, a therapist, is getting ready for another work day. We are introduced to her husband Jonathan, himself a successful doctor, and their teenage son Henry, who attends an elite private school. Later that day, Grace joins a group of ladies who are preparing for a fundraiser for the school. One of them, Elena, has no concerns about breastfeeding her new baby tight then and there in front of the group... At this point we are 10 min, into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this new TV mini-series is directed by Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning Susanne Bier. The story is based on the 2014 novel ""You Should Have Known"" by Jean Hanff Korelitz. It basically is a Manhattan-centric murder mystery, so one has to be very careful what to disclose so as not to spoil any of the whodunnit. The opening episode takes its time to let us get to know Grace Fraser, a woman who seemingly has it all: a successful career and a wonderful family. Yet it becomes clear that all isn't necessarily as it seems... Nicole Kidman, now 53, remains stunningly beautiful (and looks easily a good 10 years younger that her age), and is perfectly cast in this role. Hugh Grant, now 60, has long ago lost his youthful appearances and now is a seasoned veteran, showing wear and tear. Reardon School, where young Henry attends, is a fictional school. Bottom line: the opening episode is full of intrigue and this mini-series looks to deliver a lot more fireworks in the remaining 5 episodes.""The Undoing"" premiered on HBO this weekend, and Episode 1 is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming services. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 9 PM Eastern. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish and good ol' fashioned Manhattan murder mystery, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.*UPDATE 11/1/20* Just watched episode 2. Plenty of drama and, yes, plot twists. Nicole Kidman shines as she is in virtually every frame of this episode. I'm pretty sold on this now, and can't wait to see how it's all going to unfold in the next 4 episodes."
62,"Despite all the negativity, I loved the ending and the manner in which each episode made you question who was guilty. I had decided that Jonathan was guilty in the episode in which he gets into a fight with another prisoner and bites them, that for me showed there as a monster within the man. There could really be no other logical outcome and I loved the way his guilt was revealed in court. Excellent acting from all concerned, beautiful to watch and much needed entertainment in these difficult times."
63,"The writing, acting , and production quality were all top notch.
Up until the last episode, that the writers did a good job of making Grace and Henry react in logical ways. I could understand why they were making the choices they did - as the grappled with weather or not a family member could be capable of murder.
*spoilers*
Personally I thought that the show should not have had Henry find the weapon way back at the Lake House. You mean to tell me that he knew about the murder weapon way back then was able able to continue acting calm and wanting to see his father?! I think it would have been better if he had found it much later - like right before Grace discovers it, or not at all. The show didn't need that layer and I thought it detracted from his otherwise - incredibly realistic reactions throughout the whole ordeal.Overall - a great watch! I was hooked and I loved it!!"
64,Loved watching this series! Very suspenseful and I thought Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman were at their best!
65,"I was still trying to guess who did it all the way till the final episode üòÖ Kudos to Hugh and Noah for playing us so hard... Courtroom scenes were awesome too as it became ""murky"""
66,The cast is exceptional with great timing. The New York cinematography is noteworthy. I'm sure this thrilling suspenseful mystery has much more to offer in episodes to come!
67,"It's good to see Kidman back in an interesting murder/mystery by David E. Kelley (The Crazy Ones, Big Little Lies, Goliath). Hugh Grant is in a familiar role and does it well as the flummoxed prime suspect. I've rarely lusted over a character in any tv or film as I did over the sultry Elena Alves.We can conclude after 3 episodes and overwhelming evidence we have our killer. But hold on, there are 6 episodes after all and in ep3 there is a hint which may cause the investigators argument to crumble like DT's re-election.I look forward viewing the remaining serie episodes and how it will all fit together."
68,"See how the review ratings here took a dive after Episode 2 was aired? Not surprising. I bet if you took a poll of the audience approx 100% would have liked ""Elena"" of the tantalizing mystery and the truly amazing direct gaze to continue her kabuki dance with The Women at least through Episode Three. Instead we are already reduced to the rather tiresome one-note ""Grace"" as real victim onscreen for approx 97% of the time, and ""Jonathan"" starting into the mega-trashing of ""Elena"" as mentally unwell. Love you HBO (and Hugh Grant, and Nicole Kidmann back in your ice-queen days) , but hardly a compelling arc.***We were slowly exiting a Broadway play (""Ink"") when this was being filmed. Right behind me I hear a funny Hugh Grant impersonation. I turn and it IS Hugh Grant, apologizing to my wife for a supposed touching of her foot (she felt nothing). Everybody around departed for home grinning.***Added after Episode 6. Yes it looks even more like the violence-porn exploitation of Matilda De Angelis now. I had been curious as to why an Italian, actually a singer, with limited English had to be imported to play a Hispanic woman, and it seems clearer now. Her interviews suggest that while she appreciated the kind support of her co-stars she is ambivalent about how she ended up. She may have been pretty shocked when she got to see the endless hammerings and shots of her crushed head that an article on violence against women in The Atlantic especially took issue with.It seems to me that you rather owe her, HBO. Perhaps you could pick up her Life-of-Leonardo series now being filmed?"
69,"Grace tends to go back and forth w/ the red and green coat. I definitely think this is a clue because she wore the red coat on the first episode. Red symbolizes for sacrifice, danger, and coverage. Green coat on the second episode green symbolizes for rebirth, renewal, and immorality. There's definitely something up w/ Grace. Notice how she was looking w/ her couple patients when he said ""I was trying to break free from myself"" and then goes in to say that parts of him wants to be dangerous... the conversations w/ her patients are definitely something to pay attention to. Her father is also strange... if he has some type of mental sickness he definitely passed down on to Grace. Her relationship w/ her son is also off she doesn't seem very loving and tends to show herself breaking down in front of him. I also think she lied about the dog story to him. There's definitely something up w/ Grace but idk if she's the killer because it's so in your face. Her father is a suspect of mine"
70,"Love this series!
I have read quite a lot of murderer's novels and watched a lot of films about the same plot but ""The Undoing"" has me completely lost.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO DID IT!
And I love not to know! ‚ô•
After having watched episode 4 on HBO (the series airs in Argentina the same day as in the USA) I cannot wait until tomorrow to watch episode 5.Who did it?
Franklin / Jonathan / Syvia / Miguel / Grace / Anothe one...
That's my list of suspects.Regards from Buenos Aires."
71,"I watched the first two episodes last night and it's very entertaining so far but I'd like to make a prediction that Grace is actually the killer. A really crazy ending would be Henry being the killer because he thought Elena was destroying his ""happy"" family."
72,"I've just finished the show and at first, I was surprised by the ending but after giving it some thought I found the ending to be brilliant.In the end the show tells us something about ourselves. It tells us that we are bias when it comes to successful, beautiful and charming people, that we tend to believe the them even though they're obviously guilty."
73,"The Undoing is a very good 6 part thriller. A murder whodunit that keeps you watching each episode by gripping you with twists and turns and well executed cliff-hangers.
Kidman and Grant top the cast and are extremely watchable. The rest of the cast are top class too.
I dont watch many TV series as many don't hold my interest but this definitely did."
74,"What a great series! Have not seen something this good for a long time. Absolutely fantastic acting, Kidman, Grant and Sutherland are just brilliant! Series packed with suspense, attention to details, not dragged over to several seasons as many other series. Definitely worth watching."
75,A sort of who-done-it type of saga with good actors creating a riveting view of a slowly unraveling thought-provoking plot. It keeps one spellbound and is best binge viewed to remember clues that are found in almost each episode.
76,"Great to teach and study several mental disorders and syndromes, applied to different circumstances Great performances, story and production."
77,"Very well written and played - and great plot! It feels like an exiting mix of Sharp objects and Big little lies... A plus that it was only 6 episodes, did get tired of it even once. You should definitely see it ü§ô"
78,"Every once in a while a masterpiece ends up on our screens, The Undoing is this gem! Great mind blowing performance by young actor Noah Jupe. Hugh Grant out of his comfort zone in this role. Of course Donald Sutherland and Nicole Kidman also gave an astonishing performance. Besides that of course great script and directing.
Only disturbing thing distracting a bit: Nicoles duck lips. She shouldnt have done it just before starting her role."
79,"ALTHOUGH THE EARLIER EPISODES HAD SOME GOOD ACTING AND SOME INTERESTING PLOT TWISTS, THE FINAL MISHMASH GETS THE ALL TIME AWARD FOR MOST IDIOTIC. WHEN WE DISCOVER THAT OUR VILLAIN IS ACTUALLY WHOM WE HAVE SUSPECTED THE ENTIRE TIME HAS LEFT THE HAMMER IN THE FAMILY BEACH HOUSE , WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A PLOT OF PUTZERY. THIS GUY IS SUPPOSED TO BE BRIGHT AND DAYS LATER HE ""HIDES"" THE MURDER WEAPON AT HIS FAMILY'S HOME, NEXT TO THE OCEAN AND HAD TO CROSS WHO KNOWS HOW MANY RIVERS AND ESTUARIES TO GET THERE? HE COULDN'T JUST TOSS IT IN? AND THEN THE ENDING, MELODRAMATIC MORASS OF MORONITY. I FEEL SORRY FOR THE ACTORS WHO WERE PUT THROUGH THIS PIECE OF NONSENSE. SURELY THEY WEREN'T SHOWN THE ENDING UNTIL 10 MINUTES BEFORE FILMING OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE AGREED TO ACT IN IT... OR ARE THEY THAT DESPERATE FOR WORK?"
80,"Instead of losing my focus while thinking how talented and gorgeous is nicole kidman, show is pretty gripping since the first episode, i just don't want see kidman is killer the killer the end. By the way i think she is the singer in the intro."
81,"Big expectations !
Grant, Sutherland and Kidman in the same series üòäüéâüòÉ
Only seen the first episode, but the acting, the plot and the professinal filming makes (for me) this series the best this year ! Please give us more !"
82,"It's all here. A great script, an incredible cast and all of them playing one of the best roles in their entire career in The Undoing. I can only hope the conclusion will be as magnificent as the 4 episodes that were out while I wrote this.
Highly recommended"
83,"After 3 episodes I am hooked for the story. Good script for sure and I haven't worked out who the killer is. But it tackles the family Undoing and I like the focus on the son.
Nicole is as usual amazing."
84,"This was such a good show, totally captured from beginning to end.
Superb performances, love the script and the plot, the way it is filmed.
Too few shows are as good as this."
85,"From the first episode, I sensed the style of Hitchcock; the shots, music, air of introducing the characters.
With each episode, a new discovery unfolds.
I particularly liked the way the story was woven, and the production guys did not waver in creating a beautifully shot and intricate movement between sceneries.
Well made and worth the watch."
86,"First episode feels long\slow and boring, but the rest... amazingly smart."
87,"Firstly:
When IMDB describes the story as:""Life for a successful therapist in New York begins to unravel on the eve of publishing her first book.""Having just seen the last episode I wonder who wrote that synopsis: It is about anything but the above, really.Secondly:
It is about a murder. And what happens when there are many possible culprits and it keeps you in total suspense through every episode. The acting is brilliant. Hugh Grant is stunning. Nicole Kidman looks really weird so she is great, because of her highly unsuccelful surgery, mostly because of it fitting into the whole scheme of things. You know what I mean when you've seen it."
88,"The type of story ""who did it"" is nothing new. And yet they managed to make all the main characters involved seem suspect until the very last episode. Also, Nicole Kidman, for no one's surprise, delivered pure gold acting together with the talented co-stars. Finally, one of the best trials on recent tv series."
89,I think this series was wonderful wonderful and kept me guessing the entire time.
90,"Highly recommended. Great watch. Hard not to keep staring at Nicole's overdone, face full of Botox, but good show!"
91,Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses and she does NOT disappoint in this series! This is a great cast of actors. The story unfolds slowly with intrigue and opens up all kinds of questions. It seems that nothing is as it appears. HBO never fails me with these excellent series!
92,"I can't remember if Nicole Kidman ever was a good actress. I believe I thought so in the Virgina Wolf film. But here and in Big little lies, I find her awful. She distracts with her terrible acting. How can an actress make her face immovable? The only expression is that strange blowing out of air. I get the feeling, that part of her cheeks is the only thing that moves in her face. Please, HBO, don't use her again. There are so many good actresses deserving a good part. It is just not fair, on us or them."
93,"For someone who made his career off procedurals, this one is so poorly written it seems as if the writer guessed at what should happen next. Above all, how is it that this murder garners the degree of police attention, neigh laser-like extreme focus under a microscope, and inordinate media attention that is portrayed in this flop. I like all the actors, but all of them are ""act-ing."" The pacing would put a snail to sleep. The cinematography is a failed attempt at art-house chic. The only redeeming aspect is my curiosity as to how they will extricate themselves from their fiasco."
94,Not sure why this is getting such positive reviews. It is a poorly written show with cliche characters. It's melodramatic and pretty predictable so far. One of the worst shows I've seen from HBO.
95,A true masterpiece of a show/performance/directing/writing in a league of its own as its Shakespearean. An equalization of humanization. Nicole Kidman is an anchor of an astute actor and Sutherland has transcended. Just finished the 3rd show out of 6 and the potential and finalization of what this show is will only scratch the surface of a world meant to be unknown but is seen and felt directly in front of us. Kudos to all on this show as it has beat to its own drum and made the heart curate bloodlines making way to pulsate.
96,This show is excellent! Really keeps you guessing up until the very end. We binged the first 3 eps and then had to watch the last 3 week to week. It's better as a binge. Very good and entertaining!!! Highly recommend!
97,"So you assemble a gaggle of A-list actors, and add some gratuitous nudity. But so far it's just a wearisome crowd of New Yorkers with too much time, money, and a male who can't be trusted. And whether you happen to be Nicole Kidman or not, it's a hard-and-fast rule with Personal Counselors that secrets are sacrosanct. A mother Counselor would therefore NOT disclose confidences of a Father to a Son without express permission, regardless of family kinship . You'd think researchers would know something as basic as this. wouldn't you!"
98,This would be a good show if they had cast a better female lead. Nicole Kidman is very underwhelming.
99,"I started watching this a week after the first episode. I gave it 5 mins. I was hooked. I'm now on episode 3 and liking it, however, the one thing that is driving me crazy is all the sighing, huffing and moaning everyone is doing. Especially Nicole Kidman. It's worth the watch and binge(able) on a rainy day. I'll update after I finish."
100,"We're four episodes in. I've enjoyed the writing so far, and good acting. But honestly, I am way too distracted by the all too many close-ups of Nicole Kidman and whatever she has done cosmetically to her face. It is so distracting that what ever scene she's is I quickly start thinking of that. Pity she felt she had to continue to go that route, and now this time it's overdone. Apparently she doesn't think she can go the, let's say, Diane Keaton route, and age gracefully. I'll continue to watch because I've got my theories about ""who done it"", despite the annoying distractions."
101,"Surprised to see so many negative reviews. Nicole Kidman's performance was superb, all the main players were brilliantly cast. Interesting story line with some great dialogue. Highly entertaining and well worth watching."
102,"Absolutely loved this mini series. The actors were all fabulous, it had me hooked from the first episode. What an ending!! HBO pulls off another great series!"
103,"The Undoing is a new David E. Kelley six-part mini series on HBO.This show has it all; production value, a great cast, nice scenery and an engaging story. But it also lacked something. This 'thing' probably has to do with the fact there are no twists or surprising turns.To me personally, this led to a rather unfulfilling feeling after the season finale. On the other hand, the fact there is no surprise is rather surprising aswell. So maybe the show needs some more time for me to sink in.Donald Sutherland deserves a special shoutout, he has a small part, but aces every scene."
104,This is an uncomplicated thriller and I mean that as a compliment. It doesn't try to surprise you or half way through change the trajectory of the story. From start to finish it is about a wealthy upper class professional New York Family that gets embroiled in a brutal murder. NIchole Kidman plays Grace a psychiatrist who focuses on troubled marriages who fails to see that her own husband Johnathin played by Hugh Grant has been cheating on her until his mistress Elena shows up in her life. And where her son has gotten a scholarship at the school her own son attends. It wouldn't be such a big deal except that she is trying just a little too hard to be her friend. Then Elena is found murdered and Johnantin is named the main suspect and the police investigating the crime are sure Grace is hiding something as well.The story itself is ironically about family and the lengths we will go to keep what we have. Did Johnathin murder his mistress to keep his family or is something else at work here? The story actually focuses around Grace and her slowly learning the truth about her marriage that she has long denied. How far would she go to protect a man that might be innocent? How far would she go to protect her son if he is actually guilty?This is an uncomplicated thriller revolving around those two questions. Is Johnathin guilty of murder? And how far will Grace go once she learns the truth?
105,"This show delivers in all aspects. There isnt many boring moments and every minute is used to build a perspective or story. Kidman, Grant and the kid do a wonderful job acting."
106,"I waited until the final episode to write a review tho I thought it was crappy prior and now even more. The acting, the dialogue... Awful! Like a 5th grader wrote this. The court scene and the so called attorneys had to be the worst I've ever seen! Did they not have the solicitors watch real ones and real cases? Did the writer not?!? I'm sure Kelly's dealt with them enough in real life being a producer , writer and former attorney!( the attorney part just found that out makes it even more pathetic).They go off the line of questioning ( irrelevant things all the time) and not one objection. It has to be the quietest courtroom I've ever witnessed. The writing throughout was awful mind you but the court proceedings were the worst of the lot. And I see lots of mention of Nicole Kidmanns plastic surgery etc. I was thinking she doesn't look that bad and actually thought she looked more like her old self( red curly hair and all) until the last episode and my god when they'd show her in the courtroom! Nicole where did you go?!? Her acting does come off as horrible because she can't make expressions but I also just think she was never that great of an actress. The only decent actor in the whole thing is Henry whom I did not now was a Britt. Not relevant but why can't Nicole ever use her real accent in anything?!? Hugh does. Annoying. Any ways and the ending was ridiculous. Come on. The series wasn't good enough for it not to have a twist, throw us for a loop! I mean watch by all means but you have to suspend complete belief about well everything in general."
107,"I love this show. It doesn't hurt that I am both a Kidman and Grant fan. It keeps me wondering, and being on the 4th episode I fully believe Donald Sutherland is the culprit. Got rid of two problems he hated. Grant's girlfriend Emma and making sure the son-in-law he hates gets blamed for it. Just a theory that is almost certainly wrong lol. Anyway, not much worth watching lately, this one definitely is. Kidman is giving an Emmy winning performance, that's for sure. Give it a shot!"
108,"I'm enjoying the series but Nicole, her chin has been elongated such that her bottom lip doesn't meet her top lip and it's driving me crazy. Also her hair is distracting, so much hair."
109,A great drama with twists that you will grip you ! Hugh Grant is brilliant in this & Nicole Kidman is just amazing and does she ever age ??? It does start a bit slow but trust me it gets exciting !!
110,So much garbage on TV....finally something that holds my interest enough to keep coming back. This show and The Fall are my picks for this season.
111,"Also some of the plot lines were completely dumb.
Hugh was good, very solid performance, especially given the stupidity and plot holes."
112,"What a shameful buffet of ""A list"" actors hammering their way through a lifelessly dull and amateur screenplay.Whoever describes this as ""riveting"" should run themselves through the dishwasher like a murder weapon.This series is beyond flawed through the complete void of character development; I could not possibly care less about any of these people... let alone the chick who showed up for a hot second in the premiere and got axed.Spare yourself from this utterly painful NAP."
113,"Love the series, i think that Kidman and Grant are doing an excellent job, especially Grant; and Kidman looks fantastic too! The cast is great and the directing is also very good!"
114,"Pretty rich white woman who's not in touch with reality and her ""earth shattering drama."" Classic self righteous Hollywood BS with Nicole Kidman. Pretty much follows the same formula as Big Little Lies. Which is why HBO has consistently left me disappointed with a lack of originality in their programing lately. Would rather watch another shameless reboot with a dozen sequels like Fast and Furious than this plodding garbage."
115,"Acting, plot just everything about this show is terrific. I don't understand how you could not give it a 9 or 10. People are so critical of everything. Just watch it. You will enjoy it."
116,"Finally a TV show that's got it all. The plot makes you feel like you know the truth from the beginning and yet you don't. Writing is impeccable, actors make you believe their characters almost to a fault. Full of twists and turns, and what a cinematography, let me tell you! Last but not least, a big THANK YOU to the creators for a proper ending, which seems to be a scarce commodity these days."
117,"Very addictive, I binge watched all season in one seating. Nicely played by all actors. Outstanding cast really, grant goes from perfect husband to despicable psychopath smoothly. And Nicole Kidman is lovely. Say all you want about botox, she looks 15 years younger than her age. Great for a rainy Sunday afternoon."
118,I LOVED the show! But I hated the fact that it's only 6 episodes. It's so good that I was expecting more but I did love the end.
119,"Along with terrible direction. especially direction.. the director doesn't seem to know basic actor and camera direction, nor understand how each scene is suppose to play out. it's only caused Big Little Lies' wonderful Kidman seem way below par. poor Nicole, with no one there to give clear directions for ANY scene, let alone the emotionally heavier ones.
in today's television, now that content is overwhelmingly churning out disregarding quality, it still manages to stay at the bottom of the pool.
but back to the writing... the dialogue is just horrendous, lacks basic intelligence, or even function in some scenes. i've never read the book, so i don't know where that went wrong. but this level of dialogue is befitting of only a secondary tv station soap.
characters are one dimensional, dry, and lack basic drive. so the plot lingers on what seems to be the first act for two episodes.. with nothing more than moods and useless flashback scenes that do not add suspense or drama... and the list goes on and on.
it'd have an even lower rating if it wasn't marketed and presented well. HBO's need for content quantity is seriously starting to affect their quality."
120,"The acting is beyond mediocre, the directing is terrible, the story 3 episodes in is the most obvious generic murder mystery ever, but the worst thing is nicole looks deformed, she has no fascial muscle movement what so ever, what director keeps making close ups to a person that was a so so average actor to begin with buu now has a deformed face..."
121,I don't understand people getting mad at the ending. It was still a psychological thriller. Very thought provoking. Great cast and excellent acting by all.
122,"I wasn't sure about watching this as I am not a Nicole Kidman fan but I am glad I did. The last episode had me glued to the screen and the scene on the bridge was intense. Nicole Kidmans acting on the bridge gave me chills. Every mum can relate at that moment. Great episodes week after week. I would be happy if it ended on series one. I have a feeling if there's a series two there could be more to what we think we know and I am not sure if I am ready for that.
Watch it, it's worth it."
123,"The show is very well made and very entertaining, the script kept us wondering who did it and it was quite obvious, the whole cast delivered and excellent performances and Nicole Kidman has proven how great she is both as an actress and producer..."
124,"Best 6 episodes of a series I've seen in ages!
Hugh Grant as you haven't seen before."
125,"I'm a fan of this genre and and only a few captures you the way this show does. Refreshing to see so many amazing and credible performances but I think Hugh Grant takes this one! This is perhaps his BEST role yet. Definitely a great exercise for the viewer, makes you ask a lot of questions about the human mind and and the lengths we go as witnesses to justify what we define as truth based of what is presented. Totally recommend watching this"
126,"All I can say is wow, great writing great acting great everthing...Love it love it love it."
127,"This series from the first minute you are hooked , you feel like you are on the edge of your chair, the acting was implacable by all. Best work in 2020 so far.
Highly recommend."
128,"I am a huge fan of Kidman, Grant, and Sutherland.
The supporting cast do terrific work and this will be, no doubt, up for Emmys in the ensuing months.
What annoys me? Kidman's character Grace. Throughout the whole series she speaks softy, quietly, in whispers; she exhales, she gasps, she sighs; she looks into the middle ground with a look as if she is trying to bend spoons with her mind.
For being a published clinical psychologist, the character doesn't seem to have much of a grasp of herself.
I put it down to poor direction. It was distracting.
The rest of the production, as I said, is brilliant!
Sutherland plays his standard father role well, the young actor, Noah Jupe, playing Henry should get special mention, Edgar Ramirez as the detective excels, and Grant proves ability to play in a dramatic role admirably.
Sure, there are a few minor plot holes - or are they red herrings - but they're The Undoing is very, very much worth watching. Even if the excellent Nicole is exasperating in her various forms of exhaling!"
129,"Now here's a complex storyline very very well acted. Nicole Kidman has come into her own and she excellently acts several persons. Hugh Grant has matured with all his layers from witty, to clumsy to a seasoned and convincing dramatic actor. AND I haven't even seen the end...watch now."
130,From Big Little Lies to this - amazing performances throughout on all sides. All-Star cast AND performance.
131,"Amazing. The whole show and cast are perfect.
Amazing Acting
Amazing cast
Amazing story line."
132,"I'm not sure about the writing but the acting was, at the best , ok. High Grant playing his usual self. Nicole Kidman, a tad over the top. Do you ant a lawyer? NO? Absolute daftness. The whole thing, to me, is poor. Not doing what she should do etc etc.Hugh go back to romance."
133,"The story starts off promising and then descends episode by episode into implausibilities, including mediocre detective work, unbelievable court room drama, rinky-dink diagnostic speculation, and unacceptable holes in the plot. (Note: I'm a retired psychiatrist with 40 years experience). The number of lapses in screen writing and depicting it on the screen ruins what are fine performances. Examples: 1. the police do no background work into the past of the accused murderer (played by Hugh Grant), no one inquires how long he was having his affair or what he was doing for the three months he wasn't working. 2. Under age children should not be allowed and aren't allowed in murder trial of a parent and then exposed to graphic photos of the deceased mother. 3. The wife of the accused murderer, played by Nicole Kidman, is found wandering through Central Park in the middle of the night or from her tony Upper East Side home all the way over to the West Side and Harlem. Unbelievable. 4. Pinning the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder on the Hugh Grant character It's not only wrong-headed, It reinforces how shoddy clinical psychologist the Nicole Kidman character is. 5. The last episode has no twists and turns other than those that can be seen a mile away and leads to an obvious and predictable solution to who's the murderer. It just resorts to another clich√©d example of the police chasing down a monster. These are just a few examples of a script that should've been sent back for more rewrites to make the plot have, as Aaron Elkin would say, probable improbability instead of improbable probability. To put it in plain English, when you're sitting at home watching the drama unfold and you keep saying ""oh come on now, that's ridiculous,"" you know you're wasting your time on a mediocre product. There are way better murder mysteries combined with police procedural out there that even include family drama (Bosch, for example, does it right). Sadly, this one fails."
134,"With an A+ cast I would have expected way more. It started out great, had an enormous amount of potential to provide a real twist. But instead the last episode was a letdown. Also, how can a helicopter casually just land on a bridge at the perfect time? We should have seen some sort of development into grace's psych flashbacks or into the husbands life. Ugh. Just super average."
135,"Great actors, Kidman, Grant, Sutherland but.....Edgar Ramirez is quite possibly the worst portrayal of a NYPD detective I have ever seen."
136,"A robust, logically flawless psychological maze, successfully qualifying for a canonical thriller. It proportionately builds suspense within harmonically incorporated scenes, with no excess nor omission."
137,"Finally something that shows true good acting. The: Who done it effect is dripping off the screen, I'm not bothered tho. Simply cos Donald and Hugh are so bloody good. I'm on Ep. Six and this cannot be the end. Hope not. I suspect Badass Don to be involved. üëåüèª I adored his performance at any moment on screen, esp. When he visits the school! Go and watch!!! Kidman is always good but to me always the same. Hugh is naturally funny but here he shows how good of an actor he is. Hope to see him more away from rom-com. All in all.. Love this show!!"
138,"It's always comforting to watch the life of rich, successful, and beautiful people who seem to have everything. This is when I think to myself, wait, everything seems too perfect. Perfect marriage, perfect child, perfect husband and wife. So, at first, I know that nothing can be that perfect.Elena, the gorgeous mystery lady who is obsessed over Grace, I want to know why. The series kept drawing me in. Each character, Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman are so easy to watch. This is an HBO miniseries that doesn't waste your time."
139,Nikole maybe play the Best role in Best way in her career. Every episode is better than the previus one.
140,"Nothing about this comes close to the quality you'd expect from David E. Kelley. He must have needed money and punched this out in an afternoon. Spare yourself this sensationalized tripe. Plus, a full length documentary could be made just on all the implausibilities and plot holes. Which, it seems, Hugh Grant tried desperately to distract from with his constant facial grimaces. Ugh. Had to decide after episode 3 whether to bail. ""It can't stay this bad. There'll be a great twist which redeems it."" Nope. Every episode was worse than the previous."
141,"Seriously? The mans not a celebrity, she's not a celebrity, the victim isn't a celebrity, NOBODY would care!
There would NOT be reporters camped outside her door!!!!
This would be no more than a blurb on news one ""woman found dead in Harlem, police are investigating""That would be IT!And Nicole Kidman can't cry anymore, because her tear ducts are on the back of her head!"
142,"Another whodunit that becomes a who cares. I rated this 1 star after two episodes and then rated it to3 because I felt that I was being overly-harsh, but the ending is so unbelievably bad that 1 star is the only way to rate this bomb.Dead women only really matter in fiction if they are gorgeous and have huge breasts. If the murdered gal had been four-foot-nine and built like an oil burner, no one would care. The rule for dead men is they have to be very powerful.OK, even if the guy had murdered twelve nurses in his own hospital, a talented oncologist could still make a great living anywhere. Period.Even when Hollywood tries to examine the rich, they just end up drooling over their privilege, possessions, and status. Why am I supposed to care about the problems of rich creeps who wouldn't take a leak on me if I were on fire? Answer: I don't. Why are so many films about obscenely wealthy people? It's unhealthy our obsession with money.And, it's unforgivably slow. Mostly just shots of Nicole Kidman walking around looking anguished, if that's your thing. It's so boring, unless you are considering having a boatload of reconstructive surgery like she's had.Ugh, one thing that I truly despise about Hollywood is when they have no other way to have a character show frustration and anger except to have them destroy their own property. After two episodes of fifty minutes, they could have put it all into thirty minutes.The hot babe who has a kid on scholarship works out in the same gym as the rich creep? The monthly fee is probably more than her rent. She also wears a dress that probably cost more than she makes in two weeks.Never talk to the cops without a lawyer. Never, freaking ever. I repeat: don't talk to the police! Every word they speak to the police without a lawyer takes away from the believability of this series and lowers the quality of the entertainment. It's a stupid plot device. The legal aspect of the wife having an ongoing conversation with the lead detective in a murder investigation in which her husband is the defendant is just stupid."
143,A really good series with a great cast! Well worth the 6 hours. Once you start you will want to see it to the end!
144,"Excellent drama that kept us guessing till the last 15 minutes. Great drama, great acting. Donald Sutherland is amazing along with Hugh Grant and Nicole's Kidman. Loved it. Welcome back Hugh"
145,"How much I can enjoy watching great actors. Everybody's impecable performance.
And Hugh, so charismatic you want to justify and see him innocent since first chapter.
Nicole is great as always.
Donald is AMAZING ! You can se his pain, how worried he is... everything you can see in one shot
I loved it"
146,Amazing show. AlwAsy on the edge of your seat!! Great actors
147,"Don't remember why I started watching this series, but I was hooked once I did and couldn't wait for every episode. Do not understand all the negative comments. I thought the acting was terrific, the story was great. Nicole Kidman is a fabulous actress, and she and the son should be up for awards. Grant was good, portrayed the killer very well, though why it took so long for his true self to come out is puzzling. Sorry it's done but loved watching it."
148,"I would have preferred that it will end more dramatically,that the conclusion would have been more clear but..I think they wanted to go with a more realistic touch ..I still don't get one detail in second or 3rd episode but maybe at a second watch it will became more clear because I can't believe that was some detail
Trow in there just like that and then abandoned.."
149,"It didn't exactly go the way I'd hoped but still, it was okay. It was enjoyable. They could've built up more character interactions before going into the main plot and also could've established more L mood but I guess they were not patient enough to create drama. Or perhaps the studio wanted to keep it light, play it safe. Not being able to see more of interactions between certain characters was definitely a shame."
150,"I am a huge fan of Nicole Kidman and Hur Grant. They are amazing actors. Having said that, it feels like the show is missing something. I love Nicole Kidman's acting but it does not make sense that she had no idea that her husband was a narcissist/sociopath. It's hard to digest given the fact that she is shown as a very successful physiologist. The only reason I have given it an 8 is because the acting is so good and that is what makes it an absolute pleasure to watch. I can wait for tomorrow's last episode."
151,I am giving 1 star just for the first episode. This looked primising but afterwards it went down like a rock. I can't believe how bad this series is and how much hype it gets. There is nothing going on. A lot of scenes that don't say anything and a waste of time not contributing to anything. If you're already on HBO go watch Beartown to see a real drama with practically unknown actors and no more Hollywood sighs and stupid plot
152,"The show managed to deliver expectations. It is well written with excellent cast and exciting story. One of the rare shows where you can't wait for the next episode. The ending was great and reasonable. All evidence poined to that. While everyone exceped for some major plot twist I'm glad there was none cause there wouldn't be room for it in a single episode. Also there is a good lesson to be learned which is confirmation bias, how we tend to see things according to our preconceived notions, which is not only applicable to main character but to us as viewers as well, cause those who didn't like who the murderer was were biased and didn't want to see ther character as a murderer"
153,Waste of good actors on an awful script and poor unrealistic dialogues (I felt really bad for Sutherland). Waste of money on a pricey production that had more nonsense and scrip holes than a mexican soap. Waste of time for everyone who saw it for the actors and for David E Kelley who have done so much better than this in the past. But what makes me sadder is that this show could and should be a lot better. It could have been good. I couldn't believe how bad it was until the very end.
154,"I'm not sure if this series ran out of money or had to wrap up due to COVID, but this was a terrible ending to an otherwise well written and well acted mini series. Did any executives at HBO actually watch the final episode or did they ignore the phoned-in, lazy writing? Shame."
155,"Well that was a real let-down. My money was on Franklin. That would have made things interesting. But no-oo. Just another take on Oedipus Rex, which is my least favorite plot.
Why did the detective lie about other persons on the CCTV? Why keep the hammer? Why explain points of law as if you are doing a TV show?
Ugh. Lots of padding. Lots of perm.
And ""none"" is either singular or plural. I thought that was a clue, but no-oo."
156,"The kind of puzzle that I awaited since late 90's and early 00's. An intense mini-series, full of excellent performances that leave you on tiptoes trying to guess what will happen next. To complement it, a solid and vibrant argument celebrating the return of Hugh Grant."
157,"What I liked-
1. Reasoning different plausible scenarios
2. Satisfying ending
3. Great acting, cinematography, and important POC characters.
4. Consistency in keeping the relationship tension alive.What I didn't like-
1. Weak Dialogues.
2. Not using psychotherapy skills of the character at its full potential.
3. Lack of technical accuracy.This series has brilliant cinematograph, consistency, and acting. I appreciate how the creators have dug into all plausible suspects and reached fairly deep into each theory. It's enjoyable how characters got to speak their minds instead of dumping 100s of mindless clues. The relationship tension between children, parents, couples, childhood trauma and its effects have been explored---which was super interesting to watch. Lastly and importantly, the show has important POC characters.From a technical standpoint, the show lacks accuracy. And the dialogues are quite old-school which can sound cringy. I was intrigued to see a psychotherapist's perspective. But the creators only partly focused on it, making her career irrelevant to the case. The show is more about psychology and I wanted to know about the characters' personal choices to find an absolute conviction. The show did redeem itself by giving us a sequence of clues to fixate why and who is guilty, at the very end.Conclusion: Never miss red flags in relationships."
158,The acting and entire show was epic. Kept you guessing right until the end. Absolutely brilliant except Nicoles botox levels that left her facial expressions minimalistic. Other that that a solid 9/10
159,"Going by the episodes that have already aired, the plot seems to be much thicker and confusing than the book. It seems the killer would turn out to be someone we least expect. (Blonde or the Son) But, we never know, it could also tread on the same path and reveal Jonathan to be the killer after letting viewers get lost in different directions.After ep.3 i think its Grace split personality."
160,"I really enjoyed this, at a point i was rooting for Jonathan and was convinced it was the wife who did it. Nicole Kidman showed why she's an Alist actress, everyone's acting was believable and entertaining. A good thriller overall"
161,The most interesting part of the show was what the characters went through and how they reacted to their own individual situation. The most compelling performance was from Nicole Kidman who genuinely made me question what was going to happen next.
162,Can we just take a minute to appreciate the amazing preformaces of the cast? Especially Nicole Kidman and Donal Sutherland. It was a good show. I hope that they don't try to give it a second season.
163,"An interesting and well-constructed series, made for the viewer to wonder about their own veracity biases. The only question that was left nagging is that Grace could have turned her husband over long before the trial and without her having to testify."
164,"Everything about this series feels like normal network television, at least aside from some pretty gratuitous (but welcome) nudity early on.The cliched establishing shot, for instance. Every transition includes the sort of establishing shot of the exterior of a building that went out of style in the 90s. Instead of acclimating us to each set, or artfully and seamlessly setting each scene, we go from ""exterior, luxury Manhattan"" to ""exterior, NYC Police station"" to ""exterior, NYC court house"". It starts to feel almost like it's some inside joke it's so lazy.Now add the repetitive use of tilt-shift during many of the ""look, it's NYC!"" transitions (in case anyone forgot).Those are, of course, minor issues. They just bring the whole thing down and lower expectations. They make it feel lazy and cheap. Far below the level expected of HBO.The script would be appropriate for a 60 minute episode of Law & Order. It isn't the script for a 6 episode HBO series.The acting is consistently good from most involved, but they're working on a terrible script, with horrendous directing and camera work, and the result is...eh...You'll watch it through out of curiosity, but the payoff will make you wish you could go back and not have watched it."
165,"While the story is a standard story of love and betrayal, you do keep wondering who is the murderer - suspecting each character. A good cast takes the serial to a higher level . A special mention for the child actor Noah Jupe who has emoted so well. Way to go! And Nicole Kidman is so beautiful!"
166,Great movie! Nicole kidman plays her role the best as alwaysüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò
167,"Wow! Foremost what beautiful acting and production. Hugh Grant & Nicole Kidman...I really didn't know ""who done it"" because the storyline was so mysterious and has depth. The Undoing kept me curious, anxious and wanting more. Also their acting son, Noah Jupe was fantastic. This mini series is great for anyone looking for a good murder mystery."
168,I can't put into words how much I enjoyed this show. I don't want to say any spoilers I just want to advise everyone to watch this for themselves.
169,"Well written, beautiful thriller. I think Grace Fraser is the killer... she knew he was an adulterer, and did it. OR Her dad did, and framed Jonathan. Spell binding TV, I'm hooked! ..."
170,Great psychological thriller!!! Sit on the edge of your seat! As a mental health provider it's a powerful drama.
171,Loved the first episode I'm bias because I love everything Nicole Kidman does . Great first episode can't wait to see the rest
172,Nice and glossy. The poor dead girl beautiful. Too bad the plot is easily predictable and the show won't go over a 6.
173,"Its an original , not a cliche. Worths for everything, Nicole Kidman!!!!! Goddamn !!
This woman never ages, One of the best actor's off alltime (I know Actress) well She is a maestro"
174,"After two episodes, I give a rating of 9. Nice atmosphere and mystery, I liked Matilda De Angelis. Very brave on screen. Hope to see more of her in the future, in flashbacks because we still don't know much about her. We will see how the series develops later, I hope the quality will not drop and I will not have to lower the rating."
175,Waste of time and energy. One of the worst series I have ever seen...
176,"If I were to watch first 5 episodes and stop there, I would give it 9 or 10 stars. Unfortunately the last episode is without a doubt 1 star finale.The show is really addictive and I agree it's one of those ""I can't wait till next week"" shows. Pleasing setting, beautiful shots, lazy beginning that gains tracktion and truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. I kept wondering who did it, kept analysing all characters, all the clues that every episode sneaked in, all this to find out that yes, it was him who did it, but he was just lying all the time. It looked like the director had zero idea how to end it.I can see a lot of 8-10 ratings that say ""great so far, I'm on ep. 3/4/5"". I agree. But the whole 6 episodes show is 4 stars and tons of wasted potential for a much more thrilling ending."
177,I never ever write reviews. Whoever has rated this less than a 7 needs a refresher course on good thrillers. I rate this a 10 already and there's only 2 episodes. The last one left me tearing up. Kidman nailed scene where she called her husband into the police. I'm so excited to see what happens. I don't think anything is as it seems! I already liked her in Big Little Lies but I have a newfound respect for Nicole Kidman!
178,"I know it's early but Nicole K is SO damn distracting! In a bad way. Why did she have SO much surgery and then still have filters and/or special effects on the editing?!? She looks like someone who has been airbrushed in EVERY scene!!! We see everyone else's laugh lines and normal blemishes mind you. And don't even get me started with full makeup And lippy in the bedroom scenes. Ugh. It's hard work watching this.
Acting is trying far too hard for me as well. It is truly ""acting"".
Not impressed so far. Will persevere."
179,I get some Agatha Christie vibes from this mistery drama for the obvious reason of a muder mistery. But I think it's going elsewhere. The cast is excellent and delivered solid performances so far. My curiosity is piqued.
180,"It could have been a great show, and it was, till they blew it all in the air.
The ending is just so shallow, illogical, uncreative, disappointing, cheap, stupid.
And it didn't have to be like that, on rhe contrary. Is it possible that the book has such a stupid end too?
Spoiler alert!!!
After Nicole's testimony at the court, the only logical end would be that she was the one, or at least her father, or even her son. But the ending with Hugh as a murderer (again) is just so out of any logic. Why did we ever watch 6 episodes??
So you are telling me he had to hide the hammer in the open fireplace of their own house instead of throwing it far into the river from that bridge he wanted to throw himself from at the end.
And he basically kills his lover for no good reason at all .
Stupid stupid stupid!!"
181,"The Undoing suffers like too many TV programs that show legal matters without hiring a lawyer to insure authenticity, On Episode 4, no lawyer would allow a criminal defendant to appear on TV. He had nothing to gain, and everything to lose if he said something wrong. It also was odd that Grace let Henry watch it and also watched it with Sylvia and her child.But that was noting like the debacle in Episode 6. Hearsay evidence, which is inadmissible, is defined as an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Both Jonathan's mother's statements and Grace's statement to Sylvia were hearsay and never should have been admitted. I forget the judge's reasoning, but it was wrong. Jonathan's lawyer should have done two things. She should have told Jonathan that if he was convicted, the judgment would be reversed by an appellate court. Then, when the cross of Grace was finished, she should have ripped her up on redirect for conspiring with the prosecutor and turning on the man she said she loved.These problems didn't have to happen. All that was necessary was a small investment in a trial lawyer to make sure the trial scenes were credible, Law and Order managed to get it right, and that never interfered with an interesting plot.."
182,"Lately HBO seems to adore the idea of a series with an amazing premise followed by the worst excuse for an ending imaginable. With ""The Undoing"", they once again succeed at this premise.Many thanks to HBO for wasting the time of their viewers once again by sticking to this premise.Awful."
183,"Juicy, Quality, edge of your seat but funny at the same time."
184,"A complete sham. A good Agatha Christie story could do in under two hours what this series failed to do in six. I won't say the end was predictable-more like so absurd that it makes you want to throw something. There must be some financial benefit in stretching a series to an intolerable length. Does the director get paid by the screen-minute? ""Ok guys, we have to fill three more hours. I want long pauses between sentences, and lots of staring."""
185,"I've seen two episodes, and can't wait to write a review. I watched home alone, in the evening, and akthough I'm not a skiddish person it was kind of creepy, even after I had turned the TV off. Good job, Bier & co! Two actors I think deserves extra cred is Noah Jupe and - of course - Nicole Kidman. Christ, you're extraordinary!To my ridiculously big joy, I just noticed that the third episode is available. It's daylight outside, that's kind of good, but I think I just have to leave the blinds down. It's kind of thrilling, feeling a bit freaked out. Enjoy you all!"
186,Fantastic show! First two episodes so far are just incredible and it's getting better and better.
187,I thought there would be big twists in the last episode considering there are so many things unexplained in the previous episodes. But no twists!!!!!! Jonathan is the murderer. Ugh I even waited the entire week for the ending. This show is a waste of my time.
188,"Silly story, silly script, silly acting, silly ending. Don't waste your time."
189,This is literally the dumbest show I've ever watched. NOTHING happens and it's exactly who you'd think did it if you use any logic or common sense. Complete waste of time.
190,"If you liked BLL and LFE, then you will love this one. This series is a cliche of the idle rich. How much time can Franklin realistically sit staring at a painting or playing chess? For a successful psychotherapist, Grace spends scarcely any time with patients. The characters seem as bored as I was watching them. I will watch it to the end only because I like Nicole Kidman, Donald Sutherland and NYC scenes."
191,First episode gets a 10! Great moody show with great acting. Same writer behind Big Little Lies which was a fantastic show. Excited about this one.
192,"We just finished the Series Wow ... Six Episodes of emotion and drama .This Show is just brilliant
Acting from Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant is first class both leads are exceptionally well supported .The Final Episode plays out with enough twists to finish with a gasp !
Some say the ending undermines the series not a chance ... The Undoing is superb"
193,......... and right now all we know for sure is .... the baby didn't do it.Love the show so far but worried this will carry over to a Season 2.
194,"I love D.E.Kelly's work and I love Hugh Grant's work.I have to suffer through the same insufferable miserable Kidman. But who cares she cant act, she looks great on camera after many many surgeries, who would not. And thanks to her constant tears we actually have an idea what emotions she is feeling as here face is completely porcelain without any lines. Hugh Grant gets to play a different role but yet his 'sarcastic comedic style' shines through but it is less annoying. Lets see if the story is actually something that is more noteworthy then known actors. I managed to watch till the end...and I dont regret it. But th show is very forgettable with many holes and rushed towards the end."
195,"REVISED REVISED REVIEW: RUN, DON'T WALK FROM THIS...ANOTHER MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE END!!!REVISED REVIEW: Lost In Manhattan...It's Edge & Expectations!

196,"Yes, it is creepily too much like ""Big Little Lies."" High-fashioned, perfectly groomed wealthy circle of Moms. Hysterically aghast affects as secrets and murder arise.By this time any streaming service ought to have its hands slapped for running a show like this weekly rather than allowing binge continuity. How antiquated of them!OK, now I've watched the whole thing and IMHO it is BS crap - something that might have been intended for ladies in the era of ""Redbook"" and ""Good Housekeeping."" Kidman, with the cutesy name ""Grace"" is a liar and manipulator. Her main ""tell"" is to warn her son, especially at the end, not to answer a question with a question, though that is what she's done almost entirely throughout the story. Check it out.Whether the author/director knows it or not, the whole thing is most realistically to be read as a fantasy of ""Grace""s perspective. What ""real"" woman psychologist walks around all the time with long curly Pre-Raphaelite hair and ankle-length coats and gowns, including solo in the dark in Manhattan, even in Central Park? Doubt it. And she gets on the stand in order to defend her husband's innocence, then reveals info that condemns him?Does ""Grace"" really have a psychotherapy practice? Well what the hell happened to it once the murder mystery commenced? She closed up shop? Her patients just took a sabbatical?So the kid finds the murder weapon and hides it because he wants to defend his Dad? Not a moment of suspicion about his Mom, who was strolling around in that neighborhood?Something is very, very accidentally or intentionally fishy about this glitzy melodrama. Including Kidman's botox face."
197,This is a slick whodunit that keeps you guessing till the last minute.Great performances from Kidman and Grant. Particularly Grant.I binge watched it in an evening and never flagged. I kept going up the wrong paths and didn't get it right. Very slick. A few silly coincidences to throw us off the trail and some standard courtroom drama tricks but they passed muster.Well worth the 6 hours invested.
198,"I'm 4 episodes in and felt compelled to write a review so here goes.I fell upon the Undoing and was intrigued by the story, mystery and the change in role by a typically typecast Hugh Grant. Expectations were high and I really felt this could be terrific and so far so good.The story is pretty straight forward thus far and is keeping me entertained, the mystery is intriguing but I have my theories 4 episodes in, I'll be disappointed if they pann out because my theories are hardly shock inducing and I'd rather a mega twist cap off this show than some obvious run of the mill ending I or we could see coming a mile away.Nicole Kidman is whimsical and magical in her role but I feel out of all they actors in this series Nicole is the one struggling to breathe life in to clumsy and at times weak script and dialogue. The short bursts of dialogue feel rained in and tire some, which fails to really enthral and capture my intention and as stated Nicole appears to be out of place in delivering the already weakend dialogue with any strength, gumption or believability.Hugh Grant is trying his absolute best and I take my hat off to him. Seeing him in this role is refreshing and because it's so out of character it feels believable. You can see him bursting to deliver a worthy performance and whilst not earth shattering its very well done.For me the showstealer is Donald Sutherland who effortlessly brings class, dynamics, truth and a real sense of purpose in what he is doing. His subtle ways are captivating and just a pleasure to watch. The man is a seasoned legendary pro who elevates with ease the previously stated lacklustre dialogue.Frustratingly its Nicole that I am struggling with, I feel her character is oddly playing with the detectives and giving them no real reason not to suspect her. Shes hardly shouting it from the roof tops that she is innocent and when they do confront her she is cold hearted and unsympathetic to the crime/victim. Her ice cold performance gives me no real reason to show the character sympathy for being cheated on and hurt and involved in all this mess. I should be rooting for her to uncover what happened as the woman scorned but shes acting more of a bad guy than her husbad who is supposed to be the bad guy.It's my hope that as the season progresses we see the brakes and the raines come off and we see some truly great scenes with heartfelt passionate dialogue that leads us powerfully to a explosive ending. I live in hope because this has the makings to be a excellent TV series."
199,"Wonderful cast...average plot. Wonderful scenery...average writing. Big budget...low result. Much of the series closely focused (literally) on Kidman's new face work (sad she felt it necessary imho) but now she has trouble expressing much emotion. As much as I've loved her in other roles, she was utterly unconvincing as a psychiatrist, but the writers have to take a lot of the blame here as well. 6 episodes could have easily been 4 and it still wouldn't have been worth the time. The shock value of repeatedly showing the brutal murder footage was clearly an attempt to get the audience emotionally involved....it failed to do anything other than force me to avert my eyes...again. To sum up the miniseries and save everyone time....husband cheats on perfect wife then kills mistress when she becomes possessive. YAWN."
200,"This ended up being a very expensive mess. And 3-4 episodes longer than it should be.I am surprised on how sloppy the writing was.
Weak character's development, many cliches and some of the worst court scenes in the history of drama TV.This is not supposed to be a ""whodunnit"".
In the book it is about the lead character discovering how ""fake"" her life and her marriage were.
Apparently they didn't trust the book's story and they tried to ""spice it up"" with murder mystery and red herrings, something that made things worse.
As a result, the focus was lost and the story's characters varied from poorly developed to quite indifferent.
At the end, you simply do not care about anyone really.. except maybe the poor kids that they PUT THEM inside a murder trial court for practically no reason at all. Except traumatize them for life. Yep, that dumb kind of writing..."
201,Vanity project for Nichole Kidman's new face... starts off ok but ultimately just a waste of time.
202,"Not sure why this show is all of a sudden getting hit with bad reviews. I really liked The Undoing. It had a good central mystery, compelling characters, and it always kept you guessing. It is a bit slow at times, but if you're looking for a mystery escape, give The Undoing a watch."
203,"I really enjoyed the whole twisty plot apart from Nicole's acting ability hindered by nerve damage from too much Botox... I found it fascinating and distracting to say the least.
Young Noah Jupe is very talented, Hugh is excellent at playing creepy and Donald Sutherland stalwart as always. Not sure second series is necessary but worth watching."
204,"Lots of haters out there. I ABSOLUTELY love the show. Hugh had me sold as innocent for most of it - I just see him as that quirky sweet British guy from 4 weddings & a funeral. I loved at the end that he had that lethal dark side to him that you just did not see coming. I started to think maybe Nicole was the killer and she just blocked it out. She was temporarily blinded to her spouse's real side, but only temporarily, and then the fog cleared and she took control.I love how Fitzgerald slams into that courtroom chair lol."
205,"Nicole reveals her Australian background by her endless time wasting ""walkabouts"".
Boring time fillers just adds yet another boing feature to this dull program."
206,"Why did Don Sutherland give Huge Grant $500000? Never explained
What was Sutherland doing outside of the studio?
The defense atty was so stupid to put the spurned wife on the stand!
The judge allowed hearsay to be introduced...Nicole could have saved us 6 hours by shoving Huge down a stairway under repair!!"
207,If you love Nicole Kidman you should definitely watch this and if you don't you should still watch it cuz it's one of the best show of 2020. Period
208,"A well written TV Series with very good cast and acting throughout all episodes.
To our honest opinion, it was not that obvious who committed the crime.P.S: I was rather sure it was Donald Sutherland since he is ""almost always"" the baddie in all films!!!!"
209,"I liked this show, the plot, the twists, the cliffhangers worked fine for me. I loved the beautiful pictures of New York, great addition to the show.
The biggest surprise was Hugh Grant and his stellar performance, loved watching every minute of it.
The low point was Nicole Kidman, absolutely unbelievable as a hot shot psychiatrist. It is hard to act without facial expressions and she has not much left - mostly wide opened eyes full of tears.
The final episode is great and surprising enough, but should have worked on the abrupt ending."
210,"For Donald Sutherland 's performance alone, I give it a top rating. As the powerful, but loving father and grandfather, Sutherland deserves an Emmy. I thought Kidman was fine...beautiful and ethereal. As a mental health professional myself, I believed she lacked credibility in her role as a clinical psychologist , but believe she played her part as the betrayed wife very well. And, by the way, what happened to her patients as her life was unraveling? Did she take a leave from her practice? Refer them to a colleague? Hugh Grant played Hugh Grant...the dapper charmer who's a cad and worse. Finally, for the cinematography alone, The Undoing deserves praise. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience."
211,Yes. Absolutely. Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman make such a good impression on this one. She is doing really well lately. And he is very reliable and getting back on track. Nice watching them together.
212,"So many twists. So many unexplored threads. I was waiting for an amazing ending. Maybe they all got together to subvert the trial. Nope, just a bad, bad end. Pbbbbbbbft."
213,"This show was Big Little Lies meets The Girl On the Train. I enjoyed this show very much, but agreed with some of the other reviewers. I am all for Hugh Grant being the killer and I think he did a great job of playing the charming sociopath. So charming, he had a well educated psychologist questioning what she likely already knew. The only thing I think they should have done differently was injected more scenes with clues deterring why it may have been Grant mid story so just when people would start to think he may be innocent, the twist would be that he was actually guilty. The story did play on those elements slightly with Grace being in the vicinity of Elena's apartment, Henry having the murder weapon, and the husband having violent tendencies. However, these could have been played up more so the audience could really start to doubt Grant's character committed the murder and then boom, he fooled us like he fooled his family. Overall, it was an enjoyable watch though. One of the better shows I've seen in a long time."
214,"Spoilers
Really enjoyed the series. Gripped from the first episode and there were enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the end. Sometimes a clever twist but in this just great acting as had almost dismissed Hugh as a suspect, probably half based on his back catalogue of nice guys. When he is good, he is good, but when he is bad he is better! No huge unanswered questions at the end, no unlikely 2nd season, just a nice gift wrapped mini series with a gripping beginning, twisty turny middle and a satisfying and oh so plausible ending. Sometimes we don't need a a scooby doo ending and makes a welcome change where the obvious candidate actually did it. More often than not the writers try to be too clever with the ending."
215,"In the middle of episode 2 so it's still early and I do plan to finish watching the series (and revise this review if needed). But so far, this lacks any subtlety, and the director and script writer try to create tension and suspense using jaded film techniques rather than allowing the story to develop organically.Failing grade for now."
216,"Don't waste your time on this six-hour snooze fest. Nicole Kidman's performance is blander than wallpaper paste and her face never moves. Silly story and overdone, over-stylized shots. Made me laugh at inappropriate times."
217,Bad acting bad story... Everything is at 1/10 rating.
218,People that are in the social strata depicted here do not talk to the police at any time. Their lawyers do the talking for them. But here's Nicole flapping her gums at the drop of a hat. Also they do not socialize with hoi paloi. Sure they will sponsor a scholarship but that's as far as it goes. No health clubs and no parties. What bologna
219,I'm calling it! The killer is her friend with the daughter in same school. Jonathan had an affair with her too and she got jealous! I'm almost certain!!! Engrossed...
220,"What I like best are the story which moves along at a rapid clip and the actors and Ms Kidman's hair. Took about two minutes of viewing to get me totally hooked and impatient for more. HBO and David Kelley deserve A++'s for their efforts. Nothing beats a well told, well acted Upper East Side of Manhattan mystery."
221,"To all directors: please, stop hiring her! Maybe for horror movies, but here, it's just distracting. She can't act, she can't even move her face properly. Miscast. Also, that fake her...."
222,"Not sure how they are going to stretch this out into 6 episodes. LOTS of Nicole Kidman walking on NY City streets. I love the casting, some of my favorites. Episode 1 was decent, but so far 2 and 3 have been pretty dull. Probably won't stick around for the rest."
223,"Hello, I'm from Indonesia. I really excited to watch The Undoing, my current fav HBO Miniseries. Nicole Kidman + Hugh Grant, OMG they are so perfect! It's so addictive to watch this movie, can't wait for the next episodes. So who kill Elena? Can anyone guess?"
224,"This show has an interesting start but gets slow really fast. Lots of needless scenes to showcase some sort of edginess or something. Breast feeding, closeup on the breast, locker room full frontal to get some attention. Then closeups of the actors eyeballs? Far too close to show any emotion, just really weird camera work.I made it to the end of Eps 3 and I'm done. The script falls off the cliff with so many opened questions, 12 second cut scenes, the police and prison scenes are all drawn out drama, and it closes with 5, yes 5 closeups of eyeballs again. WTF. Is this some new way to convey intense emotion?"
225,"SPOILER ALERT. MUCH OF THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT HOW THE STORY ENDS.SPOILER ALERTThe first 5 episodes were pretty good. This show works hard not to feel like a one-hour story crammed into 6 hours.The actors are good, and the acting is good. The writing isn't bad. The two actors that play the two sons do a good job of acting pretty much like real kids.Objections1. Movie makers use ""rain"" to set the tone and mood of a scene. I get that. This movie way, way over does the use of rain, to the point of, ""oh no, not again"".2. Clearly the onsite scenes, shot in the prison and at the courthouse, were all shot at the same time, even though they are supposed to take place on various days. That's forgivable, and it doesn't detract too much from the story, though it's hard not to think about it when watching the same scenes repeating in different episodes.3. The police detectives are too much like TV police. They interrogate the mom, without an attorney present, although they think she may be a suspect or an accomplice.4. The mom has a high priced, supposedly very competent attorney, yet she doesn't request to have her present when the police are questioning her.5. Some of the emotional scenes are just too much of too much.6. Still, overall, I rate the first five episodes pretty good. The final episode is a real disappointment, especially with all the build up to some startling, unforeseen conclusion.7. Who was the murderer? Was it the mistress's husband? He had the motive and the opportunity. Was it the grandpa? He was mean enough, and he hated his son in law. Was it the trusted girl friend? It was suggested that she may have had a relationship with the murdered mistress. These people were all prime suspects.8. If the story had ended at the end of episode five, that would have made an excellent ending. The scene is the 12-year-old son, peacefully sleeping and the mom coming into his dark bedroom to check on him.The mom walks over to the son's closest, kneels and opens her son's case, and in his case is the hammer, the murder weapon. Flash to the son, lying in bed, with his eyes now wide open, and unblinking.My wife and I both exclaimed in unison, ""Whoa, it was the son???. Wow!!!"" That would have been a great Hitchcockian ending. Leave the audience hanging on that possibility, and the murderer being someone no one suspected.But no, it was not to be.SPOILER ALERT...SPOILER ALERTThe murderer turns out to be the dad, the prime suspect. Boo. I wasted 6 hours waiting to find out what they could have told us in the first episode. It felt like one those long Internet videos that promises a great surprise that goes on and on and never delivers. Boo and Blah.Not only that, but the final episode also includes a double-cross by the wife who volunteers to testify for her husband's innocence. We find out that the wife has told her friend the truth about her husband's emotional and mental incapacity, and her friend has shared that information with the prosecuting attorney. The prosecuting attorney uses the information to discredit the wife's testimony. Why the heck didn't the high priced, professional defense attorney question the defense attorney on where she got her information? The wife should have been charged with perjury. She, a professional psychologist, testified that her husband was incapable of violence, and then the prosecuting attorney discredits her testimony with the wife's own set up /true testimony. The case should have been ruled a mistrial right then and there. That's bad writing, and it's bad story telling. It stinks up the whole story. Pew.The upside for the final episode, is the closing chase scene. That's pretty good, and we see very good acting from the dad and son.Other than that, by this point I was sighing, ""I wasted six hours on this?"""
226,I wonder if David E Kelly et al would admit to plagiarism of Presumed Innocent? It's good but fairly similar (down to the hammer) but a slight twist to make it arguably different. Is it just me?
227,Oh dear.The 1st episode was great. Some delightfully subtle tension.What an utter disappointment from there. The second episode revealed the ludicrousness of the whole premise. Part of the problem is that the hubby was far too lovely as both husband and father. Then the police involvement is totally farcical. Beyond a joke. The courtroom scene in Ep 3 would not have made it into a school play.If you could rank a series by episodes it would be 9* for the first and 1* or 2* beyond there.Sad.
228,"I watched The Undoing mainly for two reasons: 1) I was hoping the commitment of a quality cast and the money for a quality production would produce something worthy of the effort and expense; and 2) I was hoping the writer, David E. Kelley, would rise above his past offerings and give us something truly worthy of our time. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the final product.The excellent cast makes a huge effort in this series, there's no doubt. Hugh Grant, Nicole Kidman, and the rest of the cast, including Donald Sutherland, can't be faulted for their performances. The problem at it's root is the story and script. Kelley presents us with the same button-pushing conflicts that he featured in his television comedy series: racial, sexual, romantic, and class conflicts. He and the producers seem to have nothing new to say about any of these issues - he just wants to provoke our interest and keep us tuned in from episode to episode, or so it seems. There is no new ground covered here, and no fresh insights. It is just a tawdry spectacle, from start to finish.There are also problems with the credibility of the script. Are we really to believe that a man known by his wife and child and community for many years would suddenly reveal himself to be a violent, womanizing, homicidal sociopath with no remorse for killing someone? It happens, I'm sure, but not often. The actions of the police detectives are equally irrational and bizarre. Real detectives who were as careful and meticulous as they claimed to be in this series would have read the wife her Miranda rights before asking her about whether she murdered someone.The series isn't interesting enough to rate above a 3, but I gave it a 4 because of the efforts of the cast and the production values. Spend your time on something else."
229,"This has all the makings of a fantastic series, great storyline, class actors, obviously plenty of production money.But I'm sorry to say, after having been a life long NK fan, I am baffled why she chose or was chosen to play a part that demanded facial emotion. Apart from the odd tear here and there her face remained unmoved in even the most emotional scenes.This is obviously not her fault and I am not criticising anyone for having cosmetic plastic surgery, far from it, but why did she choose to play this part when her facial musculature is now incapable of doing her obvious talent, justice."
230,"See This movie, great acters and a perfect murderstorie"
231,"I am not saying that the show is bad or great but it was OK for the first 2 episodes. Now I am starting to get a cringy like feeling that the plot will fall apart and become just another twister and leave us all feeling ""WHY DID WE BOTHER""
There is no direct reason but you know when you are alone at night and after several small sounds you start to get this idea in to your head that something is amiss. EEEEKKKK! It is happening for me.
The reason why I am writing this is because I just wonder whether the script writers and the director are on the same page? The Kidman character is becoming unreal like the ""uncanny valley"" of a robotic human. It is not Kidman's fault though. Again its that feeling and usually that is the end of the suspense. Lets see."
232,I was hoping till the very end that this story is going to be worth watching. Somebody please give me back 6 hours of my life.
233,"I just finished watching Succession and compared to that - The Undoing is SO boring. I'm in the middle of episode 3 right now and I'm pretty sure I wan't watch episode 4. There's is absolutely no interesting characters in this. I can't even feel sorry for Grace, mainly because I have no idea how she's feeling - her face looks exactly the same independent of whether she os supposed to be sad, angry, happy or surprised. The two police man are also extremely annoying and their behavior makes little sense."
234,The story is engaging with the right amount of balance between mystery and drama. Nicole Kidman is a perfect lead. That is balanced by an awkward performance by Hugh Grant (maybe he should stick to romantic comedies?) and Donald Sutherland's Emmy worthy performance.
235,Two ageing stars in new murder-courtroom drama.Yawn.
236,"I was really excited for the upcoming shows this fall.And they all same to fall flat.I thought this show was the one that was gonna save this year for HBO but it was terrible.I'm gonna all the shows that premier in the last months.I usually watch every show new show they Air.Becuause They are just a few and they come every week so it's not like Netflix that they have many shows and throw them at once1.Lovecract Country:Inconsistent,Some episodes were unwatchable.Terrible Ending2.The Third Day:Stared Good With The Jude Law episodes but the last 3 flopped and the ending was bad.3.We are Who We Are-Extemley Boring and Pointless.4.The Undoing-And this one was poorly executed the editing makes it bad an just makes me angry by watching.I won't cancel my suscription because of the old shows.And stay for Barry 3.But if you continue with this batch of bad shows.It's over HBO.You hadn't Been the same since Chernobyl."
237,Would've been a 7-8/10 for first 5 episodes. But the ending was atrocious and flat
238,"I love the casts but God the show sucks, really weak and not sure if writers or the director knows how the real world works."
239,"First episode was excellent, second was very good and the third was yuck. It's now become one of those series where you dislike intensely every main character. Kidman's plastic surgery is very distracting and her character in the series is really quite stupid. Very very disappointing."
240,This is poor. The characters have no depth. Mostly two-dimensional. The writing is just ordinary - I cannot say it's good or bad - simply uninspiring. The two main characters are great actors but neither the writing or the plot does them any favours. It's quite clich√©d and predictable.
241,Overall the series is solid. It will keep you guessing from start to finish and is certainly binge worthy. Matter of fact you could make a long evening and watch them all no problems. Acting was good as well as the story. I think when its all said and done the real criminal in the series was the eyebrows... No question they are killers!!!!
242,"I love Hugh Grant in anything, the scriptwriters always give him a good 'turn of phrase' and his comic delivery is excellent. Nicole Kidman is talking in a 'normal' voice rather than her usual whisper, which is a plus. Storyline is promising after the first episode.Have to agree with the other reviewer about the interrogation of the little boy without an adult present. Also the other mums were scantily interviewed outside the school, so why take the interest further with Kidman's character in her own home ?As an aside - have Americans not progressed to electric toothbrushes yet ? Every film and drama where the characters are brushing their teeth - regardless of wealth or poverty, they all use a manual toothbrush !!!! as do the players in this drama WHY ???? Its the same with the lack of electric kettles in homes - are they too outlawed in American homes ? they all seem to use 'on the hob' type kettles, which are a rarity in the UK."
243,"Wow, the last 20 minutes were a huge disappointment.Mom jumps out of a helicopter and rushes past a line of police (who must have been distracted by the lovely views of the river) and grabs up junior and spirits him back to the city just as the police cuff dad. (It was really nice that the two officers that investigated the original case were able to join the cast on the bridge.)Don't ask how the helicopter magically caught up with the car in the first place or how the pilot found a place to land within 30 seconds of dad hitting the brakes--those last tortuous, nonsensical scenes in the courtroom had already dispelled the slightest whiff of reality.The last 20 minutes made the first 5 hours a total waste of time. Ugh."
244,"What could have been a good , decent show gets shadowed by Nicole Kidman's ... FACE ! Whatever she did to her face makes it difficult for her to show any humanly responses! Bad choice Nicole.."
245,This is the best show i have watched in my entire life
246,"Expressionless Nicole, stretched out scenes and lack of any thrill or excitement, if you are not a Nicole Kidman obsessed fan you are better off watching something else. Whole show was quite boring and lacked any twist. Garbage for lack of words."
247,"I know this is a mini-series but it isn't as ""mini"" as it could be. Seems to be a lot of ""filler"" with repeated shots and some not necessary scenes. That being said, apart from Hugh Grant the acting was wonderful."
248,"Terrible story, terrible acting. Without COVID-19 I doubt that this would have aired. I expect better from hbo."
249,I feel as though this whole series was to showcase Nicole Kidman's acting chops. Sure the execution was superb but the storyline felt like a six-hour long episode of Law&Order: SVU.
250,"Great actors reduced to a tiresome, dull script wrapped around the laziest attempt at tension I've ever witnessed. So bad. Don't waste your time"
251,"It had the potential to be something great but it was so difficult to keep interested.
Nicole kiddmans character was so boring and lacked any emotion which is such a shame as she normally plays such powerful characters in mini series.
It got to the point that I didn't actually care who did it.
The first episode had me gripped then it just went on a downward sprial of
bordem.
Some episodes didnt really have any content whatsoever and just felt like bulkers to pad it out a bit.
It was mega unrealistic and hard to believe that a wife would behave like that if her husband had been accused of murder and exposed as having an affair with the victim.
Very strange series and extremely disappointing from such high profile actors."
252,"...a murder mystery where the obvious suspect is the culprit!
What a huge disappointment! What a waste of production and talent!"
253,"So far it looks like a fancy - better done episode of Law And Order SVU. Good performances, more of Nicole Kidman doing a ""we rich people have problems too"" like in Big Little Lies but with the curly hair. And Hugh Grand doing more of...Hugh Grant."
254,"Tragic, really. He writes one good series, ""The Practice,"" and he's allowed to make rich people porn forever.
IT'S NOT MORE INTERESTING JUST BECAUSE EVERY CHARACTER IS LOADED.
Quite the contrary. But you live behind palace walls in LA long enough, you start to think you're superhuman, super interesting ubermenschen.
But you're not, Kelley; you're just a legal failure married to a hooker.
Not unlike this garbage you write."
255,"6,5
This series seems to follow the formula of Big Little Lies but I think the only thing in common is Nicole Kidman and a crime. This is another soapy TV show whith really good actors, just like we saw in Little Fires Everywhere and for that reason I am watching it. Also, can't deny that I love to see all the beautiful clothes, houses and lives from the privileged in NYC. The directing, cinematography and dialogues felt cheesy at times, but then you have great acting so I am just going to stick in here and see what happens. I expected something better from David E Kelley but it worked because now I am hooked up for next week."
256,"The team at HBO is getting more efficient - where it took 8 seasons of GOT, they were able to disappoint me with a weak ending after only 6 episodes here. I spent several weeks patiently waiting for the next episode - hanging, fingers barely gripping the cliff, in anticipation of a story that laid down red herrings and hints with cleverness and finesse. As it ended up, the whole story ended up being a way to tell a tale emphasizing the strength of women. Unfortunately, they forgot to tell Nicole Kidman, so she acted as a medium for a thriller. Yeah, the court room ending is somewhat interesting, with a little twist, but better would have been after finding out that Grace had Lilly hire someone to off Elena because she knew about the affair all along. The guy you've told us all along did it doing it is dull even in a documentary these days. If I had to do it again, I'd watch the first 5 episodes, then fill in #6 with imagination."
257,"Badly written, badly directed, badly acted. A boring, un-creative, un-imaginative tedious mess and a complete waste of time for the viewer. This is nothing but a reject script from a discarded Law and Order episode tragically expanded as a mini-series and given false, undeserved prestige under the HBO banner. Don't be fooled - it's awful!"
258,"This is nothing more than a six episode Lifetime mystery, but with better sets and costuming. Kidman looks (and acts) like a lifeless wax doll whose sole emotion is staring blankly at the camera. Hugh Grant is the same British cad he plays in every movie. Donald Sutherland and Lily Rabe are fantastic, but their characters are reduced to plot devices to move along the action. And the plot itself is straight out of a romance novel.I kept expecting it to get better. Oy."
259,"I have never written a review of a movie or show, but this one is so poorly executed, I had to see what others were saying. It has a super cast, and the story line may be good, unfortunately the lighting and direction is appalling. It is so bad it's comical."
260,"I think my headline is a pretty accurate summary so if you have not watched this, do not waste your life on this series.You think having Hugh Grant, Nicole kidman and Donald Sunderland should make this a good candidate for a watchable diversion. It seems to be a standard very poor quality script with no thought given to any shred of originality. Throw in a doctor with being British ( cue Hugh) being the a pretence at some new thinking; i have news for the writer. He needs to make some effort rather than just copy and paste the same old hackneyed ideas.What an utter waste of time for bored women with nothing better to do, no hobbies and no ability to grasp original thinking to watch and then pretend it was watchable. SUCH TOTAL DRIVEL."
261,Started with so much promise but sadly it wasn't to endure. I want six hours of my life back!
262,"This television show tries to be a show that shows a true crime/legal story. Unfortunately, it makes a complete mockery of both law enforcement and the legal system. Watching this show, objectively makes people less educated on how the legal system works. Many shows do this, but this takes the fictionalization of the legal system to another level. Every ""attorney"" on this show should be disbarred. If you watch this, please disregard everything you think this series shows about the legal system."
263,"I'm super surprised by the vast amount of negative reviews on this one. I was hooked from the first episode and disappointed when I found out it was only going to be 6 episodes all together. I bet people are disappointed by the ending after all the possible twists and turns the story could have gone in any direction but I found it actually surprising that Jonathan (Hugh Grant) was the killer. They did such a good job of convincing us it wasn't him that I kept trying to figure out who it could be even though all the evidence pointed to Jonathan.I will admit that I didn't love the last episode and the ending itself, not the way the story turned out but the whole chase and final scene. Sure they could have ""shocked"" us all and had Henry (Noah Jupe) or Franklin (Donald Sutherland) wind up being the killer but people would have complained about that too. People still to this day complain about The Sopranos ending even though it's so well done as David Chase gave you everything you needed except actually showing Tony getting shot but you had to understand the point of view shots and people want the ending to anything great handed to them.This show is definitely worth the watch in my opinion and held my attention throughout every scene as I tried to figure out what could have happened that night in the art studio. In the end it was the most obvious answer that surprised me the most and that's different than most stories like this.
-SweeZ"
264,"Overall I REALLY enjoyed this show, every episode left with a huge cliff hanger making me want more. I love Nicole Kidman's acting as always. The show had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I love all of the hidden metaphors throughout the series showing duality and how you can never truly know someone. I thought that intro song was brilliant as a metaphor for how grace lives in a dream world and doesn't see the reality of the situation and who her husband truly is."
265,"It was actually a catchy and thrilling show but it could be much much better. i think the point was just for us audiences to beleive that it wasnt john and then find that we were played. also ther was absolutely no sign of him being a narcissist person at least we did not see it and we only heard it from Grace !! so obviously it was unpleasantly surprising finding that he was such a different personality with no freaking sign. also Grace was a very neutral character she couldve been so much involved and become more affective, but she was just worrying and thinking all the way in the show.
i just wish it was longer than a mini series and instead it became more complex and engaging and breathtaking."
266,"Kind of enjoying this.
Agree that Nicole Kidman is a bit so/so wispy in this but think she's meant to be? Maybe she's a better actress than we think.
I like Hugh Grant in it.
But anyhoos - just came here to say I'd like to put a punt out that the kid did it and the dad is covering it up.There. I said it."
267,"Really? Am I the only one who see they are too old for this roles? Usualy I don't leave comments, but this is terrible."
268,"I am hyper critical of any streaming platform ""Short-series"" (or film) from HBO, Amazon, and (especially) Netflix. I find over 95% of them unwatchable. In a word, most are incredibly gratuitous in one way or another. The massive levels of promotional make me ill. I have 2 recent exceptions: HBO Europe's ""Beforeigners"" (2019), which had no promotion. Set exclusively in Norway (Oslo), it is outstanding. I found it increasingly changing for the better. It begins funny and fascinating. However, it slowly changes into mystery and suspense. I would give my little finger to be Krista Kososonen's agent! She is superb! A brilliant actress, intelligent, witty, and easy on the eyes. The other show I liked was Amazon Studio's ""Zero, Zero Zero"". I had to skip some of the episodes as they were predictable and boring (maybe 3 of 8). The rest were terrific! As far as this series goes, I have to wait and see. I cannot judge the entire series from a single episode. It is interesting. So for now, I give it a 6/10. Wait and see!"
269,"I got bored a bit in the first few episodes, they seemed to be dragged out to simply make it a big series.Then through the boredom Nicole Kidman's character became more and more annoying, huffing and puffing, every sentence through a gasping whisper, her ridiculous hair style, the seemingly endless walking around New York looking statuesque.First time in a long time I've given up on a series, but this just became a drawn out painful montage of whispers, over acting, pointless drama, for example a 3 deep wall of paparazzi outside a school everyday after one murder ? Of course with poor Nicole the centre of attention, but off course she walks into it wide eyed going 'what's going on ?', squads of police searching her home, outside school and home, not one or two but 10 or so plus reporters using flashes everywhere, Hugh Grant genuinely looks in pain."
270,"This was excellent up until the final episode. So many unanswered questions ultimately led to a very predictable ending with no twist. In many ways, this series would have been much better had they just ended it after episode 5. Such wasted potential."
271,Couldn't take my eye off the lips. Hideous. Why can't these stars just grow old naturally?
272,"The first episode was not wholly terrible, but the last five got progressively worse, and overall, this series was simply awful. It was a bad story, badly performed. In the end, the amount of real plot probably wouldn't have filled a one hour ""Law and Order"" episode, so the dumb would-be plot twists added in to fill out six episodes turned out to be a lot less twist and a lot more dumb. The melodramatic overacting of Kidman, Grant and Sutherland have to be the worst of each of their respective (and otherwise laudable) careers, although to their credit, they were delivering some terrible dialogue. Ms. Kidman's stage whisper line deliveries got old quickly, and her recently tightened face (don't remember it in ""Bombshell"") limited the emotion her character was able to convey. Whomever wrote the lawyer-involved scenes had no familiarity with the law, and not even the remotest knowledge of the rules governing the presentation of evidence in court. No lawyer would conduct themselves as those did in this series, and no judge would have allowed them to. So, to recap: bad, bad, bad. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
273,"Each and every performance is horrid and contrived. There isn't one likable character. Hugh Grant uses his patented facial expression well beyond its expiration date. Not a chance that there was a police consultant used, as procedure is non-existent. Take a pass. Absolutely nothing to see here"
274,"With such a stellar cast, it is shocking how poor it is!
I echo others sentiment that Nicole Kidman's wooden approach to her character leaves the show flat. It's a bit disconcerting. I can't tell if her detachment is part of what she's trying to portray or just bad acting.
Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland are alright.
The story line...why would the press mob over this murder case? Because they're rich? A private school is involved? It's all so unbelievable and grandiose.
And I haven't gotten to the alleged shocker, and I know the answer already. It's pretty obvious.
Lastly, Grace unbelievably walks around alone late at night far too often for a woman let alone in NYC."
275,"The story actually begins with a very realistic day of a rich family but as minutes go by, the plot turns more and more irrational to a point of a complete absurd.
At 4th episode, when Hugh Grant visits the widower and they share a moment with the baby, or on 5th episode when he tells his wife he's to blame for his sister's death (in a manner of ""oh sorry, did I forget to mention it before?""), This is when you completely lost me.
This is a pathological lier we're dealing with, and it makes her a not so hot-shot psychologist after all.
The amount of lies they keep throwing at us is just indigestible. it's preposterous.
P.S - is it me or Nicol Kidman seems to be playing the same character every time? (Big Little lies.. Aha-hmm)"
276,"The ending was an absolute let down and I felt like I was duped into watching a fancy Nicole Kidman and charming Hugh Grant film that just didn't hold up at all. The plot twists were terrible and to have it end the way it did just left me going ""REALLY?!""
This was such a terrible ending that I'm writing my first ever review."
277,Like ever...Did i spend 7 hours on a movie that turned sh...t in the last one - no plot - no nothing - what a wate of good acting... ever...
278,"I instantly skipped past Nicole Kidman's vapid trilling of ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" in all 6 episodes, and once past that ordeal, the series was good.A story of murder and betrayal among New York City's pampered elites is well done for the most part, but as with DEFENDING JACOB, end ending left me cold.Story has Kidman as a snooty therapist married to a famous oncologist (Hugh Grant) with a 12-year-od son in a private school. The school has a handful of ""scholarship"" students and Kidman is on a committee with the mother of one of these kids. Then she gets killed.Kidman's character seems weird. The mother seems even weirder. As the story unfolds, Grant turns out to be a prime suspect in the killing of the mother. It's then revealed that Kidman's father (Donald Sutherland) has always hated Grant and campaigns to get Kidman to take the boy and bail, leaving Grant to fend for himself.Instead she sticks by Grant and Sutherland ends up having to pay millions in bail money. But while the police pursue Grant as the main suspect, others also seem to have motives to have killed the woman. Many secrets are revealed during the court hearings. The ending, however, is very weak.Co-stars include Noah Jupe as the son, Lily Rabe as Kidman's best friend, Edgar Ramirez as the nasty detective, Douglas Hodge as the public defender, Rosemary Harris as Grant's mother, Matilda De Angelis as the dead mother, and Noma Dumezweni as the lawyer (especially excellent)."
279,A plot so ludicrous and preposterous I won't even waste my time writing a review for this stinker. I'll leave it at this... Fried clams.
280,"Transparent, flat story.
Next role for Kidman: Joker"
281,Are you kidding me?Stupid ridiculous ending that explained nothing.What were Nicole Kidman and Donald Sutherland thinking signing up to this disappointing piece of trite?As for Grant? Public toilet
282,"Ugh, what to say. The series was captivating and could have easily been an 8 or 9, but that ending was just so disappointing! The teased and anticipated twist never happened.
It was still fantastic acting though. Hugh Grant was a hit as always (although it was hard to see him in such a dark role). Nicole Kidman, Noah Jupe... even the lovely attorney hit it out of the park."
283,"The UndoingWell, well, what a thrill, this was a stylish, clever game of cat and mouse with the viewer being the mouse. Forget Nordic Noir, forget forensics, forget any logical motive or reason, the whole plot rested on emotion and duplicity, it really was a most refreshing drama.The whole impetus of the plot was driven by Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, whilst we didn't know it until at least episode 4, whatever she believed to be the truth arrived at the decided conclusion.The pendulum of who was the murderer swung this way and that, was it the husband, her lover, the grandfather, the wife of the lover or perhaps even the 14 year old grandson. I, of course, got it all wrong, but that was the joy and frustration of this tense drama.We had some big hitters with Kidman, Grant and Sutherland and they left no menacing stone unturned.Not for those with a heart complaint, or wanting their crime fiction served on a plate. This was modern Agatha Christie at its best and nothing was revealed until the denouement.I'm giving this a hard 8 for raising my blood pressure!"
284,I could not stop watching. Absolutely beautiful cinematography of New York. Nicole was amazing in her role.
285,"I did enjoy this, however somehow, I feel a bit short changed as well. Hugh Grant and the young man who played his son were tremendous. Great to see Hugh Grant, change his roles and the young man has a great career ahead.
I feel there is many questions unanswered though"
286,"It was way to long, hard to get past Nicoles plastic surgery and the ending was just plain silly..."
287,"I give it 3 stars for costumes and interiors: love the Max Mara cashmeres and Chloe silks on Lily Rabe!Otherwise: it seems to be the third season of BLL. Same formula, but much weaker. The story is too stretched for 6 episodes. It is banal. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grand are just too old and tired.A minor point: with that green coat and the long curly wig Kidman looks like Galadriel or Arwen, or just someone out of Lord of the Rings and the son IS Frodo."
288,Random full body nudity.Helicopter rides.Millions.Crying.What did I just waste my time watching?
289,"Massively overrated.
Miss cast.
Poorly written.
Ridiculous ending."
290,"This is a C-rate drama that belongs on ABC, not HBO. Undoing could have been shortened to a 110 minutes instead of 6 episodes of twists that never materialized. The show was almost saved by Hugh Grant's acting until he attempted crying and blew it for everyone. The script, direction and cinematography were crummy. This program would have never been made before AT&T's purchase of HBO."
291,"One after the other. The only chance that this series will be anything remotely good is if there is a second season and Hugh Grant it's not the killer. Boring, shallow and dull. Nothing different then every actor playing themselves."
292,"This show had such potential, and I want to be clear that the two stars belong solely to Donald Sutherland. Literally no other character on the show was remotely relatable or even likeable.Kidman's character just drifts around New York, attempting an air of European elegance while simply coming across as vapid and aloof. She stares at literally everything and conveys nothing.It was a chore to get through the last three episodes which says a lot since it is only a six episode series. I truly can't not recommend this enough unless your idea of a fun time is watching grass grow or a voluntary root canal."
293,"Disappointed overall - with a cast like that I expected a lot more. Acting was completely sub par, as a result of very bad directing.
I gave it a 7 only bc of the story and the cast - which is generous."
294,"Wasn't a fan of it,I kept watching it to conclude the story but it was a bit of a let down altogether"
295,Nicole's face is distracting and way too many holes in the story
296,"I know that the writer try to point out that we don't have to look further, sometimes it is just simple as it is. Okey I get it but I am seeing simplicity in every day of my life. That's why I am looking for some movies or series to see the creativity and imagination with mind blowing. I have to say that in some scenes Nicole Kidman looked scary. I expected something connected to physcological mind gaming or something shocking happened. ALSO the ending was so meaningless like Wtf.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT. IT IS THE FIRST THING YOU THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPENED."
297,"Just terrible. Even if you only hope for some basic, old school whodunnit, this series fails enormously. Hugh Grant can only play 1 character and that's Hugh Grant. He can get away with it (sometimes) in romcom stuff but here he is a complete miscast. You just can't believe he is the person he pretends to be. Nicole? Man, she's horrible, with all that plastic filler in her face, she just has no expression, which makes her creepy and ugly (those eyes!). Just weird. Her vocal chords also seem to have been treated with botox: one dimensial, whether she's happy, upset, sad or angry... all the same boring tone. Then there are some more fillers... in the script: plenty of unnecessary scenes, shots, dialogues just to stretch the whole thing into 6 hours. The ending is predictable from episode 1. Watch Cardinal instead. Also 6 episodes but what a treat."
298,"While it might have taken this long, this is proof that hbo will remain undefeated whenever they try. Four years since the night of but boy was it worth it."
299,"Acting was great but we knew who did it from the start, why burn the episodes.
Shaykh kill her and basically keep the murder weapon rather than throw it in the Hudson River.Disappointed."
300,"The story telling and character development wax extremely weak for a project associated with David Kelly. Very poor insights into character motivations, such as detectives, attorneys and even protagonists. The initial focus on Kidman's professional career seems to evaporate as the story progresses. Aside from gratuitous nudity and some salty language, this easily could have been a made for TV movie on any network."
301,Never sees his lips move. Pity could never understand what he's saying.
302,"Totally agree with Time Magazine.
I too felt insulted watching the final episode."
303,"Apparently the book is very different to the show, and I wish they had kept it like the book. Instead they tried to make the show full of twists but there actually were none. Nicole's face (and lack of movement and emotion) was very distracting as well as her bad American accent. Hugh did a good job. Donald Sutherland was wasted in this role. There were so many things that made me laugh even though they weren't supposed to!
The ending was stupid. I'm glad it was only 6 episodes or I would have given up after the 3rd."
304,"Predictable ending, What was frustrating is that the entire series led you to believe it may not of been Hugh Grant but in the end it was him. It would've been a greater ending if it had been Nicole Kidman or even Nicole Kidman's father or someone else who is less suspicious but in the end it was Hugh Grant. Boring ending could've had such a better ending."
305,It is a really good show. However I will have a request from the director of the series. Change Nicole Kidmans coat
306,"Well, me and my girlfriend thought this was going to be a smart and unpredictable tv-series but the last episode showed us we were fooling ourselves all along. The script and acting in the last episode was embarrassing."
307,"I was excited for this series and had high hopes considering the excellent cast. However, episode after episode, I was getting more disappointed and the irritating and sloppy last episode really sealed it for me. I actually thought that Kidman would be the murderer for a long time, she really seemed off. There were so many interesting clues and brain teasers that eventually didn't lead anywhere. It was the first, obvious suspect all along. Kidman's performance wasn't bad, she obviously is a great actress, but I was badly distracted by her wax cabinet face that could produce only one expression. Basically, only her eyes are moving which really affects her ability to bring emotion over to the viewer which negatively affects her acting performance. This series could've been so much better, such a shame really."
308,"So we knew who the murderer was after episode 2, no big twist at the end. Very disappointing."
309,"Wow a crime story that is taking place in NYC with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant. When i first saw it i was really excited about seeing Hugh Grant on screen but halfway through the first episode i felt like there was something wrong, something that just didn't feel right. There is nothing that pulls you into the story. Instead of being on the edge of my seat i was laying back as far as i could. I really don't know whats worse the script or the acting performed by Nicole Kidman. The characters feels so generic, the acting was not good as i was expecting and a horrendous script. I feel like they did my boy Hugh Grant dirty with this film."
310,"It was a 9 star until last episode, where I still believed Donald did it. But then....people leaved the cinema, sorry. So bad ending...seriously? Who gives you the right to make fun of intelligent people? You are putting our mind to work for what? FOR WHAT? Shame"
311,Very disappointing and predictable ending. Could have been so much better!!! Theres literally 100 different ending I could think of that would have made this much better.
312,"I almost shut it off during the kitchen scene when the camera person was dashing back and forth doing 180's around the room from every angle and kept getting stuck on the stairs looking down at the characters for some Godforsaken reason, but I stuck with it because of Hugh Grant mostly. The scene in the park where the camera person is reaaaaaally far away, then he's close in, then he's far away again a split second later is absolutely ridiculous - its a Dad walking his kid to school - you don't have to set up the shots like its a car chase. Please go to film school!
But if you get past the first episode the professionals take over and the production crew steps back behind the scenes where they belong to let the actors do their jobs and it turns into a highly watchable murder mystery. I'm on ep 4 now and can't wait for the next one."
313,"A waste of good viewing time. There were many holes, inaccuracies and inconsistencies.
So many things were never explained, not least of all Grace's ability to identify sociopathic narcissism in her husband, but not the victim who displayed nothing but this condition (the fundraising meeting, the kiss with Grace, the locker room, her appearance at the fundraiser). She was a clearly disturbed character, but psychologist Grace never mentioned this at all. It was highly believable that she stalked Jonathan.
Her very expensive and varied wardrobe would suggest that Grace herself suffered from some form of narcissism.
The discovery of the sculpture's hammer was totally unbelievable and very lazy writing.
Grace was told by the victim that she lived in Harlem and as her studio was within walking distance Grace must have known she was in the neighborhood, which she denied knowing.
Was Jonathan's violent tendencies displayed when confronted in the prison just for the audience's benefit? It was never mentioned in court when his character was being assessed.
The full graphic frontal female scene in the locker room was totally unnecessary.
Was this to shock or gain some sort of notoriety for the show?
The point was, standing naked before Grace in discussion and observing Grace's reaction.
Grace was sitting down facing the other way when the scene opened, so the frontal nudity was for the audience only.
Also, she obviously had not given birth a couple of months previously.
Profanities and F bombs are just too tiresome now. Not necessary if the writing is powerful enough to convey what purports to be some sort of reality.
As the drama progressed the increasing close ups of Nicole Kidman had me distracted by her mouth which seem to have a dolphin look, whereby her lips outline finishes well before her mouth extremities.
The close ups make her look unnatural, like she is wearing a tight mask.
Her nighttime walks with wild hair and long coats made her looked like she had escaped from a Harry Potter set.
A fine performance from Hugh Grant, but I prefer him as the cheeky likeable rom-com characters he is famous for."
314,1st episode was really good. And then the 2nd and 3rd came.
315,First episode was good. Second episode lost me. I simply fell asleep.
316,"First episode was terrific, and I looked forward to second episode. It, too was revealing but could have been condensed into 15-20 minutes of tight storytelling. The extended shots where nothing happens is a conceit of directors with 8-10 hours to fill with boring, meaninglessness content."
317,"This should have been a movie, and maybe it was before they stretch it out to fit the frame of a miniseries.
Nicole Kidmans autotuned voice on the intro track doesn't make it better."
318,"Appears as quality, but devolves to a lazy who done it, with maddingly implausible scenarios and cheap cliffhangers. Expected better from sonething with the HBO mark."
319,"Hugh Grant, Nicole Kidman and Edgar Ramirez all deliver fine performances but the script is truly unbearable - zero originality, meaningless dialogue that seems to go on forever, pointless scenes that have no apparent connection to the story and a plot which leads absolutely nowhere. The sheer pretentiousness, the evident pointlesness and an incredibly dull finale - just as the show had managed to build up some actual suspense towards the ending - just ruins the whole thing. All in all, a waste of your time. I am sure even Susanne Bier is at a loss as to why this series got made in the first place."
320,"Well, I really wanted the killer to be either Grace or the son. Too predictable for it to be the dad."
321,"I thought that the terrible final season of Game of Thrones made HBO aware of bad endings, but they somehow managed to destroy an amazing show in a matter of minutes. Again!"
322,"This is a fairly good thriller/murder mystery. It keeps you interested till the very end (except for the last 10 minutes).
Thought Hugh Grant did very well in the lead male role with good supporting acting by Noah Jupe. New actress Matilda De Angelis did a fine job.
The only negative to the whole show is Nicole Kidman's acting. Definitely below par for her. Because of excessive cosmetic surgeries to her face it is tough to make out any facial expressions... and in some cases downright distracting to watch her."
323,"Very torn with this one as it's a great production with some great shots and scenery.
Donald Sutherland was good, and Nicole and Hugh were ok as a couple. Some parts were just a bit too far fetched for my liking. I don't think they needed a big plot twist that others thought was needed...it's just a portrait of a narcissist so they tried to make him likeable...a reason to explain why she wanted to believe he was innocent but he keeps letting her down. Until she finally stands up to him.
The last episode though... so many plot holes, kids been going to the trial all along and suddenly on the last day he goes to school??"
324,"I'll choose not to fill in the blanks and ruin it for new recruits. Fantastic for five episodes, then it went off a cliff. Such a shame as the same ending could easily have been reached without the story being compromised."
325,"I guess they raised the expectations so high that the end is ""meh"".
The beginning is quite exciting and truly intense - all the mixed feelings that surrounds the spectator really captivates their attention (at least was what I felt!).
HOWEVER, the end kind of disappointed me. Considering all the drama and suspense of the story, I was expecting a HUGE plot twist - sadly, this didn't happen.
At episode 4 I was able to predict the true murderer (but always keeping the faith that I would be surprised)Ultimately, it is a good mini-series and didn't regret to watch until the end (nor would I have endured if it were otherwise xd)
Have fun whatch it - or not! eheheh"
326,"First of all I'm so shocked of Mr. Fraser behavior but every single human being has his deep personality after all he's a killer. secondly, i'm so upset of the severe criticism from the majority of the audience!, I mean what is the end that they are expecting?"
327,"It was great to see Hugh Grant play against type, and this was definitely his show. Donald Sutherland was great, but didn't score enough screen time. Nicole Kidman played Nicole Kidman; unfortunately there was way too much focus on her character, when she was the least interesting part of the show. Essentially we have a six part who-done-it with suspicion falling on various characters until the final reveal. At that point the show just started getting interesting but by then it was all over."
328,"I really enjoyed this show for the most part except that last episode. There were alot of clues and red herrings and there were moments when anyone could have been a suspect. I feel like the writers thought they were being unique and going in a different route than most psychological thriller tv shows by making the reveal what it was, but it was honestly just too disappointing, not shocking and seems lazy. It is a bingeable show but after that ending I kind of regret wasting all this time on the show. If I had been spoiled about the ending before then honestly I wouldn't have even bothered watching this show."
329,I thought Nicole Kidman was outstanding. She does an excellent job portraying the conflict within the character with just the looks and expressions on her face. Solid plot with twists and turns and great acting.
330,"Tropes layered on top of tropes, smothering a layer of exaggerations, which only serve to hide unrealistic characters and an endless spew of cliches. I can't believe that Nicole Kidman acted in this without vomiting in her own mouth.It's like a frat boy's idea of a Harlequin Romance mated with a sheltered and uneducated domestic servant from a rural mountain village in Eastern Europe's idea of life in New York."
331,"Hugh Grant gives us an excellent performance; followed by the exceptional supporting talents of Noah Jupe and Norma Dumezweni. Other than that, I pity any individual who had to sit through this pretentious garbage all the way to its clumsy, bitter-end. It's as if the writers decided we should care so much about a rich couple and their problems of overtly spoiled wealth, lies, sex and violence only for them to throw all plausibility out the window during court and the climatic, yet stupid, car chase. Would it be too much for the father to just toss the murder weapon over the bridge and into the Hudson River? Edgar Ramirez is insufficiently used and just floats in the background. Donald Sutherland is well... Donald. And my God, Nicole!! Did you forget how to act?? Close-ups of melodramatic faces don't count. The filmmakers should be ashamed of creating such a fail of a series. Then again, it hasn't been all that long since HBO has released something this bad (Game of Thrones series finale?). And for what? So more people sitting at home during a pandemic could cancel their subscriptions? Don't waste your time with this nonsense. Anyone who has seen ""The Gentlemen"" already knows how well Hugh Grant can act. Three stars for the three professional actors previously mentioned who were able to pull off the crap script they were saddled with."
332,"This is a message to the actresses, mostly studios, agents and whoever else who put the pressure on women to look perfect. On high definition TVs the evidence of injection fillers in the face, botox and mini-facelifts are distracting from the story and making it difficult for the viewer to believe in the character, the whole time is spent analyzing what's strange about the actress's face. Apart from that I recommend the series. Intriguing."
333,"An editor with a pair of scissors could have made a reasonable 100-minute movie out of this six-part series. Anyone watching this with the expectation that it is a tight and gripping thriller is going to be disappointed. Make no mistake, this is a soap opera, pure and simple. Sure there are a few cliff hangers and red herrings thrown in to try and create tension, but this is really about gawking at the trials and tribulations of people much richer than us.This is certainly star studded - Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland. As you would expect, the acting is top notch. Donald Sutherland, in particular, steals the screen whenever he appears, although his role isn't huge and, frankly, I don't know why he wasted his time. Some of the behaviour of the characters in this struck me as quite unbelievable. Many times I found myself shaking my head and marvelling at just how stupid some of these people were. This series also boasts the two most irritating and obnoxious police detectives I have ever seen on screen.All this being said, this series will no doubt be very successful as it provides what many people seem to be looking for these days - the opportunity to watch rich people behaving badly."
334,"Seems like nowadays screenwriters can only make a good start, but when the end is on horizon, - their talents are washed away. What was that in the last episode? How could the story turn into this? A total disappointment. Not the end itself, but the way the whole story came to it. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant are great actors, but it would be better to pay more money for better screenwriters. I thought it's worth 9 stars, but for the last episode I gave the show only 5. Sorry."
335,"Off-topic: This is my first review on IMDb - I'm certainly not a cinephile but I think I can recognize something wrong when I see it.Specifically, this series plays some tricks in the course of its episodes that I did not enjoyed at all. I felt led in certain directions only to be misleaded, plot paths whose only aim was to ""stretch the soup"". I did not feel respected as a viewer. Perhaps these words may seem a bit drastic... but the closed paths the plot takes you to are too many that it is impossible to ignore them.1) First of all, Johnathan's guilt was already clear to the aware viewer starting from the second / third episode: in fact, Johnathan's ""business trip"" had been scheduled for a few days (we learn about it during the first episode). However, he says he ran away the day after the murder because he was afraid of the situation that would inevitably put him in an uncomfortable position. It is therefore clear that the murder was premeditated but... No character, ever, emphasizes this fact. For me it is just unbelievable, such neglect disturbed me up to the last episode.2) For several episodes we are led to believe that Grace is the killer. The agents even name a series of phone calls that Grace would have received from Elena, phone calls that take place off-camera and initially make us believe in a surprise epilogue in which it turns out that Grace and Elena knew each other much more deeply than presented during the first episodes ... epilogue that obviously will not come. Those phone calls are no longer brought up. That's not sidetracking to me, It's just a pointless waste of screentime.3) During Johnathan's TV interview, he says he knows who the culprit is. Cliffhanger. We await the next episode to know the answer, most of us are expecting a twist where he says he thinks it was Grace. Twist that does not arrive. Later, and with much less emphasis, we learn that Johnathan's suspect is Elena's husband. Groundbreaking.4) At some point in the series, for no reason, we see Grace's father secretly going to spy on Mr Alves. We are therefore led to believe that Mr Reinhardt is up to something, but this suspicion turns out to be meaningless and another dead-end plot path.5) When Haley talks to Johnathan in prison we are introduced to the idea that there is a second woman in Johnathan's past. The subsequent events of the series (at least to me) led me to believe that it could be Grace's best friend, Sylvia, who is introduced to us right away as one of the main characters (we know that she gave some advice to Johnathan regarding his dismissal). Unfortunately, aside from her small role in the epilogue, it seems Sylvia's job is to be ambiguous and carelessly answer Grace's phone calls.I think that's all... I might have missed something though.On a positive note, the series had a great photography and the acting was excellent from almost everyone. Sutherland and Grant especially were amazing. Kidman was great too, but at times she seemed a little confused on how to portrait herself: I think this was intentional, or maybe she wasn't sure either about the involvement of her character on the murder.Lastly, let me just say that I don't demand a thriller series to be immediate or explicit: I'm fine with plot tricks to sidetrack the viewer, I just don't like it when I feel like the plot is treating me like I'm dumb.My verdict: Not great nor bad. Some major plot holes. Definitively entertaining if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the suspence."
336,"A somewhat courageous attempted clone of ""The Sinner"". Hugh Grant plausible in his attempt to follow McConaughey's transition from rom-coms."
337,"First of all, I don't understand how this crap got 7.7 on IMDB. 2ndly, it would have been better if it was one and half hour movie than over 6 hours excruciatingly slow limited series.The writing was so lazy that in the end it really made no sense of existence of this drama. The story started quite good but then from 2nd episode onwards it just went downhill. I always thought that it will pick up at some point and will give us a 7.7 rating surprise, but it was like the plane never left the runway.I will not recommend this to anyone."
338,"""The Undoing"" starts out very well.It places the chess pieces calculatingly,uses a lot of wide angles and close ups to up the tension and maintains a sense of intrigue.However,things start to fall off in the second half of the season.It seems a 45-50 minute runtime was a bit too long for the tension to survive.Inspite of a lot of things going for it,the tension fizzles out due to some poor writing.Grace Fraser,played by Nicole Kidman comes off as a very confused woman who really doesn't know what she wants right uptil the end.This is not her 'trauma' or 'stress' getting the better of her but she just seems like a weak person overall.On the other hand,Franklin Reinhardt,played by Donald Sutherland is an interesting character that is not explored well enough.Same for Sylvia,etc.In the end,the show was nothing more than a weak ""whoddunit"".If I judge it as a 'psychological thriller' then also it falls well short of it's promise.It is disappointing because all the ingredients are there.The direction is good,the performances of almost all actors is very good,the music is decent and the show doesn't seem to have been constrained by resources but the writing lets the show down.All in all,it ends up being little better than an average show."
339,"First of all, I signed up for HBO for Prime to watch this series, so kinda pissed that they made you purchase the last episode!!!
All of the episodes were great, but, felt it was tied up in episode six too quickly which made the ending disappointing and I felt cheated.
Nicole was a beautiful woman and it makes me sad that she has chosen to use filler to the point that her expressions are almost gone. I hope that actresses start to except their age better so that their craft doesn't start to suffer because of their chase to escape a natural wrinkle.
We want to see real people! That's why I tend to keep to European films where people aren't 'perfect.' They are so much more relatable."
340,"Episode 1 was good, 2 meh. 3? nope, its turning into one of those.. well, lets just make stuff up and throw it in there completely diverting from the story in a totally different direction. next will be some hunter thompson wacky trippy crap to ""make it all work"". the only thing I like about this series is hbo FINALLY didnt shove any pennisses in our face, yet, but rather showed some nice tail mmhhmm ;) 3 stars for that and only that."
341,"Nicole Kidman has had so much Botox you can only tell she started acting by when she physically moves. This is a well made , well written show with pace. But Nicole Kidman's Botox-face is just irritating. How can you act a scene when you only have A single permanent slightly confused scowl for a face? She ruined this for me."
342,Bad acting. Kidman over acts as the aggrieved wife. Slow plot. All those pointless long shots. Story is barely tolerable. No sympathy for the 1% and their trappings of wealth.
343,"Started off well, but descended into a rather farcical storyline. Why would there be media hysteria over the death of an average young female. ? Why would cops fly around in helicopters, landing on a suspect's front lawn just to question her ? Why is Nicole Kidman constantly sighing, huffing and puffing ? Once you pick up on that it becomes irritating.
Littered with boring scenes, and long pauses,with plenty of sighing, this is a six part series that could easily have been a 3 part one if it had been thought out better."
344,Nicole Kidman playing Nicole kidman acting and Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant acting and nothing much else. Empty and bland and not worth watching IMHO
345,"First episode was good, couldn't see where it was going, big production, famous actors ... second episode was not so good ... same thing ... but what happened in the third episode? Nothing, who wrote this? Hugh Grant character with no expression or feeling ... only is capable of saying ""I am innocent"", beatings in prison that is complete nonsense to the story (this is not prison break) Is characterized as one of the best doctors in NY but has no friends, wife and father in law do not believe him, no one knows why he is accused but still after a week of the homicide, he is in prison having a rough time ... really?Detectives are a joke ... they visit the father in law in a
Museum (writers looking at great movies where this type of things happen but with so different quality), they interview Nicole and start saying they cannot disclose anything but 30 seconds later they are ok to spell everything out ... very bad actoring alsoDonald Sutherland who is a fantastic actor is a millionaire that sometimes seems like Superman and in a next scene is crying because he gave money to his daughter's husband. Really?Deceased husband acting is also so bad ...So bad guys, big bucks used in production and actors and an episode where they gave us nothing at all ... very bad acting and environment (and Nicole is great)A Six episode series ... a third episode where nothing new was basically given to the spectators, just cliches copied from other movies ...Good thing is that it can only get better"
346,"The show had potential, yet there are too many useless scenes, amateur details, unanswered questions and no plot twist they led us to believe exists. I expected so much more than that."
347,"After 5 episodes of build up and twists and mystery, I was expecting a big finale twist ending to make my jaw drop. But it just turns out that he did kill Elena after all. I'm massively disappointed. What lazy writing."
348,"Started very strong and went down hill very quickly .
Poor acting -Hugh should stay in romantic comedies, his scene at the restaurant was like an 5 grade kid in school play .
Nicole has no facial expression...
The kid is annoying as hell ...
And the ending is so bad that it even funny ..
So overrated, so not HBO , so lame ."
349,"At 30,000 feet, this miniseries was interesting and had potential. Whodunit? We didn't know until the very end. But it was done in by inane and illogical plot segments. Absolutely stupid stuff, so illogical and unnecessary that I am unable to understand how it survived the cutting room floor. Its not clever, it added nothing, and it only served to destroy the believability.Oh, you disagree? Fine. Explain the following:1. The hammer is hidden in the fire pit, NOT THE HUGE LAKE OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FREAKING PLANET?
2. Grace is talking to the two detectives without her lawyer after Daddy has already hired the best lawyer in NYC?
3. Grace's collagen lips and the dead babe's raccoon face drove me crazy, yet here they are and they're making out in the elevator? Good Lord, its beyond stupid.
4. ""Eyes on me."" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
5. Helicopter ride and then landing on the bridge, LOL
6. Troopers stand there like statues as Grace runs past toward a man who was described ""armed and dangerous""? WTF????
7. Grace's blond buddy leaked this whole story about Jonathan to the prosecutor and this entire mountain of hearsay is allowed in? Laughable. Look, hearsay is still hearsay. It doesn't matter who introduces it.
8. As dumb as Jonathan ""stashing"" the hammer on his property where it could be linked to him, then we are to believe the idiot kid brought it home to hide it to ""protect Daddy""? My God.
9. Grace ""goes for a walk"" through NYC and Central Park at 3AM in her (wait for it) robe and slippers? Haha
10. Jonathan goes to his dead lover's apartment and confronts her widower hubby so he can see his baby and give her a bottle? Kill me now.At the end, I was rooting for Grace to try to grab Jonathan to save him, but then Jonathan pulls her over and they both die, plunging 100 feet into the river."
350,"Spoiler alert. Beautiful acted, scenes, great actors, other than that, extremely disappointing storyline. I dislike typecasting but with maybe with some kind of transition? Not at an extreme going from king of romantic comedies to axe murderer. It is ugh! Also not believable, you would not hire an expensive attorney, bail out your husband and then destroy the defense and the attorney's career. Also there would have had to have been signs he was a sociopath prior to the murder and infidelity, that a scholarly Harvard therapist would have certainly picked up on. The writers built a plot like they were going to resurrect the marriage after discovering the infidelity, like there was more depth to what was going on. So many other options to take the story but chose the easiest plot. Thumbs down."
351,"This was a watchable show, but never one that held much suspense between new episodes. It has great talent in it, but the material itself is silly. Nicole Kidman roaming the city trying to escape notice while wearing a vivid burgundy full length coat on her 5'11"" frame with her glorious red hair hanging loose was a common ridiculous element. At least put your hair up lady!We thought we were watching a mystery thriller series. Instead we were watching interwoven character studies of people who don't feel ""real"" in any way. The only surprises are early in the story, and you are waiting for a stunning revelation that never happens in the end."
352,"An exceedingly long Law and Order, should have been the same run time. Cast can't save a painfully slow script, don't waste your time...."
353,"Lazy writing and Kidman's facial expressions through years of plastic surgery overshadow a gripping story until the final episode.The plot is simple, someone is murdered, case goes to trial, there's one obvious killer. Some love triangle elements, some half hearted psychology thrown in for ""substance"".What's makes this lazy is that all the way through we're told that Jonathan is the easy option, evidence is circumstancial and it needs to be proved beyond all doubt. Then the series concludes that Jonathan did kill her but it wasn't ""the real me"".Watch the first episode, skip to the last and save yourself some time. The rest is inconsequential filler to keep you watching, to leave you feeling that the better story was left on the cutting room floor and coming up with a better ending.For those still reading: My ending. Kidman is the killer, she knew about the affair and killed Jonathan's mistress. She is now living a lie, burying her guilt and crime in a psychological quagmire. Burying her husband in jail in the process.We watch an innocent man crumble before us, projecting all others thoughts and judgements upon himself whilst the ""poor wife"" stands stoically beside him.Last note but petty in it's content. Kidman has had so much work done on her face that her expressions are left confusing at most. Her lower face looks CGI'd like Henry Cavill's face when Sony wouldn't let him shave his moustache off."
354,"It is a complete 180 degrees turn from the narrative style of the preceding 5 episodes and 40 minutes of good acting and scripting.rather than serving as a satisfactory conclusion, it just makes the viewer feel as if they have wasted 6 hours of their life watching a cop-out right at the end.It is so bad that it smacks of a rewrite of another more suitable ending, to suit a socio-political agenda. Or it could just be that the writers just flopped at the end when it all matters.(helicopter rides and chase sequences involved too, for this bizarre change of narrative style)update from an news update:""I sent it to some trusted people, and I said, 'Who do you think is guilty at the end of this?' They all said, 'Well, it's not really clear.' And I got paranoid,"" Grant recalled. ""I thought, 'Is this all about a second series? Because that's not so much fun for me - I'm here to play a killer. That's why I'm here.""should really have let it continue on a ""not really clear"" ending"
355,How can anyone take seriously a wronged woman Nicole Kidman who's face is so plastic. All her expressions are trying to raise a botoxed eyebrow. Should have got a real actress.
356,"Its basically a long episode of Matlock, if the writers phoned it in. Multiple scenes ruin any kind of suspension of disbelief. First the idea that Grace would even entertain the idea of keeping company with her dirtbag husband post arrest. Fostering the ability to argue his innocence, sure, but actually keeping company and living him thereafter? Just not believable. The scene where Hugh Grant finds his murdered mistresses husband ""to win him over"" was laughably stupid. The defense lawyer that attacks her clients to ""test how'd they do on the stand."" And on and on. It gets sillier with each passing episode. Oh yeah be prepared to see a head mashed onto mush via hammer blows 3-5 times each episode. Why do we need to see the same mushy head over and over? Who knows...
My girlfriend and I did develop a fullproof test to confirm bad writing while watching this. Just repeat the lines aloud to each other. Guarenteed belly laughs."
357,Episodes 1 & 2 set out a great story with lots of promiseUnfortunately episodes 3 through 6 didn't develop the mystery any further than the plodding obviousNicole Kidman and Donald Sutherland were greatOverall it felt like a missed opportunity and I didn't enjoy it
358,"I decided to see it out to the end, despite after 2 episodes thinking this was going to disappoint. I wasn't wrong. The courtroom scenes were annoyingly implausible (this from David E Kelly??) and the whole farce was more like an out-of-season pantomime. The Madame Tussaud's waxwork of Nicole Kidman 'sighs' its way through the role as an unconvincing wife and psychologists, the rest make the best of a script obviously written whilst waiting for the pasta to cook."
359,"Enjoyed up until the last 20 minutes of the final episode. Just another whodunnit but this time it was the actual accused who was guilty....it was a good start with the usual suspects as the killer...the husband, the lover, the scorned wife and of course the obligatory son. Kudos to the writer for the twist in the courtroom scene as that was clever and I didn't see that coming. I would have scored it higher but for me it was a very disappointing ending.The acting by Hugh Grant and Noah (Henry) was fantastic but Nicole Kidman had such wooden and stilted acting. Absolutely non relatable personality, boringly dull and I said to myself 'no wonder your husband had and an affair', unfair some will say but that's my view!!"
360,"This started out really well. Great locations, lavish sets, complex characters, multiple possible suspects, suspenseful cliff-hanger episode endings. But the effort fell short. Without giving anything away, I will simply say I found the finale unsatisfying.Many good mystery series flesh out all the possible theories and suspects so that, when the big reveal comes, we've at least considered all angles thoroughly. Some of them even take more than one season to do it. The ending here was a surprise and felt premature. The actors are excellent, especially Hugh Grant, but that doesn't save it,I wondered whether the show ran out of time the onset of the pandemic and perhaps the writers shortened some of the story lines. Or this is just how they wanted it. Whatever the reason, it was a let down. Good news: I only had to watch six episodes to be done with it. Bad news: With ten, episodes it could have been better."
361,"Ok, I know. I enjoyed the story. Nicole Kidman was fine. However, I couldn't stop comparing it to defending Jacob. The Undoing copies several of Defending Jacob's story beats, such as the child being accused, the parents questioning their relationship, and having the series end with a court case. It just feels unoriginal."
362,"Watching Hugh Grant try to cry was laughable, and I wish Nicole Kidman would move her face. I think in her earlier movies she moved her face, as I recall. Is the hint of a wrinkle really that bad? Movie was boring and then predictably boring. I soldiered on through to the end though, hoping.."
363,"Started off well, but never delivered after the first few episodes. The outcome was never in doubt, because they never succeeded in creating any reasonable doubt in the murder.Very unrealistic that someone on trial for slaughtering a person gets to roam freely anywhere he wants, without impediment. No reporters, no photographers. He can drive anywhere he wants, go out for restaurants, show up at the victim'd house, etc. He can run off and disappear, but show up at his beach house undetected by police. Yet the police watch his wife diligently. He can hop in the car the last day of court and take his son, again without the police knowing anything. Who were they watching the last several episodes: no one. Suddenly they stopped doing their job once the trial startedAgain, the show failed in the end ..."
364,"Series starts off very promising. it is very tense at the begining and full of plot twists. Each episode end wants to shock you and you never know exactly what is going on. Every character is acting suspicious, so you don't trust anyone. All this seemed very interesting at first, because it feeds you an expectation that something really schocking will be later revealed, insted you are offered a very poor ending, that I believe dissapointed many viewers of the show. Because the show is trying to make every character look guilty, the ending also doesn't make much sense. A lot of things are mentioned that later seemed like the show have simply forgotten they included them, they were just randomly thrown in to create more drama. Series turned out to be another cliche and not that special or fresh at all. it makes you feel that the director only wanted to steal your time."
365,"Emotionless Kidman filles with botox, with a plotline like boiling soupe on a nails head."
366,"After the first couple really decent episodes, the story split in way too many directions with random scenes that ended up meaning nothing at all. With 6 weeks invested, the biggest disappointment for me was the abrupt ending."
367,"It's an okay show but a bit dragged out and a few things become annoying, Nicole Kidman's hair is just too much, she also is constantly puffing and breathing heavily, every time a door opens or someone speaks she exhales loudly, non stop.The building of tension is slow and a little predictable, as said okay but it doesn't match the hype, honestly it would probably have been better as a 3 part series with a different lead actress, whose less about how she looks and sounds and more about being a cast member."
368,I wish i could get back the time i wasted watching this!
369,"Appreciate that it's an adaptation of a book I've never read, but this was a massive much a do about nothing. I'm sure they must have just been staying true to the novel, or at least I hope that's the excuse for lame excuses for twists. I did think the casting was reasonable and they were believable in the characters they were portraying. But it couldn't make up for the massive hole in the plot in episode 5, and from there on we realise that we're just left hoping there's so much more to it than what there is."
370,"Bad story, bad plot and bad acting. Didn't believe in anything that happened. This serie is a total waste of time!"
371,"Im embarrassed on the behalf of everyone involved in this disaster. The first episode is okay, not more. But then its just get worse and worse with an obvious plot and bad acting. I stopped watching after the 4th episode, could not take it anymore. Its laughable to be honest. How some people can rate this so high is shocking. I tried to tell myself ""these actors wont accept being part of something this bad, it must get better"". But it did not. Hugh Grant pretending to cry was the only funny thing cause it was tricky to get. Was he pretending to cry in the show and succeeded in looking like he pretended? Or was that a genuine effort to cry? For sure it cant have been."
372,The series held my interest but the apart end ruined it for me. The twist never came. Excellent performances by hugh grant and donald Sutherland.
373,"Slow and unable to keep my attention. I was pretty convinced I had the right murderer from the start and was genuinely annoyed by how stupid some of the other characters are. Many unnecessary scenes, eg. Grace fainting. The son getting thrown out of school. Etc. I did not enjoy Nicole Kidman's acting, thought it was an excess of pouting, broody looks, ""stoicism"", and her hair was distracting. But mostly just that the plot was bad and slow."
374,My guess is The Undoing had one set of very talented writers for the the first three episodes and then the B-team took over to bring the plot to a conclusion in the last three episodes. Overall when it was over neither my wife or I thought that much of the overall story and agreed we wouldn't recommend six hours of it to anyone.
375,"Well... I heard such positive reviews from friends and I was in the mood for a great mystery thriller with a top class cast.Acting was poor, safe for the kids and Donald Sutherland. Especially Hugh Grant was down right awful especially in the scenes where he had to show emotions. At least there he is at sync with his character. Nicole kidman, I was also telling my husband and read it in another review here had a plastic surgery which makes her look like joker around the lips.The pace is slow, the characters to the most part are unlikable and I ended up simply not caring how this will end. Mostly I cared who will end up raising that little girl who is not loved by her father. And the father daughter relationship is one weird and implausible one. A father who is logical and sane and clearly wants to protect his daughter yet despite all his good sense he gives very good money to help her free her husband despite the fact the latter is in his mind most definitely guilty.Now at the end, Hugh grant ends up being a total sociopath with whatever other syndrome he has, multiple personallity, bipolar, jekyl hyde, not sure, however is it perhaps a bit weird that he hasn't shown any symptoms of this prior of these events; and what about the hospital; why can't anyone tell Grace why her husband was fired and why is everything so hush hush and then this story never complete itself;Many wholes and different threads which led nowhere."
376,"Good watch, but should've been a movie instead, everything's too stretched."
377,The show starts out pretty well with some good characters and an intriguing storyline that ends with absolutely nothing to do with the characters that have developed throughout the miniseries and it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
378,"It is simply beyond me how this bland production raked up such a high score. The fault in my opinion lies in the really poor direction of the movie by Susanne Bier. She remains a small time director, who has gone in way over her head again. Why was she picked for this job. What was David E. Kelley thinking? Hugh Grant has recently done amazing work embracing the dark side. Nicole Kidman is almost always great. Here they both seem to have zero interest in story and character development... (this has little to do with the issue that Nicole has embraced Botox in a massive way). Anyway, needless to say - this will not stop anyone from wasting 6hours of their time to dive into it. If you subscribe to HBO, you will likely watch whatever there is on offer. It is just a shame, that's all! ** for the performance of the young boys"
379,"Good supporting actors , known leading actors once brilliant at their best, good story. But something happened. Maybe too obvious.
Sad. I'm sorry for the honest work of the actors. And best regards for the next production."
380,This is a melodrama with steroids. One idea going nowhere.
381,... the son did it.Great deliverance from Grant & Kidman though!
382,"Grace (Nicole Kidman) and Jonathan Fraser (Hugh Grant) seems to be a happily married couple in Manhattan. Their son Henry goes to a pricey private school. Their lives are turned upside down when one of the students' mother, Elena Alves, is brutally murdered.Right off the bat, there are two issues with this show. First, it's overwrought. The material allows for it but David E. Kelley is pushing hard on those buttons. The crying, the camera work, and the deliberate twists are all over the top. It's soapy which may be the intention of the opening with a little girl playing with soap bubbles. As always, these characters never ask for a lawyer when they should. That leads me to the second issue. These characters are doing some dumb stuff. Grace is an obvious suspect as soon as the affair is revealed. She should get her own lawyer as soon as possible. I thought that she would get Lily Rabe to be her lawyer which holds a few possible twists in the future. More than anything, Nicole Kidman plays it so innocently that she can't be the killer. That takes away the bigger possible twist.As for other suspects, that is the great hope of this series. It's the fun mystery box part of the show. My big wish would be one of the two kids. That could be a great shocking twist. This show needs one. At the end of the day, these characters are not doing smart things and that annoys me. Why would the hammer be hidden in the fire pit? Why wouldn't Franklin keep Jonathan under guard after spending millions? Why would the lawyer call Grace to testify? There are too many whys in this show to count. On the plus side, Hugh Grant delivers a great duo performance. His natural charms allow him to play both sides. This definitely has enough acting power and great production value. The writing does need a few fixes and sharper turns."
383,"It looks the part but there is no depth there.Men bad, psychos, strong woman can't trust.There is no twist, they just take the laziest way out at the end when they left openings everywhere to mislead, why was the mistress thanking the wife, the father could have been trying to pay her off to get rid of trouble or as a second sugar daddy, who knows, but they chose the most cartoonish path instead. The husband is either a psychopath which would have led to them making far fewer mistakes or they were just dumb and everything built around the character was a red herring, but really it just wasn't fully thought out.and really, the overly mature kid writing is always off putting in these things."
384,"So from the first episode, I was like YES, OK Jonathan IS the killer, I knew that from episode 1. What kind of innocent person tucks their phone away, withdraws tons of cash, and then makes off to,,,,somewhere? I thought that maybe they were going to set up a twist, like Grace framed Jonathan - otherwise why would we spend 6 episodes watching? I found her character rather creepy: wlthholding minor details, acting very defensively upset whenever the police tried to get close, not wanting to hire an attorney for herself (because she's so confident in her story?), the strange encounters with Elena felt really threatening. It was only when Justin's mother said he was a sociopath I was like oh ok, they haven't been pulling my leg...I've been trying to come up with theories to prove that Hugh Grant is not the murderer, which I guess is technically repeating grace's experience; except I knew all along he had to be the killer, and was kinda just waiting for the series to spin out and finally prove it's Grace because we're all expecting some kind of plot twist. Maybe it's just supposed to be a show about how we're willing to give people of a certain class the benefit of the doubt until the trial, or how we're more willing to doubt women; it's just that emotionally that play doesn't land in an emotionally satisfying way. Especially since, I knew from the first episode; but if they weren't going to spend six hours of TV and looking at grace's face in sinister angles all the time not to even alter the story a little bit from the expectation, it's a letdown. And come on why would she never get her own attorney???? UUUUGH GRACE"
385,Lots of promise but a disappointing and badly executed ending. Worth watching for the great cast though.
386,Just finished it. So no plot twists of substance. Grants acting is wooden as always. Kidman is good. The last episode was such a let down. Really? A series that went from a probable 7 to a 3 in the last few mins. Indeed it was an Undoing.
387,"After such a build up of guilt against Jonathan Fraser during several episodes you'd expect a twist at the end and a surprise. But nothing. The actress nicole kidman again gets to play the innocent victim, posing her way through her scenes rather than acting, and this 6 part mini series ends up telling us nothing new. Waste of time."
388,"These days when the Autumnal slew of dramas hit the screens one has to assess carefully which to invest your precious evening time into. Sad to say we nearly faltered with this one but the promising cast swayed us and we got through the halfway mark. This is the tricky time... to write off those 3 hours or spend another 3? A big decision... now it is all over I wish we had opted out. Without spoiling it for newbies I have to say we were disappointed with the upshot; how it was unfolded and the ""big reveal"". Clumsy, rushed and unconvincing I would say. Maybe now I will seek out the novel but I worry that this will be another doorstop tome expecting me to shell out 400 plus pages of my even more precious reading time to reach another disappointment.
One last point to make: was this a horror tale? Ask this because of the overdone close ups of Ms Kidman's mush... or was it the same bit of footage repeated? Don't have a clue how much it cost but it was not money well spent... sit her down next to the craggy old men Huge Grant and Hawkeye... well, no comparison...
For those of a more easily offended nature this ""epic"" has some profanity as well as (briefly) rough sex and violence to women... no smoking much and no drug usage... but worst of all too many yuppie talkers and over-privileged characters you really could not care much for....
Lastly, why oh why was Donna from West Wing given so few appearances?
Right... wasted enough of my time on this... where's that book?"
389,"Can you imagine if an unknown pitched this series without a list talent? I can. The answer would've been a super hard no! I can literally hear the notes, and If I had more time I'd list them! lolI'm sorry but I'll have to agree with the others as it relates to the series in its entirety, but especially the last episode... which was an incredible disappointment to say the least. I don't want to get into story specifics, I'll simply say the premise was interesting and the performances were so solid... I stayed on the journey. However, this is something to be consumed all at once with the ability to fast forward... which I did a lot during the finale.Anywho, Kidman and Grant are obvious favs who never disappoint. Sutherland is a legend. Has he ever not murdered a role? I was not familiar with Noma Dumezweni, but now I'm a fan! Might be more appropriate to dub the series a master class for acting.In closing, (can you tell how much I adore transitions), I only wish the overall story could've been better. Clearly they had money to burn. Maybe some of it could've been thrown to additional writers. But who am I to judge? I don't have a mini series on HBO... (I also thoroughly enjoy ellipsis)Please blame all grammatical, spelling, and formatting errors on siri. I'm not using her, but she will still take the blame... and like it! All the best!"
390,All was great until the last episode... very dissapointed about the ending - ruined everything for me - wish I didnt waste all this time watching :)
391,"I really enjoyed this until the last half of the final episode. It's like the writers just gave up! So many plot holes and set-ups that led nowhere, but could have made for a far more interesting arc."
392,"Kidman - no mimicks at all (i felt like she wanted so badly being able to mimick her face and crawling in that skin)Grant - 488 facial mimicks for every 30 seconds (he can't help it, can't stop it)Terrifying!
Way too long, could have easily been a 2 hour film.
Save that 6 hours of your life, go exercise or call your parents instead.I like the costumes."
393,Emotional drivel. Unrealistic to boot. A waste of 4 hours
394,"This was a fantastically acted great mystery all up until the final 10 minutes of the final episode. All the red herrings and possibilities of possibly Nicole, her son, her father, her best friend or the murdered woman's son being the murderer all turned out to be nought as it turns out to be Hugh all the time. But it's nit just the fact it turned out to be him because it could have always been a possibility, but that the reasons behind him being a so called sociopath wasn't explored. One phone call between Hughes's mother and Nicole didn't go deep enough- then it was completely rejected by Nicole's character after that? It also didn't wind up loose ends which I hate the dramatic action at the end does not satisfy me - I want explanations!
But the most annoying thing is the casting of their son with brown eyes when both Nicole and Hugh have blue. I was wondering if that was going to be part of the story but no they just didn't bother to check with science.
So it unfortunately ended how I wished it wouldn't with no twist and a quick unexplained resolution."
395,Nicole Kidman did it. There I've said it! I always knew that Nicole Kidman was no good when I first saw her in Dead Clam and Far & Away...
396,"A complete waste of time. This should be a zero! Who greenlights these projects? Who in their right mind can find this "" riveting?"" Funny thing, every single character is really annoying! Did I say it was horrendous?"
397,"Probably one of the most overrated and over hyped series I have experienced. Couldn't wait for it to end. Acting is marginal, story line boring and just an all around low interest event."
398,"Don't waste your time with this serious. It's totally shot, to lead you away from the actual killer. Loads of unfinished stories. It's a silly tv show once you know who the killer is. Sill show"
399,"Cheap and entertaint. Poor twist. No twist at al.!
Great characters, poor story telling. Plot is as strong als Thrumph realection. You just must love it. Or not.Nicolle and Hugh where the driving characters. Without that just a B Netflix production.Overal 6.5"
400,Over dramatic by far. Not a law and order court room at all. Everyone has very strong emotions. The kid is too precocious. 3 episodes would have been fine. A lot of filler time. Acting is good. It's the writing. Too much drama imo.
401,For 5 1/2 episodes it was 10/10. The writers bailed and took the safe out. Very disappointing.
402,"After big little lies i was excited and the cast was promising as well but i just finished it because i wanted to see how they manage to end this full of cliches story. I like Hugh Grant but he was the wrong choice possibly he was in it because they wanted to be popular in UK and British to watch it.
You can see that a weak script can make best artists look bad.
Nicole kidman's dress choices are very distracting as well. Looks like she was weang same thing in different colour maybe a friend of hers trying to promote her brand of clothing.
In the end such a waste of cast and money."
403,"I just about gave up on this after the first two episodes. I'm pleased I didn't as I would have missed a powerful understated performance.So, the bad. Yep, Nicole Kidman. Or lumpy face as I got to call her throughout the six episodes. And the lumps changed from episode to episode. At one stage I thought she had cotton wool under her top lip. And what's with her mouth? As someone pointed out, you had to listen to what she said because you couldn't go by her expressions for mood. There were none, the same bland and blank look only a botoxed plastic face could do. There was one scene near the end where she hugs her father (Donald Sutherland) and I honestly wondered who he was hugging. as for her acting, subpar and the worst of all the cast. Why Hollywood women get these things done instead of aging gracefully is beyond me.
The other 'bad' was the misdirection that was so far out that the only logical conclusion was the person who eventually 'done it'. The red herrings were too obvious, everyone was a suspect and then the writers went out of their way to prove it. This didn't add to the story and after it finished I realised some of the misdirections were pointless and stupid. For example, Mum (Nicole Kidman) happened to be walking within a block at the time of the murder. Why? Just a coincidence? The boy found the hammer, washed it in the dishwasher twice and took it home to protect Dad. How does that protect Dad? Up until then we didn't even know the son suspected Dad. Just dumb. There's more, but that's enough to annoy me. I don't like being treated as stupid.
Now the Good.
Hugh Grant once again proves he has some serious acting chops. Great to see him do serious acting and show his range from anger to lust and carry it well. More please Mr Grant. Donald Sutherland does the entitled rich old man who uses his money as a weapon very well. Loved his dialogue and interraction with his grand son's Principle was priceless. The reason I said I was pleased I continued despite the dismal performance by the lead was Noma Dumezweni. She did a fantastic turn as the defense lawyer. Strong, powerful and her rage at the end was something to watch. I will be hunting more of her films.For Hugh, Donald and Noma's performance alone I gave it a 5 otherwise I'd also be down in the 2 or 3, probably because I wouldn't have watched it to the end."
404,"The first 5 episodes have a lot of the potential. Especially in the first 5 episodes maybe if you could add some extra minutes of details and it would touch perfection, but the last episode destroys everything. Please rewrite the whole last episode and give us an alternate ending."
405,"Thrilling story with high potential, but the ending was shockingly terrible."
406,WTF is going on with Nicole's dial? Hope her plastic surgeon has a good refund policy.
407,Spoilers. Finished episode 2. I like the story so far. Nicole is an excellent actress she is playing her part well. My problem is with the writer or director. Nicole is supposed to be a well educated therapist but she falls apart to the point of becoming hysterical. She should be trained to handle difficult situations. We will see how it unfolds. I'm a man so I really have no idea how a woman should handle a cheating husband accused of murder.
408,Did I miss the her book release?I didn't recall hearing about it at all. It was a bit confusing for me.
409,"I'll be honest here. I watched episode 1, 2 and 3 and figured out where the story was headed, as episode 3 played out like a ""filler"" episode. So I went straight for the final Episode 6 and trust me, I didn't miss much at all. I could easily pick up the story from 3 without having to sit through episodes 4 and 5. This is what happens when they try to stretch a small story into 6 episodes."
410,"The actor that plays Henry was spectacular. I guessed it wrong but it really is psychological. Some things I felt didn't get resolved. I also felt like it was slow at times and maybe could have been summed up in 4 episodes instead of 6. It did generate conversation between hubby and myself. It would be interesting to see a deeper analysis of certain things throughout the episodes. I am sure if I went back and rewatched, I would be looking for different clues."
411,"I was looking forward to watching this, but I was surprised with how predictable it is. It's everyday thriller/ crime movie. nothing special. I chose to watch it because of Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grants, and I was right their performance is the only good thing about this show. The forced dramatic scenes and dialogue whch turned to be comedic overall was the worst part. Also they could've wrapped the whole thing up in a 2 hours movie."
412,"No Spoiler review: There was some good acting and some interesting episodes but a show like this depends on a good ending. The ending fell flat doing nothing original, unpredictable, or interesting. Instead it fell into cliches and just tried to hype up the lack of guts with a little sensation but nothing worth the time invested. It's all been done and done better a hundred times before"
413,"If you read my review of ep 1, I had this called and didn't have to suffer through the last 5 episodes. Just didn't have to sit through 5 hours of them try to make you believe husband didn't do it when who the heck else could it have been."
414,This series had some good actors but they seemed to be reciting lines and the characterizations were superficial and unrealistic- writing was pretty awful and I usually like David E Kelly. But aside from that it certainly was not HBO material - maybe star power is overrated at times.
415,The stuff of wives talesIt went from potential into something else no real who dumb it. The end was devisely dumb. It had to be for its intended audience and theme. Play on the demographic for the drama.Please just throw the hippocratic oath out the window for such estranged psychology. Once a cheater always a beater. Now lets just gossip. He must of hid those emotions away since childhood with his adultery.Yawn it had potential until it snapped.
416,"The first 4 or so episodes were great. Who did it? But the ending, my goodness. All of the sudden hugh grant's character is some monster. The finale has zero twists or anything interesting. The helicopter chase was one of the biggest WTF moments I've seen in any show recently. Nicole Kidman's frozen-unmoving botox face is so distracting throughout the show its almost comical. I couldn't stop commenting on it whenever her giant face was onscreen.I guess I was expecting an interesting twist. But there was none. Snoozer."
417,"Nothing can save the BAD writing and cliched, chewed and badly written plot. Kidman and Grant are great, but not enough. Gave it a try until almost the half of episode 3 and that was it for me. Back to Scandinavian TV shows."
418,"So far, looks like Nicole Kidman wanted to take advantage of Big Little Lies success and made like a New York spinoff, as much as Reese Witherspoon did the same with Little Fires Everywhere. Rich people with dark secrets, nothing new. I hope episode 3 will get better. Performances are a bit cold. Music is great."
419,"I loved fist 5 episodes, 6th one is trash, the way the presented charachter of doctor, just could not be murderer. The kid was the only real option."
420,"I just hate the ending. It makes while series unnecessary. It is great, and then it appears, that he was a great doctor, loving father, loving husband, lover to another person able to kill because of rage. Oh, and he wasn't able to feel anything, because his mother said so on Skype.
And he was soo stupid (while being unable too feel anything) that he hid murder weapon in a place obviously connected to him.
And his son just found it because you always look in unused fireplace, where murder weapon is...
Prosecutor who uses his wife Skype conversation heard in a bathroom from a different laywer and actually frames him is a cherry on top of it all.It could have been great. It is, if you just don't wath the last episode.
I just finished watching it and I'm soo angry..."
421,"After watching the first two or three episodes, I rated this an 8. It keeps you coming back for more because you want to know ""whodunnit"".Now that I've finished watching it, I wish I hadn't wasted my time.It had a lot of potential but ended up being a real stinker as far as the story line goes.Great acting all the way around and who doesn't enjoy Mr Sutherland who is like a fine wine that gets better with age. But in terms of writing, it was a wasted opportunity to make this stand out.If you're looking for a surprise ending, don't. The last 20 minutes ruined this show."
422,Nicole Kidman's part was played by a Spitting Image puppet! Her face was completely off putting. Needs to grow old gracefully. Naff show. Bland script. The plot development was handled like an advent calendar!
423,"Not david e kelley's best work. not nicole kidman's best work. not donald sutherland's best work.
yet, really entertaining. slow at times, too fast and unlikely at times. but the directing is fantastic and the photography is lovely.
i recommend reading the book cause it is quite the same experience."
424,"I thought it was a good miniseries with a great cast plus great acting, I really didn't want it to be Jonathan that killed her I was hoping for a good twist at the end but never happened. I would of gave it a 10/10 if there was a twist about who actually killed her."
425,"The first episode was good.The second not so much. The third tonight had me angry. There were things tonight that we're not paid attention to, Namely the audio recording and camera work. Not to mention the script sad to say. Why would Kidman walk down a street at night she was unfamiliar to. When she lives on 5th Ave.
Also what woman never carries her purse. She never seems to have one.
There is also the scene where Kidman is playing a game of Chess with her very rich father. Then after confesses he gave 500,000.00 to who? If he gave that amount of money to Husband Grant, Why? Up to this point everyone thought he was still a doctor treating children with Cancer.
Then we have a flashback of Kidmans to a scene she was not even in.
Then there is the scene where Kidman and son visit dad in prison. Before they arrive we are in the visitors waiting room and are witness to a woman hugging an inmate and removed from the room. That scene was only there to brace us for when the son holds his fathers hand and is forced to leave.
Also the police not suspecting the dead woman's husband, was ridiculous.I will continue watching because I Adore Kidman and Hugh Grant. I just rewatched the first episode and now am confused even more. The scene the detectives show her walking near the victims block the night she is murdered, Nichole is wearing the same gown and cape she wore at the schools benefit. This means it is the same day that the kiss in the elevator took place. There is also a scene in the first episode of the husband of the victim in bed alone the night of the murder. He does not appear to be concerned that his wife is not beside him.The next morning the son questions his father about why his mom is not present. Dad says she stayed at her studio. The boy leaves to catch the buss but instead goes to moms studio finding his mother dead. But here is the biggest flaw. From the time Niclole meets the mother is only 2 days before her murder. Then we are shown a portrait in oil that this victim painted.........in two days. Impossible!
I am loving this show. I still have issues lithesome. Still I don't understand why a NYC women runs around without a purse? Or how that portrait of Grace was done in 2 days?
And now in ep. 5, so much is made over Hughs talking to the dead woman outside of the school. Why is this such an issue when he was treating her son for cancer.
The end scene was shocking although I suspected it, It was very well crafted. poor boy.
Now that it is over, which I liked the end ,I still have some questions, First one was the continuity. How did the ""ARTIST"" paint that oil portrait of Grace in 2 or 3 days. Also what happened to the baby daughter. As for the ending,I would have preferred that he be found not guilty, and then we realize he did it."
426,"I have watched each episode and have fell asleep during each episode. Genuinely. I'm not sure why I keep trying but I am hoping at some point it works.However, I am sorry to say this, but the continuous blank stare and huffypuffy gurning from Nicole Kidman is beyond tedious. She was fantastic in Invasion and Stepford Wives amongst others, so is clearly a talented artist. what has happened? I can only think, writing and direction. As she is the main character, the plot is paper thin, tissue thin.If you are going to base a show around one person, give them something, direction, plot, anything. It is impossible to get into most of of the time as it is just Nicole Kidman staring, camera zoomed into stare, some gurn-esq sighs (think a subtle Les Dawson lip smack) and that is it really. Others attempt to speak to her, and she just stares, and sighs.There is no clever plot, as some have suggested.I think the other actors have been let down by the way this has been written and/or directed. Having other characters storylines so that they all build a mystery and slowly pull you to the centre where it comes together andyou feel invested would have been helpful. However the whole show is carried on N Kidman's shoulders therefore the rest of the cast have to hope she does good given they are not really given a lot of opportunity to make it interesting.In my opinion, she does not.The only two who seem to have any character and ability to hold any interest are the two husbands, mainly the deceased woman's husband whose scenes are gripping, well the scenes aren't but his portrayal of his character is.I am unsure if the director daren't tell the lead actors that the acting is not really coming through the screen, or if this is some kind of experimental method of 'stare...gurn...sigh... .. ..... ...repeat'.I saw a high rated review stating those of us who think it is boring is because you need grey matter to be able to understand the thrilling and intelligent plot, this review then went on to say the reviewer and partner then rewatched to see if they had missed any clues. They had to watch it a second time to see if there is an actual plot! It's not a case of. it is so clever we are not meant to enjoy it, so we enjoy because we are clever and know it is part of the experience. Erm, no, it is just really bad with nice apartments, nice hair and a pretty awesome winter coat.I feel sorry for"
427,A pretentious melodrama with a rushed ending which ultimately didn't pay off. Nicole Kidman was good but that's about it. 6 epsisodes could of been 3. Could at least have had a better plot instead it was predictable.
428,"You can have the best cast in the world, but if you do not have a story, it crumbles to pieces. You cannot have 5 episodes with a plot and the last one with a different plot. The twists and turns need to be drip fed, otherwise viewers will feel that they started to watch a series and ended up watching a different one along the way. For an HBO show, it was among the poorest."
429,"This was extremely disappointing. Did Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman not read the whole script before agreeing to take part in this?
So unrealistic, the writing is horrible. Do not watch this if you like well-written crime thrillers, it's not worth your time."
430,"Terribly bad story, lousy dialogue and paper thin characters. Waste of time!"
431,"Me and my husband have just finished the season! The ending was disappointing, I felt it was so obvious from the beginning and there was lots of unanswered questions. The twists and turns made it fun to watch, but the ending was unsatisfactory and rather meh! The writers should have ended the season differently, and obviously they left it fully concluded which might mean there will be no season 2. The aspects of the show which we enjoyed was the scenery and music. The acting from Nicole was rather wooden but that is probably because of the amount of Botox she has, it really does limit the movement (tbf I have absolutely no movement from Botox so no judgment). I feel they could have expanded on some of the characters. But anyways still rated it high because I enjoyed watching the episodes until the final!"
432,"The plot twist is there is no plot twist. Nice looking, decent acting, nevertheless disappointing."
433,"Entertaining, but I refuse to take seriously any show where the killer schleps around the murder weapon for more than a week for absolutely no reason. Not to mention a show that co-stars Nicole's winter wardrobe. And don't get me started on how freaking weird Kidman acts in the first two episodes. The only close to normal major character is the detective. Among the multitude of gaping plot holes: everyone accepts that the defense needs to show evidence against another person to claim that the police should have also investigated them as a potential suspect. Just a Lifetime series with A-list stars."
434,"Sets itself up from the first episode as a multi-perspective who-dunnit... sadly it de-escalates into a straight forward court procedural with virtually no twists and so-so ending.It is edited in a way that suggests characters are having flashbacks (they aren't).In an interview in Marie Claire director Susanne Bier said:' That whole notion to 'regulate the truth,' to massage the truth into what we want it to be, is such a big important issue that we all felt we were doing a really fun and really entertaining whodunit twist and turn but at the core of it was that 'I think it would be fair to say the show lands somewhat short of her intention.Grant playing against type is excellent fun and Donald Sutherland is a power house. Kidman seemed to struggle and was unbelievable as a seasoned Clinical Psychologist.Skip the intro music if possible...Overall a decent show but massively overhyped and nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is."
435,"Great start and suspensful until close to the end. No plot twist, sorry. Turned out pretty boring"
436,"Had the real potential to go into an interesting and maybe surprising direction. Oh what a surprise, woke political correctness wins out again. Low point, in the tedious, not credible last half hr , was Kidman walking out of building holding hands with friend and dad. And btw who in NYC pays that $500/hr to go a Kidman who's just a PhD in psychology and can't write subscriptions? They go to a ""real doctor"", a psychiatrist."
437,"5 episodes, i couldnt blink, episode 6... hmmmm not the same."
438,"Not a credible storyline at all. It got gradually worse, the last episode was hysterically funny."
439,"I really loved Big Little Lies season 1. I think David Kelley is just trying to capitalize on its success, but this series really lacks. Plot is overdone, so I would hope the mood and the acting would elevate it. It doesn't. Kidman is one note, but the character isn't that full to begin with so there is not much for her to do here. I think the suspense was supposed to be the draw, but by the end I didn't even care who did it because it was so drawn out. Having known a few narcissistic sociopaths in my time, so I did find that premise interesting. But that's about it. In the end, i didn't really care what happened to any of the characters and was left wishing the story had been as compelling as other HBO series that are outstanding."
440,"Imo, the first episode was promising...then 'The Undoing' headed downhill on a fast sled. It packs more gloss than twists, with a whole lotta' wealth flaunting as filler.Creative license is a given. But the show's depiction from a legal standpoint is ridiculous. Like the endless late-night walking alone and Grace's very thin veneer as a psychologist.I've always found it easy to dismiss comments about Nicole Kidman, Botox and plastic surgery as mean-spirited and/or piling on, and much smaller than her acting. But she suddenly looks more wax figure than human and it's constrained her ability to play one.In a scene where Kidman runs in fear, her utter lack of expression helped turn a climactic moment into an anti-climax. It was mortifying. She's ruined her instrument. And I wondered, watching the difference in Hugh Grant's scenes with and without her, if some co-stars might find it as disconcerting as we do."
441,"Quite intense and intriguing until the last episode and then... an absolutely awful ending. Magnificent and suspenseful play by brilliant actors throughout first five episodes disintegrated into a banal calculating ""undoing"" of the defense by the murderer's wife. Fittingly in the last scene on the bridge nobody acts believable anymore. Very disappointing really, 9/10 - for first five episodes, 2/10 - for the last."
442,The Lawyer for the defendant would never have put his wife on the stand given everything else she knew and what was going on. Ruined it for me and we knew she was going to flip on him.
443,"I was totally convinced by the pilot episode that I will definitely finish this miniseries but gradually the plot stated loosing the the thrill. And ultimately the story fell like a disaster. Some what in the presence of NIcole Kidman it felt like watching ""Big Little Lies"" once again, as I found many similarities in between these two shows. Disappointed to see no more creativity which I was expecting, but I gave this series an 8 just for the star power that delivered amazing acting and obviously New York City."
444,"I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought some of the stuff in the final episode was ridiculous.
WARNING SPOILERS:
1.When they found the murder weapon, the hammer, Hugh Grant wanted to turn it over to the police hoping to get the murdered victim's husband's DNA from it. Well hey, even if that happened it would be easy to dispute. HE WAS HER HUSBAND, HE WENT TO HER STUDIO AND TOUCHED STUFF. But since Grant was the murderer, and used it as the murder weapon, his DNA would have been on it, so it didn't make sense for him to suggest giving it to the police for testing, especially so adamantly.
2.The husband's attorney was allowing his wife to testify on his behalf. Hey, she obviously would and was subject to cross examination. The defense attorney knew this so only a dummy would have allowed her to testify. .
3.And the defense attorney had first hand knowledge of Nicole's conversations with her friend and her husband's mother.
HOW UTTERLY NOT BELIEVABLE."
445,"First two episodes are very good, in a psychological thriller way.
Then, the next 2,5 are a bit boring and very prolonged in time, giving us the idea that the same story could be told in half the time.
The plot is very consistent and it is a must see item to everyone that likes a good thriller.
Hugh Grant has a very good performance, especially in the last episode.
Nicole Kidman's performance rarely disappoints and in this case, the viewer is also doubting what her character is planning or thinking.
Donald Sutherland also with a good performance.Noah Jupe Is going to be a great actor!"
446,"Waste of potential, great actors, initial writing, everything.
Riding the wave of how good this show is during the first 5 episodes, only to be bashed in the face with just about the cheapest 'subverting of expectations' ever!
Right after watching the ending I of Corse learned that the ending was preordained by the book. However! That does not excuse the blatant use of subversion for subversions sake!
Grace, a prestigious Harvard educated psychologist, when confronted with her husband's mother who has just unapologetically and unknowingly admitted to blaming her, at the time 14 year old, son for the death of his 4 year old sister, takes it at face-value that he is the one who is an unfeeling unapathetic monster and nearly concludes that, the man she 17 years of experience with, may in fact be a sociopath.
Besides rendering Grace a garbage clinical psychologist, this is what is used to put the nail in the coffin in Jonathan Frasers trial for murder.
This cements itself at just about the worst of the show.
The second worst then being...
That all the remaining people in the show left to root for are people you don't and can't like.
Grace, Franklin, Sylvia, Fernando Alves, the detectives and the prosecutor. None of these people are worth liking or rooting for. The only exceptions being the son Henry Fraser and Miguel Alves which comes de facto because they're children!The only reason I would recommend this is because you will probably like the show like i did, up until the last parts of last episode and the you don't. Or you hold the capacity to turn off your brain."
447,"The first 5 episodes were great and I was expecting a final episode with twists or at least some quality viewing. The last episode was so disappointing, very predictable, bad acting, unrealistic storyline that fell short. I regret wasting my time with this series now I have seen the last episode."
448,"It's a watchable show, although the ending is little rushed and somewhat disappointing given the constant teasing of twists. But the most distracting aspect is Nicole Kidman's utterly emotionless face, and not through a choice by her character, but clearly because of her copious and unfortunate plastic surgery. Even when running and screaming her expressionless face is simply fixed to her skull. The botox clearly works. I've never thought of her as a particularly good actress and now she has diminished one of the most important tools of drama - her face.Everyone else in the show does well, Hugh Grant is always watchable and charismatic, but the writing is not particularly original and Edgar Ramirez is criminally underused.In conclusion, had I not watched the series I'm not sure I would have missed anything. Other than to reel in horror at Ms Kidman's stapled face."
449,"Spoiler : at one point in the middle of the final episode, the husband of the victim (who is he? What's his story?) bursts into a meeting room at the courthouse and starts yelling at the defense lawyer for her ""vile"" tactics of putting his child on the stand. In a fit of rage (transparently intended to inform us that the husband had violent tendencies), he throws a pile of books and papers on the floor before a security guard drags him away. Literally two seconds later we see the meeting room, and there are no books or papers on the floor. This crass error of continuity should give you a general idea of the lengths the creators went to to generate plausibility.Why in the world were Nicole Kidman's and Donald Sutherland's characters chasing her husband in a helicopter along with the police? Why would Fraser keep the murder weapon? Why would Fraser's wife be taking walks late at night miles and miles from her home?In the first episodes I was a little annoyed by emerging whodunnit structure of the story. But misgivings were outweighed by the excellent acting, especially Grant's, the guy is such a pro. I was a bit disappointed with Kidman though, because her character was virtually indistinguishable from the role she played in ""Big Little Lies"" (which was a far superior series BTW), including her strange diction speaking American English."
450,"Remember Funny Games? The movie that prides itself on portraying the realism of violence, then makes up a stupid reason at the end that ruins the realism of the movie, then patronizes you for thinking the film would be realistic?This show does the opposite. It goes into the completely unrealistic, then penalizes the viewer for using their imagination. It pretends that you're an idiot for not seeing the obvious outcome, that the murder suspect was the murderer. But this doesn't work when the show makes up situations that would never happen in real life, such as that same murder suspect being put on national television to testify for his innocence while his case has barely even begun, just to shill in more evidence that the suspect is innocent.I watched the first five episodes, which were all very grounded in reality... other than that one scene. I swore it would have an interesting, never before seen outcome, because the evidence the show gave was interesting, and never before seen. But then, it just doesn't. It does the same thing Funny Games does, but in the inverse. The show tickles the mind and the imagination, pretending to be a whodunit, then tries to make you the fool for not blatantly ignoring the information it's given you. It gives you all sorts of useless scenes and characters who have no significance to the show whatsoever, like Donald Sutherland's character, to make you think of a more interesting outcome for the show than it actually gave. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I refuse to watch the last episode in full, because the show doesn't play by the rules it set you under for solving the nonexistent mystery, just to seem smart.Not a 1/10 because Henry is a good kid."
451,"Halfway through the first episode I guessed the plot. Let me point out the obvious and yes it contains spoilers so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.
Anyway, the writers should realize that all over the world DOCTORS have affairs with patients and patients MOMS, however the MOTHER or the PATIENT must first do a little thing called PRESS CHARGES in order for someone to be FIRED!
if it was a willing affair, the dead woman would not have pressed charges..
it is oversights like this that ruin otherwise decent HBO series for viewers with a brain in their head."
452,"As above. Yaaaaaawn. It says my review is too short to post, so here is some more. A. Very. Long. Law. And. Order. Episode."
453,"I was hooked from episode one but as the series progressed, I wanted to hurry it along. The result at the end was probably the twist - I was looking everywhere else for the killer. Nicole Kidman's character got on my nerves, particularly all that hair. I was almost shouting at the screen 'tie the hair back'! But that's probably just me. Not one for a re-watch, I'm afraid."
454,"Don't waste your time - this was poorly written, poorly acted, and comes with a boring, terribly contrived plot. I honestly do not know how this gets so many positive reviews."
455,"This stated out curiously, then started to get interesting, then ended just like one may have thought so from the beginning, and that is where it let me down. I hate to write this but...""The Simpsons Did It Better"". (Who shot Mr. Burns)What you had was a ""who done it"" among the rich and privileged against the poor and tying to break into that world that got interesting as it progressed. The leads of Nicole Kidman as Grace and Hugh Grant as Jonathan were snotty enough, and it kept you interest to see their world unravel over the mini-series, and boy, did it unravel. Bu what was keener in this series was all the ""supporting"" characters in this tale. The casting for each - kicked butt WAY more than the leads.Matilda De Angelis as Elena, the victim was captivating, even to the end. Ismael Cruz C√≥rdova as her husband Fernando, that was excellent casting - gone to waste with a flawed story by the end. This actor, I will be looking for him in other things things later as he has a bad boy career ahead.The children Noah Jupe as the son of Grace and Jonathan was spoiled & conflicted enough and the son of Elena and Ferando, Edan Alexander was finally good at the end on the stand, as well as finding his mother dead in the beginning. And Grace's friend, Lily Rabe as Sylvia was more than just window dressing. I do wish they flushed her character out a bit more though.Then there are these two - Noma Dumezweni as the high priced lawyer Haley Fitzgerald for snotty Jonathan - goodness, if ever I get in ANY trouble, I want someone like her. This actress killed it in this role, she was interesting to watch, snotty, tight, lawyer to the rich, yep.And...Donald Sutherland as Franklin, Grace's father. I was captivated with him throughout the episodes. I also chose him as a suspect if not THE prime suspect. He was playing the role so good, I would say this is why the ending was SUCH a let down. I agree with everyone who too chose him as a suspect. Sutherland did such a bang up job - I will look for an Emmy nod for him, if for nothing else but his old money grand-fathely snotty speech to the school headmaster alone.But I do have to say that ending was a real let down to all of this. I can't for the life of me understand why it went so -- typical! Excitement was building though the episodes regardless of who ""did it"" and then...well it fell flat. Boo! Grace, even with her ""how weak do you think I am?!!!"" declaration was weak as heck in the end. I mean what I would have done would have put me in court case #2 in this series. We, the audience were far better for an ending than that lightweight one.This was a good mini-series that could have been."
456,"Great cast, and well made. But the writing is completely awful, to the point that we were laughing out loud at some of the lines."
457,"Watched this limited series with my wife and we were intrigued by the first 2 episodes and were truly looking forward to binge watching the remaining four episodes. Episode 3 was slower but still held our interest, by episode 5 I couldn't wait for the series to be finished. The finale was a joke!The story had decent characters and actors but the writers seemed to have phoned this one in, very disappointing."
458,"For the first 5 episodes I kept thinking wow, that's what happens when you get good script and good acting. It just keeps building and building, episode on episode and you are so looking forward to the big twist or climax at the end. Then you get to Ep 6, the last episode, and it fizzles out and I can't help but think I've wasted 6 hours of my time and the show has wasted the talents of 2 good actors. Save your time. Watch something else."
459,"The show overall is ok. I like the story and I also like the crew. But Nicole Kidman can't act any more. With all the plastic surgery she had on her face, she can't make a simple facial expression anymore. Sad, happy, terrified or overwhelmed...it is all the same."
460,The story is poorly written. Acting is horrible. Waste of time
461,Too long ... eventually not that surprising ... but i liked it overall ... the show had its moments
462,"I still do not understand the reason for unnecessarily lengthening stories that instead of six chapters of a series, could be a very good movie. In this way they achieve a precious and precious result that could be summarized as two hours of entertainment"
463,"... without any of that show's humor or cute characters. Unbelievable courtroom drama heaven on the ""Telenovela"" style. Donald Sutherland should get an award for hamming it up. Many shots of Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant looking down while ""acting"" an unseen ""eye roll."" Unbelievable. 6 hours that you'll lose interest in by the 3rd or 4th hour. But you'll still be sucked in to see whodunnit."
464,I felt the main protagonists were overacting all of the way through this and as a result I just couldn't be convinced of the storyline.
465,"So, the crucial point in having Grant's charachter convicted was his wifes testimony, where she was grilled by the prosecutiion. She was put up as witness by the defense. So, just a question for the writers - why on Earth wouldnt then the prosecution call wife as a witness and destroy the defense!? Flaw, a bad one."
466,What a ...shot... show. Illogical and everything based on luck and almost zero evidence and mistakes done police. Each character mental rollercoaster made it hard to make it believable. Ending is circus
467,"Worth watching if only for the outstanding performances of Noma Dumezweni and the master of his craft, Donald Sutherland. Both set a flawless high standard but Kidman and Grant we're wooden in comparison and not so convincing. A good binge watch though, especially for a rainy afternoon."
468,"La ti dah, lives expressed in quip liberal NY too hip for you, setting- Obvious branch off of Big Little Lies success, Kidman tries to recapture the ingredients to bake a similar cake... Interesting start, and may be worth a following. The problem is the cynical overtones are forced and sarcasm as a lifestyle makes one question the positive 'get' one seeks to Invest bingeing a series like this? Kidman, operates in that one Dominant gear of slow pronunciation, and peculiar dainty, yet hip and together projection. Problem two, is the lack of pace, and Kidman's 1 and only facial expression, as filler's and nip-tucks disallow any variation of emotional expression. Some have commented on counting the plastic procedures or guessing amounts of Botox used- instead of delving into the plot - as it's distracting from the story and it's, well, a lot... Not top notch - Not bad or uninteresting, but somewhere in the middle- 7 is fair and Spot on-"
469,"The slow theme song at the beginning sets the pace through every episode, dragging one through the alone moments of life where thoughts invade... and take up movie time. Infinite slow details sprinkled liberally with sex scenes that border between voyeurism and erotica that fill each episode with more feeling than movie. A series made by men for men. The last ten minutes provides all there is to know about what happened on that episode and has just enough intrigue to keep the viewer interested in what's coming next. Great actors and great acting. Although how two parents managed have a dark eyed, black haired child, when both parents, and grandfather, are blue eyed provides us with the possibility of maybe another shocking twist in the tale down the track - or perhaps the child wasn't cast well enough. Overall The Undoing is watchable... while doing something else that is, there's not much to miss, except in the last ten minutes."
470,"Consider this a work in progress. If possible I'll update my review as the series unfolds. This has all the markers of a classic society, who done it. The victim, Matilda De Angelis, shocks the socialites by breast feeding her infant during a school fundraising meeting. She does this again in a scene with Nicole Kidman in a locker room at the gym. A gratuitous and unnecessary full frontal display. Also, the first plot problem as I see it. Matilda's child is attending the 50K a year school on a scholarship. It seems unlikely that she, an artist living in Harlem, would attend the same gym as Kidman's character. Kudos for realism when Kidman searches for her husband's hotel room. The production company actually did a little research for a relatively minor detail. It's a drag when they get details wrong in a movie.Saw episode 2 and they did explain how the victim and Kidman's character belonged to the same gym. Still seems out of her price range though. One mystery left unanswered was how a doctor with her husbands name was at the conference her husband said he was going to attend. Is the husband a fraud or was this just a plot hole ?"
471,"This show was honestly terrible. It's the poor man's Big Little Lies (I think it's weird Nicole Kidman would take the exact same role for basically the same show on the same network). Entertaining at first, but it's so over the top ridiculous and the acting is the same. Don't waste your time, not worth the hype-people are just stuck inside, bored and have already finished all the good shows out there."
472,"If they though he killed his wife then no way would he get bail and the program reveals too much detail too early. Its has a chunky awkward plot and very unrealistic, but it has three good actors, enough to get you to watch it. I want to have suspicion's not shown who has weapon and then its just a waiting game. Plus the C.g.i of murder victim looked too stupid, her face looked like a flat pizza. It gets worse as police failed to search home properly with murder weapon in his wife's fathers house. the wife was seen near murder scene and they fail to search her house, but I think ending was kind of strange considering all the clues and kind of stupid. It not ground breaking and waste of time watching. Its designed to show a jealous wife, who setting up her husband and in the end turns out she is just the housewife. Is it cleverly written or just badly directed."
473,"Some spot on acting right from the start and a good idea, if not totally original, it works well with all characters seamlessly fitting their roles. However, why the naked wo.wn scene was needed us beyond me? A woman who has just had a baby would not act like that surely? Why O why do screenwriters look for opportunities to display perfect naked female figures? Damaging to young women who get an impossible role to follow and setting back the Me2 movement. If it wasn't for that I would have given a higher score. I will watch because of the promise and despite the irresponsibleness."
474,"Painfully bad.
Nothing makes sense.
Nicole Kidman's acting is intolerable. Her character's actions make absolute no sense and the ending is just ridiculous."
475,"I can't really understand why HBO feels the need to stick to Nicole Kidman for every second TV series. Her face is completely destroyed from all the botox and surgeries and it's no fun to watch.
Hugh Grant is as convincing as Mickey Mouse in his role.
The kid is annoying af.
The only well played and believable character is Donald Sutherland's. He's another caliber though, any comparison would be unfair.
A big mess this is.
HBO series begin to no longer be what they used to. Perry Mason was meh, this one is straight trash."
476,"The first few episodes weren't bad apart from Kidman's immobilized face which really affects her emotions which are now all the same. Unfortunately, too many of her closeups are featured.Grant, on the other hand is all the worst for wear, weary and ancient and downright sleazy. She playing a psychologist, and he an oncologist, really pushes the disbelief metre way too high.But OK, some of the bit part actors are great, including the sons and the lover and her husband.But all sorts of problems with reality. For one the kids being questioned without a social worker present. For two the kids in court seeing the murdered women, one her son? Please.The last two episodes it truly falls apart and we are troped and cliched to death, with obligatory car chase, helicopters, bridge jumper. It was painful to watch, like they ran out of all idea and let Grant and Kidman loose on each other without intervention from the cops surrounding them. Puhleese.No big reveal, just a pitiful whimper.A complete waste of time.3/10"
477,The story is nonsensical. The acting is horrible. Waste of time.
478,"The Lifetime channel movie from hell.
1%ers gone wild."
479,"There's a lot going on in this short series...and little of it is good. Overall, the story was weak and predictable. The acting was mediocre except Hugh Grant and the young actor that played the son. Nicole Kidman's plastic surgery face poses became super annoying. Beyond these things...it basically comes to this: if you hate men, you'll love this series. This alternate universe is chock full of man-hate. The storyline is full of how ""only men cheat"" and ""of course it's the man...it's always the man."" Really??? In my 52 years of life I've seen just as many women cheating as men...that's just a reality. However, Hollywood's PC crowd loves to hate men...and it shows in this series. Most, if not all, of the female characters are strong and intelligent...most of the men are weak, doltish, creepy, and/or just plain crass. Another PC trigger...rich people. The series constantly pushes their societal facts that only rich people murder and try to get away with it. You know...because rich people are so evil. It's all too bad...there was some good stuff here but it got lost in the elite's hatred of men and the idea of successful people actually making money (that aren't in the Hollywood club)."
480,"I feel like casting Hugh Grant in this series is a cheeky throwback to his arrest in the 90s for sordid misconduct. While he plays the part well, the reason I am rating it on the lower end of the scale is because of the outdated plotline which has been done to death in the 80s ie loving, devoted, perfect husband is accused of infidelity and worse. It's packaged as a 'psychological thriller' but I don't think it quite overcomes the cliched storytelling. Too many scenes, including the ending, have been leaked online which basically ruins the surprise for everyone. I don't dispute the cast and crew wanted to do something 'groundbreaking', but having a female director does not elevate women to feeling empowered or inspired by this type of drama i.e. women are either hussies who get murdered or devoted wives who get cheated on."
481,"First of all, what the hell is happening with Grant's face all the time? What kind of facial expressions are that? Like he's having a stoke. Although, it goes with Nicole's wax-face I miss seeing people who get old decently.Anyway, I gave it 8 initially until the last episode, which is ridiculously stupid and makes all the previous ones pointless."
482,GREAT marketing for a predictable plot. I came looking for a complicated story and ended up a very simple one and with 5 extra hours of serie.
483,"This was a really great watch with an amazing cast. But it was such a build to such a left-field, dramatic finale. He went from maybe sociopathic throughout the series to full-on crazy within the last 30 minutes. poorly concluded but worth the watch nonetheless."
484,5 epidsodes. The story is completely unbelievable but wore the acting has degenerated into actors living on their rep. I can't believe how bad Kidman and Grant have mangled their roles. She is totally mailing it in and making a lot of money and Grant is just totally bad and the attorney and son aren't much better. I'm surprised David Kelley released this. This will affect his reputation too and not for the better.
485,I thought this show was shockingly bad. I'm sure there are plenty of people already detailing its faults but damn it just seemed rushed and very poorly written. Plus who cares about the wealthy? Poor poor pampered privileged.
486,"Kidman, Grant, Sutherland! Thought l was in for a real masterpiece! I kept resisting the impression l had had from episode 1, in vain... even the performances are fake! There's not a single thing to praise about this series! Waste of time and money for HBO, l don't get the high ratings! it's boring, superficial, not even a good plot twist... just nothing"
487,"You know the ending right from the start. Easy. Great production, good acting. Lazy 2020 writing. Stupid plots. A lot of scenes don't make any sense. No surprise or mistery. It's like it's forbidden in this day and age to make other ending than this."
488,"I rated this 9 at the first episode the I downgraded it to 7, plot are strong, acting is flawed, while Hue Grand is typical the cold arrogant physician, the incredible Nicole Kidman is acting another character ( not a psychiatrist). Also the trial is artificial and creators should remember that our generation is deeply sophisticated and knowledgeable about true crime, it's sad if a fictional TV show is lower than the actual trials and murders."
489,Absoulutely nothing happened for 6 episodes. I watched it with expectations but nothing happened. Don't recommend.
490,"The first episode started off fantastic. I was in. Then I watched episode 2. Then #3. And you get the point. But each episode was slightly worse than the one preceding It until when I finally watched the finale it was like- that's it? That's the shabang?So long story short, I give this 5/10 stars. It had its moments of intrigue and entertainment but it also slowed down to a snails pace and had questionable (Nicole Kidman) acting as the series went on."
491,"This was disappointing to watch. The acting was bad from Nicole as well as Hugh. All movies I have seen with Nicole display a similar character, lots of steering and walking. The visual age of them as couple was too far apart. None of the actors was convincing. I am glad that I did not have to pay for, except lost my time."
492,"This show is so ridiculous. The court room scenes are
an abomination to the criminal justice system. Terrible, obvious acting."
493,"The first two or three episodes were good, then the episode twists at the end of each episode got goofy. Would have been better as a shorter series. There is a reason movies don't go six hours. This show needed an editor. HBO probably wanted 6 episodes. Good story, not great. P.S. the acting was exceptional. All props to Kidman, Grant, et al."
494,Great actors my expectations were so high that I kept on watching although I was literally bored the whole time. Other than the first episode it was terrible throughout.
495,The last ep. was a true disappointment. So much build up of flurry action in the first 4 ep. and then a diving flop from the fifth to the car chase finale.
496,"This series has a strong cast with Kidman, Grant and Sutherland as well as some really good performances from relatively unknown in comparison actors. Most notably Noah Jupe who plays Henry the son.
From the first episode I was gripped as to who could have done it and the behaviour of certain characters when questioned by the police and the insistence of other characters being innocent led me to speculate that maybe the most obvious suspect wasn't actually the suspect.
This continued throughout the show, dropping in little hints and tips that send your mind darting off in one way or another.
However the last episode came across like writers had given up; like they couldn't think not a way to keep the story interesting and just when you expected a twist, it didn't come.
Such a good show until that last 20 mins which is utterly disappointing"
497,"With such great acting in this mini-series I expected a much more sinister plot, or at least a much more complex one. Everything is way too politically correct in this show, which means it was probably a California production. Before I destroy the simplistic plot I have to say that I still enjoyed this series very much. The acting, the sets, and the drama make all episodes very entertaining. Now for the plot. The plot is based around this new ""narcissistic"" label that keeps floating around Los Angeles and everywhere else on the West Coast. Everybody is a narcissist now, every woman that gets a divorce says their husband is a narcissist, and vice versa. Its a really shallow and dull way to look at the world. The plot for this series needed to be much more complex to have a lasting effect on the viewer. Possible scenarios involve the woman being forced to have an affair with the doctor in order to set the doctor up for blackmail. Once the money is received, the woman is killed by ""higher-ups"", not by either Hugh Grant or the other husband. This leads even further to us finding out about other purposes for the money obtained from many blackmails by a large group of people. The money could be used for all kinds of things, lets be creative, could be used by a group of people trying to buy or start their own country. Nicole Kidmans father could have been involved in this plan without her knowing it, and it goes on and on. Instead we have a very, very predictable, although dramatic, ending to a politically correct California label of the day mini-series. Very disappointing, but good for the acting."
498,"I binge watched the first 5 episodes then had to wait until tonight to finish the series. I didn't like it at first, and frankly was about to quit after the first episode. It got better but left a sour taste in my mouth. Something about the characters and their demeanor made me hate it but I digress. The ensuing episodes got marginally better and the last episode was a bore. Since it's sorta popular it's worth a watch to see what the hoopla was about but if I'm honest I could see this being on a basic cable channel and didn't need to be on hbo."
499,SPOILERIf my husband went out of town without his phone and I didn't know the code (sure) I would call my credit card company to see what hotel it was used at and in what city. Duh.
