0,"Dexter will never disappoint. Each and every episode is a work of art, and it never gets boring or old. To start, we have excellent deliveries from Michael C. Hall as the serial killer (yet a like-able one) known as Dexter Morgan. Add ""The Excorcism Of Emily Rose"" star Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Dexter's sometimes moody sister, Deb.It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole ""well this serial killer had a terrible childhood..."" in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.Then there's the actual story lines. It's not cliché. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.'Dexter' can also be hilarious when it wants to be, depressing when it wants to be and especially thrilling when it wants to be. And it doesn't come across as trying too hard.Strong writing, clever dialogue, talented stars. It all makes for a wonderful TV show. Definitely the best new show of the season and will become one of the best shows of all time."
1,"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!"
2,"I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR."
3,"This is going to be my first ever review on IMDb, there is not a day when I do not visit IMDb to check the reviews about movies or TV series that I watch, I watch lots of movies and series.For the first time in my life it happened to me that I could not sleep after watching a series. I have seen prison break, heroes and a lot other. Prison break and heroes first season was awesome. They inspired me so much that I got some tattoo's done on my body. However both these series cut loose as soon they go to the next season. Heroes was big disappointment but DEXTER.. OMG series after series it starts to make me so curious about the next episode.. damn the season 4. I just could not sleep the whole night after watching it. I spent my weekend watching the episodes back to back.To start with Dexter (Michael C. Hall) his darkness was off the edge he played the role so well that sometimes I wonder if he is the same in his real life but then I found that Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) is his real wife who is playing his sister in this series. Damn Debra is one character who is so confused and mostly been controlled by the people around her, she always end up doing something wrong but always gets credit for the good things too.I love the part when you get to know what is going on in Dexters mind when he thinks about something or when someone is talking to him also the part when he talks to his dead father Harry. (he just thinks what his dad would say in that situation). All the episodes/characters and all the seasons are written and played so well that you can hardly find any flaw in it.My favorite characters are Dexter (Quite obvious), Rita and Vince Masuka damn Vince is so funny, he just utter one word in his entire episode and comes out to be damn funny.I just cant wait for the Season 5 and I am sure whosoever watched dexter feels the same way just like I did.(Apologizes in case my first review has some mistakes and offends somebody's feelings)"
4,"Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books."
5,"Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clichés.Thrilling story, many details, and one of the best opening sequences ever."
6,"HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale + Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up."
7,"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word......Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in hand to say: ""I'm kind of sorry for the hype.""If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended. Sure, sure, I couldn't have known how poorly written the resolution of this once-magnificent series would be. But, you see, I shouted praises for this show from roof-tops...telling every friend who would engage me in discussion about pop-culture that they NEEDED TO WATCH DEXTER, it's the greatest drama on television!Alas, I will not leave any spoilers here and if you've come along the journey with me then you will undoubtedly watch how it all ends, but I write this edit in vain so that you, internet friend, cannot say that I didn't warn you: 'Dexter' leaves me wanting a real ending."
8,"Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt."
9,"Been on my radar for more than a decade. Jus finished watching all the 96 episodes in 30 days on Amazon Prime.
It ain't a record but the addiction with the character Dexter made it possible for me n the other factor is the lockdown.
The character Dexter is a lovely manipulator wher he acts accordingly to the situation. A true psychopath. This series will make u ask q whether the character is truly living a double life of that of a serial killer n that of a family man working for the Miami homicide department as a forensic expert.
Although some of the scenes r far fetched, the series is very intriguing n captivating n that is only cos of the character Dexter played very well by Michael C Hall.
Many fans were upset at the finale episode but i think the conclusion is fair. The finale stayed with me for days. It is surrealistic n poignant. It may haunt fans of Dexter Morgan.
The ethereal guitar music, the double life of Dexter, the dark humor, the camaraderie between the siblings n the talking of Dexter with his dead father is amazingly done.
The dark humor is hilarious. Ther were times that during murder scenes i was laughing n my wife was kinda wtf.
E.g. A serial killer known as Tooth Fairy labels Dexter a sick mother*ucker.
Also when Dexter praises the same killer regarding his act near a cop's/attorney's house n the reply of the killer is hilarious.
The finale episode of the 4th season came as a shock.
Cudnt believe my eyes. Thot mayb it is jus a dream.
Check out Christina Cox as the villainous cop, one helluva hot babe."
10,"Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.The character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer, is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series. Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!"
11,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman."
12,"Thanks to the quarantine, I watched series that I never imagined I would ever see, one of these series Dexter, which I heard had a bad ending, so I decided not to watch it, what a nonsense I missed myself watching one of the best series ever.
Dexter has eight seasons and a renewed new season to fix the poor ending and everyone's excited about it.
All seasons are excellent, from the first to the seventh, with the exception of the last.
You evaluate each season as follows.
First 9.7
Second 9.6
Third 8.7
Fourth 9.9
Fifth 9.0
The sixth 8.9
Seventh 9.0
The ex Final season 7.0
Waiting for the new season"
13,New season 2021 confirmed. They say its limited. Let's pray otherwise. I'm so excited!!!
14,"I'm just going to break this down by season, keep it simple.Season 1 / 9/10: Brilliant opening season. Awkward Dexter is best Dexter, and you're really inside the characters head. The second best antagonist throughout the series is also featured here, with strong performances all round. The writing is great, the humour is even better, and the whole season fits together. I honestly can't pick one quote for this incredible season, but if I had to... ''You can't be a killer and a hero... it doesn't work that way!''Season 2 / 9/10: The premise of the BHB investigation is solid, and the investigation ran by Doakes on Dexter is even better. The way the season unravels is great, besides the slight deus ex Lila in the finale. Unfortunately, the finale isn't as good as the episodes before it in terms of tension. Besides that, another brilliant season. ''I just know there's something dark in me and I hide it. I certainly don't talk about it, but it's there always, this Dark Passenger. And when he's driving, I feel alive.''Season 3 / 8/10: I love this season, though it was never going to live up to Season 1/2. It's very important in terms of the character development of Dexter Morgan. Jimmy Smits is great, but the side plot and antagonist were only good, and not great, unlike in past seasons. ''I killed my brother... I killed yours too.''Season 4 / 10/10: This is the final season in my eyes, and it has a fitting enough ending for me to be satisfied with to call a series finale. John Lithgow is terrifying. The writing is sharp. Lundy's death is shocking. Rita's death is beyond shocking. Everything about Season 4 is on point. ''I thought I could change who I am, keep my family safe. But it doesn't matter what I do, what I choose... I'm whats wrong. This is fate.''I really don't feel like reviewing Seasons 5-8. It's not that 5,6 and 7 are bad, it's just that they completely destroy the character of Dexter. They give a psychopath feelings, and that's a MAJOR misstep. This is all the result of Clyde Phillips leaving the show, and he being replaced by incompetent writers.Season 5 / 7/10: Straight up bad ending. Characters forgetting they have evidence against a serial killer. Terrible villains. Writing is still surprisingly good.Season 6 / 6/10: Writing is straight up bad. The protagonist is terribly portrayed and written. Terrible twist in episode 9. Great ending, but that's about it.Season 7 / 7/10: It would be higher rated, but it is ruined by Hannah's inclusion, and the death of Isaak way too early.Season 8 / 2/10: Terrible. Treadmills. Dumping loved one's in the ocean. Standing outside a cafe, stalking a serial killer, and wondering why he saw you when you stood in one place for AN ENTIRE HOUR. TERRIBLE SEASON. SCOTT BUCK SHOULD NEVER GET WORK AGAIN. Utterly atrocious.It's a great ride watching all 8 seasons, but if you really love the show and really respect the character, you'll probably only watch seasons 1-4 if you decide to rewatch."
15,"Despite being so many seasons, no one gonna feel bored or detached.
Impressive and outstanding series."
16,I just finished watching this series and today I heard they're dropping a new limited series! I.cant.wait!!! Especially if it's anything like the last few seasons.
17,"I'm here in 2020 to remind everyone to watch Dexter at least once in their lives. There are very few shows I circle back to once I've experienced the conclusion, but I still cannot get enough of Dexter. Every time through I experience another ""oh damn"" moment that I didn't catch the first time around. This keeps me in constant fascination of how brilliantly woven and expertly portrayed this story is. The writing is superb and you will never get ahead of the twists and turns.Did you ever think you'd have empathy for a serial killer? Me either...Watch it. Trust me."
18,"I've just seen the finale of season 5 of Dexter and man...! What a series! This is writing at his best! I just love Michael C. Hall plays his part. His does it so well, it completely let you forget that he played the role of David in Six Feet Under (my favorite of all time-series!). And all the characters in the five seasons are really wonderful, but I especially liked Julia Stiles. She's playing her part very nice!! Lithgow in season 4 does his part only as he can do and it works fine for me! Can't wait 'till he returns! (he must return!!) Here in Holland ""Dexter"" airs on a non-commercial canal en mostly about 23.00 h. at night. Nobody in Holland heard of this series, unless they watch in online or on DVD. And that's a pity... I can't wait until season 6.... Keep on the good work!"
19,"Season 1 (10/10): Great.Season 2 (9/10): Great.Season 3 (6/10): Boring. That... Manuel, Miguel... Something Prado is awful. He's just not interesting AT ALL. I didn't like Laila in season 2, but she seemed like a goddess after M. Prado. The whole storyline it's just ZzzZZZz.Season 4 (10/10): Awesome. Great villain and dialogs, great plot twists, great season. There's not much more to say.Season 5 (8/10): Good. I understand why so many people didn't like this season, the fact that Dexter was confused about so much and that is not something very believable considering his psychopathy. However, I love Lumen and I love the villains (which is also not a popular opinion). I was more interested in Lumen and her story than I was in Dexter's affairs and contradictions, so maybe that's why I do like the season.Season 6 (6/10): Good. However... This one is a little tricky... I did like the characters, I did like the villain and all, I didn't mind Dexter's doubts and questions about religion and all as much as other people did. BUT, there is a major flaw in this season even for people who didn't bother by the theme: It leads NOWHERE. The only thing that does lead to something happened at the end of the last episode AND it could have happened in any other episode of any other season. The storyline has no purpose and adds nothing for the character of Dexter. I guess the best word for it is pointless.Season 7 (8/10): I'm only giving an 8 for this one because of Isaak Sirko. I loved the guy and I think he went away waaay too soon. This season - because of Isaak - had a great potential. Good character, good story, great involvement with Dexter, great development of both of them. They could've explored these two and made season 7 as great as the first or fourth. But instead, they gave us Hannah... Boring, boring character (even more than Miguel Prado), dumb storyline, terrible writing... Never understood why she didn't die in Dexter's table. Sure as hell didn't understand why they ended up having sex and... liking each other? Really? Whenever she was on screen, I felt like turning off the TV or skipping the scene. Which would lead me to not watch most of the season. Sirko would have been so much more interesting to develop and to watch... It's just a frustrating season.Season 8 (3/10): And if you didn't get enough of Hannah, here comes some more! Except this time, she is not the only thing wrong with the season. I'll try to be short here because if you watch this season the reasons of why it's terrible just pops up in front of you.About Dexter during the season: It seems like Disney was right all along and that true love conquers all. Even cures psychopathy!Debra: Really? After everything? After SO MUCH has happened to her, all the good development of character in every possible way... That's how she ends up? Her ending seems forced and untrue. I just don't buy it at all.About Dexter in the last episode: So... Because of Debra's oh-so-convincing-ending he decides that he will pretend to be dead so no one else gets hurt because of him, huh?... But he stopped killing hence not making enemies, which would make it almost impossible for something bad to happen to anyone else because of him... Plus every enemy he had before is already dead... Huh... Why is that clever again? He ends up alone Wolverine-Origins style for no good reason whatsoever. Hannah is a freaking fugitive and he thinks Harrison is better off with her? I just don't see why he thought he would put them in danger if he went away with them since he wouldn't kill anymore and that was what put people in danger before.Another major flaw is that NO ONE ELSE GETS AN ENDING. Quinn and Batista and how they were after the Morgan's death, how they handle the fact that Debra's body just went missing, if Batista ever retired after all that and kept his restaurant. How Queen got over the loss of someone he loved so much and if he was okay or I don't know, got depressed and started drinking and stuff. Just give us something! At least La Guerta got an ending. Those two were just ignored, like they weren't an important part of the story considering they were there almost always.Plus, ever since season one those ""very common huge storms"" from Miami were mentioned, what? Once? And all of a sudden it's there the day Dexter was suppose to leave also giving him the best opportunity to grab his sister's bed off of the hospital without grabbing anyone's attention (Seriously?).It's just bad."
20,"Dexter is a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones or Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it is and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show!"
21,"Keeping it short,You're getting a serial killer who's made to kill evil.You'll love him and weirdly you'll be able to relate to him. Odd eh?Enjoy (ps watch out for Easter Eggs in the background of scenes secretly placed)"
22,"Despite the ending, LEGENDARY SHOW.
A whole new world and a worth watching series for real. A bloody masterpiece! I enjoyed every second.
Great acting, great story line, quotes, characters.
I'm in love with Dex."
23,"Nothing can be compared to this tv show.
There are no words to describe.
For me, the best serie ever!"
24,"I recently bought Season 1 of Dexter in an attempt to finally find a show worthy of replacing The Sopranos as my number one TV drama obsession. Boy, did I find it. Despite taking a few episodes to really get going, Dexter unfolds superbly, bringing its many plot twists together to form a tightly woven package with highly skilled performances and excellent writing.The central performance of Michael C. Hall is always riveting, as this compelling actor enables us to understand, and even sympathize with, his many predicaments. His attempts to juggle his carefully-constructed, idyllic domestic life with his code-driven nightly stalkings and executions form the central interest of this enthralling series. This is one of the great many reasons why The Sopranos was so impressive; watching Tony struggle with the demands of fulfilling his dual familial role of father and mob boss was the essence of the series, and from this, other strands were allowed to develop. Dexter also has this quality, one of many qualities, it must be added.The writing, as has been mentioned, is razor-sharp. The characters are rich and alive with personality, and as the first series develops so too do the character arcs. Lieutenant LaGuerta and Dexter's sister Deborah, in particular, are well-rounded, multi-dimensional creations, and they are played to perfection by Lauren Velez and Jennifer Carpenter, respectively. There is a palpable sense of tension and excitement as the walls begin to close in on Dexter, and this reaches boiling point in Season 2. The plot is never less than intriguing, and careful and intelligent use of flashbacks allow us to gradually learn more and more about the monster(?) that is Dexter. The editing and camera-work keep a good pace to proceedings, and the lighting is always excellent, especially in the disturbing night scenes.The impressive opening sequence is particularly noteworthy in its use of extreme close-ups that show a man doing seemingly normal, everyday tasks to put himself together, but if one looks beyond these mundanities a much darker picture will be revealed. The music is eerily effective here, and maintains a high level of quality throughout - always tense, and evocative of the given situation.So: uniformly excellent acting, sharp dialogue, well-developed characters, intelligent plotting, creative and absorbing camera-work, and a deliciously dark humour make Dexter one of the best shows on TV right now, and further proof that the last 10 years has been the golden age for dramatic television."
25,"Dexter has the unfortunate distinction of having one of the worst final episodes (and season) in history. That much is true. However a lot of the show is worth your time.The first 4 seasons in particular (thank you Clyde Phillips) are must see tv. The influence in future shows have been realized because of how tremendous the early year were.The final 4 seasons are up and down (still some good stuff, just not as consistent) but I still recommend this show overall. Just know going in that the ending will disappoint."
26,One of the best shows of all time. Even though the ending is not that good the whole show is really great.
27,"<== UPDATE IN OCTOBER 2020 ==>
Believe it or not, I have just heard that a new season is coming in 2021!!! I could not believe it!! And yes, with the master, Michael Hall as Dexter and I hope many of the previous actors too that were also really good.
WE DO NOT WANT ONLY A MERE ONE EXTRA SEASON, WE WANT TEN (YES YOU READ WELL, TEN) EXTRA SEASONS OF DEXTER WITH MICHAEL HALL AND, IF POSSIBLE, MOST OF THE ACTORS FROM THE PREVIOUS DEXTER TV SHOW!!!!I DO NOT LIKE TO WATCH MOVIES OR TV SHOWS WHERE THERE ARE CRIMES OR DEATHS.
HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF DEXTER, THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL, AS DEXTER IS IN FACT MR. JUSTICE!! Michael Hall is unbelievably good in his role as Dexter!!One unique feature of this Dexter TV show is that you hear Dexter's thoughts and you know exactly what he is thinking when an action occurs!!More, I laughed a lot, in fact nearly all the time because of the funny situations that sometimes are described in the stories by the other characters that are part of this Dexter TV show such as with Vince Mazuka!!"
28,"Dexter is a great tv show with a new idea seasons 1 to 5 and 7 can't argue with how good they are
Others seasons had their fair share of goodness
But weren't as good but you definitely have to check dexter out if you haven't."
29,8 seasons.96 hours of episodes. Completed in 20 days. That is how addictive this series is. Really worth your time if you really like watching drama.
30,"Only one word superbbbbbbbb.....
Excellent series. Very nice to see everyone. Every episode is very exciting. The character of the protagonist is very well crafted. Very nice overall with some frustration at the end. Dexter Morgan I love u man."
31,"One of the best series of
ALL time, period! Michael C Hall is one of the most
underrated actors alive
He was BRILLIANT in this role, as he was in HBOs
Six Feet Under!
It is not often one can watch a series, over and over, and see a NEW
thing each time!
Hate to sound cliche'
but, "" They don't make
them like this, ANYMORE!"""
32,"""Dexter"" was an absolutely phenomenal TV show from beginning to...not the end. SPOILERS AHEAD. The premise of Dexter Morgan's life was to live as the person he needed to be, a serial killer, but with 1 rule: don't get caught. In the end, Dexter's life choices affected everyone who he had impacted. His father had committed suicide, a killer brutally murdered his wife, his family abandoned him, and his sister Debra was shot and later died from complications by the bullet that came from another killer that Dexter could have stopped. Realizing this, Dexter seemed to have fallen into a hopeless pit of despair, once again, and the story abruptly ends with him faking his death, leaving a life of love and happiness with his girlfriend and son behind, to living his boring days out as an isolated lumberjack with nothing to look forward to...not even the desire to kill that this entire show had built his character on. I get that he lost his desire to kill when his stronger desire to love his girlfriend overtook it, but now that there's no love from her, what is there? Just nothing? It's bad storytelling to just leave a character as a shell. The major problem with this ending and why it's so bad is not that it's sad, but that it's borderline boring and disrespectful to the story. To throw away every detail of character development that had been created for the last 8 seasons just for Dexter to look hopelessly outside of a window in his run-down shack before he sharply turns his head towards the camera with a glaring look in his eyes before the end credits roll is incredibly unsatisfying and insulting to the entire show itself. None of it made sense. You can't even ask, ""what's next?"" because nothing in that scene was worth asking that question. There is so little that could have been done to improve that entire sequence. Dexter could have held up a blood slide to show that he continued to keep trophies as his vigilante justice prevailed. Some say that Debra should've appeared as an imaginary ""ghost"" like Harry did throughout the show and offered him guidance. After Debra died, the story still had meaning behind it and could've still developed; I think it was a good touch to add that life-changing experience to Dexter's story, but where it went wrong was when the producers of the show went backwards instead of forwards and had Dexter stay in Miami doing nothing at all when they could've at least showed that he was still protecting his family and the world from evil the best way he knew how to, and that's by being the Dexter that we all fell in love with from season 1; the serial killer who kills serial killers! Would it have been A good ending? Not really, but would it have been 100x better than the garbage ending we got? Absolutely."
33,"In the last episode everything was good until dexter and Saxon meet up in the hospital. What should of happened is dexter should of came into the hospital and seen everyone attention on the guy bleeding went after Saxon. however dexter would of beaten Saxon to deb room an hidden once Saxon entered an was standing over deb about to kill her dexter would of injected him from behind and snuck him out of the hospital, since everyone was concerned with the guy bleeding. Then dexter would of taken him back to Saxon kill room an did a classic last dexter kill with photos etc. However he wouldn't of enjoyed it like he use to, his mind would be on starting a family.Meanwhile in the hospital deb would wake up an Quinn would propose to her with the ring he kept and she would say f$&@ing yes. Then dexter could of wrecked the boat as a sign of his killing days are over (after disposing of Saxon body) and would of met Hannah and Harrison.That way deb an dexter have got a new start."
34,"It's been a long time since The Showtime Network served as HBO's b!tch thanks to a trinity of fantastic shows like Weeds or Californication, but Dexter is the perhaps the king of Showtime's programming hill.I am currently mid-season 2, but this show seems to just be getting better. There are moments when I find Dexter, the mass serial killer, absolutely adorable. Yet he is tainting my view of the other characters. I constantly find myself wondering which character is rotten to the core - I just haven't seen that one moment that reveals them yet. I find myself wondering if it's the brilliant writing that makes it seem as if evil people gravitate towards one another seamlessly, while good seems to scare people away.Are there other good characters? No, not really. But somehow the cast supports the massive weight of Dexter as he lives by Harry's code and only succumbs to his inner monster for the purpose of ridding the world of people just like him, except his killing ""Them"" is somehow innocent.This show has great plot potential and story development because Dexter is still somehow childlike. When the show begins Dexter is unable to handle intimacy with his shattered girlfriend Rita. In Season 2 the sex scenes are so steamy they should only be watched while sitting on vinyl sofacovers (the kind Grandma has in the good sitting room).I'm just a new fan to the series, but if you're looking up Dexter maybe you haven't had the experience of watching this yet. It's worth every minute. Especially when you realize that Dexter is not only becoming more human as he starts to really ""feel"" for the first time, but he's also becoming a more cunning and less ""innocent"" killer."
35,"All my friends kept telling me how great this show was, but I never made time to watch it.Finally started watching it from the beginning, and was hooked immediately - GREAT writing, GREAT acting, great storyline. Never expected to find a cable show about a serial killer that actually had any depth.Never watched ""six feet under"" but Michael C. Hall is so good in Dexter that I'm thinking of watching SFU just to see if he was as good in that series.Kudos to all the folks involved. Can't wait for season 4!"
36,"I enjoyed this series, like a lot!It is a very unique show. The feeling of survival and never ending criminals lurking, and dexter as the main character, it is super fun, seriously.It had very good seasons as well as some neutral ones. Overall, quality had its stability, the sense of the show continued. And I mean even the 6th and 7th season perhaps.However, my kind of generous rooting for the show cannot let 8th season be another valuable season.
The theme of the show and moments it sure provided early on, 8th season didn't introduce any excitement whatsoever. It was a dull, uncared repetition which I am sure everyone realized. Imagine how worse it would feel if Evelyn Vogel was not portrayed by that wonderful lady!I just realized maybe there should be a story behind this 8th season ridiculousness... anyways...Despite, especially the uniqueness of the show and of course well execution of it, will always make this show in the 'one level behind top tiers' for me."
37,"I had some troubles at first watching this TV Show. I don't know why but the first season is difficult to watch in some ways. Because it's difficult to understand Dexter and to have empathy for him at first.
Then, each season is great with great new characters and a great casting.
I must say, one of the best thing in Dexter is the casting and the performance of all actors. The story writting is also great.
My advice, don't stop at the first episodes, try at least 2 seasons."
38,Pretty good show but they started going down by the seasons
39,One of the best series I have ever seen. It's so addictive. Every episode is a gem. & Michael??? Superb. Just awesome.
40,"Yeah this series was so solid. I dug the entire premise. Michael Hall performed the roll perfectly. Jennifer Carpenter is such and interesting looking women, sexy, pretty and awkward. The story from start to finish was solid. It's very unusual how well the entire series progressed and the story held."
41,"This show is awesome and strange. I think they did really good. I would hope that if there was a spin off it would be just as good. The directing was awesome. The plots were awesome. And, hopefully Michael C. Hall makes another show or movie with a similar character.
Everything took me by surprise. Highly recommended. I love what I saw. My mom and I are both huge fans. And, she and my stepdad both watched all of them with me. And, we were all laughing and crying at all the same stuff. And, we had discussions about some of the cases."
42,"When I turn blind eye to most of the last 2 seasons I rate this as great show, 8/10. Serial killer catching his colleagues is intriguing and nicely executed. Forensics expert by day, our favourite murderer by night. As we go along we slowly learn more and more about this peculiar individual, get inside his troubling mind and uncover the reasoning behind his actions. He seemingly perfectly balances his urges with his daylight cover life. Alas, noone is perfect and happy sunny life clashes with his nightly antics which results in dangerous outcomes at times. Dexter learns a few things along the way. Monsters on the table are added bonus. I laughed and giggled more than I anticipated. I also cried and you will too.
First 4 seasons are great, but after that show becomes more and more dull. It burns out as everything meaningful was already more or less covered, save for 2 or 3 plot twists near the end. Plague of many shows these days, they don't stop while we're cheering and continue until we're angry and yelling. Even our cunning serial killer gets dumber each season. Personal order of seasons per likability: 1,4,2,3,6,5,7,8.
I came for the crime investigations, stayed for the story and didn't regret it."
43,"Great series, I have watched entire series three times. Always something to be found when it comes to Dexter Morgan!"
44,"Dexter is really an brilliant character with ahow writing at its best from S1-S5 but S6, 7 the writing gets poor and they destroyed the show with ending thats why this show cannot be given a full 10/10"
45,The character of Dexter was really amazing through the whole series.
46,Dexter is Mind-blowing Stunning Incredibly Thrilling with full of fun n emotional as well..I felt very deep connection with each character in the show.. It's a complete package ..I will highly recommend this Masterpiece of the TV shows history..
47,"A show with the best quality story & character development, explicit cinematography, execution and all! This is a must see anyday! Masterpiece in a word. Dexter Morgan has been a role model. The dialogues were amazing."
48,"I don't really give the perfect 10/10 rating to a lot of titles unless they really blow me away. This blew me away and still continues to do so.I am new to Dexter (only watched a couple seasons so far) and I didn't know what to expect when I first watched the show. I was hoping for something I could watch weekly on TV without worries at all. I decided to buy the show on DVD so I bought the first two seasons and wow. In case you don't know what Dexter is, Dexter is about a Miami blood splatter analyst named Dexter Morgan (who is played by Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under and Gamer). By day, he is, like I said already, a charming, funny and quite popular blood splatter analyst with the Miami Metro Police Department. At night, he's a serial killer murdering the criminals that got away. He also hangs out with his girlfriend, Rita (played by Julie Benz from Rambo (2008) and that No Ordinary Family show) and her two kids, Astor and Cody. His only family is his sister Deb (played by Jennifer Carpenter from Quarantine) who works at the Miami Police Department like Dexter as a cop.This show is fantastic! The acting all around is great! Michael C. Hall is phenomenal as Dexter. The way he portrays Dexter is the way any serial killer should be portrayed anywhere. The supporting actors are amazing as well. Jennifer Carpenter is great as foul mouthed Deb. Julie Benz is great as Rita making her a real 3 dimensional character. David Zayas and CS Lee (Zayas plays Batista and Lee plays Masuka)are great as well. They are great comic reliefs, especially CS Lee. The narration in the show is also great! I've never heard a narration that great in my life! The way Michael C Hall delivers his lines during the narration is, at times funny and terrifying. Each episode is really well written and keeps me attached the entire time. The dialogue is really good and seems like these are normal people having a normal discussion and it's not unrealistic at all!I think the only flaw I have with this is the beginning of season 2. It's really slow in the beginning but it picks up very quickly which I loved.Overall, there is nothing I can say that I haven't said already. The show is really dark, funny and addictive! I hope the next seasons are just as good or even better!"
49,"I may aswell say now, season 8 was handled badly, no way to end this great show. However I refuse to downgrade my score from a 10 as overall this was a superb production.I cannot believe I never got round to watching this before now, but better late than never. It's fantastic, it really is completely absorbing, go watch it..."
50,"Dexter will always keep you on your toes. It's an insane look into the mind of a psycho path trying to make his way through the world while being ""normal"". It's constantly evolving and just continues to get better. I can say with confidence this is one of the best shows I've watched and I hated to see it end. Although many believe otherwise, I think the ending was the best way they could have ended a show like this, and for that I give it 10/10. A lot of shows are amazing all the way through then it ends terribly and that alone can almost leave a bad taste for the show overall but not here. Dexter is a must watch."
51,"First of all, I really want to say that I didnt get to watch this show because my friends wouldn't stop telling me how good it is like other people on here. I never even seen anyone on the internet saying it is a MUST watch. I just knew its a good show but never was interested. One night I finished Fargo and then I just browsed on hbogo and found this.Really good story, good acting, good production. The character of Dexter was really thrilling, fascinating, dark but at the same time very confident, friendly, happy and caring. I liked most seasons but I really hated season 6. All other seasons were great.Now, about the ending. It was horrible. One of the worst endings ever. But I want a spinoff definetly."
52,"What a series, great series, July arrived and we all sat down to watch season 8.At the beginning of season 8 I was hopeful, mixed emotions for characters such as Zach Hamilton and Evelyn Vogel, but overall I was enjoying it, then this finale was scheduled, so I watched it.First of all I would like to say sorry to the people who have watched and waited for every single Dexter episode and season, as in they watched the first ever episode on its release date. Unlike me, I got the season packs and just watched from season 1 to 7. Anyway, I can only imagine what it is like to finish your 8 years of love for this series, with this finale, You would kind of feel it was a little bit wasted after all those great episodes.The thing is with the finale is, I kind of wanted to feel sad, I couldn't because the ending was so, so, so rushed. I remember a series by the name of ""Last Resort"" Huge potential, looked great, but the final episode was rushed.When you enjoy the majority of the previous seasons of Dexter, you kind of feel the writers are perfectly capable of doing it again for the last season. I understand that there was a change in writers for this season compared the earlier ones, The older writers must be sitting on there stacks of cash laughing down at the below par season 8. Thing is with series' its a marathon, not a sprint.Right now there's not much we can do other than move onto the other series', however I kind of hope they just remake season 8. Someone suggested Dexter: Returns, which seemed silly but I could see a writer seeing that potential gap in the market and seizing it. I know for sure i'd watch it.More about why season 8 was below par; The Hannah and Dexter combination was not working for me, I didn't see too much chemistry, I couldn't get myself to liking her other than the fact she's quite hot. When you look back at season 8 you can honestly say ""It's not like the previous ones"".As much as I would love to blurt out all the spoilers and explain how horribly they are portrayed, I cant. Everyone who has completed the series knows what went wrong, and to the people who are trying to say it's actually good. No.Goodbye Dexter."
53,"When Dexter first aired in 2006 it was fresh and exciting. Michael C Hall is excellent, his character is well written. So much so, that the viewer ends up rooting for him - a serial killer. The supporting cast is strong. With the exception of a terribly written, cast, and portrayed Debra Morgan.On rewatching; Deb almost makes the show unwatchable. It's like they were pushing to see how ridiculous they could make her. It's a shame because the show would have benefitted from a little more realism. The constant sobbing, whining, and screaming gets really old after the first few episodes. If the writers had killed her in season 3, it might have elevated the show to one of the best of all time.The seasons wax and wanes. It's a pity they killed off Doakes so quickly. He was a fantastic antagonist to Dexter and they had great chemistry. Doakes was hilarious in his rude bluntness. Showing Jennifer Carpetener how it should be done.Other high points were Det. Lundy, and of course guest star John Lithgow. Perhaps the greatest seasons in the entire show. The side story with Rita and her kids was often frustrating, but the writers fixed that - eventually.The final season is the weakest, with writers clearly rushing to wrap the show.If you can stomach Deb it's worth a watch. Great lead, with a solid supporting cast (Angel/Matsuka/Doakes). Nice backdrop of the shn bleached streets, and beaches of Miami. Some really nice arcs and characters."
54,"I so didn't want to love this show because it pushes the boundaries of my fears, but every episode I found myself getting deeper and deeper into the storyline. So many times I said ""Ok, that's it, I can't watch this anymore"" only to have day dreams about what's going to happen next to jaw me on the edge of my seat again. It's the kind of show that makes you forget that they are actors. You feel like you actually know them personally. For better or for worse. Lol"
55,All I can say is Dexter wouldn't leave Harrison under any circumstances that his dark passenger somehow just made him lose sight for too long now.....We want a sequel even if it's just one more season
56,"I really liked this series.
The strengths of this beautiful series are the subject of many interesting sub-characters and the wonderful acting of the main actors, especially Jennifer Carpenter and the masterpiece of Michael C. Hall, with whom Dexter became a lovable character.
The series' process was well illustrated by the weak passenger's darkness and Dexter's transformation into his true self, which was completely related to the torment of his conscience in the end.
In general, although the end upset me, this series was really one of my favorite series."
57,Dexter is great show with the main character dexter working at the Miami as a blood splatter analyst and being a serial killer. Season one was an amazing starting season for this show. Season two Miami metro is trying to catch a serial killer and it happens to be dexter but he wasn't caught of course with doakes catching him but dexter takes him prisoner and he dies. Season 3 is good but kind of forgettable season 4 was the best with dexter trying to catch a serial killer but at the end he kills his wife Rita. Season 5-7 is where it gets weird with end of the world nonsense to Debra finding out he's the Bay habor butcher and then to cap it off they have one of the worst seasons and endings in tv show history season. 8
58,Truely the one man show. There were loopeholes in the cases but this man just makes everything go away. And makes this one of the best series ever made.
59,"Just finished watching Dexter
I'm just wondering why people didn't like the ending
I mean he's a serial killer for me a happy ending isn't an option
Of course there were other ending alternatives but the death of Debra needed to happen
Faking his own death was perfect to end a show like this"
60,"One of the greatest shows of all time and also the underrated shows at the same time. Dexter is one hell of a series. Especially, the act done by the protagonist would make you watch this show completely. I would complement Michael C Hall as one of the greatest actors of all time and he is just to be flashed under the spotlight. A magnificent actor and with his acting he takes the series to an other extreme level. It has all the needed stuff like action,crime,suspense-thrill,drama,what not: 'You name it, Dexter has it' . I just can't get this out of my head. The whole time I've been searching for a show like this and would have missed a great goddamn show if hadn't watched it! So to speak I feel lucky. I think 10/10 isn't enough for this. The way is Michael Hall portrayed this character is phenomenal. Watch it and you will definitely not be disappointed."
61,"Exceptional series, Except for the season 3..... the climax part of the series is fking fantastic"
62,Brilliant storyline and performance. Thrilling and exciting. Nothing obvious. Very addictive. Loved the character.
63,"We also live under the mask.
The characters in this play are very three-dimensional to describe, and the plot of surprise makes me ecstatic.
The theme music and into opening are very thoughtful, which makes me unforgettable for many years.
From the first to the fourth season, it is a very proposition to write, surprises everywhere, and also makes the audience nervous, but the end of the fifth season to the eighth season is completely out of focus, it is a pity,
Dexter Morgan and Debra Morgan, I will remember you"
64,"I am shocked of what happened at the season finale, no wonder low rating episode, Dexter will have a miserable life for sure, the only thing that kept him alive is Dep, low exceptions as well!
The first 4 seasons was above than amazing after that the show died to me even though I completed it but with low passion.
I've
I absolutely recommend the first four seasons and then stop, the last couple seasons are just pretty punishing. It quickly becomes a shadow of its former self.The first four are fantastic, or at least 1, 3, and 4 are. The 8th I remember being alright enough.While I recommend only watching the first four, five at most, I know the temptation after all that great TV would be rough so you'll probably finish out the whole series anyway. I know I would. Fair warning: It was my favorite show on TV, but after the finale I've never been able to go back and rewatch an episode, it's just that tainted in my memory. Someday, hopefully."
65,"When I saw season 1 of Dexter I thought that it was the best show ever created. I do still believe that season 1 was a masterpiece. I also loved season 2 (my husband didn't) and season 3. After season 3 it started to flail. I kept watching, hoping that it would get back whatever magic it had those first few seasons. My husband loved season 5 though I did not like it. The last season was one of the worst. I felt that through the years Deb just kept getting whinier and whinier. I never loved her but I felt that her character had some depth (the insecure, unlucky in love, foulmouthed, tough female cop) in the beginning. By season 6 I was just sick of seeing her on screen. I don't want to spoil anything in case you've been living under a rock and have never seen Dexter, but I do understand that she went through some things and those things had a profound impact on her. Even so I hate what they did to her character. After season 3 I would watch each season and hope that the next season would be better...but it never was. The show started out so strong and great but it couldn't hold onto the magic."
66,"When I watched the first few episodes of Dexter, I was not impressed to say the least. But boredom pushed me into watching the rest of season one; and my god, it was the best decision I have ever made.The show is full with surprises and unexpected twists, you never know what will happen next, or how it will happen. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. And to spice it up, throw in a couple of a dark humor here and there, and you got yourself one of the best TV shows ever.Dexter is a brilliant character, portrayed beautifully by Michael Hall. It's not easy to like a serial killer, it's even immoral; but he has this sort of attraction that you can't dodge. You'll immediately fall in love with the character as he is one of a kind.Debra is perfect for a secondary role, she's somewhat the complete opposite of Dexter, and her outgoing, not-afraid-to-say anything personality makes her character shine.In the end, Dexter is a terrific TV show, and I urge everybody to go watch it."
67,"I was an enthusiastic viewer of the Dexter series all over the seasons. Because the personality of the main character: Dexter is clever, always one step ahead before everyone else (many times surprised the viewer), act before everyone else, strong, ruthless and insensitive. But this last season was disappointing me. The protagonist wasn't even a tiny step before the happenings. He was lagging and always just reacting! Something happened and he didn't know what to do, so he asked her sister for help!? He still doesn't get all of the emotions, but getting much more sensitive, and so on. So the writers were about to making a stupid, vacuous, loser serial killer - who luckily always get away. I gave up at the half of the season. Dexter isn't that person, who used to be."
68,Just watch it i have watched this series 3 times over there is no better not breaking bad not game of thrones nothing comes close.
69,"I did not mark this as containing spoilers, because I am not talking about any particular episode or plotline or character, other than Dexter. But I do mention general situations found in the show.All these people giving the show a 10 are extremely generous. Dexter never encounters a lock he can't pick in seconds. There never seem to be alarm systems or video systems and he does a lot of things in daylight, yet his activities often go completely unnoticed. One of my favorite episodes in terms of ridiculous writing is one where he leaves a crime scene saying he's going straight back to the lab to do some work related to a death that the police are very, very interested in, but actually goes somewhere else for a long period of time. The detectives go back to their offices - the ones Dexter shares - soon after Dexter leaves, but not a single detective ever asks where Dexter is. That one was totally unbelievable. As the seasons go on, his ability to move around unencumbered by the requirements of his job just grows and grows.I'd say give this show a chance. It's not without its own (hey, let's face it - warped) attraction. Just know that sometimes you have to completely suspend your understanding of reality."
70,"First of all, I would like to note that I'm not really the guy who likes to write comments on TV-shows, movies or anything like that. I prefer to watch a particular movie or show and move on. However, I find my self writing this comment and while doing that I realize that it is only a show like Dexter, or these few that are equally of quality to this one.To see Michal C. Hall return on the screen every episode is just something I'm totally looking out for. This is from the moment when I first watched the show. Now I'm going to be honest, I live in the Netherlands and so Showtime is not available here. One of our national networks told us that they have plans to broadcast Dexter this year starting with season one. I keep following Dexter on the net through the so inevitable but unfortunately called ""illegal"" ways. This I'm doing since the end of season two when my brother told me about the show. By that time, no one of my friends ever heard of this show. At the end of season three, we kind of where making appointments with my friends to specifically watch a particular episode of Dexter. Me myself most of the times am getting up at 4 am just to be first to download it when ever it is released. Then later on the day, have some good time with my friends enjoying this magnificent show. Even two of my girlfriends love the show, and these are not really the girls where you would expect it from. Embrace the effect of Dexter on my life, my friends their lives all our lives. Or like the tag line says, ""Takes life. Seriously"" It sure as hell took my life, seriously!To go a little deeper on why I think it is such a great show has the following reasons. Personally I just like crime and police shows. As long as it is no where like CSI Miami, CSI NY or CSI season 258. That I don't like. I like a show to be original, a show with a sick twist even better. For instance, ""Californication"" in my opinion, Original, nice and has in a way that same sick twist like Dexter has. (alright both made by Showtime, true) If you like the show in a way I do then you might agree that after a few episodes you connect with Dexter in way like it is normal. Some regular guy from two blocks further who has a good job at where ever that maybe.It is the possibility that it could be your friend, your neighbour or maybe a family member. Of course, this has all to do with the personal view you get from Dexter. Any other serial killer in any other show most of the times only share there motives for slaughtering there number of people. For instance, there are not many nice serial killers in the show ""Criminal Minds"".So I guess it is his lovely wife Rita, played far beyond excellent by Julie Benz or his ""damaged-in-her-own-way"" sister Debra played by his real life wife, Jennifer Carpenter. The smaller but surely not lesser roles like Vince Masuka, Angel Batista and his other colleagues which make the series so complete. It is that doing his all day routines with out really pulling attention of anyone in his surroundings of who he really is. The idea that it actually could be possible to kill bad people, slaughter them, enjoy it and still get away with it. The series are original, one of a kind... ""A Showtime masterpiece"""
71,"What started out to be a phenomenal series, Is not ending well :(. I crack up weekly at everyone's reviews but never got irritated enough to post my own. Well 8yrs later the day has come this is by far the worst season.... OK sure it has a few highs but far more lows. I love Dex but he is turning into a whiny b**** which defeats the purpose of his original purpose. :/ So there's my rant I wont even get into the others or else I might as well right a report.Wtf is this 10 line crap I see one liners all the time????So they want us to write a whole report. Well this is my 1st review which is obvious at this point lol.So you want 10 lines here is your 10 lines."
72,"Two reasons propelled me to write this review. One is the excitement to tell how great this show was, and the second is the disappointment to scream how the 8th season miserably failed and letdown the entire 7 seasons of great work. Usually i don't like the serial killers but this show made me do that with its great direction, brilliant acting. I should say Micheal is absolutely magnificent. If you are in a state of deciding whether to watch or not I strongly recommend to watch. Don't decide by just watching the first episode you should see at least 3 episodes to really get in to the show.I really liked the show, I would say on of the best show in the TV history if only they had stopped with the 7th season. The 8th season drastically altered my opinion on this show with its no excitement, worst writing, bad direction and worst story. In my opinion, season ratings are 1 --> 9/10 2 --> 10/10 3 --> 8/10 4 --> 10/10 5 --> 8/10 6 --> 6/10 7 --> 10/10 8 --> 0/10"
73,"I've recently discovered Dexter and have just completed the entire first season in two days. I really enjoy it, and the writing is far superior to most (all?) of the network television shows I've seen in recent years. At first, I had difficulty accepting its premise, as I felt it was too ambitious, but after experiencing the first season's conclusion, I think they did a good job of tying it all together.The one issue that remains for me is the use of flashbacks. While the creators utilize this device in order to explain how a sociopathic serial killer like Dexter can navigate the world undetected -- through the teachings and direction of his adoptive father -- this is something that stretches beyond the ken of how much I can suspend disbelief. There obviously has to be some sort of suspension of disbelief to accept that a serial killer is also one of Miami's top forensic analysts, and that much I can accept. The flashbacks reveal that Dexter's adoptive father rationally taught him a moral code to channel his instinct to kill, and that takes this idea too far for me. The pathology of serial killers is that they cannot be taught, and while implicitly this has to be accepted if the underlying premise is to be entertained, the frequent use of flashbacks over-stresses this to a point of complete disbelief. By the end of the first season, however, this was largely relegated to the back burner, as the plot had thickened sufficiently that the viewer is more interested in its resolution than its realism.Michael C. Hall is compelling in his portrayal. Stylish show, excellent writing notwithstanding the flaws, and fun. On to the second season."
74,"Having watched Dexter right to the bitter end I have to say I won't miss it at all. What was a better than average series, stylishly directed with a great cast was forgiven for being a bit repetitive. It should have ended 3 seasons ago, this last season was pathetic, it was as though the writers had been sacked, some new ones brought in and told to keep it ""ticking over"" and told to end it all in the last 2 episodes. for a show built on secrets very few were revealed, this went out with a pathetic whimper. The penultimate series built to a real dramatic high that promised so much for the final series, instead of keeping this up and pushing the characters to new extremes it was as if they were all too tired to be bothered, every character acted as if they were ready for a retirement home."
75,"The first Season of Dexter was quite brilliant, i immediately fell in love with the character. and the idea of this serial Killer that hunts down other Killers without leaving a trace fascinated me! The second Season started off good too, but at the end of this Season Dexter should have been caught by the Police/FBI for all the mistakes he made and traces he left. This is where Dexter died for me. But because of its success in the beginning the saga of dexter continued and there came another aspect into the series, the commercialization. Suddenly the relations of the characters became ever more important, just as in any other sitcom and Dexter's kills ever more sloppier. His mistakes mainly kept the story alive and it became really easy to foresee the main plots of Dexter's story because what ever he could do wrong he did. The original Dexter acting according to his codex/logics was gone. What started off so great ended in a mediocre series. This series suffered the tragedy of being brought to the masses."
76,"I just started writing this review out of anger, because I still can't believe that I wasted 96 hours of my life on this piece of garbage. (Well, 48 to be exact) Dexter used to be so bad-ass once; it started with the premise of a serial killer who only kills bad guys to satisfy his thirst for blood. The first season was alright, with one really cool revelation at the end which added so much to Dexter's depth as a character. The 2nd expanded on that idea and was much better than the last. The 3rd, while a step back, was still great television and the 4th had one of the cruelest endings I had ever witnessed...Then came those awful four seasons. The 5th starred Julia Roberts who's not anyone's favorite person in the world, grew into something okay and then ended dreadfully. Really, why the hell would Debra let two serial killers get away just because they were avenging some bad people? So why doesn't Dexter come out and go ""hey Deb, while you're at it, I've been killing bad guys for 20 years apart from this, we cool?"" but of course there's always a next season for that. The 6th season, which was very negatively received, had nothing! It just used shock horror, mutilated bodies and statue bodies to cover the void Dexter was starting to create. What the hell was that stupid revelation where we find the bad professor is dead and it's all his student's work? Why the hell would we see the psyche of another serial killer for six whole episodes? When did this show become ""Dexter and Tom Hanks' Son""? And of course there was that EXCITING cliffhanger (that could have happened 12 episodes ago), and of course Showtime announced there would be two more Dexter seasons, so, no, nothing was going to happen again. The 7th season actually started nicely, with tension but then turned to the same sleeping pill Dexter had been for the previous 2 years. Introduction of Hannah didn't help either, her character was flat, boring and just played badly. I can't think of any other reason for her character to be there except for the actress to get naked, which she didn't do anyways. So this season ended so predictably that I didn't even think about Dexter for one whole year. Then the last one came; weird characters popped up: First was Zack, who was a bad guy for 3 episodes, a nice one for 10 minutes and then had his head opened up, but left some clues for Dexter. Great storytelling indeed. Then there was the bad guys who were all treated by Evelyn and apparently one of them ate people now and the other was into feet. Of course each of them lasted for 5 to 20 minutes each. So again, great job. Then came the Ryan Gosling lookalike who popped his eyes open to scare people and nothing more. Let's see what else, Evelyn talked a little, played videos and died, Deb did drugs, healed, kissed that pretty cop and died. Dex killed some bad guys, dropped Deb, drove into the storm and didn't die.And what a storm that was! CGI effects that even made a film like Disaster Movie look like Citizen Kane, and of course every time a black smoke comes over Miami the whole town goes insane, and of course nobody learned that Dex was a serial killer, and of course Harrison will be better off with Hannah than with whoever the hell is taking care of Astor and Cody, and of course Astor and Cody won't even get a goodbye call from Dex since he never loved them and of course that pretty cop will let Dex off the hook after he so calmly killed a prisoner because he caused his girl to go under a surgery and then die and of course some idiots will call this series the greatest television show of all time and never watch Breaking Bad or The Wire or for that matter even According to Jim which I personally hate but would rather watch 100 times rather than this vulgar garbage and of course...I gave this show 4 stars because of its great first 4 seasons, now I would've advised you to watch those 4 seasons but then you would be so drawn to the show that you'd start watching the rest as well and then you'll feel as crappy as I do now. So please don't watch this. It's for your own sake."
77,"This is hands down one of the best shows ever made. The character of Dexter is so well played- he starts the series as straight forward, no feelings. Then bam, he's complex and more human- like. So many twists and turns it makes your head spin! Way to go writers! You nailed it with this one. Only one question... what happened to Dexter?????"
78,"If you make I'd through the first two episodes I believe that you'll want to binge watch the whole series. Where as I Love Michael C. Hall and believe that he truly is a gifted method actor...the first season was the best. I'm not saying that the others were not good or exciting. You have John Lithgow and Jimmy Smitts, along with other amazing actors...but when you reach the finally and you think it should or willl go one way; it goes a totally different direction. I ""LOVED"" this series until the very last episode. It disappointed me on a very deep level. I don't know how writers, producers, and directors, of such an amazing show could end it the way they did. Very disappointing. All but the last episode is worth watching."
79,"I think that is the right name (Dexiller)
It is a awesome
Im in 7 season i will right back to say......"
80,"I love this show!!! Michael C. Hall perfectly plays a serial killer struggling with his identity. Dexter is such a strange character because while he is a serial killer you root for him since he kills other serial killers. I love the drama and the pacing on this show, especially seasons 2 and 4. The season long villains are equally interesting as Dexter. The setting and music are really awesome. The last season doesn't strike all the right notes, but it's still good enough to merit the show a 10/10 rating. Wonderful show!!!"
81,"Didn't think I would like this series but my boyfriend wanted to watch it so i thought I'd give it a go..... it was amazing! The character makes you fall in love with him straight away even though he's a serial killer! We loved him that much we even named our first cat after him! A bit gorey and did enter my dreams afew times after watching it late at night, but very very gripping story line!"
82,"My God this show is in another level.. i can challenge if u see it once you will never forget. i think every crime thriller lovers should watch this. it's a must see and very different from others. it's very hard to leave the monitor without finishing the season. my only issue is didn't like some of the casting decisions.
but overall absolute masterpiec.
love it"
83,"""Stooopppp! That never helped anybody.""
Best line ever"
84,Its been more than a year i completed this and it's still haunting me😍
85,It doesn't get much better than Dexter. I enjoyed pretty much every season. The only reason I didn't rate it a 10 is because I felt the finale was lazy
86,"Starting in 2006 and wrapping up its final season in later 2013, Dexter proved to not only be a hit for Showtime, but one of the greatest series' to ever cross the television screen. Michael C. Hall plays Dexter Morgan, the title character and a serial killer with a code- given to him by his adopted father-Harry Morgan. Throughout the course of the show, Dexter Morgan changes a lot and attempts to control his demons and the resulting effect around them. The show is easily brilliant, and most certainly earns the hype surrounding it. Not only is the shows atmosphere and concept clever and amusing, but the writing in the show takes to deeper levels as it progresses that is simply worth sticking around for. The show features several fantastic performances throughout its 8 seasons, most notably Michael C. Hall himself as Dexter. His performance is masterfully done, and as we watch him continue to unravel on his past, his future, his successes, and his mistakes, we get to learn more about the mind of the character and it is so beautifully portrayed by Hall, who clearly was one of the best casting choices in all of modern television. Jennifer Carpenter plays Dexter's sister, Debra Morgan, who goes through several struggles of her own throughout the course of the season, and provides a touching realization of the mistakes we make for the people we love, and the grief surrounding it. Other series' regulars also provide some great performances, such as David Zayas, Desmond Harrington, Lauren Velez, James Remar, C.S. Lee, Erik King, and Geoff Pierson to name just a few. However, surprising as it may be, where Dexter shines greatest is with some of its guest appearances for seasons, such as John Lithgow, Julia Stiles, and Jaime Murray, which are the best of those throughout the course of the shows runtime. The highest point of the show is, as most would agree, the fourth season- containing Lithgow's golden globe winning performance as Arthur Mitchell. The weakest part of the series, in my personal opinion, is that of season six, specifically episodes 7 and 8. Season 4 contained such strong performances and such in depth writing, it was truly hard to pull away. Season 6 contained, in my opinion, the weakest writing throughout the entire course of the show, and was truly flawed in its delivery and execution of the concepts it wanted to flesh out, until the season finale. Most people's biggest gripe with Dexter is the series finale itself, however. Where many were expecting a happy ending, or a tragic execution of our title character, we were treated to an abandonment of faith by Dexter Morgan as he faked his own death to protect those he loved and moved to the mountains to become a lumberjack. Many were shocked and appalled by this decision, but I enjoyed it for its realistic nature. Dexter went through hell in his final day in Miami, fearing he would be caught helping Hannah, and later having to face his sister live the rest of her life by machine. Seeing her like that, seeing the one thing he had always cared about no matter what, taken away from him because of the choices he made simply destroyed him. Whatever feelings and emotions he lacked before, came into full view, as he realized, as he had with Rita, that his feelings for Debra were no lie, and were in fact, stronger than anything else he held dear. He loved Hannah, he loved his son Harrison, and he loved his life and job in Miami. Dexter Morgan would do anything he could to protect those he loved, not just because he was a killer, but because the pain in his heart for losing those he loved was deeper than anyone else he knew. He had lost his mother in front of him, he had killed his own brother, he had caused Harry's death, and most of all he lost Deb. Because of a simple mistake, he ended up paying the final price. It was too much to bear, and thus, he acted impulsively, but with faith that those he loved would be better without him. He was alone again, as he always had been, but the difference now, as tragic as it was, was that he didn't want to be. He payed the final price for his actions, for his killings, and even though we care terribly much about the character we have come to know and love over the course of 8 seasons, he got what he deserved. He was never afraid of his own death, as long as he didn't hurt anyone because of it. Death, simply said, was too good of a thing for Dexter, instead he was forced to live the rest of his life in solitude, where he would remain miserable, knowing what he did, and having feared what he had become. It's a sad ending, but putting the inner works of Dexter Morgan's mind together in those last quiet moments, truly shows how realistic the ending truly was, as disappointing as it may be, it was the only choice left as his world continued to fall apart. The final price for what would have been his final kill. The ending may have not been well liked, but it did prove to be a true end to Dexter's character as his life now faded away in the mountains where his sister had imagined. In the end, Dexter is a truly one of a kind masterpiece, and will be missed.
My Rating: 10/10"
87,"This is one of the best shows I've ever watched. Maybe better than Breaking Bad!
Atleast I enjoyed it more than Breaking Bad. Watch this if you haven't cause it is a bloody masterpiece. The ending is bad though but still..."
88,"Here's what I didn't like about Dexter (out of order):1) Debra's constant swearing 2) Debra falling in love with Dexter (I mean... what? why?) 3) Quinn letting go of his investigation of Dexter even though he had plenty of evidence that he was into something shady (he knew Dexter killed Liddy!!!!) 4) Dexter's car accident (he conveniently left the body parts inside a punching bad... what are the odds) 5) Letting Saxon live after experiencing how much of a bad idea it is to let anyone live, specially someone who threatened your family 6) Miguel Prado (suddenly he had no conscience? suddenly he's always been a psychopath and was just waiting for the RIGHT PERSON TO GUIDE HIM?) 7) Debra's whining, crying and search for love during the 1st seasons 8) How ""easily"" Lumen had sex with Dexter after being raped several times and how easily her darkness disappeared and she left Miami 9) Batista and LaGuerta. That led to nowhere. Completely unnecessary. 10) Astor and Cody, specially Astor showing up drunk, what was the purpose of it? 11) When Dexter went to France to kill Lila (oh wait let me go to Paris 1sec to solve a simple issue for 1 day BRB bye boss bye family) 12) Deb didn't want to see who was behind the curtain (Lumen and Dexter) 13) Brian Moser showing up again and eating invisible hot dog with Dexter 14) How could Debra let Hannah live with her after she tried to kill her? 15) Masuka's daughter. Masuka himself. 16) Hannah not making an effort to disguise. Just f*cking dye your hair black and wear brown eye lenses for Christ's sake!!! 17) Zach Hamilton. What was the point of that plot? And he was SOOO annoying. 18) Dexter unplugging Deb and taking her body from the hospital in front of EVERYONE and NO ONE NOTICING to his boat that was CONVENIENTLY parked in front of the hospital and taking off in the middle of a hurricane threat 19) How did Dexter survive the hurricane alone in the middle of the ocean??? 20) No one noticed Deb's body missing later? No one would want to throw a wake/funeral or something? 21) The stripper Quinn dated disappearing after all he went through because of her, all the relationship construction... for what?? 22) Dexter murdering someone inside an airport 23) No one checked the hospital surveillance camera if Hannah checked in with Harrison after he hurt his chin on the treadmill 24) The amount of time Jamie works babysitting for Harrison 25) Debra confessing to murdering LaGuerta and no investigation coming out of it 26) Dexter surviving the ""lake of fire"" 27) Brian Moser recovering body from the bottom of the ocean by himselfThis was all I could remember."
89,"The other user reviewing this show - have we really been watching the same thing? Dexter was (highly) recommended to me by a friend, who described the it as a show about a serial killer who targets serial killers. A novel concept for a TV show, I thought. I'm always on the lookout for something new and interesting, a series which I can follow.What my friend failed to mention is that, by day, the protagonist is a blood spatter analyst/expert, hence the show is centred around forensic science and police investigation - a very not-so novel concept for a TV show.A lot of the dialogue is clunky and unrealistic, and also causes some of the acting to be less than convincing. Which prompts me again to to ask - is the other user really talking about the same show? Dexter has its interesting moments, but ultimately I can't say it leaves me thirsty for more."
90,"I'm based in the UK and just love this show.When they stopped NYPD Blue (and also stopped showing re-runs of this series in the UK), I just got very angry, it was as though something really good in life was taken away and not replaced by something equally as good. I must admit that there are probably some really good US drama series out there and I could get into them if I followed them from the beginning.I felt the same way when 24 stopped.Dexter fills the gap as far as I am concerned. It has humour, side soap opera type stories about the other characters in the series as well as the great Dexter storyline.I wait until the series comes out in a box set and then just watch them all in one go over 2 days (I did the same with 24 but over 3 days), it's great entertainment and totally addictive.When I saw how they manage to finish each of the Dexter seasons with an amazing final episode, I just thought ""you can't write this stuff""!Full marks to the story writers.I have a few criticisms which don't deter me at all from watching future seasons (I just pray to God that they don't stop this series). These are:1. Dexter needs to go out in disguise each time he sets out to kill someone (there always seem to be people out there with camcorders), also he could do with having a secret unregistered boat for when he dispenses with the bodies.2. Jennifer Carpenter is a bit of a ladette, with her swearing and manner, I don't think it would be the end of the world if her character is written off. Julie Benz was eye candy and we could do with someone as nice to look at and feminine in her manner.3. It was a shame Sergeant Doakes was written off in Season 2 but it did make sense, in that with his obsession with Dexter, there was bound to be a showdown eventually, if only they could have retained his character for a while longer. Detective Quinn is interesting though and replaces Doakes well.These are the only things I can think of at the moment.I love this show, God bless the writers and producers, please keep it going on forever."
91,"While I admit that I do have the average morbid fascination, and have the same attraction to Hannibal Lecter as everyone else, I actually found myself chuckling at some of Dexter's situations and emotions much to my dismay. I found the first episode to be promising. It shows the same anti-heroic essence that Showtime is famous for however there is a hint of Hollywood drivel about it as well.Michael C. Hall does an excellent job at being likable. He has no other expectations to fill now. In one episode he proved he can take a character from boringly evil to someone I'd invite over to watch the Sunday game.Julie Benz provided a chillingly accurate portrayal of Dexter's scarred and fragile girlfriend as well. One would almost expect to see her on Oprah in fact.Along with the actors, proper credit must be given to the writers as well. These two characters, along with Dexter's adoptive father, are incredibly well created and nurtured to the point that I was willing to cheer them through their respective faults. On the other hand, the writers should be flogged for the remaining characters. In order to build sympathy with Dexter, he has been surrounded by THE most annoying people possible. For example, while I have absolutely no desire to commit any crimes outside of tax evasion, if Dexter doesn't kill his whiny, gutless, how-the-f***-did-she-become-a-cop sister, I will.With that in mind, the promise of the recurring bad-guy killer (Dexter is the good-guy killer) will keep me tuned in as this show desperately needs a third point of interest."
92,"Best psychopath mind... Series you see.
Deserves more attention."
93,"This show is much better than Breaking Bad from the acting to the story, how i wish to watch another show similar to this one."
94,"Want to erase my memory and watch it again,,,,,,,,"
95,"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit! It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole ""well this serial killer had a terrible childhood..."" in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.Then there's the actual story lines. It's not cliché. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books.By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clichés.Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt."
96,"My biggest problem with this is that the entire show revolves around the audience having a sympathy for the main character Dexter and being absorbed with the mind-numbing ""hooks"" the show uses to interest the audience.The first episode opens to Dexter finding a bloodless body, and he has a feeling of awe toward the killer. For this show to be enjoyable, the audience also needs to have this awe at the ""mystique"" of watching a serial killer and seeing him go about his life and also enjoy the ""clever"" evasive answers the show consistently revolves the dialog around setting up. Another part similar to this is that they almost ruined the character ""Sergeant Dokes"" by claiming that he was something along the lines of an ""elite super saiyan delta force black-ops CIA assassin terrorist"" which was completely unnecessary and was only put in because they didn't want the audience to think that the 'amazing' Dexter would be challenged by any cop other than an ex-black ops superagent..The audience also needs to be appreciative of the similarities that Dexter pulls between his psychotic life and other people's life (you can usually spot these as he almost always says some corny one-liner narrative to himself when they occur) It's really hard to enjoy these when you can see right through them.I may be alone here but I have absolutely no sympathy for Dexter even though he kills criminals he is still a violent psychopath and a complete sadist, torturing his victims, through the speeches and the anticipation of death, before killing them, making him a disgusting person. In addition to this, all of the characters are remarkably shallow and unlikeable, and every time there is an office ego battle ala the ones that made me fast-forward through half of ""24"" I want to gauge my eyes out with an ice pick.Another nitpick is that in season 3 episode 2 I believe they jumped on the anti-pedo bandwagon which was one of the lamest sell-outs to revolve an entire episode around in the history of TV..If you can't see yourself becoming absorbed in the aforementioned 3 qualities that this show has to offer, avoid it at all costs."
97,Don't bother investing your time to watch this...after season 4 the show looses its creativity and by the very end your left with nothing... it was like the writers couldn't be bothered thinking of an ending and pulled suggestions out of their a**. I'm not quite sure why the show ended the way it did...not only was the story line pathetic...the acting was mediocre and the it was just basically THE WORST ending ever...there are no other words to describe it. I could go on forever about how horrible it was...there were so many better scenarios they could have used! I originally gave this show a 10/10 but now I feel it deserves a 1/10 Seriously DON'T BOTHER! Good Bye Dexter...
98,The first four season are awesome and the fourth might actually be the best one. That's the ending of a good tv show for me. The other four seasons are a joke and a cruel ending for what otherwise would have been a decent series. The final season is an absurd and nonsense waste of time.
99,"Superb series. Solid plot, with every season bringing a fresh nemesis for Dexter and new reasons to look over his shoulder. It is a very intriguing and tension-filled drama. The fact that even his sister, who is a detective in the police department, doesn?t know about his double-life makes for very entertaining television, as she could be his Achilles heel.Not perfect though. The writing did become weaker towards the end, with the final season being quite a disappointment. The final episode has to be one of the worst, especially considering the quality that came before it, in TV history. The conclusion is ridiculous. But man do I love this show"
100,"Dexter started off well, loved the first season and ended up watching 90+ hrs in a week to complete the series. The Early Seasons were great but the later ones were just plan bad. Every seasons do have some great episodes but the overall flow of the series turned downhill by the end.Dexter the protagonist as a serial killer/lab geek starts off perfectly- the awkward guy who find hard to fit in with others and try's to stay under the raider of others.I did enjoy his character development of wanting a family and still being the awkward guy. But in later seasons when he become's social and a smooth lier he looses his charm. Debra was again perfect in the start- the clumsy girl leaning on her brother for solving her cases, did enjoy her character development where she become a smart detective but hated the part (season 6) where she starts helping her brother out...just doesn't add up.Season 1- has great story and plot - the mind game with the ice truck serial killer and it's conclusion and meaning to Dexter want's you to come back for more. Dexter and the whole crew are excellent but i really enjoyed Rudy as the ice truck killer the most.Season 2- builds up on the first with him being suspected and trying to balance romance and its fall back. Both the new characters Lila and Agent Lundy add to the productionSeason 3- was a bit disappointment- Dexter taking student and wanting to be friends was very out of character for him but still had good plots and story. Migule didn't seem to add to the series at all.Season 4- Great Plot. Introduction of trinity was great, Dexter trying to learn from him, be a family man and balancing both his nigh and day jobs with the unbelievable cool ending made it the second best season for me.Season 5- Lumen and Dexter together and Debra at the end- didn't like it. Liked individuals episodes and how it played out but Dexter and Debra were so out of character.Season 6- B-Grade Doom's Day Killer Travis was so bad. Debra at the end and her actions were just crap. Only think good about this season was Brother Sam and he was a small part of the season.Season 7- I actually enjoyed the season for the love angles and romance it bought back into Dexter's life and Issak is so bloody cool but Debra and Captain LeGuerta part spoiled the endSeason 8- Worst season of the lot - The ending is Terrible Overall the series is a fun watch and most of the episodes are made like masterpiece only when they started tweaking with the characters personalities things turned sour."
101,"I became aware of the 'Dexter' TV series after I had read the first two books (I am currently half way through the third) and viewed the first series with some anticipation. Although they had stuck to the basic story, I feel that the writers have missed the point. The books are all about Dexter and his thoughts. Nothing else matters very much. The other characters such as his sister, work colleagues, etc. are largely irrelevant and very minor supporting players. However, the writers have given them personalities, lives, and screen time. Again, the story is about Dexter and he should be on the screen most of the time. No-one else matters. There were even extra characters created, tentative relationships formed and situations manufactured without Dexter input. Apart from that series one was quite well done. Series two, however is simply deteriorating into soap opera. Who cares about the life of his irritating sister? She is a terrible detective, making assumptions and jumping to conclusions. Then we have Dexter's attendance at 'meetings' to deal with an addiction that no-one asks about. Neither his girl friend or her mother or sponsor Leila actually ask what he is addicted to! Perhaps he is addicted to attending meetings? Bizarre. So much of the second series is contrived. It is irritating that most of the things which are happening in the current series did not happen in the books. It's no longer all about Dexter but about the lives of the supporting players  whom I have said are largely irrelevant. To illustrate how far the writers are 'off the plot', I have added a few SPOILERS (below)- from the books, not the TV series. If you don't want to know what happens in the books, stop reading here.SPOILERS  but are they? Will the writers stick to the books?Dexter's body stash is not found, there is no FBI involvement, Doakes is no longer a threat as he no longer has hands, feet or tongue (courtesy of the killer in book 2), Sergeant Deborah knows all about Dexter's compulsions and Leila simply doesn't exist. Dexter is about to marry Rita and one of her children (Cody) seems to be carrying a 'Dark Passenger' just like Dexter. And best of all... Dexter is being hunted by a mysterious stranger with a more powerful 'Dark Passenger'. I sincerely hope that the writers rethink their strategy and stick to the books. There is more than enough horror in them to attract an audience."
102,"Does it occur to any of you that the premise that this guy kills only murderers who otherwise can't be brought to justice was a way for the producers to sidestep criticism of what is basically a show that glorifies serial murder? They know you tune in for the blood lust, not the comedy or the justice. If it was about good old fashioned vigilantism they wouldn't include the scenes of Dexter enjoying his killings.It says a lot about modern America that this show exists. The parallels to ancient Rome just keep coming.Try to imagine this show with a non-sociopathic ""hero"" and you'll see that you'd not enjoy it nearly as much. And that says a lot about YOU."
103,"I just viewed the series finale episode which was a completely lousy, unsatisfactory bummer. There was absolutely no reason to kill off Debra. Considering the brilliance and cleverness of the series writers, I am at a loss as to why Debra had to die. It would have been easy enough for the doctors to place her into a medically induced coma so that when she emerged she not only recovers fully as the same old person she was, but with only one, single, crucial difference. That difference could easily have been her having complete amnesia regarding what her brother does and killing Laguerta. She would remember everything else about being a good cop and maybe she would even marry Quint. But NOOOOO!!The entire series has been a wonderful fantasy of justice. The writers and powers-that-were came up with amazing plot twists, always rescuing Dex and Deb in the nick of time. I cannot speak on behalf of any other fans, but surely there must be others of us who realize that in real life, no one like Dexter could possibly exist. Such a person could never do the things depicted in the series and get away with them. We all know that in general principle, vigilantism is wrong because it leads to mob rule, but this TV series gave us the perfect vigilante in this modern, decadent age. I don't know about anyone else's disbelief, but it certainly set aside mine. I am at a loss as to how to fix the damage, even if there is a movie or yearly Dexter special (I'd like that, though.) Thank you for letting me post this protest."
104,"Dexter is one of the best shows I've ever watched. However, Deb has to be THEE most annoying character out of any show I've ever watched. She's supposed to be this hotshot homicide detective, yet she can't control her emotions over any tiny inconvenience. Whatever she's involved with, is all of a sudden more important than anything anybody else has going on at the moment. Screaming just to get her way, or passive aggressively shutting down to get sympathy. She acts like a 12 year old in almost any situation. It just gets tiresome to watch. How about using some professional discretion every once in a while. Then maybe she wouldn't rely on Dexter to solve every little problem she has, not to mention almost every serial killer case. She takes everything too personal. 🙄"
105,"Dexter is simply the best serie of all time! With the most iconic character in fiction.
It's a MUST SEE! for those who like crime/drama series. Especially because we see the entire show in the killer's perspective."
106,9/10 the next season are very bad I don't know what's the writers where think in then it get trash
107,Dexter is by far one of the BEST tv series ever!!! A true MUST SEE that kept me on the edge of my seat. I wasn't fond of the ending because it left me wanting more n more of Dexter!!! This is by far my all time favorite.
108,Miss this guy so much and his droopy loopy sister! This was full on entertainment! Bring it back now!!!!!
109,"Dexter loves killing. 1st season I didn't like much but 2,3&4 seasons we're great. Again 5&6 were only ok. Then season 7&8 came back good. Vigilante vs Vigilante series."
110,"MIXED EMOTION DRAMA CRIME
LOVED IT.
SUGGEST ME MORE LIKE
DEXTER AND BREAKING BAD."
111,"Goddamnit I really want give this show a 10 but, I can't and it is mostly a few utterly awful seasons and especially the final season. This show suffered in the same way as Game Of Thrones which I ended up giving that series a 9/10. So if I had to split dexters 8 seasons in half I would say the first four are easily a 10/10 and the last four a 6/10."
112,"Can I please request for new seasons, please please."
113,"Dexter Morgan isn't like other serial killers; when he was young his stepfather, a Miami homicide detective, realised something was wrong with him and instilled a moral code into him. If he is to kill he must only kill those who deserve to die; specifically killers who have managed to evade the legal punishment. When he isn't killing killers he works as a blood splatter analyst for Miami Metro police's homicide department. Over the course of eight seasons a variety of killers threaten the people of Miami... typically one main serial killer per series plus several minor killers Dexter needs to deal with. He is also in a relationship with the mother of two children from a previous abusive relationship and has a step sister, Debra, who is an officer in the same police department.Dexter is obviously the most important character but Debra comes a close second. There are also the other members of the homicide department, and his step father... the latter might seem a little odd as he died before the series started. He doesn't only appear in flashbacks but frequently Dexter converses with him; as though in an inner monologue with his conscience.I really enjoyed this series; normally when working through a box set I'd take a break between seasons but here I watched it straight through. Dexter is a great central character; given what he does we should hate him but Michael C Hall does a great job making him sympathetic... of course it helps that his victims are worse than him. Jennifer Carpenter is equally good as his foul-mouthed sister; a more emotional character who provides a great balance to Dexter. The other key characters are all good and nicely varied; Rita, the girlfriend with an abusive ex; Lt. Maria LaGuerta, the boss who plays office politics; Vince Masuka, the hilariously perverted pathologist and Sgt Doakes, an officer who thinks there is something wrong with Dexter, to mention just a few. Given the subject matter it is hardly surprising that it is often very bloody and violent. There is also strong language, mostly from Debra, that might offend some viewers. The story plays out really well with elements that feature in just one episode; season long plot strands and character development that takes place over all eight seasons. There are quite a few twists and some real surprises. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy crime drama which is gripping and at times darkly funny this is a must see."
114,"This series used to be OK, but it has turned into a prime time soap...and not a very good one. Maybe the lead character killed off the good writers???? I'm glad it will be over soon. My wife makes me watch this with her (because we used to enjoy it together) and I'm really starting to resent it.The acting is weak.The characters are weak...even Dexter.There are a lot of holes in the plot (he has a son when it's convenient for the writers).The technical aspects of the show are weak - hire some consultants for goodness sake!Doakes was the best part of this show, and he's long gone.Save your time, read a book instead."
115,"This is one of those series which has a compelling premise, a great balance between the drama and the humor until the end of the fourth season. After that the show runner changed and it's goes from an epic series to a disgrace. The first four seasons are great, but the final 4 are nowhere near as good.Now that is not a crime worthy of such a low rating, but the final episode, the ending is so bad it ruins everything that came before it, if there is any justice served, any person who had any hand creative input in the ending would never work in any form of any entertainment industry again. Yes it is that bad. Not ambiguous like lost or sopranos, but the worst ending in the world, and sadly it's definitive. Do not watch!"
116,I like the bit where he kills all them people and always gets away with it
117,Excellent series. Then a sh..t last episode. What sh..ty writing !?? Dexter must not end this way ..
118,"I have never reviewed a series yet and this series changes that, i also never got to see this until 2018 and binge watched it from start to finish and i am so glad i discovered and watched this and just hugely gutted its ended.SO many on the cast list to mention but obviously the main character Dexter played by Micheal C Hall is just super and exceptional in his role as a friendly serial killer we all hate to love.Dexter is a Blood Splatter Analyst for Miami police and as a young child witnessed the murder of his mother and this has turned his mind, made him what he is, made him hate the bad and punish using the code he's father taught him. Well its almost a perfect follow of that code as the odd mistake can and does happen. Dexter has a close relationship with his sister Debra played by Jennifer Carpenter. Both play their roles out and with other Miami Metro police officers as their friends the stories are great.Dexter has a main killing code, to rid the world of murderers that have slipped the net of the justice system. sometimes Dexter has to change course, change his mind, abort and admit that he has got it wrong either with who he has just killed or who he should have killed, either way its a bloody end for most.We move from season to season with a different subject but all around the introduction and goodbyes from each seedy character and its never boring. I found some of it so frustrating as i was half on the edge of my seat egging Dexter on to just finish the bad character off, and finally getting my just desserts as another one bit the dust.i really wish it didn't have to end as it really was the best TV series i have watched, it has excitement, suspense, grit, anger, love, joy, mystery and fulfilment in the entire 8 seasons. i was never bored and loved each of the 96 episodes individually for different reasons. well acted, well worth the watch."
119,"I'm going to write a lot here because I loved this show for a long time. The lead characters were distinctive and fun and strangely likable (Deb is probably one of my favourite characters ever on TV); the central plot was really out there; the acting was excellent; the surrounding drama was strong.It went so well for so long. In season one Dexter is isolated and his life revolves around his need to kill, but over time he develops meaningful relationships and has to work the killing around an increasingly full life.It all made sense up until season six. The direction the show seemed to be going in up to that point was that Dexter was actually not a psychopath and that he had been brainwashed from an early age by a jaded dirty cop. Vigilantism by proxy I thought. The flashbacks of his foster father explaining his condition even started to feel like manipulation.My belief that the show was going in that direction made it all internally consistent. It made sense that Dexter was able to make connections with others, get married, and have children. It all seemed to point to a suppressed humanity coming to the surface.Anyway. So it didn't go where I expected and instead it increasingly reinforced the idea that Dexter was indeed a psychopath. I think that's where the show began to lose me. It meant that none of what had gone before really made sense or meant anything.So the first thing to go was internal consistency. The next was probably the humour. It didn't occur to me until well into season six that Dexter hadn't made me laugh since season five. I mean it was never laugh out loud hilarious but it was kind of a dark comedy. Then the writing nosedived. I know even the best TV shows will have highs and lows, and at first I thought season six was just an ill conceived plot, but then came a rapid descent into lunacy.I feel like I should mention that I'm not religious. I am aware that some people of faith found season six very offensive. I did too, just not on religious grounds.The writing in the first five seasons was fairly consistent, but from season six on it became increasingly incoherent and eventually just plain silly. Dexter's internal monologues began to reveal extraordinary gaps in his memory, most strikingly the belief that he had never been in love before even though his admission that he genuinely loved Rita appeared to be a landmark event at the time.Then Deb began falling in love with everyone, and then out of love again, the lowest and most ridiculous point being when her therapist explained to her that she was in love with Dexter.Dexter then unlearned everything he had come to understand. Repeatedly.Hannah was probably the worst thing about the last seasons. She wasn't very likable and it was difficult to see why Dexter liked her (other than that she was smoking hot obviously). Apparently she was the only one who ever accepted him for who he was. This was another enormous hole in Dexter's increasingly poor memory because Hannah wasn't the first. There was Lila and Lumen before her. I really hoped Dexter would kill Hannah. He should have. It would have made more sense than immediately falling in love with a serial prisoner and continuing to love her after she tried to kill his sister. I like to think a thing like that would put me off just about anyone. Still, it's just the sort of thing that happens when the writing on a show goes down the toilet.In the end it became so schizophrenic it was like that game where you pass round a sheet of paper and each person writes a sentence of a story.Dexter is going to kill Hannah – Pass it on – Then he falls in love with her. Deb gets shot but recovers – Pass it on – Then she dies.I think Dexter probably just ran too long. It happens all the time now. A show gets really popular and the makers wring every last drop of blood out of it before it dies. I often find now that if I do make it to the end of a show I feel cheated. A lot of the time I just give up but I liked Dexter so much that I felt I had to see it through. I suppose that's what the makers rely on.I actually liked the end of the last season. Possibly because by that stage the poor writing had blurred the lines of Dexter's character to the point where I no longer knew who he was and so I didn't care enough about him to want a happy ending. Having said that, it was always on the cards that it would end badly for him and I was cool with that side of it.Bizarrely, the final episode actually felt a lot like the ending to the story that I wanted the show to tell. In the end he gives up everything he has to protect his son and the serial poisoner that he inexplicably loves, the ultimate proof that he is not a psychopath. The issue of why Dexter killed people as he began to realise he was not what he had always been told would have been a strong story, but in the end it drowned in a quagmire of repetitive melodrama.I think I need to work out an average here because 1 – 5 were 10s, 6 was maybe a 5 or a 6, and 7 and 8 were about 3 a piece.I'm rounding it down to 7. 8 is just too high given the awfulness of the last two seasons."
120,"Having watched the first 6 seasons, I have a good idea about what the show is about.. and let me say I think it is messed up that people rate this show so high, and sympathize with the main character. I even found myself sympathizing with him myself in a way, because of all the suspense in the show. I didn't want Dexter to get caught because he's the main character but at the same time what he does is absolutely wrong. I realized this show promotes corrupt morals from the start, but the extent of how tiresome this show is doesn't start having an impact until around seasons 5-7, especially 7.Why couldn't this show be about a clever way Dexter sets these people up so that they get prison for life, rather than torturing them and murdering them? Also, Dexter ends up killing SEVERAL innocent characters throughout the seasons all to... NOT GET CAUGHT. The show is basically insinuating that a serial killer who is threatened to get caught has the right to kill innocent people. The murderers he does kill BEG him for mercy. Does anyone out there realize how wrong this show is and how much it deteriorates moral thought? Later on in the show, it is shown that people basically die for anything that they do that is ""unacceptable"" by Dexter.Lastly, this show becomes repetitive after a few seasons. While it is entertaining to watch, by the time I began season 7 it seems every minute there is a reference to something along the lines of: ""would a monster do that?"" ; ""but would they understand if it was a monster?"" ; ""nobody accepts a MONSTER..."" ; ""it sure is different as a monster..."". Well I'm pretty sure by the 7th season I no longer need to hear about how he is a monster, and how unbelievably hard it is for Dexter to live as a monster. It's as if the show is forcing out sympathy and acceptance for the monster (Dexter) by constantly saying how difficult Dexter's life is. So the question is, does the audience have to decide by themselves whether to sympathize with the main character, or do they have to be constantly be spoon-fed and alluded to reasons why to sympathize with him?The fact that so many people think so highly of the show without realizing that it constantly tries to justify moral wrongs such as killing (even of the innocent), torturing, and admiring deaths as a work of art shows how many people are brainwashed by the writing and can't see the real point of this show. What I think this also shows, however, is how messed up many of our own morals are, that we can even watch this show and not be disgusted."
121,"The show is about a serial killer, who is gunning only for other killers. It's based on the Dexter books by Jeff Lindsay, but only loosely. The first season is fairly close to the first Dexter book, but after season one it derails into something quite different.One thing you have to realize about the show is, that while the story revolves around Dexter's extracurricular activities, he is only barely the main character. The show tries to diversify by showing the lives of the other characters as well. Considering these characters are everyday cops working in the homicide department of the Miami police force, they had to spice up their lives a tiny bit. The result is basically a soap opera with lot's of romance, angst, about 10 times as extreme as anything you're bound to see in real life. Dexter's life is also spiced up, as if that was necessary, as the show tries to humanize him over the course of the series. My personal preference is for inhuman Dexter.Of course, pretty much everything you see on TV is like that these days. Unrealistic relationships, and attempts to throw every single movie cliché into one show are hardly a strange concept. So, coupled with the originality of the premise, this is in fact one of the best shows out there, right now. I personally enjoyed it very much, but I recommend anyone to record the show before you watch it, so you can skip through the all the boring parts.Also if you're like me and you watch this show mostly for the Dexter character, you might want to try out the books. The books are in fact so different from the series, you can read them and watch the series without noticing much overlap."
122,"Very well wrote, very well played. Best in it's genre. Thank you for your genius acting, Michael C. Hall."
123,"Dexter is the singular most addictive show ever. I stumbled upon it at the library last October and once I started just had to watch all five seasons straight through. When I finished I was so happily in awe of finding Michael C. Hall in another show of the caliber of Six Feet Under that I had to watch the entire five seasons through again.The balance of comedy, drama and thrill ride makes for a good show but the writing and acting are what makes this show beyond great. It did not surprise me to come on IMDb and see that it was rated 9.3 out of 10 with over 13,000 votes. This show truly takes you on a thrill ride one moment, has you laughing your ass off the next and then crushes you when Dexter experiences a serious loss.Jennifer Carpenter's character Deb is really wonderful as well. I've seen people criticize her interpretation of Deb but I feel like she's created a character that is truly one of a kind.I was blown away by John Lithgow's performance on the fourth season, he is such a spectacular and versatile actor. Getting to see Dexter experience coming face to face with the life that he thought no other serial killer lived, the life he is trying to live, one that includes a family despite his dark passenger, was bound to happen. It had to be written. But casting John Lithgow and watching him bounce between being a monster of insane strength and a cowering simp was brilliant.I cannot wait to see what season six holds in store and whether they will incorporate Lumen again. If the writers just let her disappear as though she can live through all of that and reintegrate into regular life then I think it will be a large disservice to her part of the story."
124,"The basic premise of the show, a serial killer killing serial killers is fine. It's the rest of it that really is a let down. As I hate spoilers, I'll just say that the basic problem with the show is the writing. Aside from Dexter himself the rest is just filler. So overall a show let down by the ""extra's"" and each season could have been done with a 2-hour movie. And here is an idea they might play with. Instead of his sister trying to ""do"" everyone including you-know-who why not have her chief suspect for one of Dexter's murders (and remember all of them are unsolved) and they only way to save her from the chair is for Dexter to come clean at the expense of losing his son for ever. Just a thought."
125,I had never seen any crime drama shows do that type like this it's incredible I think it's another one of those shows were the more you watch this the more you are interested in and I consider this to be the very best crime drama series that they ever created and it's seriously the most binge watchable shows ever so I definitely recommend this to dexter fans out there you will love this type drama shows it's a masterpiece
126,"This is a show with some great , good and bad seasons with one of the worst endings ever.I think if anyone is on the fence about the show you should just watch the first season. The first season is based off a book so it plays out almost like a mini series with no real cliff hangers. Then if you like it keep going."
127,"Dexter is one of those shows I get excited about when I describe it to someone. For me I've never been into those crime drama series but with Dexter, the story is done perfectly. There are tidbits that people complain about the series but it is done so well. It has great characters, great writing, and great stories. While it might seem formulaic at times it always comes up with something interesting plot and has great characters to support it. Without giving too much away the final season is a bit ""soap operaish"" but if you over look the logistics you'll still like it just fine. It's a series I know I'll be recommending to people and be rewatching sometime in the future! Long live Dexter!"
128,"But last two seasons, were little unlogical, and Hanna, actor was little weak,... Anyway, series was really good."
129,"High quality stuff from Season 01 to 04, with a great/careful character construction for Dexter, but then it just goes down the hole. It's a shame they did not take the opportunity to wrap it up perfectly with the epic Season 04 ending. After that it is just disappointment after disappointment until it has become a big pile of garbage."
130,Season 5 and 3 were the best of them but from season 6 it's all  up and I am bored of it now
131,"I binged Dexter's first 4 seasons inside a couple of weeks, and adored every minute..the characters, the writing, the subtext, the characters' relationships, the acting, everything...and then the last 2 minutes of season 4 happened, at a point where they could have ended off the series on a masterful, uplifting note, but probably as a chash-grab, they ruined it..so, the first 4 seasons, 10/10, but as I didn't finish it, one point down.."
132,This show is incredible and terrifying. You certainly find your self wrestling with vengeance vs what is right.
133,"And it's still one of the most uniquely thrilling, funny, outrageous and best shows ever made.The writing, storytelling, pace and music and sound effects, the natural talent by the actors and actresses etc etc etc - all this and more is without a doubt some of the very best I've ever witnessed on screen.A TV show gem that will forever live on as a textbook definition of true movie art. Period.However...One ""but"" though...The WORST ENDING of a show EVER MADE!!And bloody hell, I'm still depressed about it after all this years...Come back Dexter, you got more work to do these days then ever before!!"
134,I love this show . the best dexter. I advise anyone who has not seen it to watch it as soon as possible. You will like the character of Dexter Morgan
135,Nice acting. Good story with fine details taken care in between. Nice direction.
136,This show is a rollercoaster from start to finish. Great characters and excellent storyline's make it a compelling watch. I so wanted it to continue with Dexter making a new life for himself.
137,"What a great series, highly recommend watching this program.Personally my favourite series is the Trinity Killer story line.Lots of negative reviews on the final episode, personally I didn't think it was bad."
138,Suspenseful drama thriller all in one if u haven't seen dexter than your missing out!
139,"A great series with intrigue and dark depravity that just dragged on too long with strange plots (including bizarrely, possibly incest). It clearly extended longer to milk the fan base. I was ready for it to end after season 3. In any case, it doesn't take away from the fact that Dexter will go down in history as being a unique, binge-worthy and majorly suspenseful drama."
140,"The premise behind Dexter was definitely interesting enough for me to start watching from 2006 (the year it came out). Dexter Morgan is your somewhat-boring mild-mannered blood spatter analyst at Miami Metropolitan Police Dept. He moonlights as a serial killer, but channels his homicidal urges to rid Miami of its' remorseless criminals (serial killers, serial rapists etc). Dexter had many pluses. A catchy theme tune, symbolic/arty opening, great camera work, and brilliant actors. Michael C Hall will probably be best known for this role for years to come. Jennifer Carpenter was probably the most stand-out actress as Dexter's foul- mouthed sister Deborah and Laura Luna Velez is perfect as the annoying Lt LaGuerta. The weakest link in the cast is definitely Desmond Harrington's wooden performance as plastic spray-tan pretty boy Quinn, however if this was intentional then the man nailed it. I found him to be the blandest supporting character, often forgetting he exists in between seasons.As for the series 8 year run, the first four series were the strongest. The best season was definitely the fourth, boasting the best villain; those of you who -like me- grew up watching '3rd Rock from the Sun' will be BLOWN AWAY by John Lithgow's performance. The man is truly a GREAT and UNDERRATED actor. The season 4 finale is truly a shocker, one of the most shocking TV moments I encountered.Season 5 was by far the weakest season, and I HATED the supporting character in that season (the highly annoying and pointless LUMEN, who I was ever so glad to see gone). The rest of the seasons picked up, and continued to improve (great supporting roles from Colin Hanks, Edward James Olmos, Yassin Bey, and Charlotte Rampling). Season 8 seemed to be heading towards a satisfying ending ( I will not spoil it) but managed to destroy it all in the last two episodes.This series truly deserves a better rating, but the ending was THAT disappointing, and as a fan I felt cheated having invested so much in the show. Despite all that, it was a great show, never boring, with a lot of highs and some great characters."
141,"I cannot believe this terrible series is rated as high as it is and so many people praise it to the skies. 9.1? Should ideally be 1.9.Dexter is one of those classic ""American-American"" TV shows that celebrates serial killers and the knife/gun wielding American hero. It is a propaganda piece that has unfortunately been accepted by some intelligent people as well.I confess I watched only the first season but even giving time for a whole season to this crappy show meant I just had too much time in my hands. But it was more than enough for me to asses it as a very pseudo- intellectual show that only deserves brickbats. The plot is very unpleasant and stupid at the same time, the story moves slowly and one feels no attraction to any of the characters. Dexter is just...there. The writers try so hard to make his love interest Rita come across as the tortured poor woman that it just looks pathetic. And the other characters are just STUPID. On that note, a dialogue that comes to mind for me is Dexter saying ""If I had a heart, it would be breaking right now."" PUKE-WORTHY. Talk about lack of subtlety. I have seen some seriously dumb shows in my life, but not all of them take themselves as seriously as Dexter. These guys have this misguided sense that they are creating a masterpiece. And that only makes it worse because they are so NOT."
142,"So far the only interesting aspect of this show is the fact that this guy is a well trained sociopath though the fact that it's overstressed through his inner monologue, flashbacks and knee-jerk reaction to ""real"" emotion i'm probably going to get tired of that. The Latin American co-worker is overplayed and kills me when he says something in Spanish and then hurriedly repeats it in English. I live in LA. I know what spanglish is. This is extremely lame. I will say the girlfriend relationship is quasi interesting but it seems to be screaming at you that they'll attempt sex and then it will get weird. shocking. Like i said, the flash backs and inner monologue trash this show. When using a subject like a socially adapted psycho you really don't need to shove down my throat the fact that the guy is a weird-o. I get it. shell of a man...blah blah blah. what else.....hummm..... well i've got this disk one of the first season and they are two, maybe three episodes left and i just don't think it will be worth watching the rest. Does it get better?"
143,"Never in my memory has there been a television protagonist like Dexter Morgan. Played with stunning grace and charisma, Michael C. Hall (of Six Feet Under fame) brings us a unique kind of monster -- one who relishes in killing but is trained to only kill other serial killers.Based on the books ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" and ""Dearly Devoted Dexter"" by Jeff Lindsay, Dexter Morgan works as a Miami forensics analyst where blood splatters are his specialty. By day he pretends to be like everyone else, and by night he stalks and brutally murders serial killers who have escaped justice.Dexter may be enacting a sort of vigilante justice, but justice isn't his reason for killing. He kills for the same reasons his victims do -- he's compelled to. He only chooses other serial killers because when he was a child his murderous leanings were discovered by his police officer father, who then taught him to channel his urges for good rather than evil.He understands that he's different than everyone else, so he takes pains to fit in, such as dating a woman even though he seems to be asexual. But what would happen if a co-worker -- a police officer who's trained to sniff out bad guys -- or his vice cop foster sister catches on to him? And what if his urges get out of hand and he can't help but prey on an innocent victim? The story is told from Dexter's point of view, and you identify with him very quickly. He's intelligent and insightful and despite his sociopathy, unexpectedly charming. Michael C. Hall captures the character with astonishing perfection. There are echoes of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman and Profit's Jim Profit, but Dexter is a completely different kind of psychopath. You may not want to like him, and you may or may not agree with his methods, but as frightening as he is, I bet you'll end up loving him despite it all.This is probably the most morally ambiguous show in television history, and it raises a lot of debate. It's very dark, and in some ways reminds me of Nip/Tuck, only with serial killers instead of plastic surgery. It's definitely not for the squeamish, and also not for those who like their heroes stalwart and true. If you like your protagonists very dark, this could be the show for you."
144,"First of all sorry for my English, I'm from Europe. I started to watch Dexter from the beginning just a few days ago. I thought, this could be an interesting series so I got all the seasons. It appeared to be a very interesting serial. After a week I'm at the 3rd year ep 5. And at this point I stopped watching it. Why? It's very simple: Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan. I never in my life saw a movie or series that was ruined by someone like this. I must say this woman is disgusting. The way she ""acts"" is far under the brilliant other characters. This woman can not - sorry to say - act. As an actress she is a failure. The way she talks, the way she acts made me stop watching Dexter. I'm sorry. I thought it will be one of my favorite series, but now I'm at a point that has no reason to watch it. Every time Jennifer C. appears I just push the rev. button, but that""s pointless. Sorry..."
145,"This last series is even worse than I expected. It could easily be mistaken for a demented soap opera. Almost each episode is chock full of cringe-inducing scenes and dialogs. To mention but a few: Vogels inviting all her darling serial killers for dinner; Hanna and Deb becoming best pals; love as the cure for the psychotic urge to kill...The Vogel character started out well but after a couple of episodes turned into the worst shrink ever. Hannah was thrown back in the show with one of the worst plot twists ever (Darling Dexter I need you help to kill my husband..... Actually not, I can do it on my own) As an ex fan of Dexter, I decided to watch the final season even if reviews were pretty bad, but I must admit that even bad reviews did not prepare me for a disaster of such an epic proportion."
146,"The plot lines are ridiculous. The acting is mostly pathetic (Debra, ugh). Many of the characters are annoying (Debra, ugh), and I am glad when one gets culled from the herd. I have watched through season six, and my opinion has not changed (although, Debra's acting has improved somewhat). It is more of an assessment of the obvious than an opinion. But I keep watching. Why? I love the character (and actor) of Dexter. It is worth watching just for him. And since there is only about six to eight episodes per year (as opposed to Lost, for instance, which had 20-30 episodes a year), I am willing to waste that amount of time. I watch an entire season (either by renting or streaming)in a couple of sittings, which makes it more bearable."
147,"I have seen the whole show now and I think it's amazing. So when i discovered there were even bad reviews i couldn't believe what i saw. Did they even watched the same show I did? And I read something about Dexter being a sociopath, that's also just completely rubbish. For people who only watched the first season or just a couple of episodes of that season might think that but if you watch the whole show then you would know that isn't true at all or otherwise you don't know what the word sociopath means. He's a psychopath but if anyone saw his/her mother get murdered in front of him/her then i think that some other people would completely snap too. And for people who complain every time there is some violence in a show, just don't watch crime series. And it's just a show, it's not reality, so don't even start by saying that it says something about a person if they like this show.Anyway, back to ""Dexter"". I think this is a show that has a great concept that has never been used before. That's probably one of the reasons that this show made it to be so big. An other reason is that Michael C. Hall is a one of the best actors in the world, and he's also the perfect man to play Dexter Morgan. It's also a lot different from a lot of other crime series and that's a very good thing. Things like CSI or NCIS are complete garbage if you ask me. But Dexter is the opposite. It's inventive, has a great story, has also some funny moments and it's just not always the same thing like the most other crime series. I have to say i liked season 1,2 and 7 the most. Season 1 was just the best with Dexter's brother as the Ice-Truck Killer and season 2 with sergeant Doakes constantly on his ass. Season 7 i just liked because there are so much aspects in this season that make it good. First you have the Ukrainian mob, then you have the poisoner Hannah McKay who falls in love with Dexter and then you have also LaGuerta who still investigates the Bay Harbor Butcher case. It has enough ingredients to make it one of the best seasons of Dexter.So if you want to see a show that is interesting, innovative, funny and smart, you have to see this show! And if you don't like any violence in a show or just crime series , then just don't see them and don't review them. If it would be a bad show, then it deserves to have bad reviews, but this show deserves none."
148,"Don't get fool by all those bad reviews. This series is the best one out there. Those who give this 1 star is simply because they have no taste in what called ""good"". One of the review said he like ""chuck"" even more. Seriously? that's way worst than any series being made.For anyone that never watch it, go and get the movie from torrent site. You will hooked within the 1st episode!The stories goes on, and now till the 6th episode and i still love it. Michael deliver the role so good that he deserved those Global Globe award.Peace,"
149,"I mean,seriously those guys who voted 1 out of 10, in which world are you living in?If you should consider about doing something good for the society,you should think about watching ""desperate housewives"" or some s...,come on this,is the best series ever!!!this is just a poor guys story about growing up in blood and doing something good for the society,cause the ""good""cops are missing it.He is just simply putting bad guys away,which is in these times very practical,because you really never think of,how expensive these ""bad guys"",are for the society,for us,regular,honest people,who pay taxes...These guys kill someone and then you give them everyday food,water...for the rest of their lives...WTF...Think about it,you would wish there would be a guy like DEXTER in every city...best series ever"
150,I can strongly claim that Dexter is the best show on TV. Every season is like a complete movie which is formed by 12 episodes and you will not be disappointed or get bored. It really makes you feel that you are involved in the story and waiting for a good final which means the bad serial killer killed in the hands of Dexter but the excitement never ends till the final episode. It always keeps you awake and submits something with surprise.Michael C Hall fits the leading role perfectly and he qualifies Dexter character without doubt. One of the best thing in the series I love is the monologues of Dexter which is very deep and real.I can never really get into a series that really interested me as much as Dexter has. Dexter is AWESOME and can't wait for season 5.
151,"I'd like to register my truth admire for this series , really magnificent and it is really a master piece , I liked the whole cast and the way that they were acting , also the way that each season expressed a single case , also the perfect character development throughout the show specially for debroah who showed the perfect way to sacrifice herself for her brother and the way he stuck to her during her difficult time after lagurita's death ..until she recovered and returned back to Miami metro policeThe thing that I didn't like the last scenes in the last episode , how did Dexter put himself inside a third degree storm and his boat destroyed and after all of that he survived ?? I think this is the most part I found strange for me , yes he want to get away from Hannah and Harrison Bec he might be a danger for them because of his kill addiction but not like that ..
But anyway perfect show yo be seen .."
152,"What I love about Dexter is how it bends the rules on what we perceive as moral behavior. You are constantly exposed to the gray areas that exist between doing what is right or wrong and in the end you find yourself sympathetic to a serial killer. Michael C. Hall does a great job portraying the normal emotionally distant forensic guy and vigilante killer alter ego who is haunted by questions of what defines his true identity.The characters/setting/everything was gold! His expertise in forensics, his amazing detective sister who doesn't suspect a thing (until much later when she literally stumbles on him killing a man). Seasons 1-4 have you sucked in for an amazing ride.Unfortunately in the later seasons the writing fell-off a bit and Dexter's character became too sloppy in his craft and more emotionally unhinged than I think was authentic to his character. I also felt like the writers were spending half the time trying to figure out explanations for who was watching Harrison while Dexter was out on his murder sprees. It got distracting towards the end.The last and most infuriating note I have on the show is the disrespect they gave Debra (an incredible character in the beginning) in the series finale. Just completely disrespectful. She was a hot mess in season 8, which is somewhat understandable given the circumstances of what they put her through in the final few seasons... But that being said- she finally overcame everything, understood the truth, and above all accepted Dexter to just wind up another body dumped in the ocean like every other victim of his. I understand the symbolism of Dexter killing her ceremoniously in the finale, but I would have preferred her being buried respectfully like the incredible detective she was (maybe even beside her father). Seemed completely mortifying for her character arc to just deflate in that way. Especially In the sense of her dying on Dexter's terms, which in multiple ways violates his ""code.""With all that being said, I was emotionally invested in these characters and their livelihoods and it will remain on my list of favorite shows. It sets the bar so high in the beginning with its complex characters and riveting storylines which is why I believe season 8 fell so hard. Fell into its own trap of trying to surprise the audience. Put it next to Game of Thrones on the list of great shows with horrible endings."
153,"I was not expecting to fall so head over heels for this show but WOW. It's truly special, despite how it ends. In general, I love this series and think at least half of it is worth watching.The first season was like nothing I had ever seen before and honest to god it will always be one of my favorite seasons from any show ever made. Season 1 is magical to me, I was fully engrossed in every episode, every scene, and (almost) every character. My mind began racing with the possibility of what was to come for the next 7 seasons. How would he continue to hide what he does in his spare time? How will everyone react when he inevitably gets found out? Surely someone like him, even though he's the protagonist, would be sentenced to death row in the end, it's the only ending that made sense in my mind. How ironic would it be to see him strapped to a table, a doctor holding a syringe above him ready to administer the lethal injection. It's a perfect parallel to the way he knocks out and restrains his victims, BUT I'm getting ahead of myself (psst none of this ever happens). The first season really set the bar, and to say I was excited for more was an understatement.A strong follow up, with GREAT tension. Dexter and Doakes' rivalry is the highlight, bringing with it a strange sense of finality to only the second season. My one issue with s2 is Dexter's relationship with Lila. For a character who claims to have no emotion and little interest in sex, this plotline felt like more of a contradiction than ""character development"". He liked his solitude in s1, yet clung to Lila's side like a lost puppy whenever he had any problem in s2. It felt off for him, and if they wanted to develop those feelings in him then they tried it way too fast imoS3 was the first time I started skimming over the other characters side plots from lack of interest, and even Dexter's story wasn't very engaging. There were a few standout scenes, but this season isn't very memorable overall. Besides Miguel's plotline, when I think of this season all that comes to mind is Dexter fishing..Dexter golfing..Rita is househunting..Rita is planning their wedding...this show is about a serial killer, right?S4 was MUCH better, feeling a bit like a return to form. Dexter is a family man now, whether he wants to be or not, and it's fun to watch him attempt to balance every aspect of his life. He still felt a bit too domestic at times like in s3, but this was a great season with a standout villain and shocking finale.S5 gets a bad rap but I thought it was an ok season. Not amazing, but not bad. I felt sympathetic to Lumen's story and liked her friendship with Dexter, though it shouldn't have gone any further than friendship. It felt way too soon after Rita, some of the characters in the show even pointing that out themselves. Still, a perfectly watchable season.S6 is a joke and I almost bailed on the whole show after watching the first episode, easily the worst seasonS7 had a much more fitting and serious tone than the jokiness of s6, which I appreciated. They absolutely NAILED all of Dexter and Deb's interactions, the weight and emotion in those scenes really got to me and I was so impressed with the acting, it's a treat to watch and gave me hope for s7. Until Hannah showed up. I can't even say that I hate her because that would imply that I care. She's not interesting at all, yet Dexter is somehow enamored with her. His inner monologue wants us to believe he loves her because she ""understands him"" and he ""doesn't have to hide who he is around her"", acting like that's some sort of revelation when he already felt that way with Lila, Miguel, and Lumen. He related to them yet conveniently doesn't bring them up when talking about Hannah ( at least not that I can remember). It gets repetitive. Not to mention there's no chemistry between them. They get together not because of any real substance to their relationship but because she's a busty blonde and Showtime wanted as much viewership as they could get, apparently.All that can be said about season 8 has already been said by anyone else reviewing this show, tbh. It's a mess. The ending sucks, but I didn't much care because by that point the show wasn't very recognizable as being ""Dexter"" anymore. Neither Dexter nor Deb, the two most compelling characters, got the ending they deserved, with some characters not getting an ending at all. It's a damn shame, but Dexter is a prime example of a show overstaying its welcome.This series probably doesn't deserve an 8/10, buts that's how much I enjoyed the great parts of Dexter, and there are some seriously great parts. It starts off unique and different, and despite how it turns out I don't regret becoming a fan. For a while, it was an amazing ride. If nothing else, it's good practice for purposefully forgetting the terrible ending to a show you love so you can wistfully imagine your own, better ending since that's almost required these days."
154,One of the best series ever made. Dexter is a must watch content for TV lovers.
155,"You know that feeling of extreme paranoia and thrill while watching a horror movie when the hot chick walks into the basement in the middle of the night? Well now imagine that same feeling in EVERY SINGLE episode of this brilliant show and i mean EVERY SINGLE episode! Don't think too much about the ratings of the finale because it is only going to ruin an amazing watch. The ending wasn't bad at all, it was just overwhelming. You will be seeing some beautiful casting along the series. Michael C Hall does this amazing show just after ""Six Feet Under"" which was another fantastic (drama) series. Just watch the show if you don't want to end up on the table (you will get it..don't worry). And Deb rocks! Bye!"
156,"Who cares what critics of this show think, and who cares what squeamish people think! If you can't stand the heat, get the Hell out of the kitchen! Dexter was the most entertaining show on TV, and its only low point was when it was cancelled. Michael C. Hall was the perfect actor to play the perfect anti-villain, and the rest of the main cast were equally suited to their roles. About the only way anyone could not enjoy this series is if they are addicted to HollyWeird situation comedy Tripe like Friends and The Big Bang Theory. Who needs a forced laugh when you can have a meaningful howl!"
157,"So addicting!!! Such a good tv series to watch.
Would definitely recommend it."
158,Dexter is one of my favourite TV shows. Nothing can ever live up to this portrayal of a serial killer's life in society. We get a behind the scenes in depth look into the life of a killer who lacks real empathy... It's definitely something to watch!
159,I enjoy following the wild exploits of the Miami forensics serial killer. Tons of fun.
160,"Dexter, an American television series based on Jeff Lindsay's novel 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' portrays the life of a Miami-based serial killer Dexter Morgan. The Third Season Finale of Dexter was watched by 1.51 million viewers creating a record of getting Showtime's highest ratings. Dexter's Fourth Season was declared as the highest rated telecast over a decade of Showtime's original series which was watched by 2.6 million viewers. For his role in fourth season Michael C. Hall won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a television drama. The Seventh Season was watched by 6.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched season of Dexter. That's a huge number, ain't it? The world has fallen in love with this series, especially with its anti-hero Dexter Morgan (Dex). He has a complex personality. He leads a dual life a blood splatter analyst by day, and serial killer by night. Some call him a psychopath, while some find him quite charming. He charms the audience with his tricks, making everyone believe that he's one of the nicest and wisest people on earth (Wait, is he?). Without 'The Dark Passenger' concept, Dex is actually a good person who strives to lead a normal life.
The role of Dexter is played by Michael C. Hall who has done such a brilliant job, that sometimes, we as an audience forget that he's just playing the character and is not Dexter himself! This character has his way of connecting with the viewers. He does this by sharing his dark thoughts and delivering deeper lessons of life. I can still say a lot about the series, but it's better to watch it. I have watched Dexter three times and I want to erase my memory to watch Dexter again."
161,"First of all, first timers, enjoy rooting for a serial killer. Dexter is a righteous dude, surprising at it may seem to read such a statement.I have rewatched this show three times and I enjoy it, flaws and all.8/10 easy. I give it a 9. Bring Dexter into your life, you won't regret it.Ps-I would love a reboot and a chance for a more definitive ending...just sayin'"
162,The series writing overreaches as the seasons progress but the premise is enjoyable and unusual enough to have you tune in again and again
163,They should continue it. I'm waiting for a day to watch Season 9. Debra shouldn't have died.
164,"I can't stand shows that constantly talk about ""innocent people"". They assume, then, that there're also ""non-innocent people"". Furthermore, they see all other living creature as lacking innocence, apparently. It disgusts me how it is OK to kill any non-human animal while it's an universal crime to kill an ""innocent"" (human, of course). Give me a break, and stick back all those twisted Christian values where they belong.Apart from that the show is somehow predictable, it goes down after the trinity arc, it has lots of continuity errors and flaws in details (which is not good for a forensic show). It's also interesting to see how everybody's sense of security, except for Dexter, is so extremely crappy, and how he doesn't seem to find problematic to tail somebody clearly while everybody else does.Anyway, still the show deviates from the majority of trashy and clichéd material the industry spits on us. Then, again, that might just be another trick to make the show look attractive, rather than being an inherent quality."
165,"An unsurpassable beautiful crime series, told with a lot of black humor and a special main character. I really liked the plot of the series. It was exceptional for its time. After the third season the whole thing started to repeat, which is why I got increasingly bored. All in all a little masterpiece of the crime series."
166,"This was one of my ""COVID-19, Quarantine binge watch list""! There were only a few"
167,Amazing Show With Great Cast Basically I Can Say This Is One Of The Best 5 TV Shows In The World ... (If You Dont Know Dexter In Season 5 Not Filming Time I Mean When Its Available To Wach... Dexter Was Sick Because Of Cancer So Its Example Of The Power Man) 💟🔥
168,"Special agent Frank Lundy: ""it all comes down to simple mathematics. A really beautiful relationship is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and I've already had mine."""
169,"How can I explain Dexter thrilling, riveting exciting one of the greatest TV shows of all time that is Dexter. Please make a season 9"
170,"This is one of all my all time TV series of all time!!! Brilliant series I couldn't stop watching it all the way through! If you haven't seen this you need to I don't regret watching this I'm so glad I did! The ending received criticism but in my eyes it was quite brilliant it was sad for me that Hannah and Harrison were not reunited with Dexter at the end, but I understand the reason for this! I think Michael c hall is absolutely fantastic in this!! I've never seen him in anything before but his acting in Dexter is truly brilliant! Jennifer carpenter is brilliant too and not forgetting John lithgow he was amazing!! Love Dexter its a classic!! I will definitely re watch one day!!"
171,"As normally a person who isn't interested in these criminal type shows i went on a whim to see what all the fuss was about with this show.Well i've been hooked ever since, not only is there fantastic acting esp between dexter and deb considering their personal lives the stories are always gripping and give that tension that is needed to keep an audience going. The characters are all great to watch and all have a role none of them are useless and leave you wondering what they are doing there.Can say that i was so happy to be proved wrong that not all these shows are trash. The only complaint i held with the show was why they had to show so much sex in certain episodes it wasn't needed esp in some not as graphically, the show has merit in story it doesn't need trash like that, seems to be the way forward of TV though i guess."
172,"Uptil today, I have seen many prime time and cable series. From Fringe, CSI, The Practice to more recently, Breaking Bad, Damages, Boardwalk Empire, The Event, The Walking Dead. And of course Dexter. I must say - my favourite of them all is still - ALL HAIL DEXTER! I won't even bother with Mad men, although i know they are a multi-award winning show, but i saw snippets of it and boy, snoooooozzzefest! So after all that guilty pleasure in my TV junkie binge, I still give Dexter the most stars as it is something that is morbid, dark and conflicted at the same time, pure, exciting and twisted! And you will definitely get reeled into the character of Dexter. However, i must point out to SHOWTIME and producers and writers of Dexter SEASON 5 - there were too many loopholes and were at some parts, unrealistic. So please - FIX IT for SEASON 6!"
173,"I only made it through the first three episodes of the first season, so unless the show has gotten a whole lot better since then, which I doubt, I stand by my 1-star rating.This show is kind of like what would happen if they decided to make American Psycho into a TV series, and hired the writers and of a cheesy sitcom, a director whose last project was a high school play, and actors who previously only worked in porn.Okay, yes, Michael C. Hall is great in the show, but you know what he'd be even better in? A show with good writing and a decent supporting cast. I think the worst thing about the show has to be the voice-overs. They're just insulting. It's like they're saying, ""Don't worry audience. We know it hurts to think, so we've done all the thinking for you. You see, Dexter is very much aware that he's a very hollow, emotionless killer, but just in case you forget, we'll have him remind you about every 3 minutes or so."" The thing that sucks is, I really wanted to like this show. Great premise, great lead actor, but in the end, just a really crappy show."
174,"Dexter lost his cool after season 2 and from 3. and onward Dexter changed from being a cold calculating killer to a predictable, boring, emotional family man. On the same time, the scenarios got less creative, characters seemed cartoonish and the thrilling flow of the episodes disappeared with a few exceptions. SPOILER: Serial killers appear everywhere, everyone around Dexter dies - Luckily his annoying wife got out of the way - I mean seriously, it is the poorest portrait of an American house wife that I have ever seen, I even found a fan-page on Facebook that wanted her dead :D!It has been too easy for the writers to please the Dexter-fans, they have offended our intelligence with easy shortcuts to conclusions and overall poor storytelling!Disappointing...."
175,"Dexter is yet another one of those shows that has so much hype spread over it, it can but fail to deliver.Dexter is devoted to getting good press and good reviews, not to getting good audience numbers or subscribers to Showtime.In other words, it's pretentious, forced, silly and more than a little annoying for anyone not into trying to appear ""cool"" to their friends in the media.Dexter is also failing miserably to build an audience, despite Showtime's repeated efforts at promoting it.Maybe it's not getting audiences because it's really not a good show."
176,"Dexter kills bad people and then works as a forensics investigator. I asked a fan what happens if he murders someone who is evil but actually it turns out they were completely innocent. They said ""He never does that."" Well maybe the writers should explore that one, though judging from what I've seen, it would not bother him at all. Dexter lacks the charm, wit and humor of ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" (a classic British comedy about a serial killer). Maybe this is because the Dexter character abuses and tortures his victims which would only please a sadist, but no matter how bad the characters are, I hope the series ends somewhat akin to the cleverness of ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", with the Dexter character caught and sentenced but a twist sets him free only until a final twist of fate outwits him. Dexter also lacks the goal, crazy as it may be, of the British character."
177,"Ladies, are you single and looking for the perfect guy? Well, your search might be over...Meet Dexter Morgan. He's handsome, fit, intelligent and has a great job. He's a forensics tech for the Miami P.D., specializing in blood-spatter analysis.Oh, did I happen to mention he's also a deranged serial killer? The smartest thing (well, third smartest) that Showtime could've ever done is to premiere the very first episode of their new series DEXTER, online at their website. What were the first two smartest things? Well, in no particular order: they gave the green light for this series, based mostly on the crime novel DREAMING DARKLY DEXTER by Jeff Lindsay, and they cast SIX FEET UNDER'S brilliant Michael C. Hall in the lead role.Dexter Morgan is about as far away from gay mortician David Fisher as you can possibly get. Or maybe not. Dexter is more like David turned inside out - where the uptightest member of the Fisher clan tended to internalize his angst and his neurotic behaviors, at least Dexter has a great outlet for his. Being a CSU investigator by day, serial killer by night does have its advantages.Oh, but he's no ordinary serial killer, this Mr. Morgan. You see, Dex has a special code of ethics. He only kills...OTHER serial killers. The ones who got away: on technicalities, on the expensively billed efforts of some very slick lawyers, or simply because the cops couldn't catch them, for whatever reason. And against the sensual, steamy backdrop of the city of Miami, Dexter maintains his good-buddy, guy-next-door persona with the same skill and precision he uses to ""take out the trash"" hidden in the town's seamy underbelly. Hot town; cool customer.There is SO much I want to tell you about this fascinating monster, who is malign AND benign all at once, but if you've already read the books, then you already know. All I have to say is prepare yourself for a great ride, as the series probably stays as true to the source material as possible.And if you're like me and you knew nothing about this going in, stop reading this right NOW. Get your butt over to the website and catch the pilot episode, or watch it when it premieres on Showtime.Don't keep DEXTER waiting..."
178,"I usually go by IMDb ratings to pick what to watch. When something has a score of 9+, it tends to be really good. But this.. well, it isn't. There is no suspense, no intrigue, no clever plot. Worst of all the main character is completely unbelievable as someone who at the same time is a sociopath that feels no emotions whatsoever, and yet only tries to do the ""right thing"" by killing ""bad guys"". It doesn't make a lot of sense and the constant and tiresome voice over acting tries to sell this as layered somehow, but it just doesn't work; its not a intriguing multi faceted character, its an obvious and transparent attempt by the script writers to make an empty emotionless sociopath somehow more ""likable"". Well, I didn't like him. And not because he is a sociopath killer, there are plenty of sociopath movie characters I did like.The other characters are better described as caricatures.Perhaps its unfair to judge this series after seeing all 5 seasons of ""the wire"", which did live up to its score; the concept of Dexter had promise; a serial killer leading a double life could have made for a very interesting series, but this is just boring. Don't be fooled by the score. I know I was."
179,"I remember seeing a preview for Dexter. I then tried to tell a friend about a new show on Showtime. Before I could get the description out, he said, ""Who really cares what it's about? Everything is recycled at this point anyway."" I responded with, ""It's a show about a serial killer...except he only hunts other serial killers, and works at the police department trying to catch him.""My friend replied, ""...Well, that's a new one.""Dexter, in my opinion, is one of the absolute top running shows on television. I can't get enough of it--I've never bought a DVD for a television show in my life, but I know I'll be snagging this series as soon as it's released. Dexter is brilliantly written and nearly perfectly cast. Michael C. Hall is a breath of fresh air--huge control over his character and 100% believable. The rest of the cast gets the job done well, especially Erik King as Dexter's half-rival, Sergeant Doakes. If you liked Hall from Six Feet Under, give this a shot, but don't expect a similar performance at all--watching these two shows back to back is mostly a testament to his range.The show makes you feel morbid--you find yourself cheering on the natural villain. There are horror elements to the show, but the only thing I really found myself fearing while watching was the possibility of Dexter getting caught.I won't go into detail, but I will add that it would be a major disservice to yourself to read the books which the series is based on--half of the genius of the show is not only its dialogue, but its ability to genuinely surprise the viewer. There were a few cliff hangers this season which I honestly did not know what would happen either way.All in all, I'd suggest that just about everyone should try this show. It has a very fresh feel, and will probably appeal to some people who don't even like murder investigation or horror programming. The only group I would not recommend it to are the squeamish, as there are plenty of graphic scenes (though it is never excessively gory). All in all, my favorite current show on television."
180,"Dexter is a near-perfect schizoid for the first half of the show, which is what I enjoyed about it. His relationship with Rita was annoying, but it made sense. Even his protective nature over his children and his mostly hidden feelings for the barrel girl after Rita's death are played out nicely in his cold, logical, matter-of-fact style.In the second half, however, they decided to fill him with all the annoying emotions I enjoyed him NOT having, making him care far more about his son than a schizoid of his level ever would, and introducing the most irritating and highly unlikable love interest for him (the poison girl) to get extra feelingsy with, and that ruined it for me. He lost everything that made him unique as a personality. Contrary to popular opinion, the ending wasn't the worst. It was just the turn the show started to take in season 6 onward that made it insufferable.If you enjoy the schizoidal logical side of Dexter, stop watching after season 5. If you enjoy watching the cold unemotional type become a soft bunny who feels all the feels and acts irrationally on them, you'll enjoy the second half. I spit on it."
181,"I have given this TV series a 10 at first but after watching the last season I have to change it to 9.The individual ratings for seasons: 1st - 10, 2nd - 9, 3d - 6, 4th - 10, 5th - 9, 6th - 9, 7th - 8, 8th - 5.Overall, it's a great series. Production values are pretty much on the level of a TV series, but the story is most of the time very dynamic and keeps you entertained. I've enjoyed this series for years and waited for the next seasons to come out.The ending is pretty disappointing and I hope they won't go for yet another season since there is really nothing left to think up there."
182,"(Not spoiler in plot, but spoiler in Dexter's psyche)I have watched Dexter since it first aired, and it feels like I have grown with him. This is because the most important growing years has been while watching him. Dexter also grows. He is dynamic and he wants to be loved like everyone else. I feel that the series is all about acceptance from others but also from yourself. It is full of hope and the fight for life, even if the life that is fought for is actively murdering. There are sides of Dexter that everyone could love and relate to, and without them, the series wouldn't work. I think, what makes me like Dexter even more, is that he, like most else, has a mask he has to wear in front of everyone: and when he meets someone that takes away that mask, it is truly special. Dexter is exciting, thrilling and the best character-development I have ever seen in a series. You really get in the dept of Dexter, and it's a fantastic experience."
183,"This show is hands down the best show ever. I have made it my own personal mission to ensure that all my friends and even friends of family members are exposed to this show. I started from the second season and me and my college roommates were hooked instantly. Whereas me an my roommates would fight here and there and didn't always get along, this show brought us together. We watched every episode together and would actually set times for everyone to be back at the apartment ready to watch an episode. Every single person I have introduced to this show has loved it and borrowed all the seasons from me on DVD to catch up. The show is about Dexter a forensics blood splatter analyst who is also a serial killer with a moral code created by his father. Dexter lacks basic human emotions and has trouble connecting to others but is able to disguise it very well to those closest to him. After all he has the best hiding spot, hidden in plain sight. Very few can see through his act and with each passing season he gains a little more humanity and character development.You'll wonder if it's okay to be rooting for a serial killer as he kills a rapist or another serial killer. The show is based off a book series but the book and show go in different directions from the same starting point. If you've read the book, you don't have to worry about knowing what happens next. This show is a guilty pleasure that will have you screaming for some more.You'll love Dexter. Your mother will love Dexter. Your father will love Dexter. Don't just watch Dexter, share it with everyone you know."
184,"i have been watching American TV shows nearly 6 years.When i heard some good reviews about this show,i thought that what can be so interesting in it?So it must be passed a lot of time to watch it.When i decide to watch it, it is not the time but it is the time that i am so bored of some other shows.And it begun.And it could not be stopped.This show can not be explained in words.How can be so skillful writers in this show?İn every season,i was shocked by the influence of it.No gaps,no question marks and all above them a mystery always goes on.Every season a new unbreathable adventure..Amazing...Thanks for the writers and the cast..."
185,"In the era when TV is getting better and better all the time, in the era of not only great HBO productions like Rome or Band of Brothers, but also Fox or ABC hits like Prison Break and LOST, ""Dexter"" is another great choice to watch; But unlike LOST or PB is not forced family-friendly show with no swear words, no brutal violence or really bad characters to be disgusted by. ""Dexter"" is realistic and fresh. In ""Dexter"" people talk how they normally do, there are swear words, there are crude jokes, there is lots of dark humour but there's also a great, dark plot which reveals dirty cops, serial killers, bad childhood memories... Dexter is no question, the most likable serial killer you will ever get a chance to meet, but as the serial goes there's nothing bad to say about it. Even though the Pilot is not shockingly good, the further into the story it grabs you stronger, by the end not letting you go to bed any time soon. The story is suspenseful, surprising, revealing more and more each episode, the acting is flawless, music adds to the climate. ""Dexter"" is an excellent choice of more adult TV series. You won't be disappointed!edit - Second Season - The Bay Harbor Butcher Second season goes to the more psychological areas of Dexter's past, revealing more and more to the story about Harry and young Dexter, what caused him to be like this and why with every episode, being a little bit less suspenseful for the most of the season but really important to the good understanding of the story. Also - a complication in the relationship with Rita emerges and a hazard that Dexter's identity may be revealed to the whole world. Last few episodes are really suspenseful and overall more is happening then than in the whole first season. Still just great. 9.5/10"
186,"After seeing the pilot it is clear that the writing is bad. Voice overs are hard and these writers don't have the chops for it. Just listening to this show makes me want to carve out my ear drums. I adore Mike Hall and loved Six Feet Under, but that was compelling, well-crafted drama. This show is just empirically bad. Dexter needs to shut up and stop trying to be profound about his life like a 14 year-old angst-ridden poet. Let us learn about Dex by what happens on screen--not god-awful, campy voice overs.Interesting premise, poorly written screenplays. Maybe I'll try the books."
187,"This show is truly one of the best on TV with an exceptionally talented cast and excellent writing. Each week as the story unfolds we learn more about everyone, and the characters are fleshed out into three dimensional people that we don't see on many shows. This week we saw a softer side of the lieutenant, which was touching. But a few episodes ago there was a wonderful scene with Angel, played by the remarkable and handsome David Zayas, and his family at home. It was a very human moment in a show that is very violent and can be almost inhuman. It's wonderful to see this talented actor in role worthy of his ability. This show keeps getting better, and I'm thrilled it got picked for a second season."
188,"Dexter had me from the commercials before the show even aired. A serial killer whose lust for blood extends into his professional life as a forensic blood expert, how wonderfully twisted is that? (Possible Spoiler Here) Adopted by a homicide detective, Harry Morgan, and his family, Dexter shows his predilection for blood at an early age. Harry recognizes the signs and through the power of flashbacks, trains the young Dexter to channel his ""urges"".Four episodes in and I am delighted to see Dexter's nuances slowly coming to the surface as the character is being developed through story lines that take the time to portray Dexter coping with life outside of blood. Being clinically insane, he cannot feel emotion as ""normal"" people do, but as Harry's training dictates, Dexter mimics as best he can to ""fit in"" to the situation at hand.Michael C. Hall shines as Dexter. When he is Dexter dealing with day-to-day-life scenes, he is convincingly docile but when Dexter is in his natural killing mode Hall takes on the body posture and speech pattern of a master predator, powerful and totally in charge of his prey. *(Spoiler Alert Here)* The best was in the second episode when Dexter, takes a break from dismembering a victim to answer his cell phone; dripping blood, he pleasantly assures his girlfriend that he will come by later.Hopefully, Dexter will continue to evolve as a careful character study and not slip into being a cartoon."
189,Boring TV series with a criminal Dexter and uninteresting characters. If I truly want to see a Vigilante TV series then Arrow is much better though more unrealistic and more superhero SCIFI based. However in Arrow the enemy are extremely dangerous and the actors in the Arrow TV series are more to my liking.Sick morale in this TV series enough said.You could argue that law should work more in favor of cops sometimes yes I understand that but I don't think this is the solution.Dexter is about revenge and personal feelings and not justice. OK in season 2 for personal feelings goal is to kill someone in the witness protection program. I am sorry but a person in witness protection program has earned the right to live by doing a contract with law enforcment.
190,"I will not say much...this show is epic,regardless of the last season which was no good."
191,"I enjoyed so much watching it, amazing and talented actors. I especially liked the charcters of Dexter and Debra and their relatioship during the seasons, this show gave us so much to rembember.I give it 10/10 but the ending tho, actors didnt deserve this for the effort they gave...Writers, WHY??"
192,"I see many comments of hate and disappointment. Some fans are convinced the producers came up with a poor conclusion. I believe the fans did not give it enough thoughts.To my mind, Dexter has attempted to commit suicide by joining all those he left in the darkest depths of the waters. There were simply no chances he could survive the storm and deliberately fake his death this way. Despite being emotional, he was also logical. He knew what he was doing, and he found it to be the only way to pay for what he took responsibility for and to spare the persevered ones all the pain and misery. Subsequently, he has waken up to be depressed by the fact that he was still alive. Suddenly, he has realized that a more meaningful way to atonement is not death, which shuts all the systems off, but living the life away from the two of the closest people in his life, people he truly loved: Hannah and Harrison, leaving aside the fact that Harrison will be raised by a lone foster mother who, if it was not enough, was still a serial killer.Dexter has ended up working physically, in the shade of his unknown past, finding what he deserved in plain four walls of his hut. I figure it was worse than death, to live in an awareness that he has left his beloved son and woman who was first to give him light after all these years of living in the darkness. Death is said to be devastating not for the deceased, but for those who remain. He has said that all his life, all he truly wanted was to feel like others did. And when he finally could feel, he quickly realized how unbearable life can be from the viewpoint of a human being.Another possibility of what could have happened in the finale is an idea of Dexter's post-traumatic amnesia... The fact that we no longer hear the narrative could point to the fact that he had lost his memory due to the mysterious incident in the storm... I find this possibility very interesting as well... I really hope we will find out someday since Michael C. Hall has suggested that it is not the time for bringing the subject back on the table, but it is definitely something he is looking forward to.His decision to take away Deb's life came out of his experience, although I could not withstand the fact that he did not give her a chance of recovery... The deed appeared to be a quick call, while the doctors could have been wrong... But, as we remember, he has been asked by his friend, Camilla, to help her pass away. She referred to him as a friend, to help a friend in need. I may be wrong, but, as far as I can remember, Deb once told Dexter that she would prefer to die instead of being trapped in her own body... One way or another, I believe he could have taken care of her somewhere safe and see if there was really nothing left to do to help her get well...I really miss this show. I like the way Michael C. Hall has put it: ""I think (Dexter)'s more a meditation on the nature of morality, family, love and the male psyche."" Who Dexter Morgan was? With Deb, Hannah, Rita, Lumen, Lila... His deliberate plan to kill LaGuerta... His deeds have consumed several innocent lives as well... Despite the antihero kind of protagonist, we all have somehow fallen for empathy and sympathy for a serial killer... Controversial, yet innovative way to provide contemplation, philosophy, knowledge, morality, and, at the same time, great action, music, and even humour!One of the greatest shows, even after all these years."
193,"Dexter, A show that has been out for quite some time now. I decided to do a review now since the final season is upon us to get a good understanding as a whole about the show. You are probably wondering, Is Dexter a good show? Short hand answer, Yes. 1. The acting is good (Jennifer Carpenter is very good at portraying different emotions. All characters are believable except Dexter to a certain extent.) 2. The production is not Top notch but its still quite pretty to watch. 3. The storyline is good (Though I do have a problem with it, that I will explain later) and 4. Do a great job of showing the morbidity of serial killers while keeping it comical and not too depressing. However, The one thing I can say about Dexter that made me give it a 7/10 was the fact that All the seasons didn't necessarily need to happen. I feel the people who watched Dexter, blindly loved the characters and story to see that the bigger picture was nothing but fodder to keep the show going on. I had a hard time getting pass season 3 cause of the rinse wash and repeat type of Episodes that they had. You could Probably even get away with watching seasons 1-5 and still have a perfect Idea of whats going on in the story. I feel 1-5 did nothing but show petty characters that came and left as the story went on that didn't even need to happen. Season 6-7 the story was considered ""not the best season"" from Dexter fan. However, season 6-7 is when the good stuff hits the fan and the Show really starts to snowball very fast. If you are a Big fan of story all together and love watching progression go right ahead, but if you want to cut the crap out and start when things actually start to happen. I would recommend watching it at season 6. For that I give Dexter a 7/10"
194,"Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen, again and again. It has to happen.Jeffry P. Freundlich better known by the pen name Jeff Lindsay created a complex character called Dexter Morgan through his novels, of which Darkly Dreaming Dexter was the first. I read on Wikipedia that Jeff wanted to name the novel ""Pinocchio Bleeds"" but his publisher disagreed. I wonder how it would have turned out as a TV series. I started watching Dexter in early 2011. I don't know why I took so long to fall deeply in love with this epic of a show. The pilot episode sets the stage for an intense, nail-biting thriller that follows in the remaining episodes of Season 1 focused around the main antagonist ""The Ice Truck Killer"" played brilliantly by Chris Camargo. I do not want to ruin the show for someone who hasn't watched the series yet, so no story or plot spoilers here.James Manos, Jr. who co-produced and wrote the first season of The Sopranos developed the series that is exceptionally well executed and designed. The writing is top notch and in most episodes keeps you guessing on what's coming next. Although, only Season 1 is based on the novel and the other 5 seasons are original, I have to appreciate the effort Jeff Lindsay put in creating the characters in the story and the plot.The characters of the series will be etched in your memory for a very long time. Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's foster sister, David Zayas as Batista, Erik King as Doakes, Lauren Velez as LaGuerta play recurring characters through Season 6 and have done a commendable job of staying in character since Oct 2006. There are many others in the show including the antagonists in each season that need a special mention here. Chris Camargo, Julie Benz, Jimmy Smits, John Lithgow, Colin Hanks to name a few. All the other actors including extras do a phenomenal job which makes the show, for lack of a better word, real.Although the series is about a serial killer and his vigilante ways, there is something so likable about Dexter's character that you will root for him every time he is trouble. The reason is his ""code"" which he adheres to 99.9997% of the time. He kills people who kill people. The kill room, the modus operandi and the act of taking lives are shown consistently flawless, after all this is fiction and makes for a great TV show. Michael C. Hall epitomized the character remarkably. His first person narration, diction and quips combined with unique facial expressions make you fall in love with the character instantly. Michael's method acting and certain subtle nuances in characterization resulted in a more lifelike performance.Some of the episodes show a lot of blood and gore(Season 6) which may be a huge turn off for most people. Blood plays an integral part of the story right from the beginning of Season 1 as Dexter has a love-hate relationship with blood.This review is as layered as the series. There is no beginning and end to such a multi-layered, open for more plot lines and new characters, type of story. Personally, I don't want the series to ever end and I am not even sure about a logical end to Dexter's character.Please make ""tonight the night"" to start watching Dexter, if you haven't watched this show yet. The title credits theme is beautifully composed and shot and will slowly begin haunting you. Dexter and his dark passenger....the journey continues."
195,"Comedy, drama, horror can you ask for anything more? Dexter is a fantastic show which takes a different way than other series, We actually follow the serial killer, feel bad for him, hope his next kill will be successfully and hope he will never get caught.Michael C. Hall is an artist, he portrays this maniac so perfectly it's unbelievable, the character from the book just come to life and i will never get over it why he isn't winning every single award he's up for. The rest of the cast are up and down, most have them bring confident performances, others fail but i have never let that stop me enjoying this brilliant show which brings something new in every episode.Also the fact that the seasons are so different and there is very little of the show repeating itself, i think that it is one of the pros of making a show after a book. Dexter is a show everyone should enjoy even if you aren't into serial killer shows because this show is so much more than just another slasher show and also i believe the fans of the book will not be disappointed with this show."
196,"Dexter is one of those shows that is instantly addictive. I know I am late in the game but I recently got Showtime at home and have been watching the episodes from the start. While it is a shame that such a good show must be relegated to a premium cable channel, it wouldn't be as good on basic cable. It is a show that needs to push the envelope a little and therefore must be on a network such as Showtime. The show is full of excellent actors and they each portray their respective characters in a way that makes the whole story very believable. A show like Dexter comes along once in a while, in the same vein as The Sopranos, where you subscribe to a premium channel just so you can watch this one show, it is that good (in my humble opinion)."
197,"Well it may be a nicely spun story executed almost flawlessly on screen by the makers and the cast but this piece shows just whats wrong with the morality of our times. If bad guys have to go through the terror and the physical pain of getting chopped up alive its OK.. even great because it gets the trash out of the world. Its the same logic which sick cops, marines and other kinds of fanatics/psychos have when they torture those who they find are under their absolute control like in abu gharib or elsewhere but its sad that most people find it to be right... I hope people stop and think before they give shows such as this a 9 indicating that they stand for what the story's hero is doing."
198,"I was honestly shocked at how bad this show is. The main character is unlikable because he really is just a depraved, immoral, character-less serial killer. He doesn't kill because he's a vigilante but simply because he likes it. The premise of the show itself, then, is horrifying because he is NOT a good guy doing something that just appears bad if you look at certain ways. He's the bad guy, just as bad as the people he murders. It speaks to the degraded state of the world's lack of morals that this show was a hit.Aside from that, his character still has no likable qualities. In addition, the language is ridiculous. Why do people want to hear the f-word so much? Are you all 12 year olds giggling at potty words or rebellious teenagers cursing for an immature thrill?Horrible, horrible show. I couldn't watch it once I saw the depravity in it."
199,"Probably one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES! Michael C. Hall is brilliant. The cast is a perfect fit for this show. I never miss an episode and find myself disappointed when it's over because I have to wait a whole week for the next one. I have sat and watched Dexter marathons and can watch episodes over and over. In a world of mindless sitcoms and sappy drama's that have all been done, Dexter is truly original. The relationships between all of the characters are very engaging and creative. The writers have done an amazing job developing interesting dialogue that is both easy to follow and makes you think about what is being said. It now tops my short list of shows really worth watching that includes Deadwood, Rome and Law and Order. Keep up the good work Showtime!"
200,"I previously have rated this series with a 10. It started so amazingly well, but that was not the thing that made it great. What was great for me is that I have read the books and the series was so much better! The acting was good, the dark humour was very nice, the stories were compelling, the killing was bloody. Everything seemed perfect.After watching the last and eighth season crash and burn (the series had become ridiculous at least 3 seasons before) I have to review my grade. But do not be fooled! If the last seasons sucked, imagine how good the first ones were to average an 8. You should at least see the first season.Cheers!"
201,"The first 6 seasons were awesome - fun plot, dark humor, interesting characters. The last two were, by comparison, dreadful and seemed thrown together in order to wrap things up. Having Dexter's affair with yet another murderous hottie turn cutesy was just too much. The Hanna character went from a dangerous sociopath to tender mommy figure and total plot device, and it was a total turnoff. And even worse was the decision to make Debra discover that Dexter was a serial killer. It turned the story into a depressing soap opera."
202,"""Dexter"" is the perfect example of how a TV show or movie can have some plot problems or an odd ending or some seasons that are weaker than others, yet still hold your attention simply because of the excellent characters and the darkly witty dialogue.Because of how well-written Dexter Morgan and Deb and Doakes and all the others are in this series, it's easy to overlook the other flaws. Too many shows and movies either concentrate on plot and end up with flat characters just moving through the motions or concentrate on action and special effects to try to keep the viewer's attention.But the problem is this: you can have great special effects and the most complex plot, but if your characters are poorly-developed, the show is going to be horrible. Yes, ""Dexter"" also has some great plot lines and plenty of action, too - but it mainly stands out from other shows because of the rich characterization. Dexter Morgan is a complicated person. The writers of this show managed to make a serial killer sympathetic, which is no easy achievement.The other plus is that, while ""Dexter"" is dark, it also has a darkly humorous side. Humor is very valuable, even in drama. When I think of all my favorite shows, no matter how serious their subjects, they all have hints of humor in them. Shakespeare, who often put a jester in his darkest plays, knew the value of comedy - and its relation to tragedy. A lot of dramas take themselves too seriously (maybe in a vain attempt to be taken seriously by the viewer?) and come off as insincere and one-note.""Dexter"" is up there with my favorite shows of all time. If you haven't seen it, it's worth watching."
203,"-Dexter is a wild animal. acts with instincts.
-His stepfather Harry nurtures Dexter with a sense of justice to control and direct his instincts.
Dexter, thirsty for his flesh, waits patiently to kill when he grows up.
-The sense of control is too advanced, which makes it human. He doesn't like things he can't control, he can't control his instinct.
The only thing he loves is kids.
When you see an empty sack without looking at yourself, you see it as a noble creature.
-Dexter is unique. different from all the serial killers he killed.
-Constantly questioning himself about his humanity. people love their feelings, but you follow humanization together.
-If it's not just a serial killer.Regarding the array:Does not leave you question marks. Clear and clear. The thing is, Dexter. He can only take the show in front of him. The side character can reflect Dexter's human nature.
brother, agility test,
girlfriend, wondering if you can fall in love,
Profession and employees are there to show how normal they can behave in natural life.It's not just the behavior of the girlfriends' children. I think it's as safe as a child and it doesn't bother big human emotions."
204,Got me hooked relly quick and It's hard to think that it's over after all these years
205,"You know how it is when you're making a snowman and you start out really ambitious and excited, and you roll out the best lower body snow ball you can imagine, and it looks so good, but you've used up most of the good snow, so each subsequent portion of the snowman gets weaker and weaker until the head is a bunch of muddy snow interspersed with sticks and rocks, and you decide you're just getting too cold and wet for all this nonsense and you are getting more and more bored with it all and you want to go inside and you you skimp out on the face by just sticking a couple rocks for the eyes and a bigger rock for the nose (since you've eaten the carrot long ago in frustration), and a stick you broke off off one of the arms for a mouth, and so now the arms are mismatched and the whole thing just looks bad and you really don't care anymore because you're just glad that the stupid process is over? I think that's how the writers of the final season of Dexter felt."
206,"Everyday I would think about it and couldn't wait to get off work and find out what happened next. Actually so glad I waited to watch this on Netflix as it would have been so hard going week to week on showtime. I was so sad to see it end. After some time I think I will start it over. Yes, it's that good!"
207,"I just watched this whole show in a little over a month on Netflix.
I fell in love with the characters, I thought they were very unique, Dexter the softie killer, Deb with her swearing and all, and everyone else. I couldn't stop watching it until the end.Which was, to say the least, disappointing. 
It left me with a feeling of emptiness, like, is this it?A lot of characters, as stated by some of the previous reviews, did not deserve to end this way. It just doesn't do the series justice.This is why I give it an 8 out of 10, because I really enjoyed watching it, some seasons more than others, right to the end. Which left a taste of bitterness. Oh well, time to fing something else to watch and forget this horrible ending."
208,Amazing. Couldn't stop watching. Love it. Fantastic writing and acting.
209,"The only bad thing that I can say about that TV serie is that it is over.
Dexter's character is so mysterious and you always want to watch every single step he does + everything is written in a smart way and not particular.
No bad words to say , the cast is good too(except for Maria).
Liked Angel and Dexter the most."
210,I have watched the whole show two time ... 2014 and 2018 and I still can watch it after 4years from now ..... it is really smart each episode has a different idea .....
211,"Nothing is perfect . The world we live in is not perfect. You are not perfect and me neither. Also story has to go somewhere. Dont get disappointed that it didnt go your way. All in all DEXTER is all time classic, you dont wanna miss."
212,"I love it all.
The characters, the stories and the dark humor. 
Dexter is a well done show that shows another part of the human nature and human needs. 
Definitely reccomented for people who enjoys more twisted kind of crime and drama. I can fully say that this show made me see another side in this very unknown and scary subject . The way it makes you identify with Dexter will surprise you as it surprised me even if you are a totally normal person or an easily scared person like me. 
I belive most of the show is great. 
I would remove one or two seasons, and it's definitely not for anyone. 
Yet if you started see it you might couldn't stop.
To wrap it all up the acting is great and the side story lines (the one that doesn't conclude s Dexter) are great and not boring at all as they are in my opinion in most shows."
213,"Love it so much, that I'm watching it again and I have never done that before. Only character I hate is Doakes. Dexter had way too much patience with him. Best season was Trinity. JG did an excellent job. Rita was annoying. I know shows can't go on forever but I wish this would come back with new episodes."
214,I will wait for another season always. One of the best tv series ever!
215,"It is hard for me to be objective so I was hooked (and still am I must say). It is the perfect mixture of dark humour and suspense. It is thriling to follow the investigation from the point of view of Dexter who is at the same time solving some crimes and committing others. I think the key is the contrast with his co-worker and sister with who he has yet a great chemistry.
I would rate it 12 if I could but as I was disappointed with the twist at the end of season 6 (the one leading to the scene we were all waiting for) and with the last 6 episodes that contained some inconsistencies and gave me the impression that the writers were just trying to finish the series, 10 is fine.
A must be seen to me."
216,"Okay so not going to lie off the bat this is my favorite show so take that as it is. Anyway, this show isn't like other crime shows. It doesn't follow a detective talking to suspects and finding out at the end of the episode it was the person from he beginning who we all knew it was. This show is from the prospective of a serial killer working as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami metro police department. Dexter witnesses something as a child making him have this urge and need to kill but only as his step father teaches him people who deserve to be killed. If you read this and want to watch something that has someone really embrace the role and make you believe he is really that character then this is the show for you."
217,Absolutely brilliant. A wonderful new look at the crime drama. Addictive. With a controversial ending but it doesn't leave a bitter taste at the end.
218,"This is my top crime thriller show , good stories & acting , hope they make season 9."
219,Micheal c Hall is phenomenal actor and his character is very difficult and good.
220,"Dexter is one of its kind. By far the Darkest show I've ever seen. If you dare enough to give it a try, it would surely break your heart! Truly melancholic and pathetic. If you like this genre, just go for it. Dexter will never disappoint you except for the last season! Highly recommended from my side."
221,"Dexter is a glorified soap opera that is carried by the great ideas of the book and Micheal C. Halls performance. The strongest points of the Series are those that come from the book. But usually, the more it deviates from it, the worse the quality of the show becomes. The side characters and stories are really flat and cliché. There is not a woman in there that isn't a weak trope, you got some overemotional girl heavy on the father issues, a ""bitch"" coworker that has it in for the only other women in the department and later uses sex to get ahead in her job, a woman that completely falls apart because she thinks her husband is cheating, and has public breakdowns. Really the strongest female character in the show is a meek housewife that struggles to get over her past as victim to an abusive husband. The show is not a bad watch at all. First time i watched i was glued to the screen. But if you look past the really fascinating subject matter, and the great delivery of Micheal C. Hall, you come to realize that the show itself is very weak and that a different team of writers and a better director could have made a hell of a lot more with the ideas from the books."
222,"When you read that a show is about a serial killer it is (IMHO) natural to question how you could identify and like the main character and show. But in the case of Dexter I had the benefit of the ratings being exceptionally high on IMDb to peak my interest enough to give it a try. I'm very glad I did as they come up with a somewhat far fetched back story, but having it based on an orphaned child under horrific circumstances of seeing his family chainsawed to death causing a cop to adopt him and raise him anticipating problems based on his sick tendencies who responds by setting up the Dexter with a ""code"" to kill bad guys who slip through the system making him a ""lovable vigilante serial killer"" who gets rid of disgusting people the system doesn't punish. So Dexter is a human scavenger focusing his desires on scum of the earth people the audience sees as deserving, making him a good guy not a psycho.So while a serial killer, they have a fairly good back story that allows us to grow to like the serial killer and root for him because while he is sticking big knives in people's chest and cutting them up to dump into the Atlantic from his boat, they are the kind of people you wanted Dirty Harry to shoot in all those Clint Eastwood movies where (especially in the first) when he gets the chance to blow them away with that big 44 magnum at which time you now want him to blow the bad guy away (and make it hurt if possible).That leaves us with a base story that allows for some interesting season and episode level stories. Dexter is pretty consistent in the season having a story that they did a good job of building to a climax at the end that was intense. Some I liked more than others, and while I hated when they let Rita get killed because Dexter dragged his feet killing the bad guy for the season. But as the show progressed it did open the coming seasons for more interesting developments in the show, stories and in Dexter as a human being.That leaves the end of the show that I was not pleased with at all. They dragged us through all the evolution to see Dexter set free from his ""dark passenger"" finally at the series finale (or last few shows). But they just couldn't let a serial killer go off happy and in love. They took care of Harrison as he told Dexter he loved his new girlfriend soon to be wife as they prepared to leave. I could even accept them taking out Deb. But why leave her a vegetable that Dexter couldn't leave? I understand need for closure on that end, but why not just let her get shot and die a hero so he could go on? I liked that he wouldn't let her live a veggie as we all know after all those seasons that wasn't his sisters way, she wouldn't want to burden anyone and was brain dead. She would have wanted to have Dexter pull the plug on her. But why couldn't he have simply gone on to meet up with the new girlfriend whose love healed his heart so he could feel emotion? I could have even accepted him dying in the storm better than what they did. Having him wind up out west as a logger was a horrible end. He cleaned up everything and could and should have had him connect with his love and let them end the show living happily ever after in Argentina. But having him battle his demons, win, and then just live alone in a shack heart broke when he simply had to go marry his love and father Harrison was a maddening ending that lowered my opinion of the show a great deal. I'm a romantic, even in a serial killer main character I wanted Dexter to wind up with his cute serial killer wife and raise Harrison living off their riches as their love healed each others need to whack innocents or anyone else.Given the way they dodged and wrote around the other obstacles for the rest of the major stumbling blocks in the story why not let our main character come out happy? I gave myself weeks to allow the initial anger dissipate so I could write this without the initial anger laced through. Dexter is unique and would be a 10, but after finding a way for him to dump his darkness, heal his heart and live with real feelings deeply in love with his new wife and son having him wind up alone in a logging camp was a crappy way to end the series. With so much that I adored about the show and characters I've never been so disappointed in the ending of a show. One of those times when I think the writers gave the viewers a very poor ending when there was a spectrum of endings they could have given us from him dead or in jail and would have rated them higher than the 1 star ending they gave us. After all those hours of good entertainment and in 8 minutes the writers stuck it to the audience with a 1 star ending that could have been a 10. 8 minutes; Guess Breaking Bad endings are just really rare where we get it all."
223,"I broke an oath I made to myself a few years ago by rewatching the first season of _Dexter_. When that show ended, and that *spoileralert* sicko sat that in that pathetic room looking at us through the screen, I was happy it ended. I wanted him sitting there forever, unable to move. *endspoileraltert*, but had to give season one a revisit, because it was so damn good.Dexter embodies the fantasies many men in our generation. We just want to be the perfect gentleman all the time (while working a cool job, banging a hottie), except when we are unleashed to go buck-wild on (mostly) sexual predators who have so offended the ladies we love. That character Paul: perfect caricature of the bad ex-husband. The moment I really got back into this show, where I just paused to write this, is when I felt along with Dexter the desire to track down Paul and kill him. A literary work is great when it sucks you in.Definitely not watching past season two, though. The series dies with Doakes's death.5/10 for the series, but +1 because season one was a ten."
224,"I really loved the concept. There was no other series in which you could love the bad guy! Very nice plot! Nice cast and interesting characters! Dexter is a amazing character, well played by Michael C. Hall, who seemed to have a ""normal"" life in general! And that is the best on the plot.. that if I didn't know that he's a serial killer I could never imagine it. In addition, another thing I liked in this series was that there was a connection to the plot between the episodes. However, in my opinion, Dexter was a unique character and he deserved a better end in his story! That's actually the only reason why I voted 7 out of 10!"
225,"I just finished watching the fourth season of ""Dexter"" and I find him to be very much unlike any other 'vigilante' I've ever seen on screen.Unlike vigilantes like those in movies like ""Death Wish;"" ""The Exterminator;"" ""Taxi Driver;"" ""Falling Down;"" etc...this guy is very meticulous, analytical, and, rarely if ever, if at all, exhibits any outward anger or aggression...making him the perfect enforcer of justice when the law doesn't get its perpetrator.At first, I had the idea that Dexter was crazy by seeing and speaking with the image of his dead father; but, now, I believe that only to be him remembering back to when his father gave him advice on how to 'not get caught.' So far, Dexter has not killed one person who has enriched the world. One, however, wasn't guilty of the crime Dexter killed him for, but, he was still a sexually-sadistic bad guy.John Lithgow, a great actor known for portraying a variety of crazed and rotten characters, is in this fourth season...and, he's as great as ever! I don't want to go too far with the 'spoiler alert,' but, this character is in need of a lot of Dexter's handiwork!Other veteran actors who star here and are great in their characters are James Remar; Jimmy Smits; and, Keith Carradine.This is only a guess as I'm not at the end of this series yet, but, I'm betting that Dexter screenwriters will eventually kill a totally innocent person to satisfy all the viewers who believe that what he's doing in his spare time is wrong!?!? That's what happened in ""Magnum Force."" An innocent had to be killed-off in order to show that what those cops were doing was a no-no. However, I did like how one of those cops said something like ""We're not killing anyone the courts wouldn't kill if the system worked correctly."" I believe that Dexter believes this exact thing! Deep down, everyone feels that Dexter is in the 'right,' which is why this series is so popular...they just won't admit it.All it takes is a crooked lawyer and a bent judge, and, criminals walk...but, not with Dexter in town."
226,"I just finished Dexter. Wow! What a great show! I highly recommend it if you like crime dramas on an intense level. It's about a forensics expert who moonlights as a serial killer who only kills those who have escaped justice. In my personal opinion, Dexter is much more. He struggles with his dark side and his humanity, in the end his humanity wins out when he leaves his job, family, friends and leaves his 4 year old son with his girlfriend who is living in Argentina, all to start over and create a new self. I musty say though the ending was not what I expected, it could have been more epic, but otherwise a decent ending. Over all Dexter is a must watch show."
227,"Miami, Florida. There are a lot of people doing very evil things. And when they slip through the cracks of the legal system, that's where our titular lead(C. Hall, subtle, meticulous), and his Code, comes in. He investigates them to ensure he doesn't off anyone innocent. Drugs them and wakes them back up in a secluded room. They, and the room, are taped down with plastic – no DNA evidence left behind. With photos, he ensures their victims will be the very last thing they see, before he bludgeons or stabs them. Up close and personal. Not the noise and distance of a gun, or the ""soft"", almost indirect way of poison. No, he wants to feel it. If there's an ironic or poetic way or place to take them out, he'll find it. And he saves a blood slide from each of them: a trophy. Dismembered and dumped off the Bay, no one knows about it. Murder. It's one heck of a way to make a living.Of course, he wasn't always like this. Actually, OK, he totally was. But as awful as this side of him is, he does try to channel it so it might help. Of course, in my opinion, it's not ""terminate people who do wrong"" that solves problems with people's criminal behavior. It's social issues, making sure everyone can get by without resorting to crime: wages for poor people that allow them to thrive, education for everyone, etc. That would greatly limit how many criminals there would be, and then the police could focus all their energy on just them. This does explore whether it's justice or a need, revenge. And there's, of course, the element of it being a power fantasy.Before landing the blow, he may have a short conversation with his target. After all, they share some similarities both have intentionally slaughtered other people, and more than once – except for some of the rapists and the like. How do they deal with this or that? What choices have they made, and were they happy before their current predicament? And the serial killers herein, the many different types of what this calls monsters(I feel that only actions can be terrible, people may have the option to either do them or not, no one is inherently wicked) are explored in great detail – this is, at its core, a psychological thriller.Learning the craft took years, and a mentor. That's where his adoptive father Harry(Remar, the weight of such responsibility, coupled with the hope for the better) comes in. The hero cop crafted the ruleset that I've mentioned above. He died before this is set, living on in Dexter's mind, this shown via both actors interacting, which we realize is only what is imagined to be taking place. Every major decision is ""discussed"" with him, and he'll argue, show pride, express disappointment, etc. How long should we follow our parents' guidance? Where do we set the line, what is a healthy way of rebelling?Thus, his stepsister, Debra(Carpenter, nervous in spite of competency), got the short end of the dad's attention-stick. It pushed her to join the force, and she now fights to get into Homicide, from Vice. One of the only women in a male-dominated field, she's masculine, and tries but fails to hide her insecurities, indecisiveness, and her deep emotions usually with an obscene, pun intended, amount of swearing, which can get awkward, and feel like they had a quota to fill. The two of them together is sweet, always looking out for each other. She's the closest he has to a human connection.His girlfriend, Rita(Benz, scared, not pathetic) is scarred. Figuratively speaking. Her ex, who left her with two kids, that she takes great care of, is an abusive junkie. She isn't comfortable with intimacy, which is how he prefers it – he's wary of letting people in, thinking they won't want the real him. With just a little mishandling, she could have been very frustrating. If she had been continuously stuck in her pain, someone for others to help with no end in sight, that's not really something we want to see. And that's not what we got. She has stories of her own. As does almost every regular in this, many of them found in the department, some of whom will change rank over the years, their families strained by the job and the like. This is stock-full of dynamic, detailed characters and their interpersonal relationships, that grow and develop over time. Every performance is compelling.This is tense, dramatic, addictive, binge-inducing and crazy fast-paced, a ton happens in a short space of time, without it being exhausting or feeling forced. This is almost always good, it's even better when its stuff that relates to the whole season(each of which is a chapter in the overall plot. 1 and 4 are amazing, 2 and 3 are great, 5-8 are good, but skippable. And the finale is only OK), and it's at its best when it's to the entire show. A lot is communicated in little time. Scenes ""turn"", someone loving turns out to be a psycho or vice versa. Still, this doesn't rely too heavily on fake-outs, twists or the like. The production values are high. This goes into what ""normal"" is, whether or not it's possible to have a fulfilling life while secretly engaging in destructive behavior, among other themes. Can it be controlled? Could anyone accept it? Can it remain hidden?In addition to what I've already noted, there is a lot of brutal, bloody, disturbing and violent content in this. That makes sense given the nature of this. What does not always, and gets unpleasant, is the many prostitutes, strip clubs, and general nudity and sexualization, including of the deceased(!), and the many fridges full of girls, not treated as individuals, rather, there to get sympathy. I recommend this to anyone attracted by the subject matter. 8/10"
228,This Show is awesome and excellent with a great story that has an excellent cast. I've seen all 8 seasons and my favorites were 2 and 4 because they had some pretty intense stuff but awesome things like the Trinity Killer and The Bay Harbor Butcher. This show started in 2006 and became one of my favorite shows with others like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. If you have not seen this show you will need to see it because it is a really intense and great show. One thing is if you want your kids to watch this show they need to be able to handle the language and violence. Also this show has Nudity and some sex scenes so you might want to close your kids eyes. But this is a great show and will be a fan of Dexter
229,"Everything about this show is just amazing. The concept of a serial killer who kills to actually make the world a better place, take out the trash as Dex would say, it's very powerful. The dark passenger, the code, the boat, the knives, the ritual, blood spatter etc. But the best thing was the relationship Dex and Deb share as brother and sister, it's so intense and it was the one consistent thing in both of their lives. Overtime you start to feel the characters, I actually felt bad when Dex let Hannah in his life despite Deb telling him not to. You develop a strong attachment to the characters very quickly.Yes, the end was kind of tame. But the characters, Rita, Harry, Vince, Angel, Harrison... especially Deb and Dex are gonna stay in mind forever. It was totally worth it, gonna miss watching it."
230,"WoW WoW WoWThe best series I have ever seen.. Don't end show with disappointed season 8 we need more form dexter.. It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole ""well this serial killer had a terrible childhood..."" in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.Then there's the actual story lines. It's not cliché. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.'Dexter' can also be hilarious when it wants to be, depressing when it wants to be and especially thrilling when it wants to be. And it doesn't come across as trying too hard.. DEXTER series is masterpiece on TV it can't end like that.. Bring back DEXTER!!! A highly recommend one of the few good series on TV worth watching."
231,"As each season of Dexter comes around, the acting gets better, the story gets better, the production values get better, the show as a whole just keeps getting better. The new season is easily the best of the series. Without giving anything away, the characters are being shown in a different light. I find it weird that I am beginning to warm to a serial killer and don't want him to get caught out. All I can say is that after watching the final episode I could not sleep a wink!!! (I don't want to spoil it for you, so you will just have to see it) This is entertainment at it's very finest - but definitely NOT for the faint hearted."
232,"One of the best, if not the best, series I have ever watched. Engaging, thrilling, psychological, Dexter has it all. Seeing Dexter develop as a person throughout the seasons on a fast pace while still covering about 12 hours of TV was an awesome experience.Although seeing a lot of criticism on the 5th to 8th season of the series I think Dexter as a series didn't fall off at all. The seasons were needed in order to develop the character and were as thrilling as seasons 1 to 4.The thing about this series I love most are the quotes like: ""I consume the people I love."" (After the cannibal) ""I destroy everyone I love."" (End of the series)It's these short but powerful quotes that give this series (for me) the irresistible charm it possesses, and character to the characterless Dexter.Speaking of the end though, I have to say seeing the real ending for the first time almost got me to tears. It shouldn't have been that way in my opinion, and to be honest gave a real bitter taste to the whole series. The set-up for suicide was perfect with Dexter realizing he is a danger to everyone he knows, with him ending the life of his sister, with these quotes, with his emotionless self experiencing his first emotions like regret and sorrow. So when a few months later I decided to watch the whole series again I tried to skip the real end as much as possible. I always read criticism on the end where Deb gets paralyzed, although I myself think it contributes nicely to the realization of Dexter. This is the first time I have written a review and I know it slacks and isn't really clearly at all, but I enjoyed writing it, especially for this awesome series."
233,"When they told me that there was a TV serial in which the star was a serial killer, i liked the idea very much. However, I was disappointed. Basically, some producers wanted to make money from the ""fascination"" that serial killers have in society. However, they wanted the show to be also acceptable for the masses and have higher ratings and more viewers, and also elude criticism. Therefore, they give us a non believable character who kills people according to a moral code.(Yeah, sure, that is what psychopaths do, lol) Anyway, the characters are good, the script is usually engaging, and this is a TV soap that you can watch. They give you the pretext to see all the murders, gore and blood without making the audience feel guilty(that's what many people want but they don't say) However, i find the premise of this show to be totally false and even grotesque. Killers are not glamorous, they do not have a code(if he were a vigilante he would not consider himself a psychopath, and even less a criminal), and all is non believable. However, despite all this, the show is very viewable, and it keeps the interest. They just did not have the balls to make a true show about a true serial killer, for fear of criticism, and because that would not appeal to all sectors of the audience and would make less money. So, they give us an implausible character, Dexter,the cool murderer with a morality code who only kills bad guys, who obviously does not fit the bill of an actual serial killer, and is a glamorous guy who keeps falling in love with beautiful girls and always befriends multiple killers(it is like Melrose Place with a cool murderer that we all can forgive and like, lol)Do you imagine a 8 season show in the line of Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?? Probably less glamorous, but far more frightening and realistic. Also, the ending was very bad. The greedy producers did not want to kill Dexter, so they could profit from a possible spin off. However, the finale is the worst i have ever seen in a TV serial. Dexter, implausible as he was, was always a guy who got away with it. The finale should be exactly that: Dexter gets away with it and goes to Argentina with the pretty blonde poisoner and his son. But no, they give us a Catholic Monk ending, Dexter, dressed as a hillbilly lumberjack, in voluntary reclusion and exile in some mountains. Ha, ha, ha. So, Dexter atoning for his sins and Joining a Convent is actually the idea¡¡¡ Pity, very bad finale."
234,I Have rated this Series overall as a 7!! However the reason that it didn't get higher was because the last episode was a bit of a let down!!I have tagged spoilers.... But there aren't any!! I just didn't want people to read that the last episode was such a let down! The ride through this series was amazing the highs and lows were heartfelt and well acted by everyone in the show!! However I just felt that the last episode and in particular the last 10/15 minutes were a really let down!! Thats all I am going to say on that! Overall I LOVED this show and enjoyed the ride! :-)
235,"That's precisely what I wanted to yell after Season 6. Again, knowing when to pull the plug is a art and a science. It was fairly obvious earlier in the show that Dexter's writers were running out of steam, but they still managed to put together probably one of the most cohesive shows on premium TV during it's run. Dexter, buddy, you have a deserved place in the pantheon of pop culture. But I'm with a lot of people when I say that you dropped the ball.I can go right to the ending and give that hell, but what's the point to that when I already saw the tide back in, say, Season 5? I liked this show to what I would say is it's perceived peak, until the last interesting ancillary character in the series (Brother Sam) is no longer integral to the plot. It's like someone came along and said ""Too risky, we need familiarity for ratings."" (You really should hear these stupid TV people talk.) The fact of the matter is, this is Dexter's world, the show could've done a better job of straying from him to establish the sub plots throughout the show, but in the end, the monster this show is, is Dexter, plain and simple. That leaves several sub-plots that fold in the wake of keeping the focus on Dexter. I also find interesting just how efficient the Miami Metro Homocide Unit is in this show, it's like the perfect camaraderie to really get things done kinda just disintegrates with Dexter's ability to control his world.The whole Debra being in love with him thing really came at a perfect time for crapping out the show into what it became (I'm thinking this was the point when Micheal C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter got married) a melodrama involving Dexter's and Debra's relationship. However, better writing would've put this conflict earlier in the show, rather than using it as a gimmick for a wind down.I liked the progession of wimmin Dexter has in his life, the Demeter-like wounded animal of Rita, the reckless abandon of Lila, the redemption in blood of Lumen and the perfect compliment to Dexter's butchery, a Poison Ivy archetype of Hannah McKay. His relationships seem to bring him full circle to himself. And then we get the male figures as well, his brother (they really should've took chances with Brian as his consciousness to remark the dissolute nature of the later seasons.) Miguel Prada as his first kill-buddy and a shining example of his sociopathic nature possibly outgrowing him. Arthur Mitchell as the father figure who understood the monster Dexter was, and then Brother Sam, the man who could transcend the evil his existence was enveloped by.But ultimately, this is all Dexter, a show wrapped up in a cult of personality that's strong, but you can't throw in extras that don't serve the central theme if you're not gonna explore them thoroughly, especially a show that pride's itself on the meticulous nature of it's protagonist. I liked the risks this show took, but I can't reward a lack of follow through (Batista's character comes to mind.) I wish the fact that there was an obvious number of people who realized who he was and allowed him to continue living as he did would've been explored better, but I'm not one to hold much against what was a daring and heart-felt foray into something as cold and clinical as the world of a serial killer. ***1/2"
236,"I don't know where to even begin with. This is one of the best crime drama to ever appeared on the T.V. Michael C. Hall is one of the best actor i have seen in a long time. After watching the first five episodes of Dexter i can say that it is the best show on t.v. Like i said even if you hate watching criminal shows because as we can see there are tons of criminal shows around on the t.v lately but this one is different form others in every aspect. If you'r thinking that this will also turn out to be a usual obvious bore like the other criminal t.v. shows then you know nothing about this show.The best thing about this show is that it binds the people and hook them to the seats.The way the cases are solved and executed by our favorite serial killer is simply awesome.Who has some killing or you can say moral codes of himself.Each season has big mastermind criminal cases and each episodes have their own big stories , i just don't want to spoil this show for you. Just watch first 4-5 episodes and then you are hooked.Each character in this show is so precisely chosen and proper roles have been assigned.The story , the theme , the acting are so brilliantly done.Dexter is one of the most appreciated and chosen criminal t.v serial of all time.The cast and the production are just mind-blowing. I usually am so selective in watching t.v series and believe me i just don't like any t.v series easily and specially the criminal ones but this one made me spellbound. It takes a t.v series lot to touch the soul but Dexter is the one such show which touches the soul.All i can say about this ADDICTIVE show is that its a BLOODY MASTERPIECE"
237,"-Well, there are a lot of things to say about this show the first would be that is one of the best on TV show ever. Why? Michael C. Hall and cast performance, original storyline, well-direction and writing, messages that the episodes bring and black humor will answer that question. Thanks to Jeff Lindsay also. If I could review the show by percentages it would be: *Michael C. Hall's performance: 40% *Cast and crew performance: 30% *Storyline, direction, writing... : 30%Of course Michael C. Hall's performance, he is without doubt the best actor on the best show on TV. I'm so disappointed that Michael C. Hall has NEVER WON AN EMMY!! Even in the fourth season that was after the second the best season and he deserved it at least in 2010. I would be so glad if Bryan Cranston would have lost that year and Michael C. Hall would took the Emmy and this year Bryan Cranston would have won instead of Jeff Daniels. Everyone is happy, ha ha. Anyways, it would be a hard prediction and hard to make it real but I would say that Michael C. Hall could be nominated again next year, don't know if for season 7 or 8, but would be great. Honestly, he has no possibilities at all to win next year because of the so so final season, but who knows?. Also Jennifer Carpenter, C.S. Lee, David Zayas, James Remar, Desmond Harrington, Lauren Velez, Julie Benz, Aimee Garcia, Geioff Pierson and the guest actors have all very well performance but Michael C. Hall is the piece of the puzzle that makes the whole series. I like all seasons honestly though sixth is not such a masterpiece season is not bad especially on the finale but the eighth season have lost little quality. Like I said about Michael C. Hall and his incredible number of Emmy wins I say the same for the show in the drama series category. It have lost against Mad Men and not one year or two, four!. Well that's the summary of what I think about this great show. I hope Michael C. Hall would be recognize for his work and I hope he make a new show/movie that would remark him, but nothing will remark him than his character Dexter Morgan, and yes, more than David Fisher."
238,"So, I'm just done watching the final episode. About 2 minutes ago.And all I can say is Dexter is my number one favorite shows ever. In all my life.Where to start? Uhm yes,Perfect characters. Everyone in the homicide feels like a family for me, love Batista. Even I like Masuka. Perfect storyline. To be honest for S8 only, I was suspicious to Dr. Vogel regarding the Brain Surgeon verdict. It's a bit off then that guy Albert is the one who's responsible. Oh but then, surprise surprise. Perfect characters. I have to say this again. Duo Dexter & Debra is my inspiration. About how screwed up life can be, about how to stay focused in so many distractions, about how to hide your emotions from public, about to love even though it's unwillingly. Perfect characters. Yes, I'm saying that again.Roger and out."
239,"well i will be quickly, but if you asking why should you start/keep watching this series, i will tell you WHY!First the acting is amazing, Michael C Hall does a great job with Dexter, he always will be Dexter for me, the serial killer! Second you cant find dead moments, i mean, each episode has a lot of content there is always something going on, there is no time to get bored. Third, to give a conclusion to my review i can guarantee you, from the first episode till the last one, all the things are related and connected. Dexter is that kind of series that leaves you crying and dying till the next episode, You always want more... you always need to know what is going to happen next."
240,"Wow!!!!! How did I wait this long to watch this show. Two weeks ago my dad bought the first seven seasons of Dexter on DVD and I decided to give it a shot. All I can say is that it was the most addicting show I have ever seen. God I can't wait to watch the last season even though the reviews are average at best for the finale. I even shed tears on numerous occasions for certain characters, that's how attached I got to this series. In fact I felt like Dexter was apart of the family!!! Here is my breakdown. Season 1- Fantastic with the intro to Dexter. The Ice Truck Killer so riveting and intense. Love the ending.... Season 2- Better than the first, The Bay Harbour Butcher and Srg. Doakes. Lila a real Femme Fatal. Season 3- Slipped a bit here but nonetheless very entertaining. Didn't care much for Anton and the Skinner scenario. Season 4- WOW!!!!!! Not only the best season of Dexter but the best season of any TV show period!!!! The trinity Killer is the season and played with such amazing panache by John Lithgow. Trinity has redefined the serial killer moniker that was raised by Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecture....he is that good. The ending is the most chilling emotional moment I have ever experienced in TV/film. A masterpiece. Season 5- I loved this season which goes against the grain as most people didn't. What did you expect after the tumultuous denouement of Season 4. I feel if season 5 was anywhere else than after 4 people would've liked it more. All in all a fantastic season dealing with Dexter and fatherhood and healing. I loved lumen!!!! and the barrel girl gang for killers was chilling to the bone..... Season 6- Average at best. The doomsday Killer was doomed in my book right from the beginning. The least convincing antagonist in the series and by far the worst season of Dexter Season 7- What a comeback!!!! loved it all here. Hannah Mckay is Lila and Rita in one and Isaac is the most charismatic bad guy in the entire series. Loved the ending, almost as intense as the trinity finale. Here is my rankings.....4-2-7-1-5-3-6........"
241,"One of the best series I've ever seen, seasons 1-4 were the absolute best. Storyline is very gripping and kept me interested all the way through, which I can often lose interest in a lot of series. Characters are portrayed very well, acting is spectacular Michael C Hall portrayed Dexter fantastically, each seasons killer was always unexpected and kept you guessing. Filming was brilliantly done, techniques used were visually stunning and was written so well. Only downside to the series was the ending, it was emotional and did keep me guessing but I expected something different in all fairness. Still would definitely recommend the series and it's not going to effect the 10/10 rating for a slightly displeasing ending. Brilliant show."
242,"To me, Dexter was a show about a serial killer; it wasn't a show about an emotionally stunted family man striving to achieve a more domesticated life... I feel like, in deliberately trying not to be 'obvious', the writers lost some of the fundamentals of the show's core identity... I get what they were going for; to show that being mixed up in killing - even when trying to distance himself from it - has always harmed the people in his life, and that the way to demonstrate his love for his son was to sacrifice their relationship in order that he be better cared for, and not become tainted... That ending might have worked if they'd kept Rita alive, but not when the 'new family' consists of a character that I didn't care about, beyond the fact that she was hot... (Hannah) Michael C Hall is a good actor, though, so I will say that he made the goodbye to Harrison work...I don't think that many people wanted to see Dexter become 'human', as much as they wanted to see him be uncovered, and try to evade capture... (whether he succeeded or not would have been irrelevant, either way could have been justified) The writers are on record as saying that doing things this way would have felt 'predictable'... Well - you know what? Sometimes predictability can at least be satisfying, if you write it well enough... The conclusion that was decided upon just felt too far away from the show that I'd elected to stick with, all the way back in Season One..."
243,"Finally, the series about the, ahem, righteous serial killer Dexter Morgan has come to an end. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first and only series about such a character, but I could be wrong. The idea may very well have come from the film 'Mr. Brooks', a film that does more with the 'nice guy / serial killer'-idea, though - I might try that one again sometime. 'Dexter', I am quite sure, I will not try again (maybe an incidental re-run). The biggest problem I've had with it was Dexter's annoying voice-over which pretty much continuously states the obvious to the viewer. In the first seasons it didn't bother me much, but in the end (I've seen seasons 1 - 7 completely, though I had difficulty getting through 7 - especially when Dexter couldn't decide to 'kiss or kill' that dear Hannah) I just decided to read the rest about season 8 via Wiki - I just couldn't be bothered anymore {edit January 2015: I've later seen pretty much all of the final season as well, but it didn't change my mind}...But the true decline of the series started earlier on;'Dexter' has many characters and there is no real story with any substance (it simply entails 'the life and times and troubles of a good serial killer') that is carried throughout all seasons (it would have been so much more interesting to have seen him carry on with Rita for instance), except for the relationship between Deb and Dex, and that one - I read {edit: and saw later on for myself} - came to a miserable end. So every season has a few new 'main' characters, some even return, and that worked okay, but not great. So the rest of it came down to the actors playing these roles, of which I have my own favorites and 'pet peeves', which I will not go into here. Well, maybe a couple then... Favorites: Lumen, Lundy, Trinity and Miguel. 'Pet peeves': Lila and Hannah (cute enough, though).It must sound as though I've no fun at all with this, but that really isn't so. On the contrary, 'Dexter' is a fun (and dark) show if you don't take it all too seriously. For better watchings: 'Six feet under', with the very same Michael C. Hall.A big 6 out of 10 then, all things considered."
244,"Who would have thought that waiting to see what a serial killer is going to do next can be so engrossing. Well, it always sounded very interesting but for me after watching Dexter, it has become an addiction. Nevertheless, I strongly think that Dexter is kind of loosing its charm, esp. in the last 2 seasons. The first 4/5 seasons, each episode had more depth and intensity, whereas now more often than not things are getting a bit more predictable. Even after all being said, the concept & its execution by the entire cast is still praiseworthy. One thing for sure, no one could have done Dexter without Michael C. Hall. A must see for all the people who love to see the good guy taking down the bad ones, and YES at times things can also go wrong.."
245,"There are some things that are just disturbing to watch. Whether it's a disturbing image like from news of a tragic event like a shooting or a video set up on YouTube like a recent serial killer did or a more fictional depiction of tragedy like the Saw films, Scream or a television depiction like Law & Order, Bones, or Jersey Shore. However there are some things which are hard to understand why exactly you're disturbed by them. For me that show is Dexter. You can always look at a show like this and say that what is disturbing about it is the graphic depictions of sex, language and death that are disturbing, and yes it can be tough to watch the way in which people are both killed by the main character and kill other people but often that's the least of what disturbs me.What usually bothers me about the show is the way in which the characters evolve over time. Most disturbing of all is Dexter who struggles to deal with who he is versus how he was raised. Each season deals with the reality of his life as both a forensic blood spatter analyst and a serial killer. Living with such a contradiction alone would be difficult enough, but trying to relate to people without revealing this contradiction is even harder for him. He does manage to make some connections to people, though they are pretty basic at first over time they evolve and grow much like Dexter himself. The thing that disturbs me most about Dexter is how much people connect with the character. And not just in the sense of the insane ones who try to reenact or mirror his crimes.My own connection is quite a strange one. I know what it's like to feel disconnected from the world and other people, trying to find a way to connect to people when you don't feel connected to anyone or anything. It's hard to care about others or have a conversation that you find meaningful when you don't care about what other people are saying. But you keep trying because you see the people around you talking and caring about each other and you want to understand what they feel like. You want to know so bad that you start to feel something just from that itself.Ultimately, I think that's what Dexter is all about, a man trying to connect to others without really knowing how. He tries to connect with his girlfriend, his co-workers as well as his family and friends. Yet no matter how many times he fails he keeps trying, despite the fact that doing so is against his nature. The main reason he fails is because his natural instinct is to shy away from people and do his own thing. But he was taught to spend time with people and to at least appear like everyone else so that he can try to fit in. This creates a tragic battle within the main character that is often played out within the inner monologue/voice over of the episodes and seasons as a whole.As the seasons progress, he learns how to manage between his nature and the way he was nurtured to embrace in life. Watching him try to live up to both perceptions of himself that he has while dealing with the people around him and keeping them from learning the truth can be both tragic and disturbing at the same time.So is Dexter the ultimate nature versus nurture? I think it is.To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"
246,"I have to admit that in the beginning when I heard about this show, I was a bit wary about watching it, because it seemed so dark!! However, because my friend kept insisting it was good, I gave it a try. And I am very happy that I did. Dexter is overall told from the point of the main character, Dexter. We follow him around as he does his deeds and we get his witty and dry humoured narration of events that transpire. Yes Dexter kills people, but the way this show goes about explaining the reasons and origins for Dexter's actions, and the ritual he has built up based on his step fathers teachings when he goes to kill a person, kind of makes you feel for Dexter. But don't be fooled, the show is not just about Dexter, one of the best aspects of this show is that we actually get some insight into the characters that affect Dexter's life, which are mainly the people that work with him at the Miami Metro police department. From season 1 to 5, we take several types of journey's with Dexter; we get to see him grow and discover himself and as a result, we become more attached to Dexter. Dexter feels like he is a monster, that the killing part of his life is a dark passenger that he is burdened with. As the show progresses, it can make one feel like everyone has their own dark passenger, even though some may be more severe than others. Each season introduces a new thrill for Dexter to unravel, and while he is unraveling the mysteries you will be left on the edge of your seat!!! This show is so intense and very drama filled. It is a well rounded drama, in that the casting is amazing, the storyline is superb, the dialogue is great and the character developments make you feel like you are a part of the Dexter show!"
247,"When I heard a new session was coming I wanted to finally binge this heralded show. I went in knowing the final season was not well received but I have to say it was true to the complex nature of the show and much better than the critics credited it. Fear of exposure. Commitment to the moral killing code. Intricate relationships with consequences.
Season 6 wasn't the best but the cast and suspense kept me interested all the way. Season 4 with John Lithgow is outstanding but so are the first two and especially season 7 with the introduction of the Hannah character. Well done."
248,"Apart from the fact that this Hannah character is unbearably dull I just find it absurd that Dexter after 6 full seasons of living by the code of Harry and keeping ""the Dark Passenger"" tamed to only end bad people.. he then throws all of that out the window and seems so weak and pathetic around this girl.. she killed more than one innocent person and even tried to kill his own sister and still you see him even imagining her lips at crime scenes and all the cheesy lines between the two of them is just absurd. There is nothing remarkable about Hannah in any way to make it justifiable for Dexter to change suddenly and dramatically like that. ""The code of Harry"" was to protect innocent people. And then you see Dexter driving to get Zach because ""he meets the code and killed innocent people"" yet next to him in the car sitting Hannah Mckay who met ""the code"" more than once..I am currently mid way through the 8th season and I can tell you I am barely making it through just because I invested much time in this series and want to finish it but since the appearance of Hannah the show keeps going downhill."
249,With Crime & Thriller perfection is this show.Just loved it
250,One of my all time favourite. Rewatched it for 3 times now
251,"While watching 1st season , Dexter was something not so interesting or breath-taking , mixed feelings. However by the end of the season i started to like it very much. After watching all 8 seasons i can say that every season is a high class masterpiece, capturing your attention and love once, it won't leave you. Even severely criticized last episode of 8 season to me seemed pretty fine. I like Dexter even more than such series as Breaking Bad and Sherlock."
252,"Dexter: the serial killer who works for the Miami police department and preys on criminals. Wow, what a man.I was hooked. Not only was I hooked, but I was impressed by how they could make each season so enthralling. I thought for sure that I'd get tired of Dexter getting into a jam and trying to figure out how to get his target while keeping his extra curricular activities secret."
253,"This series is in my top 10 for TV shows for a good reason. From the great acting, the thriller aspect, the roller coaster events where you never know where you'll end up. Just a great show. Would highly recommend"
254,This tv show is awesome. It's so unsuspecting and will sneak up on you. I'm usually trying to pick apart and figure things out etc but with this it's so unpredictable in the best way.
255,"Season one: doakes was the #1 antagonist for dexter. Always up Dexter's ass. I wish they didnt have him as onto him as he was. The ITK was phenomenal, and season 1 really took me out of my comfort zone. From ""tonight's the night..."" to ""in your darkest dreams."" I was absolutely hooked.
Season 2: a couple of scuba divers stumble across Dexter's dumping grounds bringing the FBI right to dexter's doorstep. Leading the way was Special Agent Frank Lundy. An on the nose investigator that follows the evidence where it leads, while always bringing his ideas to his culprit just to be turned away. May have been the best season if not for season 4 and the trinity killer.
Season 3: Dexter goes after a drug dealer and winds up killing the district attorney of Miami's baby brother. I'd give this season a 7/10. I love Jimmy Smits. He was an excellent part on this show. When I learned he was directing the skinner near the end, and actually captured dexter nice surprise ending.
Season 4: I'd say this was the best season ever. John lithgow and Michael C. Hall were absolutely incredible. The ending left me in tears. As soon as I heard Rita's phone ring, I just knew, and then seeing her in the bathtub and Harrison on the floor covered in his mother's blood. I was left empty inside.
Season 5: a group of childhood friends, kidnap, torture, rape, and kill their victims after they've all had their turns of pass the astroglide. Jordan chase is a formidable foe, as debra closes in on her brother unknowingly...debra has a human emotion that not just crying and whining, she was empathetic and let's their final victim walk away, not knowing her brother was also in the room.
Season 6: (as an atheist, I tend to be bothered by religion in shows) you were lead to believe from the outset that there are two killers, while dexter is searching for professor Gellar, his protege, travis is going around setting up biblical end of times rapture style killings, later dexter discovers that gellar has been stabbed to death and put in a freezer. Thereby eliminating one of Dexter's threats. Dexter tries to figure out what the last tableau is while.learning his sons life hangs in the balance. He also befriends an excon who has turned toward religion and leads a relatively normal social rehabbing genuinely good guy named Sam. When sam is shot and ultimately killed, dexter finds out, a guy sam was trying to get out of the gang life, a gang has ordered him to kill brother Sam. Dexter drowns him only to be met with this his brother. At the end of the season dexter has travis on a table and is revealing his ritual of his stlaknand kill to his never being able to talk victim. He doesn't know that debra has come to examine the church, and she walks in on dexter delivering the death strike, which catches dexter off guard.
Season 7: we are lead to believe that debra has turned dexter in for murder as he is running towards an airport. Hes actually on the hunt for the man who killed a fellow officer in his department. He kills him but the worst is only just beginning. The guy dexter kills is thebgay lover if a Ukrainian big wig shot caller, he also meets hannah McKay, a fellow serial killer. He falls in love, which is the antithesis of a serial killer, they can't feel anything.
Season 8: it takes us back to Dexter's upbringing, Harry's struggle with Dexter's psychopathy, and a psychologists interpretation to help harry cope with it. After harry walks in on one of Dexter's kills, he sees first hand dexters delight of taking another humans life. And he cannot live with himself. He kills himself. Debra is also struggling to cope with Dexter's lifestyle and tries tinrehab him from killing. The psychologists son jealous if his mothers passion for dexter and her own disgust towards her own sons extracurricular activities, she has him committed which he doesnt take to kindly to, kidnaps debra and is about to kill her when dexter intervenes. Dexter decides to give debra the chance to send him to rosion but he gets lose fatally shooting her as dexter plans to get away with hannah. He sends hannah with Harrison to Argentina, debra ultimately dies from her gunshot wound. And dexter decides to keep those save by faking his own death, and becoming a lumberjack."
256,"I LOVE Dexter! This show always makes you feel tense! Watching this show, I was like:
-What is gonna happen next?
-Is he gonna get caught for his killings?!
-OMG I thought ***** was gonna happen.
-Omg that was close!"
257,Really good show tossing up after there first few eps but then got hooked on it
258,"Dexter is not a normal psychopath but he is the one with code thats what kept him alive. He has no emotions except anger . He has no conscience , don't have faith in any religion and doesn't believe in miracles but all he believes in is his code that harry taught him. Although harry betrayed him by not telling him that he was responsible for his mother's death and also he has a big brother (brian). But still he live by his code or mostly . From season 1 -8 its all about events that happen in his life and what are the impacts . Psychopath deals with things differently and thats what this show is all about . Every event in his life changed a monster into a human with less humane .whether its miguel 's friendship , rita 's death , lumen, hannah 's love , vogul's death he changed emotionally . But after debra's death he started feeling guilt .he feels that he killed debra (even though indirectly). Thats why he ended this his way by taking debra 's body and dump in the same spot where he used to dump those to whom he killed. Because feels himself responsible for her death . the guilt that builds up in his mind that he is responsible for every death of his loved ones whether its harry , vogul , debra , liguetta , rita .... Thatswhy he faked his death so that his son harrison would live a life without under the influence of a serial killer otherwise he would end up like him.
Lastly we see dexter as a lumberjack . In season 8 there's a scene in which dexter said that his need to kill is lesser but still its somewhere . Also at the time of putting daniel on chair he said i don't need to kill you but i want you death . This implies may be he controlled his urge to kill because this scene is before debra's death and after her death his urge disappeared with the buildup of guilt."
259,"Dexter is just amazing, great mysterious character, and you'll get to know him better as the series goes on
But he's not the only great character in the series, probably the most underrated character in the series would be masuka he always buts a smile on my face, and also debra, she's a badas*
I've watched it a long time ago but it's definitely in my top 3"
260,"From 1 to 7 season this show was amazing but the finale season was soo baad and the ending too I recommend to watch this if you haven't seen it yet bc i think i'm the last one who watch it
And micheal C hall this man is an iconic anc epic he is very f talented and the whole cast ether they did a great job"
261,"My rating by each season:Season 1 > 10/10
Season 2 > 10/10
Season 3 > 9/10
Season 4 > 10/10
Season 5 > 9/10
Season 6 > 8/10
Season 7 > 8/10
Season 8 > 7/10It could have been one of the greatest tv series if they could make last few seasons better, specially the last one. It's pretty sad to see a great series end this way."
262,"Dexter is a great show! I really like that it's not so predictable, I guess sometimes you know what is going to happen but they still drop it on you so unexpectedly which makes it intresting. Also they keep the action going. Once things start getting close to boring they through in another twist. Well done, well done 👏 be warned though, it's pretty dark, he is psychopath, and the whole show is about him!"
263,"Dexter Season 1 is the greatest hook I ever found in a TV series. I never saw anything with Michael C. Hall and the rest of the cast was unfamiliar to me, but well the first season was so amazingly unique and raw. It was a love on first episode kind of deal.Season 2 was maybe even better, the inner conflict and overall character development, the new generation of creators could take notes how to build characters and move them forward.Then the problems. Season 3 - skip.Season 4, return to greatness. Probably the most creepy season in a good way, Hall was supported by great John Lithgow who delivered magnificent performance over the whole season.And then the Dexter ended.
Yes, i recommend to stop watching at this point and give up on the last 4 seasons because there is almost nothing good in them."
264,"I like dexter. Dexter is good. It makes me laugh it makes me think and I hope it all works out in the end.
Thank you for coming to my ted talk."
265,"Watched this whole series a while back, was addicted. Only thing I would change is the ending. There are many ways it could have ended and that was probably my least favorite way."
266,It's really does have a good plot of story n really loved it.The end really made me upset
267,"Dexter is the story of a man who, due to a traumatic experience early in life, is unable to feel anything. He is incapable of feeling emotion but he fakes it as best as he can. He's a great guy that people seem to like but they don't suspect his dark side. That's because Dexter is a serial killer. But he doesn't kill just anybody. No he only goes after people that deserve it. He kills murderers, rapists and other people that he considers to be bad. And he gets his information on a lot of these people by working as a forensic blood spatter expert for the Miami police.This is a series that started out really strong and that's due to good writing, good acting and the fact that you actually care about this man. He does evil but he only takes out the bad guys. However something happened in Season 4 which honestly killed the whole thing for me. It was the absolute best season this show had and part of that is due to John Lithgow being the big bad for that season. And it's not because he did a bad job at it. Quite the opposite. He was so good that every season after that just felt like a let down."
268,"I'm only sad it ended but it's shows like this that make TV worth watching.
Micheal C. Hall is my favourite actor from his character in Dexter and I am going to try letting go by watching Safe.
I'm just glad Michael C Hall is still alive and well and I hope to see him as Dexter again as I loved the narration and funny scenes in Dexter as well as the killing.
Let's hope I can rate Safe 10 out of 10 and I hope to watch more of Micheal C Hall after SAFE. It would be good to see a Seasons 9 so they could end it better but like I said I'm just happy my favourite actor is still alive acting..
Keep watching good TV... But more importantly... keep living!Thank you for such a great TV series..I love Dexter"
269,"By the time I completed the first season I was hooked on to the show and was aware about its potential.I just finished the series and was binge watching so I can understand the lust of the viewers who had to wait a whole year for it.
It would be apt to say that Dexter is the batman of Miami, working for the Miami homicide by the day and at night he becomes the vigilante who comes out of the obscurity to take out the trash of the society. But there is twist, he is not going on a killing spree because he cares for the people of Miami, it is only to fulfill his urges which he does by following the code taught by his step dad.Every season is filled with thrill where you can find Dexter going to the limits to get the job done and many a times you will find the antagonists getting the best of our Dexter but using his skills of an assassin and the sharpest of brain he finds a way out.My personal best would be the season with Arthur Mitchell case because of its ending which you will find out only if you watch it.From my point of view if blood and action is what gets you going, Dexter is the answer."
270,"The 1st season was incredible. Such a surprise show at the time.
But the 3rd didn't work as good.
The last season I was like wtf. like game of thrones....
So I recommend 2 first seasons and keep going till you decide not too.
I even imagined a season story where dexter would be visiting like Scotland or Ireland(is red hair lol) and would use is knowledge to track down an evil Priest. then came season 4 with a religious killer ! strange...."
271,I watched 3. Episodes of it and after it i got hooked with it. Loved it better than Game of Thrones.
272,"Note: I have seen all 8 seasons.This is a crime show that really doesn't hold anything back, making it probably the best I've seen so far.My suggestion: Stop watching after season 4. It starts to get more convoluted and less believable after that. Or, if you can avoid falling for cliffhangers, watch up through season 6 and end it there assuming Debra does the right thing."
273,"I began watching Dexter in high school. Sophomore year to be exact. As someone who is not a fan of crime dramas like NCIS or Law and Order, Dexter puts an incredible twist on the tale. A daytime blood splatter analyst turned vigilante killer by night. No longer are you blocked to the views of the good guys, you're behind the eyes of an anti-hero. You get to view the crimes from all sides. The story lulls you in and you realize you're sympathizing with a murderer. But you can always fall back on the fact that he's only killing other murderers.Each character breathes an incredible life into the show. Be it his sister Deb, who is off the cuff and has the mouth of a sailor. Batista who is a guiding light for the team, and brings a sense of comfort in such a dark show. I could continue listing characters, but these are the main 3 that the show highlights throughout its long seasons.Dexter is a one of a kind show that can't really be replicated unless they bring it back. The only reason I dropped a star is because of Seasons 5,7 and 8. These seasons really put a bad taste in your mouth for the great content you were watching before.The good part is they didn't end the series with a dead end. There is still room to revive the series under new conditions. This show really helped get me interested in Television in general and without it, I'm not sure I'd have cared as much about Television History."
274,I can't even say how many times over I've rewatched Dexter. Something about this dark mysterious series just never fails to catch my attention. Michael C Hall is an incredible actor and plays this character perfectly. I will admit the last season runs a little dry and I felt the final finale was cut short but none the less all in all this show is wonderful and I highly recommend it!!
275,"Definitely an effective show. It manages to make the viewer empathize with an unlikely hero. The series does drag on a bit and the subplots start to become a bit absurd, but definitely binge-worthy."
276,"Dexter- a character so complex and dark but a man of a strict moral conduct at the same time. the show revolves around the protagnist (or in this case the antagonist too) as he fulfils his personal requirements and ,in my opinion, justifiying them, by fulfiling them on the deserving. interesting till the 4th season but just repetitive from that point, the show neverthless can be considered a classic."
277,"This is what Fresh off Boat or any casts Asian American should do in Florida that they need more drama less than sitcom. The Original and TVD has more dark mystery like the show . Mentalist and NCIS is just boring but Jethro Gibb serious badass than Patrick Jane. I, honestly believe there are many Immigrants and American have more diversity with show and chararcter. 
 Klaus Mikaelson, Jax(SOA), Damon Salvatore and Dexter, have same quality of their dark family past including the psychopath murderer, but they yet soft side of their human and members who understand them than other people."
278,"Dexter Morgan is a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department. He is good at his job and gets along well with his colleagues. Little do they know, however, that he is also fighting crime in his spare time - killing murderers who escape justice.Superb series. Solid plot, with every season bringing a fresh nemesis for Dexter and new reasons to look over his shoulder. It is a very intriguing and tension-filled drama. The fact that even his sister, who is a detective in the police department, doesn't know about his double-life makes for very entertaining television, as she could be his Achilles heel.Not perfect though. The writing did become weaker towards the end, with the final season being quite a disappointment. The final episode has to be one of the worst, especially considering the quality that came before it, in TV history. The conclusion is ridiculous."
279,"I'm in love with this series from the very first episode. If you're into binge watching, then you've to see this one. Performance and storyline make this show brilliant."
280,"Season 1 makes it into my TOP 10 of all time and seasons 2-4 are not far behind it. I like the setting of the show (""Miami""/California). Dexter is interesting as well as the story in itself. Season 5 is a major backflip and the rest is just awful. 10/10 for the 1st half and 3.5/10 for the second"
281,Dexter is simply one of my favourite shows of all time. The combination of Serial Killer come vigilante come Police worker makes for some pretty interesting episodes. The more you watch the more powerful it becomes and the more emotionally involved with the characters you become!
282,"If you believe in an eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth, then this is one show you should not miss. It's cracking, and the thrill of wanting to see the next episode continues throughout each series.Michael C Hall plays the lead role in a show which almost questions the morality of today's laws and justice. In summary a serial killer who kills killers.The macabre nature of the show is not for all, nor is the vigilante style justice meted out to those who are deemed guilty by Dexter. Nonetheless, it's gripping and whether you believe in what he does is right or not doesn't detract from the story in each series.However, there is a stark difference between the early episodes and those from series 6 onward. They appear to mature and grow darker... and the relatively light production style from early days feels more brooding and sinister to the point you start questioning your loyalties to Dexter.Michael C Hall plays the character well and you find yourself almost cheering him on, wanting him to get away with it whilst wondering, 'how will this all end?'... And it's that thought which keeps you gripped... If the thought of a serial killer killing killers sounds interesting, then you may well enjoy this."
283,"Dexter is a wild thrill ride that I strongly recommend you buy a ticket & get aboard.
Great overall story arcs to each season & main storyline flow very well through the 8 seasons of this showtime great. 
It has a great cast & great writing & u don't have to sit through 5 episodes to know what's what, you'll either like it or won't, so after a few episodes you'll know whether your a Dexter fan.
Sure some seasons are worse than others but it never gets to a point where its not enjoyable to watch.Basically Dexter is a serial killer & we get to follow his life & how it affects him & those around him. It's tense & violent & funny & upsetting, all while being a drama. I know you think the whole serial killer thing has been done before but not like this. This is a stand alone series & has its own merits. You invest a lot into dexter & the characters & you'll be glued to the tv if you binge watch this.
I've rewatched the seasons I think about 4 times & I still enjoy watching it. Even after knowing what happens to who & when & why, my love for the show kept me entertained. My personal order of my favourite seasons from best to worse is
4,2,1,7,3,5,8,6. Just because I picked some seasons lesser doesn't justify the whole season as there's great episodes in every season it's just my preference, however I highly recommend you start from the beginning as you'll enjoy the show that much more & you'll also miss out on characters & crucial plot twists if you jump seasons, therefore not understanding or appreciating the show to its full extent.FUN FACT:Michael C Hall who plays Dexter & Jennifer Carpenter who plays Dexter sister Debra were married in real life & seperated during the show, ummm #awkardfilming 
It's a tremendous asset to them that you won't even notice & C Hall suffered a form of cancer through the show & kept filming with a wig. So what are you waiting for ? If you haven't seen it jump aboard the dexter train."
284,"Dexter is an amazing show, lets simply put it at that. Not only is the plot captivating, but the way the show builds brings intense drama and suspense to you on a silver platter.
Based on the ""Dexter"" novels by Jeff Lindsay, The show stars a lot of big name stars, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter (these two do an AMAZING job, by the way) being the two mains. The plot centers around a man named Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department. He has a seemingly happy, normal life, with a pretty average social life outside of work. The only thing - He's a serial killer that targets other criminals - typically ones who escape the law. The show creates a sort of atmosphere of love and support for Dexter and what he does, even though it isn't all that legal. It's hard not to imagine him as your favorite character.Another amazing thing about this show is that we're literally learning from the mind of Dexter. We can hear his thoughts, narrations, and everyday planning as if we were him. We are also able to pick up on subtle hints dropped by other characters that the audience may not have picked up, but Dexter did. This plus the phenomenal camera work make us feel like we're in his world, like we can feel the same emotions he's feeling when he panics and paces around the lab or in his home, or when he's angry and the camera deliberately shows him much larger than the opposing party.The last thing I'll talk about is the scenery. Sunshiney Miami seems perfect for a dark contrast - a serial killer. The show gives off average crime show vibes with a dark twist, even though it's almost always sunny and vibrant where they are.Dexter is a great show for people who are into crime shows, mysteries, and even comics. This show really has a little element of everything anyone could ever want in a show. Humor, mystery, and serial killers."
285,Well written I can't remember the last time I Click next episode with such purpose to know what will happen next and yaa it delvers every time. Michael delver such extraordinary performance not to take anything away from the other cast specially Julie Benz. IT IS AWESOME..))
286,"Michael C. Hall and company bring a truly masterful story to life. The writing, production and cast is all top tier. Will be a cult classic for a very long time."
287,"I dont have criminal mind but i really like this movie! the twist of the story is perfect. i just hope that they will make another set again or part 2 of it since dexter is still alive.,"
288,"An excellent drama that encapsulates the mind and life of the titular character, Dexter definitely does not disappoint. Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan is the villain you love to hate and gives an excellently nuanced performance as the Miami serial killer. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Each has satisfying story arcs and feel like a dynamic cast rather than just background noise. Deborah Morgan is a particular standout as Dexter's sister and Deb's actress Jennifer Carpenter holds her own across from Hall. Her character development as Dexter's foil is so well done that by the final seasons of the show, both Dexter and Deb become synonymous with the show. Dexter isn't the only main character here. Despite loving the first five or so seasons, I felt that the show was guilty of carrying on a little too long. Some episodes felt a bit like filler and while the ever changing cast of villains were great, some were noticeably weaker than others. Because of that, it made me less interested in those season's main arcs and sometimes made me just want to get to the next season. Overall however, I would not let a couple plot missteps detract from what is considered one of the best dramas ever to grace television. It in itself is a character study of serial killers and makes you emphasize with both Dexter and the villains. When the pace picks up in certain stretches, viewers might not be able to resist just one more episode. I know I couldn't."
289,"I wished it would have ended with her sister alive, life backs to normal. The END does not seems to be an end, may be started again. BTW, I just loved the series, its very ADDICTIVE. After such a long time, I found the best TV show so far I have watched. Thanks to everybody for making it happen."
290,"Such a unique and interesting story line that keeps watchers on their feet throughout the whole series. The characters are all very lovable;Deb, Dexter, Batista, Rita, ETC. While 'Dexter' is excellent, it is also very depressing and contains many character deaths that left me feeling empty inside...The hardest deaths to take in for me was Deb and Rita's. Overall though, amazing show."
291,Dexter is one of the best movie I have ever observed. This show is fantastic! The acting all around is awesome! Michael C. Hall is incredible as Dexter. The way he depicts Dexter is the way any serial killer ought to be depicted anyplace. The supporting performing actors are amazing as well.I can never truly get into an series that truly interested me as much as Dexter has. Dexter is AWESOME!!!
292,"This is undoubtedly the Darkest TV series I have ever seen. Simply Outstanding! One of a kind! It's totally a new genre for some obvious reasons. I cried for the first time in my life after watching a TV series! Yes, I did! I had to cry after watching the last episode of fourth season. I just couldn't take it and eventually go through a chronic depression for the next few days. Even after this shock, Dexter is still my most favorite TV series"
293,"I can not give enough praise to this TV series. It is beautifully plotted, and executed even better.Never have I seen a series whose music has been used so well. To depict lightness even while something horrific is happening on screen, to want to look away from the screen but being captivated by the horror and the music is sheer talent.Highlights of the show would be the superb acting by the leads. At times, it is easy to forget Michael C. Hall is even acting. His presence on screen is so powerful, so commanding, it is hard to look away. Indeed, at times I even wondered at just how many roles Mr. Hall has to portray on screen. From playing the part of a bumbling redneck to a ruthless sharp witted killer, few actors have displayed such a finesse for the arts on screen.
Jennifer Carpenter as the sister is one of the most foul mouthed loved characters to ever grace the screen.
Many a time, the bad guys from this show are the crowd pleasers, right from Season 1.This series gets a 9 on 10, the one point it missed is due to the last season. I still seem to be a bit undecided on how this series ended but nonetheless, as the series and its ending still continues to haunt me and the fact that it probably will for a long time, warrants the 9 on 10."
294,excellent.director was amazing.no words to say.i am sure nothing will better than this series. and c.hall was excellent amazing and his sis also.he is excellent.hats off to you... excellent awesome... nothing better than this i swear..............................................................
295,"I love Dexter. I always have and always will. When the show first came out the season 4 finale upset me so much I had to stop watch. I finally picked the show back up and decided to finish it. Dexter is a great show, but in my opinion the first season wads the best and and it was on a slow decline ever since. Don't get me wrong, Dexter is amazing, just each season was a little less interesting than the last. Then there's the series finale. Everyone told me not to watch it and just pretend the show ended on Season 8 Episode 11. Well I didn't listen and watched the finale. Subsequently, the finale made me so angry I threw my laptop across the room. So whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THE FINALE!"
296,"It says a LOT about modern audiences that a show in which someone commits a slow BDSM murder on a crying human being in the opening five minutes of the first episode is one of the biggest hits in TV history. I don't care what kind of excuses the show gives itself - this is about a man who methodically hunts people down and the climax is him slaughtering that individual in a creative, brutal manner.Wake up call to people who enjoy this series: you are a closet sadist and/or masochist. You need to open up to yourself about these hidden feelings.Addition: This is not what a psychopath (APD) is like. I have spent time with psychopaths before, even shared a house with one for three years, and they are absolutely NOT like this. Dexter is the Hollywood interpretation of antisocial personality disorder, not the real deal."
297,"Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a conundrum wrapped in contradiction. By day, he is a blood splatter expert working for the Miami police whose adoptive father, Harry (James Remar) was one of the cities finest and whose sister, Deborah (Jennifer Carpenter) is also a detective in the force. Dexter is also the dutifully understanding boyfriend of Rita (Julie Benz) and father-figure to her two children whose dad is a heroin addict wife-beater doing time. But come night time, Dexter is a serial killer. To his credit he only ever kills those who deserve it  'monsters' like himself. Dexter admits however, through insightful and often chilling voice-over, that he is most certainly no super-hero. He is a self-aware socio-path who does not dream, feel guilt, love and who has an insatiable urge to kill with precision. The only reason he kills those who deserve his brutality is because of his adoptive father, Harry (Remar) and a code that he was taught. Recognizing Dexter's impulses at an early age, Harry impressed upon his adoptive son the lessons of a hardened cop whose seen too much  the unfortunate truth that the 'system' to which he dedicated his life, didn't always work. Most of the time bad people got away with doing bad things, and sometimes there just isn't any justice in the world. Enter Dexter. Harry taught him to wear a mask for the world  a mask of normalcy to hide his true psychopathic tendencies which are only to be unleashed upon those the system wrongly lets free.The first season of Dexter pivots around the Miami police department's search for a serial killer, nicknamed the 'ice-truck killer' for the way he transports mutilated and drained bodies, leaving them in unusual places around the city for the police to find. A warped present. Even more warped is that the mysterious killer appears to be speaking directly to Dexter. With each twisted crime scene a new stone upturns for Dexter as he finds himself a new 'play-friend'  someone who is just like he is, but who doesn't appear to hide his impulses from the world the same way Dexter does, as Harry taught him to. 'Dexter' is at once a 12-part crime thriller, with each new episode the puzzle of the ice-truck killer becomes more involved. But more than a tantalizing whodunnit, 'Dexter' is a gruesomely intriguing glimpse into the mind and everyday life of a socio-path masquerading as an average joe. The character of Dexter Morgan is following in the same footsteps as Tony Soprano (""The Sopranos""), and to a less commercially successful extent, Joss Whedon's Captain Mal (""Serenity""). Dexter can be classed in the same league as that mob boss and small-time space thief because like them, the character is not the classic 'good' guy. He is bad. Sure, he goes around giving just deserts to fellow serial killers, rapists, paedophiles and all other manner of pond scum  but he is still intrinsically 'bad'. And he even admits it  he enjoys torturing and killing these people, he does not do it because they deserve to die, there is no real justice to his killings  he just needs to kill and as Harry instructed him, if he's going to do it anyway, he may as well kill those who deserve to die. And that's why Dexter is the best sort of protagonist. Finding yourself rooting for Dex, being on his side is all together strange and unnerving  that as an audience you side with the serial killer. Its very odd. But these days audiences like their protagonists to be all about the shades of grey  the morally ambiguous are so much more interesting than those on the straight and narrow. And adding to the appeal of Dexter is Michael C. Hall. No stranger to the quirky and successful television series, Hall comes from good stock having had main role on the successful 'Six Feet Under'. From morgue to murder, Hall is enthralling  altogether sinister, likable, intimidating and sometimes appearing heroic. Dexter is no easy characterization  he has two completely opposite sides to him, both of which have to be believable for the other to hold up for the audience  a family man and a frightening serial killer. Hall is the best kind of leading man  altogether likable yet chillingly intimidating.Its pretty much a universally acknowledged fact that television is where the real talent lies these days. TV is taking more chances than the box-office ruled films being produced, and cable means that networks are able to expand their viewer-ship and create a little more outside the box than was previously allowed on commercial television for the masses, so to speak. 'Dexter' is a testament to that truth. A gutsy, confronting, sometimes unsettling but completely satisfying and intense show that should not be missed."
298,"The first season of Showtime's newest show about a serial killing serial killer is worth its weight in body parts. The shows complex characters and intelligent plot line made for one of the more enjoyable TV watching experiences I have had in years. Even if the show doesn't return for a second season, it sure makes for a heck of a miniseries.Michael C Hall will astound you if you were a Six Feet Under fan. His portrayal of Dexter Morgan is genius.I think the shows that pull me in most are the ones that spend time exploring the dark and light sides of characters - Dexter does that really well.Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister also does an amazing job of showing her full range as an actor - I expect to see her with some type of award at some point.Seriously - check it out, it has a heart (even though it may not be beating any longer)."
299,"Dexter is a rare find. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I count the days until the next episode.99% of the content on TV is mindless drek; clichéd re-workings of the same forgettable formula.But, Dexter is in a class of its own.Terrific acting, sharp and unforced dialogue, dark humour that, like Dexter himself, creeps up on you when you least expect it. It also creates a fine balance between the crime content and the character relationships. Flashback segments are segued naturally and utilized sparingly, unlike the TV show LOST which is crammed with annoying filler that seems more and more to be an attempt to distract viewers from the fact that the writers are writing their way out of a hole.My jaw literally drops when I watch Dexter. What else can you say?"
300,"Every episode that I've seen of Dexter has kept me on my toes; like nothing before. I thought I'd be able to guess outcomes and then I'd be surprised by a result that came along. I'd recommend this to any fan of mystery or criminal investigation shows. Being a fan of the serial killer genre of movies, I was very skeptic of a show about a serial killer; again, the surprise came after only two episodes. I was hooked. Generally, I'm a fan of the 'regular' sitcoms: Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy and the like and I'm sure the CSI shows can keep something going, but they deal with different crimes a lot. A show about a serial killer that works for the cops? Yeah, right... Curiosity proved to be quite ""on my side"" this time, though, as the show proved to be better than any I've seen in a long time. I like it better than Seinfeld and that's saying something for a guy with the Kramer painting in his living room. Just make sure you can handle the gore."
301,"The complexity of the character Dexter draws viewers into this crime drama. It is strange to find a serial killer so endearing and identifiable. Michael C. Hall does an amazing acting job, playing both the part of serial killer Dexter and acting normal Dexter. I applaud his performance. Dexter's relationships with the contrasting outside world create the story, particularly the relationships with his sister and girlfriend. He has problems opening up with his sister, his only surviving relative, as well as difficulty forming a romantic relationship with another woman, Rita. Comedy is what brings all the elements together to form a complete story and excellent series. It really brings the basis of morality into question - is it wrong to kill the bad guys?"
302,"show time is finally giving HBO a run for its money... this exciting new show is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat... the characters are very well developed... the main character Dexter gives the audience a peek into the functionality and motives of a serial killer...the show is a unique take on an a lingering desire for forbidden knowledge that secretly dwells deep within the minds of many..a parallel storyline is that the main character is a detective as well as a serial killer and he is in search of a meticulous killer dubbed,""the ice truck killer""... Dexter does not kill at random, he seeks out other killers and seeks to server justice as he see fit... a very entertaining new television show...I highly recommend giving it a chance"
303,"This is an excellent piece of work for Showtime. Michael C. Hall wonderfully portrays Dexter, the serial killer who only kills serial killers. As you might expect, the show challenges the viewer to decide whether or night they like Dexter's character. Furthermore, the sequential growth of his character from one episode to the next leaves you fascinated as to what his next move will be. Through and through the performances are solid and the quality of the cinematography and film style is especially captivating. I am generally not a fan of serial killer thrillers but this show is particularly well done because Dexter is different than any character I have ever seen. I understand that the show is based on a number of books and I inspired to read them only after seeing four episodes."
304,"How can anyone (other than the psychopathic) enjoy watching someone who likes to kill animals and humans? I understand that he kills only the ""bad"" people but that doesn't change the fact that you are enjoying a TV series for the killing. I am not religious and I actually do read quite a lot about serial killers I think just to try to understand the psyche but this show is horrible. You get hooked into a show because you like the characters of the show but how can you like someone who has no emotional connections, responses or ties and who could easily kill his siblings/parents if it weren't for his ""rules"". How on earth would a cop be accepting of a son who is a young Ted Bundy in the making? You wouldn't. No way would that happen. Uh uh, no way. You certainly can't connect emotionally to such a character so I am at a loss as to why this show is still ongoing unless it is the violence that enthralls the viewers and in which case, we need to take a look at our society if this is the case. Wow ... lol"
305,"I am a huge fan of ""Dexter"" since the start of the show, it has been one of my favorite. I really enjoyed how you could see Dexter's mentality in a season, how it changes through out it and the fact that it is centered around him. However after an amazing ending to season 4, season 5 was completely boring and the only thing that kept me watching was how much I liked the first four. Then season 6, which I was looking forward to, started of well especially with Mos Def's character and the contrast to ""DDK"". However the writers had to many directions to take the show through and chose the wrong one, they lost interest in detail added too much mind-numbing talking and introduced the worst twist followed by the sickest crush I could ever imagine.DEXTER ENDED AT SEASON 4!!!"
306,"I just recently started watching this show and I am already hooked after watching just two episodes. Everything about this show is fantastic, but the best is Dexter's thoughts and narrations. Also I felt as if this serial killer is really a likable guy, the kind you invite to a party, but it also makes me wonder what lies beneath the surface of others? What are they like, really? If you enjoy a thinking show, that is funny, chilling, and sometimes dramatic, and you don't mind the content, I seriously recommend you watch this show. Now if you are a viewer that only wants to be entertained, and can't come to grip what the real world is like, don't watch this show.Anyway 10/10 for sure!"
307,"This show brings up so many thoughts. Thoughts that I won't go into on here. There is just nothing there.However, the actress that plays Dexter's sister looks like a damn man. A skinny man. And her character is weak. Always crying for attention. And so damn thick. Stupid really.But a good show. For once, a show that depicts the most advanced in our society."
308,"This shows potential was incredible. Season 1-4 was phenomenal (a clear 10/10), but then it went down more and more and the series finale ended in a disaster. Such a dissapointment... :'("
309,"I loved this show right up to season 7. It was brilliantly funny and dark. The 7th season just felt off kilter. The series finale left a lot to be desired. I'm an avid reader, so I'm going to have to give the books a try."
310,"I don't know why everyone is singing the praises of this show. I just started watching it and I gotta say, it's pretty lame. Way too many ridiculous repeated events (how can someone repeatedly kill people and carry them out their car trunks, unseen). How can you beat someone to within inches of their life, basically tell them who you are and then just walk away, with zero repercussions? Really bad acting, mostly from the supporting actors (his sister for one is brutal, so is Dexter's nemesis the police sergeant) and equally bad writing.This show is a joke. This passes for really good television?! There are no likable characters, terrible dialogue and a ridiculous story line. How long can they drag this nonsense out?"
311,"If you have Netflix and you haven't watched Dexter, what are you waiting for? Dexter is my personal favorite television series to date (and yes, I have watched breaking bad). I watched Dexter on Netflix earlier this year and it only took me about three months to finish because of how awesome it is.Don't worry, no spoilers here, just an abstract to get you hooked in case you don't know what the show is about. So basically Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro, but by night, his 'dark passenger' must be fed. To fulfill his needs he has to take lives. In order to do this while not ruining the lives of innocent families, he takes the lives of others who have killed.If the premise alone isn't enough to excite you, I must also say, this show is very addicting. Once you finish season one you may not want to stop.I highly advise every human being who does not think that a show with killing is satanic, to watch this show."
312,"I'll keep this a little short. Dexter was my absolute favorite show.....until the end. I was so into it, that I would feel ill with anticipation and literally have to force myself to keep watching. THEN.....season 8 came and the plot careened out of control and the series started,(even more than before), to make little sense. They disrespected Batista, who was on the show for years and ultimately got little screen time, and many actors were brought in for a Hollywood incest fest. They also cheaply used the season as a cash-cow advertisement vehicle, BLATANTLY placing Pepsi into one of the shots. THAT'S one of the reasons how you know the show crapped out so bad. They also played dress-up too much in the season by wearing bright colors and saturated many of the scenes with red. Also, they zoomed onto characters too closely with the camera and forgot to involve a broader audience for the story. It was this aspect that truly made the story feel shallow and unrealistic, like a really crappy comic book with one or two people in each frame. Yeah, the show went down when they tried to be too Hollywood and also, at the same time, went too meta, meaning that they tried to convey too much deep meaning on screen. If you're not careful in doing that, the show can easily lose viewers along the way. Also, the plot just had too many holes and refused to circle back onto its own storyline by bringing up the past seasons and events. Not only did they refuse to close this gap by filming certain scenes, but the dialogue was also crappy and really, honestly, could have been better written by a monkey......with disabilities and no hands. It's like that South Park episode with the manatees in the tank randomly picking out words for a Family Guy episode by choosing a random ball. Horrendous. And offensive. I don't want to really throw out the entire series, but I am in FULL agreement that Dexter was really meant to be a package-deal series. The story was so centered on Dexter that to let the series crap out in the end LITERALLY made the entire series lose value. I literally cannot watch Dexter anymore. It's like being punched in the gut while having your brain sucked out of your head, and a black hole start in your heart with your soul being vanquished forever to Satan by Jesus Christ. Which is to say, you'll wish you never watched it all to begin with. Remembering only hurts.So, the stars? Dexter gave me some really, really good times, so I can't give it one star just because of the last season. However, the last season is a travesty to the series overall and blights the honorable name of Dexter Morgan. Just end the series on season four or five, and you'll be good."
313,"""Dexter"" seems to present itself as a thriller/drama, considering all the poetic pseudo intellectual voice-over musings of the main character. However, I see it as a dark farcical comedy.Consider that our main character, Dexter Morgan, works for the Miami Metro Police Department while simultaneously interfering with their murder investigations so that he can murder a murderer before he or she is arrested by the police. Add to that the fact that Dexter kills about a dozen times a year (including the murder of an assistant District Attorney) without ever being caught, and we have the element of farce.To further confuse matters, the character of Dexter's sister, Deb Morgan, has the physique of a malnourished 12 year old boy; is not very attractive, yet her character is written as if she's an irresistible hot chick.The premise of ""serial killer working for the police department"" was a good one for a TV show, yet after 3 or 4 seasons it stops being plausible. No one could interfere with so many police investigations and kill so many suspects without being caught.Dexter isn't an indiscriminate killer, however. He adheres to a 'code' which demands that he only kill people who have committed murder.The appeal of the show seems to lie in this moral ambiguity where Dexter can be made out to be a hero for ridding the community of human scum while at the same time he is guilty of the same crime these human scum committed. Murder.The average viewer has not committed murder, so the average viewer does not feel threatened by Dexter. If viewers feel threatened by the main character of a show, I don't think the show would do so well. Making Dexter seem ""safe"" was a crucial plot element which has allowed the show to remain on television for eight years.Dexter is portrayed by Michael C. Hall, who was funeral director David Fisher on the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"". Two of the other main characters, Lt. Guerta and Detective Battista, were regulars on the HBO prison series ""Oz."""
314,"I was hesitant about this show in the beginning, since I'd read that Dexter was someone who killed animals (which is something I CAN'T forgive under ANY circumstances). However, the premise for the show intrigued me, so I checked it out. While it's true that Young Dexter displayed the typical signs of a future serial killer (ie. killing animals), at least we didn't have to *see* it. What we saw was Adult Dexter killing nogoodniks who deserved what they got, which was why I was able to like his character: because he was putting his need for killing to a more noble use than just because he enjoyed it. I know he doesn't kill simply to save people. He didn't set out to be any sort of ""hero"", but whether he wants to be or not, he's doing a service many people would be grateful to him for. It's funny, at the end of Season 1, I felt the ending (with Dexter daydreaming about everyone cheering him on/congratulating him, etc for what he'd done) was a bit out of place, but eventually I grew to appreciate that ending more, as it was something Dexter would no doubt dream about. It suddenly made sense to me/felt right in the context of the show.My favourite character in the show is Dex's sister, Deb. While some have issues with her, I don't. I agree with the majority of what she says/does, plus she's highly amusing. She finds new/inventive ways of cursing that never fail to surprise/amuse. I love her and Dexter's interactions, they have great sibling chemistry. Jennifer Carpenter is oftentimes a scene-stealer, she's THAT good and Deb goes through SO much stuff. She's easily the best female on the show. I also liked her relationship with Lundy, weird as it was. As for Rita, she doesn't really annoy me too much (except when she seems to take Dexter for granted, just using him at her own convenience). Thankfully, she was written out at the right time and doing so allowed for Dex to grow/change as a person and the story to evolve. Angel is the most 'normal' character in the show, he's likable and he has a nice friendship with Deb. LaGuerta's storyline was the most boring aspect of Season 2, her and Angel made a pretty snore-worthy couple, and she proved to be a horrible back-stabbing bitch - least she got a fitting ending.Doakes was easily the most unlikeable character on the show from the get-go, remaining so until the end of Season 2. Oddly, it's near his end, when he's talking things out with Dexter, that he finally becomes tolerable for me. A shame it took until his exit to see that character/actor playing him could act like a human being/not be so one-note. His replacement, Quinn, is slightly better (at least he has more than one mode, unlike Doakes who was in a permanent state of being p.o'd). I was grateful to Lila for taking out Doakes at the end of Season 2 and felt she added some much-needed spice to the show. Yes, she was hated by a not-small percentage of viewers, but I thought she had an interesting role. Her & Dexter's scenes/conversations together were part of what made Season 2 so great. She brought out sides to Dexter (and his inner feelings) that we wouldn't have seen otherwise. If nothing else, she served a useful purpose in Season 2. What I really appreciated was the way they wrapped up her character. That final meeting between her & Dex was very fitting.Sadly, Season 3 dropped in quality a bit from the first two seasons. The best aspects of Season 3 were Jimmy Smits as Miguel Prado and the ""friendship"" he developed with Dexter (my favourite part being Dexter's 20 second ""MIGUEEEEEL!!!!!"" freak-out where he threw crap around in his mind after realising Miguel used him). The show came back strong with John Lithgow in Season 4 as Trinity - who made the season quite unforgettable. Julia Stiles was another welcome special guest star in Season 5 as Lumen. Her & Dexter were excellent together and she had a very interesting storyline. Season 6 was the worst season, the only good bit being the ending. Season 7 was a vast improvement, allowed for a different dynamic between Dex & Deb and also introduced Hannah. Yvonne Strahovski was great and her character's relationship with Dexter allowed him to evolve more than he ever had before. Having not seen Michael C. Hall in anything else, it goes without saying that he perfectly embodies the character of Dexter Morgan. The show has a dark sense of humour, as do Dex's voice-overs, which fit the mood. The opening credits get special mention for how highly appropriate/relevant they are to the show. I love all the details of Dexter going about his daily morning routine, doing seemingly mundane things, but them being presented/shot in extremely sinister/disturbing ways. It's *so* perfect. Every single thing we see in the opening credits can be related to what Dexter does (in regards to his killings). All the preparing of food, and even something as simple as him getting dressed, takes on a whole new meaning when you watch them. Like Dexter himself, there's two sides to what's going on: the normal everyday routine, and then the darker more disturbing side. To top it all off, the show's theme is one of the BEST themes for a show ever. It's so twisted and eerie, yet so catchy. I love it. I appreciate shows that can put actual thought into something like opening credits (whereas so many others don't). The end credits music is also nicely creepy. The series final ended on quite a depressing note, but I guess it was fitting for a show about a serial killer."
315,"To wrap up the story in twelve episodes or chapters, that's short, that's fast, but that's radical, à la Dexter. He manages to solve a ton of problems in these twelve episodes. First he finds a surrogate mother for Harrison, and that was difficult to find. Luckily the only woman he had loved and that was still alive, apart from his sister turns up and re-activates some fundamental mechanisms. And Harrison likes her. She is very special but she wants to become a good girl.He manages to solve the problem of his father and how his father, a good cop, could accept his adoptive son to become a criminal, how he managed to come up with the code, etc. In fact the symbolical mother surrogate of his, of Dexter, comes up to him and reveals who she is and what she did. She reveals that his father OD'ed on his heart drug when he could not stand what Dexter had become any more. Dexter hates that doctor Vogel that has nothing of a bird in that story, at most a vulture but that is no bird you try to attract in your garden with a bird feed and a bird bath. He has to solve a last case of a serial killer who is aiming at both him and Doctor Vogel. Her past is revealed and she becomes extremely dark and deep with one son killed by another, you know the story of Cain and Abel. And the killing son is sent East of Eden in some institution in England, or something far to the East. And there he is tortured into medical blankness since he is a criminal who deserves to be punished even if it is with drugs or some archaic violent treatment like electric shocks or other forceful manipulations of the body or the brain, and why not the mind and the imagination. Of course the dear son who was buried alive in this institution plans a good case of arson, with seven dead people in the wing that burns, and himself among these seven, officially, because' in fact he manages to get out, change identities and then move on, looking for mummy, Doctor Vogel, and all those she preferred to him, and first of all Dexter. And the blood trail can start under the police identity of the ""brain surgeon"" because he saws up the skull of his victim in a very special way and scoops out one very precise section of the brain and delivers these extracted sections to his mummy. A yummy appetizer for Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving celebrations.He of course has to save his sister from private investigation and then to make her a star in the Police Department. So he finally comes over his need to kill with his last victim and gives him over to Deborah for her to arrest him. But a Federal Marshall comes up and he completely messes the case, frees the criminal who kills him straight away, takes his gun, shoots Deborah who shoots him but in vain. And things will not turn honky dory and there will be some complications. Dexter then has to close up the file and clean up the plate. Deborah disappears in a hurricane. Finally he has to take care of himself and to protect Harrison and the substitute mother who has taken the boy to South America, and there is only one way. So he disappears with his boat into the hurricane. A tempestuous ending but it works.And yet they more or less kept one card up their sleeves, I mean the producers, for a sequel in let's say five or ten years, when Harrison reaches teenage and starts moving towards finding his father and recuperating the father model he needs and remembers from his tumultuous first four years. Check it all by yourselves with the DVDs how they manage to keep one bun in the oven in slow gestation. You can always dream. But it is sure the author of the book series will be able to go on working with Dexter if he wants, though the last volume was announced a long time ago and will maybe finally come out next March (2014) and it is supposed to be entitled Dexter's Final Cut, which promises quite some blood.We'll see. Que sera sera. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
316,"This show is so perfectly done that this review will sound extremely biased, but I can't help it - it's simply that good. The characters are all incredibly deep and well developed. Even ancillary characters are given compelling story lines, you really get a feel for the people that surround Dexter's life.Then there's Dexter himself. I've never seen a character so simultaneously expressive and emotionless. His constant struggles with himself and his life are all beautifully played out on screen.All in all, you figure it must be a good show if you're rooting for a serial killer. enjoy"
317,"Usually, when you watch a cop drama/action/suspense show, you get the feeling that complexity consumes you. Well, this one is no different, but only in terms of what the complexity is. Usually, in regular cop dramas, you're looking for someone or something to answer all your questions, and in Dexter, that is also the case, but it's the way you find out that is truly masterful. The cat and mouse game is literally a game, and you just can't help but feel remorse for the good people and excitement and vigor for the bad people. I can't tell you how many times I waited to see a new crime scene or a new flashback or a new revelation, or just a funny comment by a witty character. This show hooks you and drags you around by your emotions. This is also a show you can watch over and over again and figure new things out and wonder what really was going on. 10 out of 10."
318,"The writing is very good. Michael C. Hall creates a brilliant character which is quite dark and a nice change from his Six Feet Under character. The mystery and suspense are played well and while the underlying story behind Dexter and his nemesis is not terribly hard to figure out, the show remains great entertainment. The flashbacks make an interesting back story for the show.Clearly this show can do more given the opportunity. The Lieutenent has an opening to get justice. Dexter's sister has a lot of needed therapy. The door is now open for Dexter's girlfriend to look behind the curtain and now Dexter will have to be even more careful in the execution of his ""code."" I seriously hope another season is planned."
319,"I first gave this series a shot because of the interesting plot line (blood splatter expert for the Miami police dept by day, serial killer by night) and because I love Michael C Hall (aka Dexter). I'm glad I did because as the season has progressed, this show has become one of my favorites. Every Sunday I get excited because a new episode is going to air. This series is so original and has an excellent cast. No one else could play this character as well as Michael C Hall. At first, I wasn't sure how the creators were going to get the audience to sympathize with a serial killer. But they have done just that, making the audience root for Dexter because he kills only ones who are guilty of heinous crimes that haven't been caught. And because he's a complex character who just wishes to be normal and to know what happened to him to make him want to kill. He also takes excellent care of the ones who are a part of his strange life. There are many aspects to this show and plenty of story lines to follow. But the main storyline has centered around one main serial killer who is murdering a countless amount of women in a horrendous manner. The Miami police are trying to track him down (with help from Dexter). Somehow this serial killer knows of Dexter and of Dexter's secret (that he's also a serial killer). So, now this serial killer has become intertwined with Dexter's life. Will Dexter catch him in time or will it be too late?"
320,"Dexter Morgan works for the Miami Dade County Police Department as a blood spatter expert of the forensics department. He is currently dating Rita,a former victim of an abusive drug addict, has a sister who's just joined the homicide devision and a superior officer who enjoys busting his balls whenever the opportunity arises. Oh and he's a completely sociopathic serial killer.But instead of quenching his thirst for murder on the innocent citizens of Miami, he carefully chooses gangsters, drug dealers, paedophiles, murderers. Individuals all of which Dexter feels have long outlived their purpose in the world because they are simply bad people.I first became aware of this series after seeing posters advertising it in a local comic book store in my home town. now the idea of a forensics expert who's also a serial killer screams comic books origins and you'd be on the right track to assume that. It's based on a novel or rather a series of novels. I haven't read them myself but I've read several positive reviews.Getting back to the series. It's nice to see television putting some effort into their programming these days. With the reality TV bug dieing, thankfully, a slow and painful death. Shows such as this, Heroes, Supernatural, Lost etc have proved that the writing seems to be getting better and much more entertaining.Dexter is basically could the result of Brett Easton Ellis ever wrote an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in which Gil Grissom goes insane and starts killing off the bad guys or if The Punisher wasn't so wild about big guns. When the viewer watches Dexter they can't help him but find the guy somewhat likable. Given he's a complete sociopath and a killer we should be repelled by his actions but the fact that he only punishes those who deserve it, we are forced in some ways to support his ""fight"" against evil.Dexter's emotional well being or lack there of, often feels conflicted whenever in the presence of his girlfriend Rita. As stated earlier she was a victim of an abusive husband and has zero interest in sexual intercourse. Something which, Dexter admits, is comfortable which. Yet he often finds himself having thoughts which he can't understand, could they be feelings? or something much more sinister? we don't know but this creates definitely the most complex and deep character driven relationships in the entire series.The reviewer only wishes the other interactions between Dexter and the other characters were this fascinating. Another relationship which played out very well in the series was between Dexter and his adoptive father, backed up brilliantly by James Remar's wonderfully understated performance as a detective who's own emotional reserve has been burnt out by the justice system allowing the wrong people getting away with crimes they were so obviously guilty of. This is a state of mind which, for better or worse is instilled within Dexter.What probably stands out most is the writing and of course the acting. Michael C. Hall, James Remar and Julie Benz are fantastic in this. It's outstanding to see their hard work hasn't gone un-noticed with Hall, Benz and Remar picking up awards for their tremendous effort on what has to be one of the best TV shows in this past decade.I can't recommend this series enough. Fans of American Psycho will really enjoy this or people who enjoy TV that can be both engaging and entertaining at the same time. Please, watch at least one episode, I'm sure there'll be something in there that will get your attention and keep for the run of the series."
321,"Dexter is incredibly charming in it's appearance. One moment can see bloodshed and horror, the next can be poking fun at that exact scene with a quirky one-liner. The writing is superb, the characters are completely lovable, and the plot leaves you hanging for the next episode without feeling sluggish and empty.The voice-over narration of Dexter explains to the audience things that the other characters in the show have no idea about, such as his desire to kill and his struggle to fit in with the rest of the Miami society. It gives the impression the audience is truly involved in the plot, as they are almost like Dexter's best friend, learning all his secrets and problems. The way hall presents his story is both comical and twisted, something that is rarely achieved with success and yet is one of the reasons Dexter is such a huge hit.Dexter is definitely not for the weak of heart, exploring the mind of a serial killer in explicit detail, whilst also presenting him as the hero of the story, removing the problems that exist in society. He is a representation of the darkest secrets that exist in all of us, but whilst the show is generally dark, it is filled with enough humour to make you truly relax and feel comfortable with what is happening, thus become incredibly shocked when a twist occurs."
322,"Fist off i just wanted to say i am one of those people that hate watching one episode a week, No matter how much i enjoy the show ill wait until i can get my hands on a whole season.Having said that i just have to see each episode of dexter as it airs,i am totally intoxicated with each episode, apart from the brilliant creative talent it is also because i was a massive fan of the HBO show OZ (which this show has several of the same cast members) and also because of the one and only Michael C. Hall. (also a dedicated fan of six feet under) Our unsung hero of this story is Dexter who has the compulsion to kill people who have slipped through the cracks of justice, this is a unique story which i have not seen expressed in the television medium before and i applaud the creatures for been so brave and courageous in telling this dark and mysterious story.Dexter is a bloody masterpiece and if your not hooked after one episode you need to check your pulse."
323,"So I've seen all 12 episodes now and all I can say is after I saw the last episode I left the living room with a big smile.I'd never thought a show like this could possibly be this good. It was pretty hard to being obsessed after the first episodes but after about episode five you just can't wait for more. I really enjoyed Dexter. The last episode I was all ""How is this going to end?"" and keep asking myself of how this thing is going to be ended in fifty minutes.I'm not gonna spoil anything but Dexter is a really great show and I really wished there were more episodes in the first season and Michael Hall is a great actor and Dexter is a great character and the way he manages to make up great lies.Anyway, this deserves so many Golden Globes you couldn't even imagine. A really great TV-show! =D"
324,"For years I heard nothing but how ""amazing"" Dexter was, and didn't get around to checking it out more recently. After finishing the series finale, I find myself baffled at the extreme levels of praise all these years. The show starts out good enough, as the first two seasons stood out from a lot of original series around at the time. However, like a lot of shows, it begins to buckle under its own success with each subsequent season.After season 2, this show loses one of its most dynamic characters. Which is a shame, because practically all secondary characters in Dexter have the depth of a cardboard cutout and are generally annoying. Between these unlikable people and Dexter's angst ridden voiceovers that spoon feed you every single part of the plot, I found myself getting incredibly bored by the end of season 3.Season 4 seemed to give promise in huge part to John Lithgow. Unfortunately every season after it drops significantly in quality, and begins to feel like 4 seasons of filler. Hearing Dexter's ""edgy"" pseudo-intellectual narration becomes more irritating as you witness him constantly making the same dumb decisions over and over again.As reward for your dedication, you're treated to the worst series finale I've seen (even worse than True Blood). I think Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter do a good job portraying their characters (even if Carpenter's is intolerable until the last few seasons), but I will never understand how this show became so popular. The idea of Dexter is unique and I get its initial appeal at the time, but the writing and consistency in quality is deeply lacking."
325,"After a good start to build good will, it proceeded to leech off that, as it fairly rapidly became worse, then worse, the maybe improved slightly, then became trash, which continued until the show ended."
326,"Never wanted this show to end. How can i like a guy Dexter and watch his show, where he shows plain face with no emotions. All were left for Deb. Hope he realizes there are more bad people in this world to face justice. Super man, Batman .... now is dexter.. I gave this show 10 Stars because it kept me hooked to this series for all 8 seasons .Not even missed a single second of any episode. I think the way Writer/director showed the relation of Dexter with all the people around him made the content of this show. and this is what i liked most. Giuys making the show... keeping on doing the good stuff and give us one more season...:) Story Ends with a WOW."
327,"Dexter is definitely one of the best shows ever on American TV. Even with the basic idea being a bit ridiculous Dexter seems more sensible then most ""more realistic"" shows on TV. The show is well written, well acted and doesn't seem to lose any of it's charm as the seasons go by, which is quite rare. Every season seems to be as good as the last one, if not better but with enough changes to keep it interesting. Even though Dexter might have some characters that fit regular crime-show stereotypes (Doakes, Masuka etc), it also has characters that seem to fit no stereotype at all. Forgetting the obvious one, Dexter, there is Rita who starts off so hurt, lost (yet always good) and delicate but bit by bit becomes a strong independent mother and wife, a slightly unusual storyline for any cop-show. The absolute jewel of the show however is Debra. On the surface she might fit the profile of a foul-mouthed female cop but under the surface is so much more. One of the most brilliant, interesting, endearing and above all genuine characters I've ever seen on television. Thank you Jennifer Carpenter!"
328,Good until season 5 should have let it die with Rita RIP and wth was the ending
329,"Loved this show... up to Season 4... Honestly, when Rita died, the show died with her. It seemed pointless from Season 5 on wards. They changed the story again with Batista and LaGuerta which was the most annoying thing they could have done given the four seasons around their story for basically nothing... Julia Styles was a nice add on but again, so deflating at the end... There were many things that changed that ultimately didn't need to and it just got more bizarre and repetitive the more the show ran it's course. The finale is ... just NO! That is not how end a series like that. What the actual f&*%?Season 4, although also not the best way to end a show, at least gave you a feeling of how great it is... the rest of the seasons were a flop and the finale a bigger flop. Goes to show you, you should stop at your best and not base any of this on ratings or a fanbase. This is what overreaching looks like."
330,"Seasons 1-4 of Dexter will be among the top seasons of dramatic television you've ever seen, it will make you laugh, cry and wish that there were more shows that could pack a punch like this one can. Unfortunately, seasons 5-8 and generally boring, predictable, and undo all of the charm and relationships that the first 4 seasons of Dexter established so well. The season finale is one of the most disappointing endings that could've been thought up for this series as well.My suggestion is to watch seasons 1-4 as each episode will have you on the edge of your seat, but you will be able to live without seasons 5-8 if you so choose."
331,"Dexter was a wicked dark TV show, that for periods off it was brilliant some off the best script TV to come out off the USA in the decade.Michael C Hall performance, as Dexter Morgan was brilliant as well was Jennifer Carpenter who played his sister was excellent too.everyone who worked on this show was good, from writing to editing and directing that what made it for me.sad to see it end, but all good thing come to an end eventually hope they do not comeback and leave it as it is a very good show no need to reboot.overall a ten show for me, a great show that had everything thought it run sadly missed by everyone."
332,"If you like Dexter, you are essentially screwed because there are no other shows that are even slightly like it. I got to the Dexter party a little late having just seen it for the first time a couple months back and have since seen it two times around. I can easily say that Dexter is one of the greatest show series ever made and I have a tendency to be quite the harsh critic. Of course the show had some flaws at times and the ending was unfortunate, but overall the show was a masterpiece. Some people weren't the biggest fans of seasons 5, 6 & 8, but I still really enjoyed those seasons. Even a bad season of Dexter is better than 99% of show series out there. Dexter is a dark comedy that's done in such a way to where the viewer doesn't really feel the full morbidity of most of the deaths throughout the show (aside from the Rita death), the show manages to put the viewer in Dexter shoes, so you kind of feel it the way Dexter does, yet still maintain a realistic vibe to it. Dexter has a special charm to it that I don't think can be mimicked. Other shows such as the Sopranos and Breaking Bad (which I also really like), I was happy with both Tony Soprano & Walter White meeting their demise, but surprisingly I'm on board with the serial killing Dexter to ride off into the sunset, having the happy ending. I think it takes a tremendous amount of talent for both the actor and writing staff to successfully pull that off. Of course (spoiler) they didn't take advantage of that rare instance, where the ""the societal rule breaker"" actually gets to live a happy life in the end, they instead fall into the cliché of ""societal rule breaker"" must pay the ultimate price and it falls into the same old gargantuan cliché. The big theme throughout the entire show is/was Dexter slowly becoming more human & particularly in the last season morphing into a human, only to not utilize it. I would have even been okay with Dexter becoming so human that he indeed kills himself in the boat in the end & it would've been very poetic. It would've also been fitting for Deb's death to be the final blow that transitioned him to be done with his killing ways with the only way to justify and/or deal with Deb's death would be to go off and meet up with Hannah and his kid swearing never to kill again. Nonetheless, I think the show gets unfairly docked, due to the ending yes the ending blows, but that shouldn't undo the masterpiece that this show was/is. More information has come out about the shows ending and what went wrong & it's mostly what I suspected. One of the things that came out at the time was; they weren't able to kill off Dexter due to the network trying to create a spin off series. But more recently in just this last year the creator said, that they just ran out of time, which makes sense, because the storyline for the final season is actually very good, but you could tell many of the scenes felt rushed...they did back to back seasons, so season 8 would've benefited having the usual downtime to tidy things up. One of the sillier things about the ending was/is, Dexter is declared dead just because they found his wrecked boat. Has this ever happened in the history of mankind? Yet, it's printed in the newspapers as so, and Batista and Hannah just take this at face value and go on with their life.I really liked the Hannah McKay character & was intrigued right from the start about her story as a whole (beginning in season 7) & the overall Dexter Hannah relationship. In theory I would have never imagined the show being able to pull off a Dexter relationship where I wouldn't be skeptical, but Hannah compliments him perfectly. She was someone who knew Dexter for who he really was, yet wasn't attracted to him for his murderous ways. She was one of the only people throughout the entire show that Dexter respected on an intellectual level (not even Deb fell into that category) and I would have to say that I have more faith in a Dexter/Hannah relationship working out in comparison to nearly every corny romance movie/show ever made where two people fall in love and the show ends. Hannah was/is also an awesome actress that I don't think got the props she deserved for her role. Her final scene in Dexter was atrocious, but the fault was in the writing and or how it was directed. She essentially is informed of Dexter's non-body finding death and forms some very genuine tears for about one second, sucks it up and moves on with her and the kid's life, ruining what should have been a heartfelt/emotional moment. I could see if she sucked back the tears, because she realized that Dexter likely faked his death, but that was not the case and she obviously had enough feelings for Dexter to risk everything for him on multiple occasions.It's difficult to put into words, but this show just resonated with me. I liked just about every character on the show All of the characters were very original. Just a funny note – I don't know what happened in season four with the makeup, but it's the only time that I know of in a movie/show I could say that the makeup department miserably failed. Dexter looks like a tranny half the time with bright purple lipstick and Rita is so orange that she looks like an Umpa Loompa. Rita looks so adorable in the first 2 ½ seasons or so before they started using a spatula to put on her makeup. What were they thinking?"
333,"First of all folks, SPOILER ALERT,Dexter was a brilliant, unique, concept. Superbly written, produced and acted. I can only assume that those of you out there whingeing (for US viewers ""moaning"")are unemployed script writers who could have done a much better job, I look foreword to your work in the future! Are you the same people that complained about certain episodes of ""Game of Thrones""? Listen closely, IT'S A STORY, IT'S FICTION!Do you also want to change the ending of ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""Casablanca"" because you didn't like it? Get over it and watch the Muppets if you want a happy ending! In any case ""Lumberjack"" Dexter is still alive!"
334,"Many of my friends told me it is an amazing show, I never really checked it out until this weekend. I forced myself to sit through the first 2 episodes - and there has been no turning back since. The story line: Dexter is a Serial Killer. That's all you need to know for starters.I've never seen so many people vouch for a serial killer. I think the ability to create such a character is an outrageous challenge, and the creators of this show have been able to do justice to that! The strength of the show has been its ability to create strong villains that make Dexter a necessary evil. I wish they would stick to that formula. Whenever they've failed to do that, there have been too many holes in the plot and some episodes leave me wondering how amateur the work has been.I just completed 4 season back to back of this series. Good show, characterization and story line is solid. Michael C. Hall,James Remar, Julie Benz,John Lithgow lived their characters so far..Starting of 5th season has taken me into a shock.This is not digestible. I am writing this review only for story line S05E01..Killing such a beautiful character is very cruel and not acceptable. :( whoever thought this should be killed first. Julie Benz I Love You. You did a superb job."
335,"I really love the show. It is such a novel concept for TV. I would say that it is the best show by far that I have ever watched. I have heard of a show like this on TV. I am definitely a huge fan. The suspense, the drama, and (at times) the comedy keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm so glad I discovered it. I speed watched it the 1st time around, all eight seasons in a matter of about a week. I couldn't stop. I tried to pace myself but just couldn't. I'm on my 2nd viewing. I'm pacing myself this time around. It's amazing how much I'm picking up on the 2nd time around that I missed the 1st time. Michael C Hall is outstanding in the role of Dexter. I can't think of a better actor that could have pulled it off. He makes the character believable. He makes you love Dexter. The way he grows Dexter throughout the series keeps it from being stagnate. I'd never heard of Michael before Dexter. I will definitely be looking for anything he's in from now on. Eight seasons is not enough. It ends with you wanting more. Maybe they'll come back with a movie."
336,"Sorry, I've been wanting to use that line for a while..The show stopped being heart racing after season 2 with the death of James Doakes. Season 4 aka the Trinity killer is the closest the show came to regaining the magic of the first two seasons. Season 1 was fantastic and like all new shows, immerses you in the world of Dexter Morgan, who we quickly find out is one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. What makes it even more interesting? He works as a blood spatter analyst in the Miami Metro HOMICIDE dept., the irony is definitely not lost. On the surface and to nearly everyone except J. Doakes, Dexter is a good looking, oddly charming, and efficient worker. It's cool to see the transition from forensic analyst to cold blooded, psychopathic killer all in one fowl swoop. The supporting cast are all hilarious, lovable, and in the case of LaGuerta and Cpt. Matthews, hate-able. One character who really sticks out is Debra Morgan, Dexter's sister, who plays a potty-mouthed, blood hound of a detective. Vince Masuka also frequently provides comic relief to the show. With no further ado, I'll mention a brief synopsis and critique of each season...Season 1 - Great season. Everything including the characters and story line is fresh. It is fascinating to see Dex hide his dark passenger from his girlfriend, sister, and coworkers (who's sole job is to catch killers). The Ice Truck killer being Dexter's brother was a surprising twist and he proved to be a bone-chilling killer.Season 2 - Fantastic season which really took the best things from S1 and ran with them. James Doakes, Lila, and Frank Lundy all appeared to be closing in on Dexter. I truly believed he was going to be captured. Lundy was a fantastic character and made a great addition to the cast. This is easily my favorite season.Season 3 - I love Jimmy Smits, so I thought he was a great addition, but this season was rather lackluster. Although I like Rita as Dexter's girlfriend, the whole getting married and settling down thing wasn't entertaining, but it is a logical progression. Overall, there were some entertaining moments like the cat and mouse game between Miguel and Dexter, but the other subplots were boring. Season 4 - This season was the closest to Seasons 1 and 2 in excitement and intrigue (at least in my book). John Lithgow was genuinely scary as Arthur Mitchell aka the Trinity Killer. Lundy made a special appearance to track down Trinity, but was gunned down too prematurely. I think it would have been interesting to have Lundy, Mitchell, and Dexter all hit a crossroads. Season 4's final twist is a shocker that no one could have predicted. Season 5 - Probably the worst season I watched. I didn't find Lumen, Jordan Chase, or any of the 5 rapists and killers in the least bit interesting. This is where I started to also notice the writing start to slouch as far as dialogue and story line. There was no suspense or element of mystery to this season. Season 6 - The kills made by the Doomsday Killers were probably the most interesting kills in the whole series, but unfortunately the killers played by J. Edward Olmos and Colin Hanks turned out to be dull and uninspiring after the first few kills. The only interesting thing to come out of this season was Dex being discovered by Debra as a serial killer. Season 7 - This season was pretty bad overall. Dexter wasn't Dexter anymore because he had Deb breathing down his back and the main villain, Isaak Sirko was way too suave to be taken seriously. The main gist of season 7 was Cpt. LaGuerta figuring out that Dexter was the Bay Harbor Butcher (which ultimately resulted in her murder by Deb). Season 7 was better than 6.Season 8 - I did not watch anything after the first episode of season 8. I looked up a synopsis because the show had declined so much. Some of the things that bothered me about the show...Quinn. He had some potential to really rattle Dexter's cage, but he kind of just faded back into his cement head detective role. He also got weirdly skinny and got a Donald Trump tan after season 3...Wtf? Dexter's seeming immunity. The closest we got to seeing Dexter get unraveled was season 2, but then the writers took a step back. After that, you NEVER really sensed that Dexter was in any kind of danger. How Batista and Quinn could overlook the events of season 6-7 is BEYOND me. A more interesting season 8 would have seen a final confrontation with Deb and Dex which would have made me cream my pants. Hannah McKay. I simply did NOT find her interesting in any way, shape, or form. Lila and Rita were fantastic, but the love interests should have stopped there. Lumen and Hannah were just annoying subplots that distracted from what IMO could have been more tension between Dexter and Miami Metro. Overall, The acting was mostly first rate, writing was good for about 4 seasons with flashes in some of the other seasons, and the premise was in general a good one. Do you ever really know what's going on in someone elses' head? If a team of homicide detectives don't, how are you supposed to know? Dexter could be anyone, that's the scary thing. Alright it's time to M-99 this review.P.S. I had a great review but the 1,000 word limit really messed that up. Good going, IMDb."
337,"Let me start off with a warning about this otherwise excellent show: Stop at the end of season 7. As the show progresses over the years, Dexter learns more and more about his past and himself. He is faced with important decisions, sometimes making the right choice, sometimes not. The writers (and directors and producers) also had a choice as to how to resolve the series -- but they made the wrong choice. In season 8, the drama changed to soap opera, and the dialog, which normally just accompanied the scenes, started to drive them. The relentless ramblings of Charlotte Rampling's Dr. Vogel were an attempt to dissect the workings of Dexter's mind but wound up slicing up what had been good story-telling until then. The cardboard characters of season 8 were introduced and dispensed with at random, with more time spent on what was said about them then what they were. And the convoluted relationships and contrived coincidences were nonsense; even Dexter's fellow officers say there's no such thing as coincidence. And the series end -- nothing good to say about it. It may take a while for some viewers to accept the premise of a serial killer being one of the good guys, and I'm sure some won't accept it at all (while others will consider the Dexter character the ultimate hero). Yes, it's vigilante justice, but it IS about justice, not revenge. The show beautifully handles the balance between good and evil. And what the Dexter character does is evil for good. The well-written, well-acted story lines make for an absorbing series, especially in the earlier seasons. The photography is great. So is the music. Actors Jennifer Carpenter, C.S. Lee and Erik King give standout performances. Guest stars John Lithgow, Colin Hanks, Keith Carradine and others were superb -- their creepiness (among other things) led to the best episodes. Don't miss the series. Don't bother with the final season."
338,"Alas – here is another show I am a late-comer too. I know, I know, this is completely my fault. It always happens, I seem to have an inherent problem with new stuff. I am big enough to admit that character flaw. Usually I am requiring dogged coaxing into watching anything new and it usually comes from a family member. I end up kicking and screaming and whining and complaining from the confines of my very comfortable recliner until I finally hush up and begin paying attention. Spoiled? Oh yes I am. Eventually I will sit down and begin absorbing a show. Eventually I will get the gist of the storyline and begin devouring it if I like the show. Sometimes the program's cheese just doesn't taste good on my crackersBUTusually it ends up being something I should have been watching all along. A couple of prime examples would be 'Bones', 'Longmire', 'The Mentalist', 'Lost' and 'NCIS' – thank you family members. In other words, most of those suggestions by my familial advisors have pretty much been pretty much spot-on. Well it happened once again with 'Dexter'. My main, petty squabble that kept me away from this programs was, ""Dexter' cannot be good. This thing is about a serial killer who is the herono way."" And once again my opinion was a giant fail. (Side note – don't listen to me about reviewswatch what you want and enjoy - or not as so please.) This show ended up being pretty good. Dexter's personal struggles with his weekly kills soon became interesting (?) and enjoyable (?) (and I sound sick when I write this.) This guy targets only the 'BAD' serial killers and takes them out. (WOW, sicker and sicker) To avoid sounding any worse than I do, I will stop right there. Either you will like 'Dexter' or you won't. The cast is strong, I feel the script is solid and the directing – very well done. I recommend watching a couple of episodes and formulate your own opinion. I started out really disjointed repulsed about the whole concept, but I ended up really liking the program."
339,"I made an oath to myself that once I become a millionaire that I would give one of my millions to Michael C. Hall and the director of this show to continue making seasons. Every time I hear Dexter's name my heart starts to race and I instantaneously start to smile. The character build up was amazing and the acting was extraordinary. I was actually pretty angry at people's reaction to the finale because I thought that was a very mature and appropriate ending to an amazing show, I think if you respect the actors and director enough you would agree. If you are looking for a show that you want to binge watch and fall in love with, put Dexter as No. 1 in your list. The cliffhanger on every episode makes it impossible for you to not watch the next episode. If you are finished with Dexter and lost on what show you should watch next I would recommend Hannibal, not as good but still a great alternative and may we all pray for a Dexter spin off."
340,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best written and planned out shows ever made. Others have described all the good things about the show. The only thing I would add is that this show, like Nip/Tuck before it, suffers from a Hollywood interpretation of South Florida that frequently bears little resemblance to the real thing. Whether it be California landscapes that bear little resemblance to South Florida or inaccurate cultural references, these constant errors detract from an otherwise perfect piece of work. In Dexter's case, the composition of the cast is a great example. Since Miami is 3/4 Hispanic, the cast is grossly non-representative. Moreover, the lack of Spanish is glaring by its omission. While the show throws in a handful of words in each show, the reality is that Spanish is the majority language in Miami with a healthy dose of Spanglish on the side. A day with no Spanish is impossible in Miami. The architecture is equally wrong (e.g., no new wood construction in Miami because of hurricanes and termites). Lastly, the frequent burritos and other Mexican food shown is completely out of place whereas ropa vieja and arroz con pollo are common. If they would have simply filmed full-time in Miami, this would have been the perfect 10/10 show."
341,"Unique experience. Perhaps Dexter is my only favourite TV series i have ever seen in my life. It reminded of me. I may not be a killer but i felt like him, i never understood people. I connected with this amazing TV series, it made me think once again about life and be happy for the people who can easily smile and pretend. I felt the life that those actors and actress has in this TV series, it made me believe they are real.. because they had been chosen really good for their characteristic. Dexter thought he will not find happiness, but he did. Dexter lost all of it. The ending was great, it was not happy ending but it was realistic, perhaps if i were him i would do the same thing, he never wanted to destroy people around him but he hurt them all and then he face the truth... at the end he left infinitely and utterly alone. Overall, the ending made me upset, cause i always wanted him to felt something constantly.. maybe because he is like me. Watched so many movies and TV series, there will not be anything like Dexter."
342,"I wouldn't be arrogant as to state ""how do people like this show??"" as I wouldn't pretend to criticize anyone's viewing tastes....and I think I do understand the attraction of Dexter...the premise...Mr. Hall does have decent acting chops and knowing the premise its obviously alluring especially seemingly to today's younger generation the idea of an anti-hero serial killer vigilante hiding behind a badge with a ""code"" that is sickening however somehow seemingly honorable concerning the ends...we don't care about the means other than being fascinated by it...Mr. Hall does a good job showing us such....however... The problem is NOTHING about this show is believable....first of all the droning narration from Mr. Hall wears thin quickly...and you have to pretty much suspend belief that Dexter is adroitly working his double life under the barely suspecting Police Force that employs him...and because of such this just doesn't work as a series...maybe a well planned out 2 hour movie....and then there are the totally miscast support mainly Jennifer Carpenter who seems to be there to be a drama queen much less a cop....She is frustratingly annoying and when She is in the same scene with Dexter it becomes almost distracting...the plot holes are so big again you have to just go with the flow of Dexter being here...being there....always there...a slip up no problem as I can take ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD from my job to fix it...AND have a relationship with kids at the same time...Julie Benz is a lovely woman however I am not sure what her character was really for....any extra scenes concerning her add little...this show with its premise should be FULL of suspense however there is little and actually I found myself groaning and even laughing at how silly the dialogue could be...the story arc of Season 1 halfway had me at at point of disbelief and I almost bailed....Season 2 it was turning into a Soap Opera as the Lila Character was not only silly but totally unbelievable...it was bad enough having to look at the over stretched face of actress Jaime Murray...at times She looked like Michael Jackson's ugly Cousin...how I made it through the arc in Season 2 is beyond me as by this time all credibility was lost...Jennifer Carpenter is TOTALLY annoying and unwatchable...and worst of all the premise was shrouded and almost negligible...and although the ending was interesting if it was a Bond type movie however its just almost inexplicable to think Dexter would find Lila in France and know exactly where She was to off her....I groaned....and bailed...."
343,"I started watching this show last year. The show was intriguing. A story about a serial killer who worked as a forensics expert was such an amazing plot line and seeing what sort of adventures Dexter got into was great. I was instantly hooked from season 1. However, unfortunately, the writing slowly disintegrated as the series continued. If you want to see the best of Dexter, I suggest watching up to season 4. After season 4, the writing gets poor, and the plot line becomes pretty terrible. I will say that season 4 is definitely the best season of the show, and has the best villain of the entire show, and quite possibly, one of the greatest television villains of all time. Season 1 was great because it was the origin of Dexter and introducing us to him. Season 2 was also really great as well. Seasons 3 and 5 were OK but I wasn't super fond of the villains. Season 6 was pretty bad. The writing was just awful, and you could tell that the writers didn't really care nearly as much as before. Season 7 was also quite terrible all culminating to the all too famous Dexter ending that made many fans angry. The ending provided absolutely no closure, and made no sense. It felt like the writers just gave up on the show and threw something together at the last minute. This was definitely disappointing.As for acting, it was pretty good for the most part. However, I still think Deb is the most annoying TV character of all time. She was just so annoying and stupid so many times in the show. Laguerta was also really annoying and moronic as well. Other than those two, the acting was great all around. The sex scenes were also awesome. There were some real hotties on the show like Aimee Garcia and Yvonne Strahovski.Overall, this was a decent show. However, up till season 4, this show was definitely a 9 stars. However, seasons 5-7 kinda lowered the rating, and made this show a 7."
344,"I gotta start off by saying the first season of this show is one of the best first seasons I have ever seen in any show. Dexter starts off with a bang. I mean we all like the vigilante superheroes. And when that superhero is a nut like Dexter it makes it much better. So like I said that first season was awesome and the second season was not far behind. This show will get you hooked from the start no doubt. But like with most other reviewers have said it does go downhill. As the show progresses and the characters evolve Dexter turns more humanLike. His sister which at the beginning her character was great but after a few seasons her character ias eratic and goes all over the place I'm talking all over the board here. To make a long story short the beginning of the show is amazing, it will get you hooked no doubt about it. The problem is this show definitely goes downhill. Every next season is not as good as the one before and by the time you get to the last season you just want to finish to show off, you're t not even looking forward to the next episode you just want the show to end already and each episode is harder and harder to watch. It turns into a chore. My opinion is do not watch the season 1 or any of this show whatsoever. Just not worth it in the end. Great first season though. My opinion is you get stoned as hell and watch the first two seasons and then u should dump the show. Peace out fellow stoners..."
345,"The moment I started watching Dexter I immediately got sucked into the series. Dexter and his family felt like they were my family. Throughout the seasons the kept the focus on the love that Dexter has for his family, which makes it in my opinion very special.The ending of the series could've been better, I didn't even know it ended. I thought there was still an episode to come but it was done. There was so much intensity in the first 7 seasons and I felt like they just gave up on the last one. I was very disappointed with it but not enough to give it a bad rating.I loved the series, disliked the ending"
346,"TV shows get better and better. And weirder and more complex too. There are a lot of great TV shows out there and Dexter is one of them. It's tough to say or compare this with something else. I started watching this right after I finished with ""The Shield"". Let's say the mind set on a couple of things weren't that different. Both have a lead character in common, who is not really a hero ... and that is putting it mildly.Coming into this, I only knew that the actor (Michael C. Hall), whom I knew from Six Feet Under (another great show) was in this and he was ridding the world of bad people, while working for the police. Now that sounds simpler than it actually is and this is not your typical story. I also knew that Jennifer Carpenter was in this, though I had no idea what role she was playing. And I can tell you that is the best thing that can happen, if you are able to go into a show like this, with as little information as possible.Obviously if you're still out to get information you will find it, there are enough people who like to share/spoil with the world what is happening. I'll tell you that this show is not for children (although apparently they did work on alternate versions, concerning the swearing as Ms. Carpenter confirmed on Talk Shows). But nudity and blood is not just thrown in without reason. Like the Sopranos, just because it could get away with showing certain things, it didn't just bathe in them.The show that feels real, while being surreal (Dexters ""father"" to name but one factor being one of the surreal parts, his voice in his head, actually being what he things at that moment and not a voice over from the future, which is a common trait in TV/movies), is written and acted in a great fashion. It may have a few moments where it seems to copy itself (Doakes/Quinn analogy comes to mind, names that you'll recognize once you've watched the movie), but never really does. The dialog and the acting is on a level that never makes you question that this was written, instead it feels natural.If you haven't hopped on the train yet, you should get on it as soon as possible. Not every show has a cliffhanger, but when there is one, it is one that will almost drive you crazy. Something that cannot be said about the show in general, because it is that good"
347,"Let me say I loved the first 5 seasons of Dexter, but I think the writers were writing each season by watching their facebook feed.The reason why I was intrigued by the show, is I saw possibility of redemption. I understand the feelings of empathy when it comes to wanting to off serial killers and child molesters PERSONALLY, so many fans got a chance to live THROUGH Dexter. Others, like me, knew what he was doing was very human, and very wrong. Of course, vigilante justice (though it may be the purest form of justice) is wrong because it leads to mob rule. There must be a rule of law, otherwise it can lead to chaos. However, his (a)moral choice of killing serial killers MADE him human, and as his connections with Rita grew, we saw a person in Dexter. When we saw his connection with Lumen, that person came back out again. I wanted him to find love and find himself, but I think I was a minority.Which leads me to my main question to many of the dissenters: How many of you are perfectly cool with abortion and capital punishment, or cops shooting criminals in high-profile raids on homes (even forgiving them for killing children and pets in the crossfire)? I'm very pro-life on both counts, the State murdering someone (it IS murder, the criminal can't defend himself and certainly isn't a willing participant in all cases) for murdering someone to illustrate murder is wrong paints a muddy picture. Moral relativity is most certainly at play here, and you disapprove of where the grey area is. I very much prefer it in the hands of private citizens, as Democide has killed more people than all the serial killers throughout history combined.Well, it didn't become a story of redemption, a staggering number of people didn't want to see Dexter redeemed. Before they killed Rita, scores of fans were begging her to be killed off. They introduce Lumen, and scores of fans were complaining about the romance. I really wondered if they wrote things according to their facebook feeds and gave the majority what they wanted: A solitary Dexter with no personal relationships damned to a life of killing serial killers.Well, I braved through seasons 6, 7, and 8. The finale was so ridiculous I felt insulted to have even watched the first 5 seasons. They even teased you with the idea that Dexter could walk away, let the government deal the justice and he can let go of his dark passenger and escape with Hannah and Harrison, but when he did that was the death of Deb.Yeah, it seemed to be the show *most* fans wanted. I saw something else, but I guess it just wasn't the show for me."
348,"There is a bit of a discussion on when or if this show ""jumped the shark"". Some say it happened after season 4. Personally I disagree. I thought season 5 was great and had a much needed emotional tie-in to the events of season 4. I wasn't too happy with the sudden way the season ended but, for the most part, I was happy with the season. Season 6 was kind of bad, but it had an interesting ending that at least ties in with the series as a whole. Season 7 however was fascinating to watch. I really enjoyed the season and the season finale is among the best in the series except for the season 4 finale. I only wish the show didn't mangle season 8 which is the final season of the show. So here is my opinion: Although the show had its ups and downs, it did not ""Jump the Shark"" until the final season when it went off the rails for no reason other than trying to be clever for no reason. It had plenty of stories to tell an yet it told none of them...or the least interesting of them.. So there it is. Show good. Ending bad."
349,"very hard for a Dexter fan to explain what he likes most in this gripping series. This is just my attempt to count some of the reasons why I preferred the blood spatter analyst aka moonlight serial killer over my sleep.1)Some may say thrill is the reason to watch it, but unlike other TV series (Prison break, Vampire dairies etc.) they do not create suspense toward the end of series. Dexter mostly end the episode on a happy note but still can cause shivering in your spine.2)It has a story of vigilante which can thrill you if you are their great fan (I will highly recommend it for Batman fans).3)The Dialogues of the series are well edited and Michael justify them by excellent dialogue delivery.4)The episodes are fine work of art and will give you glimpse of Nolan's work especially the sixth season.5)Brilliant star cast Michael C Hall, and Exorcism of Emily rose star Jennifer Carpenter do not needs introduction even the rest of the crew has done brilliant job especially Masuka in his comic role.6)The series is built in the way that you will find yourself attached to Dexter. Even some of you will find the Dark passenger in you (you will understand term dark passenger on watching the series)7)Dexter is portrayed as emotionless person but still the series has emotional scenes regarding father-son, brother-sister, husband-wife relations involving Dexter in each but don't worry they won't make you cry.8)Watching Dexter on his hunt or in his lab will show you classic Sherlock especially when he explains the murder by just watching the spatter of blood.9)Background score is the another charm.Last but not the least, you may find the sensuous scenes redundant because you are so involved in the story they seem distracting (you may be smiling now but it is true).Hope I have given you enough reasons to watch the series. Comments are welcomed."
350,"DEX.. A forensic expert(Blood spatter Analyst) working for Miami Metro police and excellent at job, cracks any case in seconds by the blood pattern in the crime scene.He is also a serial killer which makes him best at the job.Knowing this about him, his dad gives him a code to kill people.(Killing the Bad people guilty of something they did).And Dex calls this part of him as the dark passenger.So it is all about how to balances his dark passenger with his regular life and pretends to be normal to others.The best part about Dexter is it is consistently good for seven seasons. It is very tough to say my favorite episode because I love all of them and also the characters in it.Anyways something which flashes my mind right now is the last 5 secs of season 4 11th episode, when trinity comes into Miami metro finds Dex with his ID and says ""Hello, Dexter Morgan!!"".. OMG!! For a sec I was Dexter and scarred the s**t out of me...When I heard it season 8 is going to be the last one I feel like I am going to be the last one on earth and have nothing else to do...If you haven't watched it yet, you are doing a sin, TICK TICK TICK this is the sound of your life running out.."
351,"Okay, where do I begin? What you need to know about Dexter is that a boy was found by a police officer and was adopted. The boy saw some things and as he gets older, 10, 12, 14, 16, the police office named Harry Morgan realises that his adoptive son has the characteristics of a serial killer. He knows that he cannot stop it so he gives a code for Dexter (his adoptive son) to follow which is to only kill people who have escaped Justice by committing murder. He is 30 something now and ironically works as a blood-splatter expert for the Miami Metro Police Department. Now, this is beyond amazing; starting with the acting. The acting is excellent in this from Michael C Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, James Remar, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, C.S Lee and Julie Benz. They deliver their roles flawlessly. The writing is seriously impressive because we hear Dexter's thoughts and his inner monolouge is simply interesting and the litreature is so ironic at times but always impressive and just brilliant. This programme is a drama; there is no doubt about it but there are some dark comedic moments and they are pretty funny and reassuring considering we are watching episodes about a person who is addicted to murder. Also, for a programme that deals with murders from serial killers, it is not the gory at all, it is beautifully shot to hide the horror from the actions but still, the super squiemish viewers should not watch this... There's A lot OF BLOOD! Overall, its just brilliantly acted, written, directed, shot and I cannot recommend it enough!"
352,"I've hooked up on this show like three years ago and never stopped watching it. I own all seasons on DVD's and watch one season monthly/weekly (as the time allows me). I've grew up to love characters, story and everything about the show.It has comedy, drama, thrill, mystery and it's very darkish - my taste. I'm kind a surprised actually that the show didn't win Emmy - actually, I was disappointed. I like Mad Man and follow series for a long time, but, honestly, the show is no where near Dexter. Acting is good, plot here and there, but it has nothing that Dexter owns or that Dexter needs to own. But, I guess, not all have the same opinion as I do.Show is addicting from the first episode and it's kind a thrilling to actually enter killer mind, to see how he thinks and how he sees things. The show embarks you on the journey you'd never thought to have : it's thrilling to the last second of episode, humorous, not cheezy at all, without flaws in plot and above all : it's honest.I'm looking forward to Season 6 and hope that show won't stop on that."
353,"Watching ""Dexter"" has been like a treat. The dark, grisly but likable serial killer masquerading as a normal person. A blood spatter analyst with an interesting side-hobby surrounded by other quirky characters such as Deb, Batista and Vince. This culminates in an offbeat, interesting crime thriller unlike any on TV. But, there are a few flaws in the plot, particularly season 5.-SPOILER ALERT- 1. Quinn did not confirm whether Kyle Butler and Dexter were the same person, even though Jonah Mitchell did not give him an answer.2. After seeing the photographs of Dexter and Lumen on the boat, Quinn would have known that Dexter was upto something. Yet when Liddy dies, he does not suspect Dexter of foul play or covering his tracks.3. The other Santa Muerte killer escapes after the shootout at the club and the case is abandoned abruptly."
354,"I got to say im not the biggest horror / drama / cops thing fan. But im always searching for good series so after a friend insisted me to watch this one i gave it a shot. And what a hit. Suspense is unbearable, storyline credible, characters all interesting, all unique, major one Dexter is a complexe mixed up guy, like hollow inside, but always searching for how to be more then he is in others. He is the example how one guy can be so incomplete and at the same time so good on some things, not of course only on killing but Dexter is a very intelligent guy with a high capacity of survival. To love a drama series, we got to love its drama, and i just love it."
355,"I started watching this show and was immediately intrigued by Dexter. He is different and damaged. He truly believes he is not human, and no he not some mythical creature. He is broken, he can not feel emotions because of a traumatizing childhood. I couldn't stop watching because I was so fascinated by his inner thoughts, his hilarious banter with himself on how to ""behave"" like a human. Michael C. Hall is a genius. He plays this character very well. Jennifer Carpenter is another fantastic actress, she really shines in the fourth season but her real down-to-earth, potty mouthed portrayal of Deb is hilarious and real.The first season we learn about Dexter, how he thinks and what he does. He is a blood splatter expert, but he has an unusual hobby. He kills serial killers. He vows not to kill any innocent human being and it is this and his charm that makes him lovable. The second season proves to be better, more intense and more of Dexter trying to lead a normal life while avoiding suspicion. The third season was good, but the best season thus far is the Fourth season. John Lithgow guest stars alongside Dexter and Dexter becomes fascinated with this man because he is just like him, living a double life, and yet he has the ability to lead a normal life. The entire season is filled with intensity and depth and the storyline gets more complicated when Dexter becomes a father and a husband for the first time. The writing and directing of Dexter are above any other show out there, it is smart, fun and they somehow get you to love and feel for this person who is morally corrupt. I never thought I would actually feel sorry for a serial killer. But is he a serial killer, or just someone trying to clean the streets of bad people? You decide!"
356,"Will the real Dexter please stand up!Firstly ladies and Gents I must confess to having a problem...I cant stop watching Dexter!! I don't really know when it grabbed me but it has,and now just refuses to let go.Wow what a concept. Dexter, the hero of the show who by day works for the police forensics dept and by night kills peeps in cold blood. Its not that the idea was thought of that surprises me, its that it made it to our screens! Oh and how lucky we are!Firstly the characters are great, from the quirky foul mouthed babe of a sister to the varying and interesting police characters and of course, Dexter himself. It has a charm I've rarely seen of making you laugh at the most taboo of things. Its narrative is superbly comic and it has the great ability to catch you off guard with violence, humour and nudity. But none of this ever feels like it is being done just for effect. The story evolves seamlessly and justs gets better and better. I cant speak highly enough of this show.All in all a real page turner, if this was a book it would be cover to cover in an hour and a half! Only Sopranos and 24 are its peers, see you for season 5 Dexter!!"
357,"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word."
358,"I think that Dexter is not hilarious, but one of the real face of the Ianus from our soul. Is a good serial and with a great success in Romania. Sorry from my English, i am french speaker native. When i write from Ianus i just think that is the motto of the movie. Every man has secrets, but just a few said to keep it. Once more time, Dexter is a different dimension of the human nature and i don't understand the term hilarious. I watch not a comedy, but a real movie. Dexter must continue! I have read somewhere that all the cats are Grey in the dark. Dexter is just a reflexion in the mirror of that idea. And the real face is covered by a labyrinth."
359,"Repetitive plot. each episode repeats itself. he kills someone and covers it because that's his job.stars were given because he's a good looking actor, plays the part well, and he's a good man in the story. only kills the bad guys."
360,Absolutely love this show. Started rewatch now ready for new season. Hooked once again. Watch it you will not be disappointed
361,"I found the series extremely entertaining. Sure some of the ways Dexter survived were far fetched and difficult to swallow, but overall it kept me watching. I felt strange that I rooted for Dexter's success and even wished i could be like him so not sure what that says about me LOL. The actor did a great job of being fake and showing what appeared like real struggles. I love the fake intro when he is on his boat and give ahoy out to the other captain, its soooooo..Dexter. The Batista character is awesome and a a guy you would want and enjoy as your friend and coworker. However the real brilliance of the show for me was that actress that played Deb Morgan. I looked forward to seeing her and it felt like I was a school boy and I had a crush on her. I was so intrigued every time her face showed up on my flat screen, maybe I was even giddy..I truly wish I had a girlfriend like her. I am not big on cussing and using offending words, but if she was my girl I wouldn't want her to change one bit and she made the Deb Morgan lexicon seem like true grit. Deb Morgan was was just such a fun character for me and the actress will forever by in my tops of all times."
362,"Yes! Stop the never ending search for the next great series. After 14 years it stands up strong. If you saw it years ago on Cinemax, you'll know what happens in general but it's still well worth another view. If you've never seen it, it's a must see."
363,"I am really enjoying the show, I am currently on season 4, I like the acting writing and characters, I never liked Rita and yes I do already know what happens"
364,"Dexter always had problems with connections and emotions. I think that they did a good job of showing that he had a code that was more stringent than the justice system. Instead of using laws that may or may not be fair to the public her used a moral system to decide what to do.Sure if you are a person against the death penalty you will not like this show. If you are a person that is for the death penalty or get upset when you head a criminal getting off due to a technicality then you will root for Dexter.I am kind of torn on the ending for Dexter. I think they should have either let him die in the storm or join back up with Hannah and Harrison. Even with the death of his sister he knew that he had reached a new plateau with his feelings and had more control of things.I was hoping for a reboot or spin-off but as we see it's not going to happen. I do not like reboots many years down the road because you lose the writers and actors that made the show what it was. Plus, since he did not hook back up with his son that would be a nagging point to continue him as a new person with no family. I just re-watched the show again to refresh my memory of it.One of my biggest complaints was his sister Deb. They kept referring to her as a good cop/detective but in reality she was horrible and it was her brother that made her look good. Having someone give you the answers does not make you good at your job. And then somehow they thought it made sense to make her in charge of the department? Sure, she got a little better but nowhere near how they were trying to make her seem."
365,"I enjoy the show and find myself rooting for a serial killer because I can see the justification Dexter uses in each ""kill"" and I think the creators did a really good job creating the morbidity that needed to be seen to show that the killings though justified in Dexters eyes are still gruesome.. One character I don't like is Dexters obnoxiously overbearing sister who is so shallow and helpless that she will sleep with anyone willing to smile at her and I find myself fast forwarding through scenes she's involved in.."
366,Dexter is a man who going through the problem of adjusting his two worlds at the same time. He losses people he care about always.
367,"I couldn't do anything while I was watching this.
The story is very strong, all the rules played in their best possible way."
368,"I just started watching from S1 ep 1 a few weeks ago. I never watched it back when it was airing originally.
I have just finished Season 3. I was completely surprised as I thought Quinn would end up being the Slicer.
So far, this a really good series."
369,"I got connection with the story so deep first time. Feel sad about about the end of debra. I don't like it. But its perfect for the story.
Thanks to all of the crew for this tv series."
370,"I'm so glad I met Dexter. Every morning I was up one hour early to watch and enjoy. His journey, which he started as insensitive, ended in deep feelings. I think the rating should be higher, Dexter deserves better. love you dex."
371,"""Remember the Monsters?"" was the last episode for this TV Show.
It's a 9 stars series but for that end.. Lumberjack?"
372,"The series is pretty engaging but has a few minor inconsistencies ( for which I'm reducing two stars ) .Dexter's method of injecting people in the neck while they don't react is poorly done ( they just stand like flaccid dummies with their arms at their sides ) Normal people will flinch violently even for mosquito bites, let alone someone pricking their necks.Season 2 - The casual spinal dose he gave a standing Lila before killing her -absolutely impossible - ask any anaesthesiologist .Season 5 - The foulest thing he ever did was to kill Stan Liddy - who didn't meet the hallowed "" code "" of Harry . Dexter didn't even hesitate to plan to kill Joseph Quinn ( just before Liddy captured Dexter ) - Quinn didn't meet the code either ( Neither did the foul mouthed redneck , he murdered on the day of Rita's funeral - plain blood-lust . That foul redneck didn't even attack him - so Dexter killing him wasn't even self-defence... so much for the ' code ' .. )Season 4 - during the raid on Trinity's house - Dexter steps out of a coffin in the garage while the garage door is being opened - it wasn't convincing that none of the raiding team found it suspicious as to how he was already inside , even before the door was opened. Even his sister didn't spot that . ( And do unarmed forensic techs accompany armed raiding teams & go inside with them spontaneously ? ) This was even more unbelievable than him pointing out Dan the dentist's body to Debra & Masuka as if he'd just arrived at the scene ( it was puzzling how a cop & a forensic guy were at the scene before a crime or a body was even found or reported ) Funny .The cops trying to get sketches of Kyle Butler from Arthur Mitchell's family was odd too - couldn't the Mitchell family just point out the guy who was present in the same house during the raid ?Season 5 - Dexter stabs Jordan Chase's foot with a knife . His stolen red car flipped just before that - when he gathered his bearings - Jordan Chase was already aiming a gun at him - when did Dexter open his kit & slip a knife out ? When the car was in mid-flip ? When Chase pushed him down the stairs - Dexter's hands are clearly seen tied behind his back - he's not holding a knife . Even if he was concealing one - he would've injured himself when he was pushed downstairs. Chase had the tool kit.Quinn , who was so instinctive , correlating Kyle Butler with Dexter - didn't react to the highly incriminating evidence Stan Liddy was practically shoving under his nose day after day ? What happened - did Quinn suddenly inhale chloroform ? weed ? get a lobotomy ? forget being a cop ?Quinn knew that Liddy was investigating Dexter - when Liddy was horribly murdered - who did Quinn think had murdered poor Liddy ?!!With no evidence he could instinctively link Dexter & Kyle Butler & Rita's murder - but he wouldn't link Dexter to Liddy's murderer - & instead just nervously deleted Liddy's calls from his cell-phone - unbelievable .Season 6 - In the first episode Dexter attends his 20th high school reunion to implicate his classmate Joe of his wife Janet's death 3 yrs earlier . Dexter obtains Joe's DNA by elbowing his nose during a rugby game & finds a match for it in the database against the DNA from the blood found under Janet's fingernails - this is incomprehensible - the Virginia police handling the case couldn't find a match for the blood under the victim's nails against the victim's own husband for 3 yrs ? Lame ..."
373,This show blew my mind. It breaks the mold in the television industry and is absolutely incredible. It never follows any cliches and is always completely enthralling and unpredictable. The writing and the acting through and through was absolutely remarkable. It finds a way for you to feel and almost root for a serial killer. Yes a serial killer no less. It's packed with so many twists and very emotional stakes even when he has no emotions. Which even questions that. Season after season it has you wanting more and taking turns you didn't think would happen. The acting is amazing. Michael C. Hall is absolutely captivating and perfectly embodies the character. One of the best shows out there. Very graphic at times but I strongly recommend.
374,"It's a binge-worthy series that ultimately loses its momentum through the series. I feel like each season was trying to better the next and failed. Either way, worth the watch"
375,"I love it .. it's one of my best
Dexter Morgan was awesome specially his son but i can't understand how he trusted Hana and let Harrison with her to protect him .. she is also a killer .. 
Death of Dep was so hard to be accepted .."
376,"Loved every single episode , but it does finish at the right time as I believed the story had run its course,"
377,"Dexter is the best show I ever seen. The capability of Dexter and his behavior of acting calm and making fools to people is just great. And his love for his friends,famliy and work is just great and his ability to handle his both personalities of serial killer and normal man is just awesome"
378,"Insane! One of The best TV Shows
Every Season is incedible!!!"
379,"If there was any possibility,I'd rather rate it 20 instead of 10! Hundred times.love it"
380,"The Netflix series Dexter is the type of show that might not be for everyone. Dexter Morgan, Miami Metro Police Department blood splatter analysts, does not live a simple life. On paper Dexter just seems like any other homicide detective, but little does everyone know, he himself has a lust for killing those who may ""deserve"" it.I really enjoyed this series because of the intriguing story line. If you are looking to watch this show, you may be easily disturbed. Full of blood and mystery, Dexter is a show that will not put you to sleep.If you are looking for a good murder/mystery, I would definitely recommend the Netflix series Dexter."
381,"Dexter is full of gore, laughs, and you just want it to keep on goin'."
382,"All episodes Dexter was fighting with himself and in the end ""dark passenger"" won the battle. Debra was the light in his life because she was the only one person who believed he had something good and he was not a beast, she loved him and also for Dexter Debra was a good person. So she was the light in the darkness."
383,"Dexter is one of those unique shows that grabs your attention from the second it starts and holds it all the way until the end. Michael C. Hall gives an incredible performance as Dexter, the serial killer that kills serial killers. Firstly, the fact that Hall is able to not only make Dexter such a likeable character, but also make us wish him well in his serial killer adventures, is a testament to his performance and to the talents of those who had a hand in the shows creation.Dexter is the story of a serial killer who dishes out his own form of justice with a set of rules (the code) and the council of his deceased adoptive father, Harry Morgan. In the beginning Dexter is quite detached and in his own head, but as the seasons progress the viewers are gifted with more that leads us to realise that their is more to this character than we first thought. He has a depth and feel about him that causes us to sympathise with him, even if we don't agree with everything he is doing. I will say though that the season finale in my opinion did not do the characters justice, nor did they reward the viewers dedication to the show. The way Dexter ended was nothing short of tragic for me, and seemed as though the writers just gave up on the characters, the show, and the story. The 8 season build up of Dexter, the character progression and story development all seemed as though they were heading to one place, but were disregarded and thrown away at the last minute. This was one of the first TV shows that I watched that introduced me to the concept that things don't always end well for the characters we love.The reason I give Dexter such a high rating is not due to the way it ended, but to the impact it had on my emotions during my time watching it. The way this emotional roller coaster of a show made me feel is why I respect it. I can empathise with the main characters ending decisions, but felt it was abrupt and rushed, unlike the seasons before it. However, this is just my opinion. If I was asked whether or not I would recommend this show to someone, I would definitely tell them that it's worth a watch.Overall, Dexter was an emotional roller coaster of a show and I am glad that I was able to go on that journey with the characters and fellow Dexter fans."
384,"Just before I begin I wanna say that I will try to keep this review spoiler free. I know how much spoilers suck. Also, I haven't seen al the seasons. So everytime I finish one of the season, THEN I will review it. As for now I have only seen 2 seasons:SEASON 1: 10/10
A lot of people kept requesting me to watch this show. I was always skeptical to start because of the wavy pattern the show's quality seems to be portraying. But when I finally started it I was hooked. It was great to see Dexter having numurous storylines, storytelling methods and character development. My favorite part of this seasons was getting to know Dexter's origin and the villain. I have read a lot of reviews and this season's villain seems to be one of the best. Also the writing, pacing and acting were spot on. Great great great season and start of the series!SEASON 2: 10/10 (yes, again)
This season is quite different from season 1. The story is basically one long 
stretch of suspense with one burning question everyone has: ''Will Dexter be caught?"". I also liked the storyline between Lila and Dexter. A continuous wave of ups and down both with Lila and Rita. I really don't know what I can say more without spoiling a lot since I already kinda did by referencing the Lila hookup. A lot of fans would rate this a little ''worse'' than season 1, but I personlly think they're even. They took a risk with choosing this path and they did it without skipping a beat. Again, the writing, story and definitly acting were brilliant (especially from Doakes, Dex, Deb and Lila).SEASON 3: No Rating Yet
I have only seen 1/12 episodes. I will review this season when I'll finish it."
385,Love everything about it except for the ending. Love all characters too
386,"Fighting fire with fire through vigilantism is nothing new for Hollywood. Whether it's Charles Bronson's well known Paul Kersey in ""Death Wish"" or a lesser known John Eastland, better known as ""The Exterminator"" played by Robert Ginty, vigilantes have been good platforms for an intriguing story of people seeking justice on their own when the system fails to do so.Then there's Dexter Morgan! Rather than using guns and explosives to carry out his instant justice, he uses his smarts and sharp tools in a ""Sick-f*** Ritual"" (mentioned by one of the characters) to take out dangerous criminals.What made Dexter appealing wasn't his killing of criminals, but how the character strove to live a normal life while he carried out his ""dark"" extra curricular activity. He uses his rewarding forensics career to his advantage to get these dangerous criminals; he tries to have a normal social life; has a beautiful girlfriend whom he eventually marries; he meets people who find out and understand his ""activity"" and keep it secret; he tries successfully and otherwise to cover his deeds.Unlike the Kersey or Eastland characters of yesteryear, Dexter Morgan isn't necessarily driven by revenge and makes these killings the center of his life as again, he tries to live a normal one. He has a code set forth by his late adoptive father who shows up in his mind (played very well by James Remar).As the show goes on, we see how Dexter's ""Dark Passenger"" (as he coins it) affects his life and the people around him---his colleagues and family---to a tragic conclusion.The creators of the show and the excellent performance of Michael C. Hall developed the title role over eight seasons and never failed to disappoint. There was nothing mundane about the Dexter character compared to other characters in other works who took the law into their own hands.It will be hard to top a vigilante character like Dexter as his wasn't so cliché'd like past ones."
387,"Great Seasons but Ending was somewhat disappointing. MC Hall's acting is fluid and flawless throughout and I wish, we could see more of him. All the character were so real and of daily life that they were felt, as if alive and one can go to and meet them. Amazing impact on TV audience, which kept people asking for more and provided a hug fan base and following. Hope that Showtime will be planning to start a new season? As fans would love it. Thank you."
388,"This is the greatest series that I've ever seen. I think I can watch it again, again and again... Most of my friends didn't even watch the series .d Some parts were a little bit boring (Especially third season) but the series was generally awesome. The Final wasn't good enough but I think the show is not over yet .d"
389,Dexter is great show and one I did not watch for years because I disliked it's premise and could not imagine how it could work. When I finally got around to watching it I was surprised how good it was and how the writers could actually make you root for a serial killer. The humour is one of the ways it softens the horror and the acting is first class. Using an entire series to tell one main story arc was also I think something of a first and it works well. Unfortunately the quality and believability begins to tail off after the 5th series and the hit you over the head anti Christian propaganda begins to become so obvious that it becomes a theme and is as boring as a fundamentalist atheist. But overall it is definitely worth watching.
390,"warning spoiler don't read last lines if you didn't watch Dexter one best crime TV shows i ever seen the plot is very different were the serial killer is the killer who kills other serial killers Micheal C hall who is Dexter character played very well and i became fan of him some episodes are highly thrilling and this show has great twists and turns and the best season are 1,2,4 and 7 negative things to be said about this show is the plot gets repeated and due to repeated plot .the seasons like 3,5 ,6 gets boring i wish the director should have made new plots to make it interesting and season 8 is watchable and i was hopping the ending would be better but it turned out be worst because of Debra death and abandoning his sons and i think if Dexter died at final episode would have been better"
391,"Dexter is a slow slide from a cool, collected, and enthralling start, to a moralizing, idiotic, and predictable end. OH! Dexter has been the ruination of everyone he ever stayed with, and his sins have found him out! Nevermind the fact that every death in the show is the person's own fault, or is caused by Dexter having too much humanity or caring too much, and everyone he killed irrefutably deserved it. The Dexter in the show compared to the one in the books is a lobotomized and declawed cat. The one in the books is calm, collected, and crazy (and obsessed with alliteration... in the books he tortures his victims to death with a knife not just stab them, which the rapists and murderers still totally deserve). In the books he is trapped by only the most clever or absurd issues but in the show he stumbles from mistake to human mistake. Book dexter is a hero from a Greek tragedy running towards his destiny, an avenging angel stalking through the night of the knife, making wrong into right, something both more and less than human, filled with the presence of a dark god(literally), a wolf in sheeps clothing; vs. a ummm guy with a needle and hallucinations running headlong into his own demise through the idiotic choices of literally everyone (especially the people who made the show), and especially through his sister's hopeless inability to accept the fact the brother she knows and loves kills murderers. In the books she was mostly fine with it by the end of the first book she was sitting next to dexter at laguertas funeral and punching him in the sholder despite the fact that she new everything and brian moser had just gutted Laguerta in front of her like a fish. Just another TV show that could have been so much betterPoint is the books are better in every way, whether yore in it for the gore or the lore."
392,"At the start I was hooked. Great storyline a lot of different angles the whole time and ending you could not guess. But, going further and further in this Series it can be a bit all of the same. the story changes but the outcome stays the same. I missed the thrill a bit when going further in the Season. There where in the first Seasons I had the Excitement and really stayed home to watch. At the end I got the feeling I already knew and saw it all.Don't get me wrong since I am in full understanding that Its really hard to make a series that actually maintain a certain ""you need to see the next episode"" feeling. But in my eyes after X Seasons there was not much outcome change.Over all I want to give it at least an 8 because Dexter deserves it."
393,"I have been watching TV shows for a while now but I would always skip over this title thinking there is no way anyone can make a serial killer look good. But once I gave it a chance, I loved it.Dexter shouldn't change your perception about his colleagues as a whole but he sure does paint a vivid picture of what a domestic and workplace quagmire his life becomes. It's sort of like Breaking Bad with the anti-hero being a serial killer than a drug kingpin.The plot is thick and has lots of twists that keep you going. The ending is perfect and it should not have gone any other way. In fact the for me, the ending tops it all. All in all, a perfectly written and executed TV show."
394,"Now this was a show I didn't believe was made, so sickening and grotesque but so artful and meaningful. Because if you wonder about all those rich(or poor) men or women that have gotten away with the worst things, don't they need some sort of ""PAINMENT""? That's what we have here with a Blood CSI agent who has a knack to kill or more like an addiction but it's to very bad people. Which makes things so intense especially when bodies start piling and you work for the police."
395,Fantastic show from the start. Every episode full of tension. I thought the final season was marginally weaker than the rest which is why it only gets 9 out of 10 but really good stuff. Great characters throughout. I remember first watching this and having to wait a week between episodes and then months between seasons! The other characters are so watchable that they could each easily have a spin off show.
396,"Just finished watching Dexter on Netflix and it rates in one of my Top 5 ever TV series. I wasn't too disappointed with the ending because the whole series seems to lead to this ending and it could allow more to be made. Dexter is a fantastic diverse character and the casting of him and the other characters bar one or two is perfect. I found the characters of Jamie and Elway to be really annoying. There are a few technical inconsistencies and questions about certain aspects of life and how people act and respond in situations that can be raised throughout but the overall story arc and series is brilliant and enough you can overlook things. Occasionally you'll find yourself saying ""would that really happen in real life"" but there's a good mixture of drama, comedy and crime fighting here! The character of Dexter is essentially a madman or psychopath but the show gets you to like him and feel his pain and anguish when things go wrong but share in the joy when it goes well for him. Some people will view Dexter as the person he is where as others will love him, which is why the show is so well written.The acting and chemistry between his on screen sister played by Jennifer Carpenter is excellent and both the main characters are cast well. The support cast are very good and there's some good cameos by big actors throughout the series. It's hard to write a review without giving spoilers away."
397,"-Contains light spoilers- Great series, good and complex ""villain"" as the main character for a change who makes you sympathize or even empathize with him (a bit like Death Note's Yagami Light(o), Japanese Manga/Anime/films).Dexter's journey takes some interesting turns each season and episodes are rarely boring with a few exceptions. His obsessive compulsions/cravings to kill take turns for the worse to (depending on other circumstances in his life) completely gone.Some key characters he meets along the way have nice personalities, smart nemesis's, long lost relatives and the truth about himself and his childhood traumas and there are and even a few who knows his secret along the way.. and his father conjured in his mind through his pathology talking to him and trying to get him to follow the ""code"" he taught him to not get caught as well as a way to justify his existence and not being a complete monster which arguably might be the case too.Fair warning as this paragraph describes my opinion about the ending of the series but I'm not revealing how it ends... The ending of the series sucked imho to the point making me almost wishing I hadn't watched the entire series, enough said.. could easily have been great, what a shame."
398,"This is in regards to the character of Debra Morgan. Just my opinion. This is the most unlikeable, foul mouthed, nasty, gross, unprofessional, self involved, sleazy, pathetic excuse for a female (and I use that term lightly) that I have ever had the unfortunate opportunity to view on any show. Every other word out of her mouth is a profanity. The writers certainly missed the mark with this one. A female can do an excellent job and be in positions of authority without having to talk in such a profane, nasty foul mouthed way. They did an injustice to the character and certainly TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE by writing this kind of dialogue for this female character. None of the male characters talk in such a profane and disgusting way. Shame on the writers and producers of this otherwise great show. After the first season I dreaded her scenes and only stuck with it because of the rest of the characters and the other great actors and actresses. The character was completely irredeemable and unlikeable. I now don't like the actress who played her either. Goodness--and please cut that stringy hair!!!"
399,"I just watched the final episode of this great series last night (31/01/2016), after having watched the 2nd last episode that afternoon. Later I'll briefly discuss the finale but without giving too much away.""Dexter"" is the story of a a serial killer (i.e. Dexter Morgan) who works for...the Miami Police Department! Being a psychopath, he must try and fit in with society so as not to arouse suspicion in others. That being said, the series does have humour going for it, as Dexter often appears a fish out of water just trying to appear normal! Even though humour is a part of this series, there is quite a bit of gore in this show, especially in the final series.If the prospect of watching a TV series about a serial killer doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I'd say that the concept is more involving than it sounds. Think of it like this...if you watch a nature documentary about gazelles and you see a lioness stalking it, you despise the predator. However, if you watch a nature documentary about lions and you're informed that there is a drought and the lion cubs will die soon without a meal, you root for the lioness' hunt. It's all about perspective and the story's point of view.The TV series is based on at least one book in the series by Jeff Lindsay. ""Dexter""'s opening titles give a credit to the first in that series, ""Darkly dreaming Dexter"", although I'm not sure how many more are drawn on for the TV series. Without having read the books and having just now glanced at some of the Wikipedia entries for these books, it seems that there is a degree of divergence in the history of the character. I didn't know that there were so many books in this series but I am now interested in reading them, especially after the finale of the TV series. That being said, having looked at the Wikipedia entry for the last book, I'm not sure that I'd like the resolution to the character's story in the book either.Anyway, back to the TV series. It's filled with flawed characters who you care for, even though some of them have done bad things.Having started watching this series on commercial TV, I have to say that the first series struck me as being a bit wooden...my memory is foggy, so perhaps I had in mind things like the acting or script. It would have been a chore to have had to watch episodes back-to-back at that time. For some reason I bought series 5 on DVD...perhaps because I missed recording it on the TV or maybe it didn't have closed captions. I'd say that I missed the start of series 7 on TV or perhaps it had no closed captions, so I bought it on Blu-ray. Series 7 was the pinnacle of this show, in my opinion, and watched episodes back-to-back at times or one consecutive days. My experience is that I can only do that with quality television, not B shows (i.e. B grade).The thing that made the 7th series the best was just the choices that Dexter had to make...choices that redefined him. Let's not forget the principle villain of that series either...the relationship which Dexter forged with him was unlike anything else in the series.Now for the final episode: scriptwriters have a tough job when it comes to ending a series. It's not easy to get it right. I'm not sure that ""House"" nailed its finale. ""Weeds"" had a benign ending. ""Breaking bad"" had a logical finale which I had no problem with. I'm not sure that ""Dexter"" got it right. It is actually haunting me though, which all good dramatic art should do. There are a lot of ""What if...?"" questions in my mind...like there were for that terrific Australian movie ""Summerfield"", which I reviewed here and is well worth viewing for fans of Dexter. It would be fascinating to know what scenarios the scriptwriters had for the finale...a pity I can't ""choose your own adventure""!Actually, that final series threw everything (including the kitchen sink) into the mix. Everything seemed a little rushed. The finale too, has a lot plates spinning in the air, so to speak. Dexter makes a series a choices. It doesn't seem to me that he made the right ones. He is not redeemed at the series, which would be nice. Or at least it's a very flawed sort of redemption. Perhaps this character's story is driven by an equivalent sort of logic as that for homosexual characters in popular culture many decades ago, i.e. a small number of possible outcomes. The choices that Dexter makes which has an impact on others seem poor ones, e.g. for Heather and Harrison.Then there is that final shot in the finale...I wonder if that was the scenario that Dexter was striving to achieve just a few minutes earlier in the episode...was that his plan all along? Or was it an accident?Finally, amongst the ""buzz"" TV series in recent years, I have to say that I've liked ""Dexter"" the best, of the ones that I've seen right through to the end. Liked it more than ""Breaking bad"". It was an interesting journey with him. I would have scored this 10/10 if it had ticked all the boxes that I was hoping for...something more approaching a Jane Austen ending than a Thomas Hardy (in a mood) ending."
400,"Just watched the whole series in a week as I never had Showtime. Ended up binge watching as for me, it was like a good book you couldn't put down. Shows a lot of sides of emotion, non-emotion, and even some comedy. I was put off a bit by the language...a little over done, which cost a star. I also was disappointed by the ending. I understood it if he wanted to off himself and in reality, no one would survive driving a boat into a hurricane as he did. Left the biggest question I had of the whole series...how did he? I would have liked to see him reunite with Hannah and Harrison and start a new chapter of his life. That cost another star."
401,"First of all, I know that there is books and so I'm well aware of how the real story looks like so that's just a simple opinion not an eulogy or a destruction. I want to start with the good point.To begin with, let just say that the concept his really good, following a serial killer that work with the police, seeing how he is killing, the back story with the fact that his mother die in front of him, it's really good, I won't speak to much about the story only that in the global, it's good.Furthermore, The actor playing his great, the actor are well chosen, the personalities are really good, the characters are appealing and some of the family story are funny to follow. The character of Dexter is not the only one that his great but let's be honest, it's not just because it's the principal, he is the best.Now, let's go with the bad, starting with the end of season four and I talk about it with knowledge of the book, it's real bullshit, they used scenaristic shortcut and because of that the Rita's Character died without scenaristic justification, the sequel of the series would have not change that much without her death so to me it's just non sense but you know we can't rewrite it so I accept it and so it' going from the first place to the third place of my favorite TV Show. After all, at least, even if the death of Rita his a shortcut that make his dead a non sense, the following of the TV show is Coherent.The Biggest problem is the season 8 that is just incoherent, first of all, something that doesn't exist in the book is debra's death which is useless, the series could have and without it and the most WTF of all is the Doctor Vogel which come out of nowhere and said that she maid the code... Bullshit !!! Why, the series where going just fine even after the end of season 4 so why did they made an incoherent season 8, I watched it and honestly is just non sense follow with non sense, it's lame on the scenaristic side and on the characters evolution side. This season has no reason to exist, in the book, Dexter Morgan doesn't end well either but at least, is coherent, logic and it has sense, this season 8 is just... WTF, in comparison it's like if J.R.R Tolkien had decided to kill Aragorn in the 2nde book for... No reason at all, I don't said that Dexter's ""death"" is wrong just that the justification for it is bullshit. The way this last season has been made his like if Leonardo Da Vinci had not finish : ""La Joconde"". For me, Dexter is a freaking peace of art unfinished."
402,"i think in the season 2 Debra and the other officers and detectives at least should ask themselves that why the bay harbor butcher kills in the same way that in season 1 the ice truck killer does to Debra in the last episode. even in season 2 Frank Lundy emphasize to Masuka that the bay harbor butcher only use straps for killing. in episode 12 of season 1 the ice truck killer used the Dexter's , the bay harbor butcher's , way for preparing Debra and when Dexter refused to kill her , they struggled with each other and suddenly the police came to crime scene and the ice truck killer ran away. then every one came in to the room and saw Debra tight in straps. so in season 2 why nobody noticed the similarity between the Debra's crime scene and bay harbor butcher's crime scene? why really?"
403,"i don't know how people see these things i cant't even call it a TV show i don't remember a single time watching this thing without falling asleep over my laptop. no action no drama no comedy the music is awful (if there is one in one season) even the cast, there is no one i can even think is pretty i actually can not mention a single good thing how do you people stand it ? thank god i can realize how bad this is. its just some boring guy who furls his eyebrows people. honestly this show is for paeans, the upper crust under educated or slightly educated( i blame our school systems) looking for something that makes them feel edgy and unique example: bunch of coffee and cigarette fags sitting in a diner "" hey do you see dexter furl his brow last night?"" ""oh yeah he furled me a good one"" "" rabble rabble rabble"". basically the smart kids in school who managed to get very good grades is who watches this, they may have gotten straight a's but by no means are they smart. people like Einstein, Tesla, Edison all would have scoffed at this."
404,"Warning...Spoilers...Seasons 6-8 kind of sucked. What would have been an excellent 5-6 season series, gets totally ruined by stretching it out to 8. Don't know if the writers got replaced or they just ran out of ideas, but the writing really stared to suffer after RIta was killed off. And, although I liked season 5, plot holes became more and more frequent and far too obvious.What really was disappointing was the total destruction of Dexter and Deb's characters. Dexter became a lot less likable when he planned to kill Lt LaGuerta, braking his own code. Also, his relationship with Hanna was quite annoying. I'm sorry, but Hanna was not a likable character. At most annoying of all was turning Debra into a murder and then killing her off in the end. That was just down right awful. I won't even go into how Dexter abandons his son and step children. What would Rita think. Boo.... Dexter writers....Boo!!!The finale would have been a little less annoying, if Dexter died instead of Deb.This is how the series should have played out...Season 1: The Ice Truck Killer Season 2: Lumen ( Dexter maybe cheats on Rita ) Season 3: Trinity killer ( Rita Survives ) Season 4: Lila ( Doakes at least makes it to season 4 ) Season 5: Jimmy Smits Rita and Dexter get married, and Dexter loses his Dark Passenger. The End of a great TV series.Alternative Season 6: Lt LaGuerta or maybe even Doakes (Never should have killed him off) hunts down Dexter and arrests him. Dexter goes to mental institution where he belongs and gets the help he so obviously needs. The End :)"
405,"The first time I saw ""Dexter"" I didn't know what hit me. There was not one show that even came close to it. Each episode was more thrilling than the next,full of bizarre twists and comic relief. Only the ending of this first season was a bit off in comparison to the previous episodes. But still as a whole this show was simply amazing. After being introduced to the first season of Dexter I never could have imagined that the second season even would surpass the first. This second season shows the aftermath of the previous season concerning the Ice Truck killer. Debs (Dexter's sister)is a mess. And Dexter has to pretend that he is a coke addict in order to account for his strange behavior that Rita (his girlfriend) has noticed. In the rehab clinic he meets his savior and his doom at the same time. A woman called Lila. To make matters even worse is that the police found the bodies Dexter dumped in the Bay Harbor. Soon it becomes apparent that ""The Bay harbor Butcher"" is even worse than ""The Ice Truck killer"". With the police on his tail he has to control his urges and watch his every move. From start to finish it is a joy to see what Dexter is up to and how he handles matters. And this time the mix of comedy and thrilling moments is just perfect. It is actually hard to admit. But even when you know that Dexter is a serious psycho killer you do care for the guy. That credit has to go the excellent Michael C. Hall in the first place. An then of course the clever writing. Without spoiling the plot I honestly can say that the conclusion of the second season is much better than the first and certainly more satisfying. It will make you ask for more. And it has not been confirmed yet,but I do hope Dexter will return for a third season. If there is one show that is entitled to than it is ""Dexter"". Since this show is becoming better by the minute!"
406,"When I heard about this show I wasn't sure that it would work - the subject sounded a bit unlikely, but make no mistake it does.Dexter is the resident blood-splatter expert in the Miami police forensics department. Likable with a dry sense of humour he goes about his day investigating crime scenes but unlike his co-workers Dexter has a secret...he also just happens to be a psychopath with a compulsion to kill.The only other person to knows Dexter's real identity is his adopted dad ""Harry"". Harry knows from an early age about Dexter's urge to kill and he secretly schools him in ways to control it. He learns to mask his lack of emotion so he can appear normal and generally fit in with the rest of the world. With Harry's help Dexter manages to channel his urge in a positive way by only going after criminals that somehow managed to beat the system. This vigilante mission might still seem morally questionable but with clever writing and well developed characters it never seems to matter. You can't help liking Dexter regardless.The main storyline in season one involves a serial killer dubbed ""The Ice Truck Killer"". His victims are unique in that they are neatly dismembered and their corpses are totally devoid of blood. It soon becomes apparent to Dexter that this is no ordinary case as the killer seems to have intimate knowledge of Dexter and his dark secret and that these killings are in some way directed at him personally. This develops into a private game of cat and mouse between the two, while the main investigation carries on around them unaware (Dexter's sister is one of the cops taking a lead role in the investigation).Despite the amiable facade he puts on for his co-workers Dexter is by his own admission no more than an empty shell of a person, devoid of human feelings. We find out that this is not really the case at all and although they are pretty deeply repressed he does have the same emotions we all have. This is the main reason why this show works. Dexter's struggle to convincingly interact on an emotional level with others (in particular his girlfriend)and all the difficult real life situations that life throws up is perfectly handled.Everything about Dexter works, Michael C Hall is perfect for the lead and the rest of the cast are equally as good. The feel of the show is just right as it mixes darkness and some pretty graphic scenes with a sophisticated sense of humour that runs throughout.I don't know why one of the bigger channels in the UK hasn't picked this show up yet (its only shown on an obscure cable channel) as it really is top drawer. Maybe the shows premise is a too hard a sell. Anyway its a shame if you miss Dexter as its the best television you'll see."
407,"The first thing that caught my eye about this show was that every episode has a lot going on. There is never a filler episode like CSI: or 24 does. Not only that, but to have no commercials for a whole hours really helps to make the show more enjoy able.Amazing how well it follows the book too. But I would have to say the show ends a little better, but the books make you laugh as mush as the show so everyone show check them out too.In short, great show that always has you guessing, a must check out!!If you love CSI:, 24, or anything else of that nature and want to see them be blown out of the water? Than check out Dexter you wont be disappointed."
408,"This is a great show. None of the multiple ""out of the hat"" twists and turns of very convolute counterparts (Lost, 24, Heroes). You get the sense that the show The show has enough side-plots to keep you interested and a very consistent center line.Some great acting from Michael C. Hall and cast.The plot follows the story of a ""slightly more than most"" disturbed individual. He takes taking lives very seriously. Everything he goes through seems to happen to someone else but in a very vivid and compelling way. As he gets more detached you as a viewer get more taken into the show. None of that feeling you sometimes get when you watch something and you half expect someone to yell ""CUT!!!""Moreover the show does not seem to have that annoying feature more and more shows have today: The ""lucky coincidence"" the ""providential factor"". Although you can tell that the main character is going to pull through, the show manages to transmit the tension off the screen.As the show (the first season anyway) ended it left the viewer both with a feeling of closure and a feeling of excitement for the next installment. In that respect it is somewhat like 24, only less intricate and a lot more dramatic. At some point when watching a very long show you stop enjoying the show and start just wandering what the script will be like the next time around. I recommend the show and hope that the writers have prepared a hole new treat for us this time aroundGreat job everybody"
409,"I barely watch much television at all because I find pretty much all the stuff that is on to be boring. I almost didn't even watch Dexter but there was nothing else to do; good thing too. This show has it all... suspense, a great plot, and many surprises throughout. Most shows and even movies are all too predictable. Dexter however, although sometimes predictable like all other shows and movies, did in fact fool me maybe once or twice which is certainly better than the amount of times any other show has... zero. The show doesn't just offer surprises, it also offers a new plot unlike any other show which is incredibly interesting. The first season is carried entirely by Michael C. Hall who plays Dexter Morgan with very little help of any other great acting except for perhaps Julie Benz who plays Rita Bennett. Dexter however plays a role not often played in shows or movies and acts brilliantly to portray an obvious separation and misunderstanding of the world because of his ""condition"" (not to spoil). His acting is bland, but much to the calling of the role, because he in fact sees the world in an indifferent light. But perhaps the blandness is the most intriguing part of his acting, because although many might say that it isn't acting I would beg to differ. Humans live off emotions and for an actor to act an emotion is pretty natural to say the least. But Dexter is instead presenting a sort of indifference, brilliant... for this is not an emotion many people possess on such a scale to so many issues. The narration is also very well done, narrated by Dexter himself in order to give the viewer a look inside his mind that none of his acquaintances see.Many might think the show is too weird, perhaps that is why I believe it to be so interesting. But in order to shorten this comment, readers should just watch a few episodes for themselves and give more comments for others interested in this show."
410,"Just finished season one in a two day 4 hour marathon. Michael Hall is great as Dexter and the supporting cast seems very real with little stereotyping.Show is in the same vein as other HBO/Showtime 1 hour dramas, sharp adult writing, appropriate violence and sex, and little pandering.Spoiler Alert: This season's arc worked on many levels, especially the way it showed us how Dexter became Dexter, the combination of flashbacks and the twist ending.Showtime has renewed the series for a second season (due late fall) and I wonder how they will carry the show since the first season was focused on one killer, The Ice Truck Killer, and his relationship with Dexter. I can't see Dexter marring his girlfriend, but I suspect their relationship will be a key initial topic."
411,"I've read Jeff Lindsay's book,and i Have thought it was great,until I saw the first two episodes of Dexter.I got addicted!this is by far the best show ever on TV.The cast is perfect,Michael C.Hall is a perfect dexter,his expressions are just the way I imagined Dexter. I have to tell everyone who reads this,don't get the first impression from the first episode,it may seem a little violent, a torture like series, and it doesn't have anything to do with this. The TV show is intelligent writing,intelligent acting,and directed to intelligent people. It's about a ""robbin'hood-a-like"" serial killer,Dexter,who is a forensic blood expert in day life,that only kills the bad guys.A killer with standards. Dexter's character it's a socialite analyzer!And makes us all feel weird for liking him. It has it all,drama,comedy,action,suspense...I saw the last episode today,and I can't barely wait to see next season in the summer,and buy all the DVD pack. If you like to get surprised,dark humour,and superb directing,than Dexter is the TV show I strongly advice! I registered in IMDb just for sharing my opinion,cause,this is going to be an Emmy winner!Looking forward to hear other feedbacks,Good Episodes!"
412,"I love this Dexter Series, I am now on season 2 and it feels awesome watching Dexter without hearing Rita's voice , I am glad they broke up, But then they got back again and now pissed again hahah YOU ARE SOOO ANNOYING RITA, glad you died in season 4 😂"
413,It's a good story. The black detective is the most annoying character ever and he sucks balls as an actor
414,"Despite all the rave reviews, DEXTER proves to be quite a disappointing series, failing to delve into the mind of a serial killer in an in-depth, challenging and compelling manner. After a promising set-up, the series goes nowhere, relying on quirky one-liners and slick production values rather than strong writing which gets under the skin of some potentially disturbing characters and themes. Every character never gets past their initial set-up, providing no depth, and a growing sense of annoying repetition. Despite being based on a novel, the series' writers seem to forget that character depth propels the story, and I don't know whether or not it happens in the novel, but the series makes some fatal mistakes that make the story less interesting. Michael C Hall proves a dull lead, but given the routine writing, he can't be fully blamed. Having him occasionally look at the camera and smirk was a huge mistake. The only actor who rises above the material is James Remar, a genuine film actor who has presence and knows how to inhabit a character. The episodes vary in quality, and the best episodes are those directed by Michael Cuesta (who directed the under-rated films L.I.E and TWELVE AND HOLDING), who keeps a better balance between quirky comedy and the darker series DEXTER could have been. With most modern films/TV series, the story can only progress by people acting stupid, and unfortunately DEXTER suffers from this failing, which seems more irritating when characters seem smarter than Albert Einstein most of the time. DEXTER is fun, entertaining, and very, very slick. But when one sees what a dark, disturbing, blackly comic show it could have been, one feels rather short-changed. Given one of the show's very clunky in-jokes, one should just watch American PSYCHO. It offers a better, darker view of a serial killer (not to mention a far superior lead performance), where the black humour is cleverly handled, not just a way to make off-putting material more acceptable for a mainstream audience."
415,"its been 8 years since i gave up watching ANY TV program, especially those ever increasing ""shallow""( at best) serials that seemingly are being produced only to ""adjust"" and ""attract"" (promote in effect by themselves) the ever increasing ""commercial"" times. so it comes as no surprise that on HBO is pretty much the only remaining entertaining ""prime time"" television (not only, but most well known by general public).in this ""organization"" writers and directors are less exposed to the effects of marketing economic aspects, propagandistic plots of some sort or another, or social disruption of habits and ideas. and in ""dexter"" case this very last aspect mentioned above is very interesting ,since in effect, it deals with unusual behavior at best and ITS best...well, i must first admit that the very first episode(or most of it) did not have much impact on my already high expectations.somehow i did not feel that Michael C. Hall would be the man for the job or able to pull it off with ""style"". but the following episodes achieved well the ""normalization"" of the atmosphere, which is critical in order so viewers can establish perceptions, sympathies and even personal relationships towards the protagonists. the secondary characters are not extremely well developed at start but the way they integrate and interact which each other is well done!.add on top of it the comic relief which intrigues just enough to keep going the ever increasing mental demand and attention required from the viewer.to the the actors and characters now: Julie Benz as Rita Bennett is the only one of those that seems as a constant cliché, or provides the very FEW ""slow"" parts within the production(there is a whole and ONLY episode i did not like because of her).yet she is very critical to the plot as giving us that ""ordinary"" vibe so we, as viewers can relate and argue about what is going on or not, or should be happening.she will definitely be appealing to any soap-opra lovers or laid back ""conservative"" viewers.Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan is outstanding; there are parts where she is ""annoying"" at least, but her dialogs are quiet original,sometimes witty and sometimes comic, especially for what she represents; and without ever going into the ""unrealistic"" realm of a ""fictional"" characters; while she is quiet pretty(and tall), she is not beautiful( at least by the mainstream television ""standards"" this days,yucks, way too many pale blonds), which makes me appreciate her casting in making the character look as realistic as possible.her voice and tone provides quiet a few punch lines in themselves.)))Erik King as Sergeant James Doakes is fabulous;a very ""conservtive"", stand up guy. i would argue that he is the most important plot character(in season two especially) towards feeding up the viewers interests and mental reasonings on the universal moral and ethical aspects of human beings, as generally being perceived as. his contrast to dexter Morgan is always so visible and yet very similar; his ideology is well defined and always ""pressed"" against the plot's central hero, creating an always evolving relation, for better or worse.Lauren Vélez as Lt. Maria Laguerta (together with David Zayas as Angel Batista)brings the show's plot integration within its Miami location, and does very well at that, at least as the general perception goes of how this specific city is, at least on the silver screen. they both represent( and seemingly are) Cuban immigrants; the Spanish language and ""stereotypes"" are brought by them ""live"" everywhere in-between plot lines; with much ""gusto"" i might add, both from my own serious and/or funny perspectives. they also create the excellent ""normality"" vibe.James Remar as Harry Morgan( Dexter's adoptive father) is ever present in almost all episodes providing the ideological plot traits and how that affects the main hero.reflections of the past that ever hunts everyone sometimes without even be aware of this fact. to me he is a bit of a ""standard"" character, somehow required but not quiet as often as he is.C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka is yet another co-worker of Dexter.he does have some comic parts or dialogs, but not central to plot much. quiet good acting but i feel he should have been developed a bit more; maybe in season three...Jaime Murray as Lila is intriguing(season 2 only). even her the character seems to be ""manipulated""(the only one as such i think) she provides some different types of ""tennsion"" and some wicked feminist traits to be reckoned with...the characters at start are very much ""cliches"", but as the ""time"" goes by, each and every one of them develops special interests, and not ONLY because some plot twists; the plot was crafted especially well, and to me at least, there are no ""plot"" holes brought in, or left out, or out of script convenience, at least on the entertaining face value. unlike ""prison break""'s season 2 and 3 ""dexter"" does not emerge itself in predictability at any point and neither has ""forced"" suspense brought us.up to the very last episode in season 2 i kept ""learning"" something new that makes sense and increases tensions or suspense. also the serial has a great replay value, very unusual for a TV show; i am inclined to reason it based on excellent performances throw out and witty comic aspects one could miss the first time around( i am pretty sure i did or at least i think so)."
416,"Dexter was such a sleeper it that when I watched it, after hearing the buzz from the US, I expected it to be pretty OK, but nothing spectacular, especially since crime dramas (csi,24, etc.) aren't my favourite. As well as that I don't really like Lost and I've grown tired of heroes. But as soon as I heard the twisted monologues of Dexter, I knew this show was interesting to say the least. And not only that, I was really produced well, the plot was flawless and the acting amazing with superb comic timing from the cast when it's needed.I must say, Dexter is the best show on TV at the moment along with Entourage and South Park. Just don't take it too seriously, and get engripped in the story. Brilliant, bring on season 2!"
417,"EDIT: Now scored 5/10Half of this series is amazing and half is terrible. Due to numerous reasons Dexter's writers and creative direction took a wrong turn after Season Four. I do not recommend anything past maybe the first few episodes of S5.PREVIOUS REVIEWPreviously Scored 10/10I was amazed by Dexter from the moment I cracked open the DVD first season, to the moment I stopped watching the last episode of season one. I'm not your typical viewer. I try to see things in their entirety,without commercial interruption. I have yet to see anything from season two, but I am waiting for upcoming seasons to hit DVD, with great anticipation!Dexter Morgan is pretty motif-psychotic, and this series about him is absolutely brilliant, in the same exact way. I found it difficult not to be completely lured into his world, much like everyone slows down to witness the potential horrors of a morbid traffic accident. We can't help it. A voice inside us tells us to keep driving and ignore the potentially shocking images, but our bodies somehow take over and curiously force us to turn and witness it all, drink it all in and get a sense of what happened and in turn, what could happen to us if we don't stop and slow the pace a bit.You can't compare Dexter to anything. It's unique and yet the writing is rooted in good fiction, stream of consciousness style, where pretty much anything can happen with the right connection and cadence, primping and puzzling.Sadly because it's Showtime, they will end up cancelling this before it can reach its true potential. Rumor has it that a third season has been green-lit, but you can never be too sure, with ShowTime. I am still miffed about ""Dead Like Me"". You can therefore imagine, I am afraid to get too attached to Dexter. Three seasons is joyous! Four would be better, but this is the kind of series I would like to see not only make it to a seventh or eighth season, but the kind of series I would like to see taken to the big screen, much like the Star Trek franchise, only better written, conceptualized and executed."
418,"Although the idea of the anti-hero is old as Homer, 'Dexter' brings something tangy and interesting to the table -- a creepy serial killer with, get this, a CODE of sorts. He does despicable things to despicable people, and while you can't really LIKE the guy, you begin to understand him. Chilling! Top notch cast -- I really like the fact that while Dexter's facade seems perfect, there are still those around him (and not necessarily those who've known him longest) who just don't buy it. Simultaneously conflicted and driven by his sick darkness, the main character has got to be one of the most repulsive to ever hit the small screen, and also one of the most engaging. Can't wait for season 2, now that one of the big mysteries of season 1 has come to some sort of conclusion. If Showtime messes it up and passes on a second season, I'd still buy the DVD of season 1, just to creep myself out with Dexter's unsettling world."
419,"This a (spoiler free) review of ""Dexter"" from episode number one to the 2013 series finale episode. I've officially watched Dexter from beginning to end and now here is my review for this great series throughout it's highs and lows. A brief intro about this show for those whom haven't seen it. Dexter is about the character named Dexter Morgan based off the novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" by Jeff Lindsay. Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro where he works with his police-officer sister Debra Morgan. Dexter is a fun, likable guy that brings in donuts to work and is an easy going guy... at least in the day. During the night, Dexter becomes ""The Monster""; Dexter lives a secret life where he is a psychopath professional serial killer. Using his Miami Metro resources, Dexter fills his need to kill by hunting down those whom deserve to be killed; he finds and locates criminals whom have ""slipped through the cracks"", although from time to time others often enter his path. He takes people out where he then dismembers their bodies and dumps them in the ocean, often leaving no train of evidence due to the fact that he follows ""The Code"". The code, known as ""Harry's Code"", is a set of rules Dexter's adoptive father, Harry Morgan, created for Dexter to full fill his need to kill without being caught.The premise of the show stays the same. Dexter typically has a need to kill at night. It's his life during the day where things change. He meets people, makes lovers, and even has children to take care of. With all of these complications in Dexter's life, it becomes difficult for him to satisfy ""The Dark Passenger"" as he likes to call it. This is where most of the drama of the show happens. Dexter is a great series because there is one big question that gets asked all the time; is it due-justice what Dexter does? Should he be allowed to kill these people who slip through the cracks? All in all, Dexter is a serial killer, but often fans are forced to be on his side when they see his inner psyche. From season one to season eight, I have enjoyed nearly every episode. Sure, like all TV shows, there is a dud here and there. But all in all, Dexter is one of the best shows ever created on television. The deep, thought provoking storyline and great cast. It's just a solid TV series. Michael C. Hall is a legendary actor now, giving life to the character Dexter like no others could. Many people watched the show simply because of his performance. The supporting cast were excellent as well and most characters stuck around from beginning to end, giving the perfect blend of family members and comic-relief when needed. Lastly the set design, filmography, audio, and soundtrack were top-tier. This show gets a nice budget and was never too over-the-top. I'll be honest. At first, I wasn't crazy about this show. When it first came out years ago, I was barely interested in it. But over time, I slowly started to pick up on this show. I eventually watched the show from beginning to end and watched the later seasons during the premiere every Sunday. Once I gave this show a good chance, I instantly got hooked. Dexter is a fantastic series and I am giving a perfect 10 out of 10. Many hardcore fans may disagree, but I think it's fair. Dexter has had it's highs and its lows like other shows. Some seasons and characters are more likable than others. But regardless of all this, Dexter is simply a masterpiece of this series and there is never a dull moment. And never have I watched a show that has given me nightmare's as much as Dexter has (which is a good thing)! Whether you are a fan of horror stories or not, I highly recommend checkout out Dexter. The only reason to not watch it is if you get disturbed from horror series/flicks, because this is an intense, dark TV show. Also, it's a bit morbid for the younger audience. But adults should totally give this show a shot. Thank you Showtime for delivering eight quality seasons of this wonderful TV series. It will forever be in my list of favorites."
420,"The Dexter series come close to the word ""excellent"". I enjoyed the series from start till end, mainly because of the great job that the writers have done writing the series. Although I must say the season finale was really disappointing. During all seasons every episode felt right. And then came the season finale and this feeling disappeared. This has to do with the fact that I was disappointed by the fact that such a great character is given an ending like this. I could have lived with the fact that he is dead and that Harisson and Hannah would go on with their lives. Them being together as a happy ending would have been better though. But no the writers of the series picked an ending which doesn't add up in the bound the fans build up with Dexter. Just as many other people say, Dexter is the good psychopath and doesn't deserve an ending in misery. Apart from the ending I loved the series. As already said Dexter is one of the best characters I have seen in a series and all the other characters just fit into the story very well. I would recommend everyone to watch this series and somehow I will always be hoping they fix the ending by adding a season 9. Unfortunately I'm quite sure this will never happen. Still this series deserves a big 10 out of 10. No question doubt about that, if you ask me."
421,"Just when the world thinks that TV has finally hit rock bottom and succumbed to worthless and meaningless shows, here comes the Showtime hit and Emmy award winning show Dexter to save the day. Dexter is about a charming Miami Blood Splatter Analyst Dexter Morgan who by day is a kind and thoughtful man, but by night is a serial killer who only disposes of the wicked and ""bad people"" (criminals.) Michael C. Hall (Dexter Morgan) and Jennifer Carpenter (Debra Morgan) lead an all stellar cast. The whole show has such a complex storyline and plot it's dumbfounding. It literally is that good. With his foul mouthed sister Debra at Dexter's side, the show is a hit and a blast and deserves immense recognition. If you enjoy dark humor, amazing storyline, good acting, and drama as well as romance, Dexter is the way to go."
422,"OK, well, loved Season 7's ending. But to be honest I'm rather disappointed of the series development. Don't get me wrong Dexter"" is still a hell of a show but personally I only liked season 1 and season 4. I mean, season 1 is based on the novel. I liked this season the most, because it's the most authentic season. It's a good start to fascinate the viewer and make him addicted to watch the series. Dexter's dilemma choosing between Deb and Brian. It was good and interesting, without much action. Season 2 was good, too. Thrilling and exciting. Showing also the development of Rita and Dexter. Season 3 was the most boring in my opinion. Season 4 again was very good. But after season 4 I got disappointed. Not only because of Rita's death – I get it, people hated Rita and found her annoying and the series isn't based on the novel anymore. But I would've liked the series shorter, focused on the initial story, without Dexter becoming James Bond and banging b****. I mean, come on, Trisha and stuff. OK, I know, Dexter's personality developed. He developed feelings. And I like this. Especially the storyline with Harrison. It's plausible. But I think the series got to hollywoodish (saving Harrison from the top of a skyscraper, explosions, Dexter getting laid by every blonde women, strip clubs blabla). Season 5 was among season 3 the weakest, season 6 was interesting but nonessential, as well and season 7... I love the plot twists, of course the series is full of suspense, but Miami kinda turned into Vice City. Personally I would've preferred if the writers focused more on the psychological aspects of a serial killer. On Dexter's mind, on other killer's minds. And I would've loved to've seen more of Brian since I think he is a crucial character for Dex. The only killers I liked were the Ice-Truck-Killer, the Trinity-Killer and the Doomsday-Killer, for they were the only true sick psychos. The season with the Doomsday-Killer was interesting in my opinion, I was excited by Colin Hanks as Travis Marshall. Very well acted and the killings were pure art. Could've been the story of a movie, too. Oh wait, we've got a similar one called se7en"". Ray Stevenson was awesome as Isaak, Julia Stiles played good, as well (though I always thought she'd start saving the last dance any minute) but still kinda unnecessary. The series could've been shorter but I guess since Dexter"" was that successful they had to strech the story out to make money money. The show is still great. The acting is tremendous. Michael C. Hall as Dexter is very authentic and fascinating. My favourite is still Jennifer Carpenter as Debra. Her acting is insanely good. So is the whole show: interesting, thrilling and outstanding. But still kinda disappointing after all. Perhaps my standards are too high or perhaps I've got to read the novels. (Oh, and please don't start lynching me now. Everybody may have an opinion. This is mine. Perhaps someone agrees with me.)"
423,"In one month i watched all 7 seasons... & i am amazed by story line.... The real thrill of ""Dark passenger"" Starts from Season 4 when ""Trinity"" Comes in Show... Just Awesome Background music... Now I am desperately Waiting for Season 8.. What will happen as Debra has killed Maria.... ""We all make rules for ourselves. It's these rules that help define who we are. So when we break those rules we risk losing ourselves and becoming something unknown. Who is Deb now? Who am I? Is this a new beginning? Or the beginning of the end? ""What did you think of the season finale of Dexter? Where do you think Dexter goes from here? Argentina? Prison?"
424,"Some of the best TV serial writing around in a show that keeps on surprising you. Each season is well written and executed and with stellar performance trough out. The ""No character is small enough"" mentality is at its greatest in the genre and that shows: a web of story lines and personal dramas that keeps on giving never feeling forced... which is a task with all that blood. A task that Dexter accomplishes masterfully. Some serious Art Direction and Sfx, I would like to mention.. I can't think of many shows with a single character that drives the action, that arrive to season 7 and they keep you on wanting more.... and I want more.10STARS"
425,"I never thought I would get hooked ""compulsively"" on this TV series about murders!! And yet Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan is simply amazing in his role, his acting.What makes it so compelling is that you can hear the thoughts of Dexter and his internal thought processes, it is kind of compelling. He kills, yes, but only murderers who escaped the judicial system and therefore you quickly feel that Dexter is more Mr. Justice than Mr. Killer!! The stories of each season are extremely well-thought, planned.I usually do not like to watch any TV series involving murders and yet, with this one, I am compelled to cheer Dexter as he tackles another monster who escaped the judicial system!! And strangely, I continuously laugh at Dexter's remarks and the situations where the entire Dexter police team is in.That is the only TV series involving murders that I love watching!!Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan was so good in his role that I WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED AT ALL WATCHING AT LEAST SIX MORE SEASONS of Dexter's adventures trying to get rid of all the monsters who were left roaming freely on earth despite the many monstrous crimes that they committed and for which they managed to escape the grips of Justice. I still have a very hard time understanding why the producers of this TV series Dexter did not try to capitalize on Dexter's success and make several more seasons. Well, it is not too late to create a new sequel TV series of Dexter that is exactly the same than previously with the same main actors, as it was so good.Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot.--------------------------------------------------------There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series:---Smallville---Star Trek: Enterprise---Babylon 5---Earth: Final Conflict---Battlestar Galactica---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting)---Jupiter Ascending (a movie)all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have. Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have ""filler"" episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have ""holes"", illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes. Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly.Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction? Here is my list of other excellent TV series that you will appreciate a lot:--A few more science-fiction:---Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome (it is science-fiction)---Caprica (it is science-fiction)---Babylon 5: Thirdspace (it is science-fiction)---Space: Above and Beyond (it is science-fiction)---Defying Gravity (it is science-fiction)---The Tomorrow People (it is science-fiction)---The 100 (it is science-fiction)---Almost Human (it is science-fiction)--Non-science fiction:---24---24: Live Another Day---Dexter---The Vampire Diaries (it is fantasy I could call it)---Breaking Bad---Kyle XY (it is slightly science-fiction)---Nikita---Damages--------------------------------------------------------"
426,"I want to stress that I have seen a lot of great shows; 24, House, The Simpsons etc. But I have never seen a show quite as brilliant as Dexter. It succeeds in every level, it's funny, has superb lead actors, great character development, very dramatic and the most ingenious story lines I've ever seen. I remember watching the first episode on the internet to see what it was like, and from the second he killed his first victim on the show I knew I was hooked. I watched the other 11 episodes of the first season religiously and I can say bar the first season of 24 I've never enjoyed a series of TV more. Dexter is going into it's sixth season and in my opinion the previous five have been superb, and the show has never lost it's dramatic pace or originality. so if you want a to watch something that will hook you with it's great story lines, amaze you by it's actors and amuse you with it's sharp wit, then without a doubt, this is the show for you."
427,"This is by far one of the most original TV-series I've seen. A serial killer with a forensic job, filling in the flaws of justice as a final judge.At first I was a bit skeptic about the whole approach and didn't know what to expect. Before actually watching, I thought it would be placed as on old fashioned horror thing, which I dislike in general. A friend convinced me a few times to give it a try. When I began viewing the first chapter, I thought this would be a dramatic, long lasting series. However at the end of that chapter I was ready for more.Don't think of Dexter as a CSI whatever approach! It's far more complex, in a good way! Nice storytelling, good acting, a thriller approach which keeps you at the point of your chair. There are some nice plots that don't turn out as some sort of cliché or unrealistic approach to keep things going, which are hard to find these days. When I gave it a spin, I never stopped and watched all episodes. Each season keeps getting better, which is very rare...You can think of ""Dexter"" as a no-nonsense, realistic thriller series. In general it's very interesting to see how you can get involved and create sympathy with a character that actually is nor bad nor evil. Actually Dexter, could be your best friend or next door neighbor without knowing... Even now, after watching all chapters to date, I don't know whether I would really describe him as a ""bad man"". If you can get this kind of feeling for a ""murderer"", this show must be good!tip: If possible, watch all seasons on a regular base and chronological, this will increase the impact. (but should be considered for every series)."
428,"There are few words to describe this show except for, nearly a masterpiece.Dexter is a really thought out character, which is probably the most interesting about the show, but it is a thrill as well to watch, good characters, well thought through plot that'll make you want to watch it as fast as possible, it did with me.HOWEVER, it two flaws.The first flaw: there is a main plot and then there are side plots as there are in some shows, some of the side plots are in my opinion unnecessary, and BORING to watch, they may have been put there to leave the user wanting more of the meat instead of the boring superfluous, side plots.The second flaw: I'm only halfway through the show (middle of season 3) but in my opinion season 2 was WAY more exiting.Despite the flaws, I really think this is some of the best I've watched."
429,"It's the only series i know that i've recommended to many people and it went straight to their favorite TV shows as well. It's also the only case that the TV adaptation was better than the original book. Every season is better than the last one, it never ceases to surprise me.Michael C. Hall started a little shy in his role, but after a couple of seasons it was just impossible to separate him from his character. When i went to the cinema to watch GAMER (where he plays the bad guy), i could hear people shouting ""look, it's Dexter!"".Right now it is my favorite TV show of all time, maybe side by side with doctor who, but they are too far apart in the gender spectrum to be compared."
430,"I agree that this is a great show. I just started watching it and have just gotten started on Season 4. I think the writing is excellent and the show is much better than Michael C. Hall's previous efforts on Six Feet Under. I like all of the characters except for one, Dexter's sister. She is so crass and boorish that she loses almost all credibility. I also find the fact that every guy that meets her starts hitting on her is not believable since to me, she looks like a walking skeleton. She's an okay actress but not up to par with the others and certainly no sex symbol. Dexter's character is perfectly done, Batista seems like a flawed but inherently good guy. Vince is just a total boob but a brilliant one and La Guerta is also done very well. The one I really like is Rita who is totally engaging and believable. The guest stars have been consistently excellent and the cameo appearances by people like Max Gail and Adrienne Barbeau have added moments of enjoyment for those familiar with television history. All in all a terrific show and I hope it continues for many more seasons."
431,When i started watching season 1 seeing the intensity and the depth of characters the storyline i said wow this reminds me of heroes 1st season.It started off excellent but as heroes i thought it would fail in second season.However watching season 2 successively 3 and 4...With each episode it continues to get better.Especially season 4 might be one of the deepest seasons of any series i have watched till now and i have watched a lot.With each of dexter kill i don't know how but i get to like him more and more.Nevertheless in season 4 with Trinity they portrayed one of most !!!beatiful!!! insight of serial killer with so much emotion in every episode.Especially in season finale i can guarantee that no one could guess the epic ending.I still wonder how they will be able to make this series better after season 4.Season 4 finale would be the best series finale even better then Six Feet Under.Brilliant magnificent excellent splendid unique superb prominent just don't have enough adjective to describe the greatness of this SERIES
432,"I was given the first two seasons on DVD by a friend. I had never even heard of the show previously. I am absolutely hooked. I'm through 1-1/2 seasons at this point. At the end of each show it is difficult to not just move onto the next. Seeing the characters develop throughout the show and the interweaving of the the past keeps things moving along. I enjoy the introduction of new people (Lila, Lundy) to keep things fresh.I can understand how some people would find the show offensive but when one considers the characters and the thought that has gone into the show it is a true study of the human mind and character. I'll be going out to get season 3 as soon as I can.If you haven't given this show a chance, I suggest you watch the first two episodes. I'm guessing you'll be hooked just as I am by that time."
433,"Its at its best funny and interesting story but surprisingly infrequent ! the script is bad and not surprising - it makes me depressed most off the times and worst is that the actors are so horrible that i could cry. I'v seen halfway through 2. season and i feel I've given it a fear chance, now i rather see skins, shameless or Chuck - this shows are in another league!! Dexter is meant to be a feeling less human so how come hes such a pussy? And i thou th he was supposed to be smart , why do i feel i could do better than him? and all the actors and those senile writers. I promise that u can find something better to do than watch this."
434,"Dexter is a good example of how bad American TV shows have become. Gory, sadistic, vulgar and pornographic.The ""hero"" of this show is a serial killer, but don't worry! Dexter is a ""good guy"", he only murders other serial killers and dangerous criminals (while they're completely helpless).Dexter is what would happen if the radical left and the extreme right married and had a baby. Leftists will love the show because of all the ridiculous liberal propaganda, anti- Christian content, profanity and graphic sex scenes. Extreme right-wingers will drool when Dexter goes Charles Bronson on criminals and throws their remains in the water. It's almost touching, in a sick way.The show is more unrealistic and silly than any of the Harry Potter movies combined. In Dexter's world, everyone is a serial killer. His brother is a serial killer. A woman he meets (and sleeps with, even though he has a girlfriend) at a support group for drug addicts is a serial killer. Even his own psychiatrist is a serial killer. I bet his potty-mouthed step-sister turned out to be serial killer too. ""The F-Word Killer"". We don't need garbage like this...watch a good show instead, like Bonanza or Walt Disney's Zorro."
435,"Dexter is phenomenal. Ground-breaking, if you would. Michael C. Hall is incredible. He's the type of character that normal people would be torn between. So lovable. So calm. So clever... But SO terrifying. There's nothing more to it.The show leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach, yet also leaves you salivating for more.For my money, this is the epitome of what a drama should be.Kudos to the creators of this show for amazing casting, and even better stories. And even more kudos to Showtime, for keeping an amazing show such as Dexter on television."
436,"At the time of writing this,I have only watched half of this series which I believe has twelve episodes.It is very slickly made and I am pretty confident that it will prove to be very popular.In basic terms,the story is almost vigilante in it's tone.Dexter kills people in a pretty brutal way but only 'bad' people.The morals of this may leave a sour taste in the most delicate of mouths,but it is done with it's tongue very firmly in it's cheek and there is no denying that this is a very well made and acted series.Michael C Hall fits the leading role like a glove and clearly has a ball playing Dexter.His deadpan,emotionless performance is exactly what is called for.He makes the character likable even if you question his lust for gruesome murders.At the core of this series is the hunt for a serial killer that cuts up their victims without leaving a trace of blood.Dexter obviously admires them and believe me,you will stay with this series to find out who the killer is.If you want to try something different,'Dexter' may well be up your street.I reckon that if you watch the first couple of episodes,you won't be able to stop yourself from watching.As a postscript to this show,I have now watched season two and although it wasn't quite as high a standard as the first series it is still pretty good.A couple of problems I felt were that Dexter spends too much time not acting like Dexter and that the character of Lila wasn't acted too well.I have read some reviewers raving about her but this surprises me as I felt Jaime Murray was probably the weakest actress in the series.Overall though it is well worth a watch and I would give season one 9.3 and season two 8.2."
437,"Dexter is a complex character study built on a notion of a darker side. Yes Dexter kills with precision befitting some of the most prolific movie monsters, but you just can't help by like the guy. This is accomplished in whole by Michael C. Hall's charm. He seems like a genuinely nice guy and his tongue in cheek delivery of the narrative is outstanding.I happened on this show by accident and it is by far one of the best shows on TV. It's also got a great supporting cast. Of particular note here is Dexter's sister played by Jennifer Carpenter. Never have I seen as foul mouthed a female character as Debra, who is so entertaining to watch.Throw in an engrossing backstory about Dexter's childhood and you've got pretty close to the perfect package. This shows to me that Showtime can keep up with the big boys at HBO.For creepy chills from your TV screen, watch a little Dexter and listen closely to the score as Dexter really gets going.Overall this is an incredible show and now I just need to find the novel on which it is based, Darkly Dreaming Dexter."
438,"Awesome new show. Excellent characters (with the exception of the whiny, needy sister who is just plain annoying) and intriguing plot. Well worth taking the time to watch. Michael C. Hall is brilliant. He proves he's talented and versatile. I was introduced to Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under and while he played his character, David, well, he didn't shine like he does in this series. Dexter is delightfully creepy and while you might not want to like him, you will probably have to find a way to come to terms with the fact that you do like the character. Looking forward to seeing many, many more seasons of this intriguing new series."
439,"I was first turned on to this show by a friend at my work, and I must admit that this is one of the most addicting shows on TV. The premise of the show is a little out there, but give it one episode and you will be hooked too. Michael C. Hall plays ""Dexter"", a man who because of a nasty childhood experience is hard wired to kill. But thanks to his adopted father(a member of the Miami Police Department)he is taught to kill those who have ""escaped justice"". The first season takes you on a chase after the ""Ice Truck Killer"" a serial killer who drains the blood from all his victims. The mental chess match that ensues between Dexter and the killer is second to none. But you also get to see what Dexter does in his private time. Researching, getting the proof he needs and then taking his own type of justice. Even thought Dexter is a serial killer himself, you will come to love him. My only disappointment was that Michael C. Hall did not win the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama series. The show gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. Can't wait for season two."
440,"Finally a show which is fresh, humorous and truly has a good dose of sarcasm. I'm from Holland so we don't get Showtime here but a friend brought me this series from a vacation in the states and I watched all 12 episodes in two days. The show grows on all fronts of acting, storyline and a killer finale. I cant wait for next season to shock me in a pleasant way again. Here in Holland It probably wont be aired or if some network buys it will take maybe a year or two to air. which in my opinion is really a shame because I loved it and others will to. Michael C. Hall plays the role of Dexter Morgan and does a really great job, he is convincing as a forensics blood expert but even more as a serial killer of criminals and other scummy people which don't get caught by the law. I also liked David Zayas as Angel Batista as one of the friends of dexter and the complicated relationship he maintains with his girlfriend played by Julie Benz. All in all a very funny and surreal look in to the live of a well behaved psycho serial killer with some very human like trades."
441,"Few shows on television lately have actually captivated me and nearly forced me to watch the next episodes. Dexter captivated me on a level that i could never imagine. I did not begin in the beginning of the series but when i saw the promo for the show i knew i had to watch it. I read both of Lindsay's books and this show is in perfect harmony with the book, it reaches a new level of connection between a show and the novel it was based on and makes harry potters connection look horrific. The season may be coming to the end, but watch the re-runs and see the magic of Dexter. You'll agree that if they're not many seasons to come, Showtime is making a monumental mistake."
442,"After many ventures into the mayhem we Americans call ""television."" I could never really get into a series that really interested me as much as Dexter has. Playing off the novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" by Jeff Lindsey, the writers have really given us a show that will grab us and keep us waiting for the next episode. The cast is what really makes this series such a winner. Micheal C. Hall does such a great job of bringing to life ""Dexter,"" he is a good actor I even enjoyed his character on ""Six Feet Deep"".So basically this show is a all around winner, and a grade A in my book. If you missed this season be sure and catch next season."
443,"Being a fan of the book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, I was a bit hesitant when I first heard it was being made into a series. Nonetheless I watched the season premiere. So far so good. Then I watched the next episode. It was even better. And that's what kept happening. Each episode was better than the last. Although the plot in the series deviates greatly from the book it retained the sharp wit and dark humor. All performances are superb, especially Michael C. Hall. He hits Dexter's character so dead on, it scares me, and makes me feel guilty that I love him still. I highly recommend this series, but be warned, it is gory and very creepy, but in a good way. A guilty pleasure good kind of way."
444,"I have been watching ""Dexter"" since it's premiere and it has been fresh and original since the beginning. This show in my opinion is the probably the best new show on television. Michael C. Hall's performance is stellar. He performs excellently as does every other member of the cast. This show creates an very eerie and surreal atmosphere that few shows are able to pull off. The writing is top notch and unpredictable. The camera work is also quite good. All of these elements are put together to create a very very very good show that know one should miss unless you're squeamish or young because be warned it gets pretty gruesome. But if you're into crime shows and things that are artistic and different then you should definitely check this show out."
445,"This show is about a serial killer, that kills serial killers. He lives by a code, and as such the people he kills must be worthy of killing. Killing the innocent would break his code. Dexter is a M.E. that kills serial killers he investigates. During the day he helps track killers, and night he kills them. This show is a labyrinth of psychology behind killers and what it would take to be a killer yourself yet still one of morality.Morality- in this sense means doing what you deem the correct action. In this case the character Dexter is a moral character, just a little twisted. At the same time, you might wonder whether he feels anything or not. It seems that he does yet also not. It is a very interesting show and any Showtime subscribers should not miss it. If you like anything like CSI, this is CSI on crack. This is like ""Crossing Jordan"" if it were a good show."
446,"As others have noted, DEXTER has brilliant writing, directing, acting and design. What makes DEXTER transcend the books and other television shows is the way the stories function on many levels simultaneously. While pulling the viewer in with humor and plot twists, the stories also resonate with diverse facets of contemporary American culture: fascination/repulsion with violence; admiration of phony manipulators; questions about the appropriateness of revenge and the death penalty; and how to balance the teachings of parents with one's own sense of self. In addition, it is my hope that DEXTER may also bring about a heightened public awareness of psychopaths in real life--not the small percentage who are violent, but the others who manipulate and destroy lives. Researchers believe that 4% of people are psychopaths--that is 1 in 25. For insight into DEXTER and real-life psychopaths, check out ""The Sociopath Next Door"" and ""Snakes in Suits."" The life you save could be your own!"
447,"This show is completely unique .
Television at its most highest craft, with brilliant acting, incredible subject matter, suspense, everything.
It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and make you clutch your hands together in suspense and make your heart race with excitement.
Dexter is a superhero like no other, but captures something deep inside of us that is hard to escape from.
Nothing more to say except just........ WOW."
448,How dare you waste my time after watching for 8 seasons waiting for a happy ending!! You have robbed and wasted my times and left me angry and depressed!! How dare you ! This show is ruined and is a piece of crap all a waste of my time and energy. Watching this show was completely pointless! COMPLETE GARBAGE hope it was worth it .. you wasted my time I am SO ANGRY And completely unsatisfied. You spit on your fans. This is disgusting!
449,"I've watched this show through three times now and it's interesting but so many things about it are stupid.The first couple of seasons were pretty good but my issues are these:1. There is not one normal woman in this series, IMHO. Every women is represented as an emotional train wreck just dying to find a man and do anything to please them. Even the women who should be above that because of their jobs.2. Deb's character is the most ridiculous. Whining, crying, cursing. Not realistic.3. Every ""cop"" in Dexter's precinct has some ridiculous personal issue that is unrealistic.Other than the killing, I found this show pretty lame. IMHO."
450,"There was an air of disappointment as the season finale of Dexter came  out, and I think one can now fairly say, the show has failed to live up  to the expectations after a brilliant first season. The first season  was boosted by an amazing new concept and caught the eye of many.  Combine it with the splendid acting of Michael C.Hall (Dexter) & some  superb direction and BOOM! We have the recipe for an award winning  show. But after the first few seasons, Dexter seemed to be getting away  with everything. I didn't find season 5 & 6 to be particularly  flattering. Nevertheless, both had a fascinating finale. That's what  made Dexter special; it had a season long build up and then an  unbelievably wonderful ending. Not that other shows don't, but here the  build up was even more pronounced due the amazing finale of each  season.  Saxon was always one step ahead of dexter until the end Coming back to  the Dexter finale, it was disappointing to say the least and the  writing was pretty ordinary. The writers decided to produce a lot of  twists & turns at the eleventh hour and as expected, that didn't go  quite well with the audience. Instead of adding so many twists and  confusing the viewers with it, they could have focused on Saxon and let  the viewers have some grip of the story line The way Debra died was the  most amusing to me. One moment she was fine and next, she's suddenly  being transferred to the ICU due to a blood clot in her brain. So  basically, she died due to the doctor's incompetence to perform the  surgery properly! lol. It perfectly depicted the disorientation inside  the writer's mind. An alternate and a better end could have been the  one where Saxon kills Dexter. After all, Dexter himself labeled Saxon  as the perfect psychopath. As Dexter tried to juggle between his  private and public lives, Saxon remained one step ahead of him  throughout the season. Moreover, Dexter wasn't completely following  Harry's code towards the end and had an inclination towards his life  with Hannah and how he could give up killing. This made him much less  of a threat to Saxon. He even let Saxon get off the hook once when he  decided to call the cops instead killing him himself. Dexter was no  longer driven by the smell of the blood while his opponent was smart  and still motivated by blood. The initial impression of Saxon was one  of an astute and a shrewd guy, but the way Dexter played him just by  giving his video to the media left me perplexed. What else did he  expect when turned up at Dexter's doorstep?! I think that was one big  mistake by the writers of the show. I was once again dumbfounded when  Saxon decided to go to the hospital all by himself to kill Debra. I  thought that it was just a pretext to kill Saxon and end that chapter.  Anyways, the story continued to Dexter killing Debra for her own good  and then himself giving up on a chance to get back with Hannah in order  to keep her safe from the life sucking monster he had become.  The fact that Dexter could survive the storm and carry on with his life  as a lumberjack (or whatever he was :P) just baffled me. These kinds of  scenes are well suited to The Dark Knight but not Dexter. After all, he  is a psychopath and not a freaking superhero! I have always remembered  the different seasons by their finale but this one missed the boat.  Dexter riding into the storm and dying would have been a nice ending  but definitely not the best. Whether you like to admit or not, Saxon  should have killed Dexter. And that would have been the perfect ending!"
451,"Dexter is, without a doubt, one of my favorite television shows currently on the air, in its sixth season and still going strong. It is a crime mystery told from the killer's point of view but, unlike any other dark show or movie of its kind, actually has the audience rooting for the macabre protagonist of the series, Dexter Morgan.Set in the extravagant city of Miami, Dexter uses his job as a blood splatter analyst at the police department as a way to find info about his next victim. But Dexter has a code: he only kills those who are guilty of killing innocents, but who have, for one reason or another, slipped through the cracks of the justice system. Dark, dramatic, action-packed, and often morbidly humorous, this show is bound to please.The acting and writing is top notch. Michael C. Hall's performance is phenomenal—he acts a demented serial killer who, in turn, has to act like an everyday joe in order to blend in with society. Dexter lacks things that most other people possess, like feelings, morals, and a sense of connection with other humans. Through his constant struggle to control his desire to murder, one episode of Dexter can show us, the audience, more about the dark side of human nature than most other television shows can do in a season."
452,"I loved the plot, the director maintained a very strong element of suspense, surprise and humor, 4 seasons later we see originality and evolution, the characters go on in time as we all do in real life. I think it really is the best show ever on TV, I am so longing for season 5, I'm counting the days, as a matter of fact. In Greece airing of the show is a bit problematic but we all DEXTER fans always find a way to keep up. Season 4 was breathtaking, I got addicted to it from episode 1. I really wish I had someone like Dexter around me in real life, the ""avenger"" you can really count on to bring a true sense of justice that otherwise can't be found. Long live the actors M.C.Hall and his wife, such a beautiful couple."
453,"Besides Jen Carpenter being a terrible actress...and I mean Terrible, this is a great series. Worth investing time into."
454,"Dexter was a very well made series, depicting a likable serial killer, murdering guilty criminals who escaped justice with fresh and intricate psychological twists.CSI by day, vigilante by night, he had charisma, wit, knowledge and a twisted mind to accomplish his own sense of justice.Viewers connected to him, liked him, but more often than not, not understanding him, as he had a deep introvert character, hiding well behind his unique world and not letting anyone in, but a few characters who matched him and were able to connect with him, as they were basically the same with dark secrets and sophisticated minds of their own.As often happens with series going downhill in their last season, the same happened to Dexter; but bear in mind, that's not a reason, not to appreciate and love the show, with one the most memorable experiences and play by its beautiful and diamond-bright female actresses from season 2 (the brightest) up to the last one.Put yourself in his shoes, connect with his mind and way of thinking and you will get yourself dark Bliss and an unforgettable ride.Become One with Dexter!"
455,"Dexter has been a very top contender on the list of shows I've seen. The idea of having a show that is similar to Christian Bale's American Psycho was very intriguing to me. The first 5 minutes of the pilot or the hook act as I like to call it, was one of the best I have ever seen and from there onwards it had me. However it starts to slow down towards season 4,5 and 6 as most shows do that have more than 5 seasons but it picks it right back up halfway through 6 and from there on wards it's a home run. Also there are other things I'd like to point out such as the type of people he meets in later seasons and these characters are so interesting it keeps you on the edge of your seat, it's a must watch."

super beastly season. the only major downside was the abundance of relationship drama that i didn't care about. otherwise it's 9 quality (about 3 viewings)

i want to edit the season and remove every batista-laguerta relationship scene. they sucked. and what made it even worse was that i really liked his relationship with giana but i'm guessing there was some conflict where the actress was no longer available. and my continued dislike of the anton romance

the only thing i felt like i missed out on was the possibility that he gets found out and has to go on the run. like what if while killer is in custody, he starts reciting things from his mom's recordings about dexter. and the last few episodes are him on the run. they didn't go that route and i respect that. but would have been exciting"
458,"There should be a sequel focusing on the life of his son, who becomes a serial killer."
459,But apart from that this series was really exciting. If there wasn't the bad ending I would immediately watch it again.
460,"Dexter is my personal favourite TV series and for a good reason! I'm done with romantic sitcoms and unrealistic dragon shit! I was looking for something real and raw and much relatable! Dexter basically portrays a serial killer who has been programmed as a vigilante killer in order to fulfill his own drive to kill people! To hide his dark passenger which he refers to his dark past, he has to adjust in the camouflage of social code of conduct. Such adjustment leads him to live to lives one as a socially diligent person and the other being a serial killer! The show does a amazing job at juggling his life between his fake social camouflage and portraying him as a cold blooded murderer! The entire show experiences dark comedy, raw human emotions and breakdowns as dexter heads on an endeavor which has a inevitable obliteration for everyone involved around him! Simply amazing show, I love how the try to portray a serial killer and his introvert kind of personality just makes it soo realistic!"
461,"At it's best this is my favorite TV show ever. I just love the premise of a serial killer that has a code and only kills other killers. Michael C Hall plays the part perfectly! He IS Dexter now no matter what else he does. The voice over is key as it helps you to step inside the mind of a serial killer and see where your own morals stand in comparison. Basically, Showtime not only invites you to root for an anti-hero, but one that is a serial killer (gotta love it). The show also has a very good original soundtrack (not the Spanish music) that really helps put your in the mood. Seasons 1-4 are a masterpiece! After that though, some of the writers left and the show started it's descent and got stale (just a side note: Dexter is still better than 90% of TV shows at it's worst). Then there's the ending... I understand what the writers were ""trying"" to do, but it's not the ending that Dexter or the fans deserved. If it wasn't for the unsavory ending this would be my favorite TV show ever (I have to go with Breaking Bad because it got better with time and literally went out with a bang... Many of them.). I REALLY hope that Dexter returns for season 9 (or a movie) to ""wrap"" things up with an ending that both Dexter and the fans deserve. Then, just maybe, this might be my favorite TV show of all time. Until then, Dexter will have to settle for being my favorite TV CHARACTER of all time."
462,Love this show !!!! must watch this show all the way through multiple times.
463,"(This is the second part of my dexter review. If you want to read the first part, check my IMDb profile for the first part of this review)Season 5Season 5 is a little odd for me. This is another really good Dexter season, but again I feel like there was a lot of missed potential. This season we get introduced to Lumen, a rape victim, who becomes Dexter's partner somewhat like Miguel. There's actually a group of villains, the barrel girl gang, this season, but none of them are really developed except for the main villain, Jordan Chase, and even then he wasn't that developed. He was a pretty interesting villain, basically motivating people with their primal urges. I also like the watch gimmick, but apart from that, we just don't get enough of him. He did have a great scene with Dexter, where he breaks him down. I actually really hated Lumen's character at first. I mean when we first meet her, she escaped from the gang, after being raped and tortured, and she's a mess, who would do anything to survive, but they did a great job of developing her character. I actually really liked her near the end of the season. This season we also get even more development for Debra, and some great moments with Quinn, but also La Guerta really starts to become annoying. To give even more intensity to this season we get Stan Liddy who's another one of the characters who gets close to discovering Dexter, he was honestly really annoying, but in a good way. The only real complaint I have with this season, apart from what I've already mentioned, is how quickly Dexter gets over Season's 4 aftermath. I don't know, I just felt like he should've had more time to deal with it. Overall I think this is the middle section of Dexter's Seasons in terms of quality. A really solid season overall, with mostly above average episodes, but it never really teaches ""amazing"" level for me.
8.3/10Season 6Season 6 is one of the worst seasons of Dexter. I don't think it's bad necessarily, but it's just kinda okay. This season has Dexter learning about religion for some reason. I felt like it could've gone some interesting ways, but nothing really comes from it. I feel like this season as a whole is kind of a waste. I mean the entire season is basically build up to the last episode, with a big reveal, but that reveal could've easily been done last season. This season is just weird, but not in a good way. The villain just keeps going back and forth, and while he had potential, he was uninteresting. Most of this season was just not engaging. There were some really obvious and stupid reveals. the writers seemed to have gotten lazy, leaving a bunch of plot holes. There's this episode which should've easily been one of Dexter's best episode. It could've been an arc for the character even, but it's wasted in one episode, and brings up a bunch of plot holes, and really stupid things. Up until this season that was the worst episode in the series. It's just odd. Again I don't think this season is bad, I think it's just kinda okay. It does have some redeeming qualities. The finale was actually great, and the twist was fantastic. Also Quinn's and Batista's sub plot was entertaining for some reason. There was a new character, Brother Sam, he wasn't that important, but I liked him. It's just an okay season, with the finale saving it from really completely failing.
6.5/10Season 7Fortunately after one of Dexter's worst season we get one of Dexter's better seasons. Season 7 deals a lot with the repercussions of Season 6's finale. We get some seriously fantastic scenes with Jeniffer Carpenter, who plays Debra. This is when we really see her even more broken character. Dexter also has an interesting arc of actually feeling more and more. We get quite a few antagonists this season. We have Hannah McKay, Isaak Sirko, and La Guerta, with some other smaller villains. They were all surprisingly good. First I have to praise Ray Stevenson, who plays Isaak Sirko. Woah, he's another one of my favorite villains. He was so great. He's got the physical presence, and he's could probably kill Dexter with his bare hands, but he's also only doing this for love. He was one of my favorite Dexter villains. It just really disappoints me how early they got rid of him. He could've easily been the main villain of the season. This season also has a lot of missed opportunities. Last season we get introduced to Greene, who's another one of those characters who gets close to discovering Dexter's secret, and he had the potential to be a great villain, but he's wasted pretty early on. I do have to say this season also has some of the best side villains. Usually Dexter would have a weekly villain, but instead of having them for one episode, they use them for a few more, which really made these smaller villains much better. This season has a lot going on. Most of the characters have something to do which is great. It just feels like the writers really tried their hardest to give us one last great seasons before the completely ruin it in the final season. Once again this season had some really intense moments especially near the finale, when LaGuerta starts to suspect Dexter as the bay harbor butcher. I think she was built up really well, because she really becomes unlikeable in the last few seasons, and this makes her a great antagonist. The finale was another intense episode, and again Jeniffer Carpenter gives an amazing performance. This is probably the season with the most sub plots, and missed opportunities unfortunately, but it is one of my favorites nonetheless. I do have to say, while Dexter's arc is interesting, some things that happened with Hannah McKay really started to annoy me. Overall though this is one of my favorite seasons. There were a lot of missed opportunities unfortunately. It had so much more potential, but at the same it brought us a lot of great moments. Isaak Sirko is amazing, Debra is amazing. Most of the characters have something to do, which was a little bit of an issue in previous seasons. I just really enjoyed this season despite some disappointments.
8.6/10Season 8The final season, and unfortunately the worst. I think what really annoyed me is that it actually had a pretty good start. It introduced some new concepts, but they're all wasted. The big twists from the finale are resolved so easily. Characters have nothing to do Anymore. We have this weird sub plot with Masuka that doesn't go anywhere. The villain had a lot of potential, but he's forgotten for many episodes. Dexter has done a great job of not relying on filler, but this season is basically mostly filler. It's just so disappointing. Like Season 6 I don't think this is a bad season either. In fact despite all the complaints I just mentioned it does have a lot of redeeming qualities, but it's just so disappointing for the final season, and the finale is really stupid. I really liked this sub plot with a potential apprentice for Dexter, but it was wasted. Dr. Evelyn was a good addition to the cast, and I enjoyed a lot of the scenes with her, but she becomes a little dumb later on. I liked the sub plot with Elway and the private investigators. Dexter's cinematography has been mostly average, but this season suddenly gets some really good cinematography to be honest. Also the music has been solid for the entire series, but I think this season gets some of the better tracks. Unfortunately it keeps getting worse as the season continues, until it reaches its worst episode yet in the finale. Like the season overall I think the finale started off pretty well too. I wasn't liking the direction it was going, but I was willing to accept it. For most of the episodes I was thinking to myself ""this isn't as bad as everyone says"" but then it seriously becomes stupid. How could such a great show just fade away in such a lame way. It ruins the character development that Dexter has had, and it tries to make it feel like it's a genius ending, when it makes no sense, and is filled with plot holes. It's just bad and disappointing.
5.9/10
To sum my thoughts on the overall series. Dexter is a seriously great, and viciously entertaining show. It's just so good and I really recommend it. The start is definitely better than the end. It stumbles more on the second half of the show, but most of the cast is so great even the more disappointing seasons are still quite entertaining. I wish this series went on longer because there were still a lot of things they could've done. It really disappoints me how badly it ended, but I'm still glad I watched the entire show because it's truly great.The average score of the seasons is about an 8/10, but I'd personally give the overall show an 8.5/10."
464,"(This is part 1 of 2 of my Dexter Review. If you want to read the whole thing, check my IMDb profile for the other part.)I finally watched Dexter after many people recommending it. I have to say I really loved it.
I'm gonna go through each season and give it my thoughts without any big spoilers, and in the bottom give a rating for the season, and the overall rating of the show will be based on the averages of every season.
Season 1Season 1 introduces us to our surprisingly lovable and charismatic serial killer. I was instantly drawn Michael C Hall's great performance as the psychopathic protagonist, Dexter Morgan. All of the cast was really good too, however I wish they gave the side characters a little more development. They're all really well written and acted. Debra Morgan, Dexter's sister, was actually one of the best characters in the series. At first I thought she was a superficial character, but we soon see how broken she is. All the characters have their distinct personality and function. Even the least developed character, Masuka, just brings some needed comedy to the series. I really like how we see the transformation of Dexter through flashbacks, and visions of his father, Harry, James Remar, who does a great job. The mystery of the identity of the ice truck killer is engaging. The identity was also pretty unpredictable in my opinion. I genuinely didn't see coming who it was. If I have any gripes with this season it would be that the villain could've maybe been a bit more developed, and had more of a distinct personality. I found his reveal a bit odd and even somewhat cliche. In fact like I mentioned earlier, most of the side characters aren't developed enough. I do love how focused the initial season of Dexter is, but we really don't know much of these side characters. Overall though this season was great. It gives us a feel for the dark, violent and even funny at times, but surprisingly well thought out series. A lot of sub plots are set up, and they all come together in the finale really well to set up the next season. This is one of Dexter's better seasons.
8.8/10Season 2Season 2 continues to improve after Dexter's first season, bringing us a genuinely exciting and even more intense season. We've been introduced to most of the main cast now, so we're able to just jump into the story. Instead of having a traditional villain, this season has Dexter as the bay harbor butcher, who's being investigated by the Miami Police Department, and FBI. I have to praise Erik King as James Doakes. He was seriously fantastic. He was set up last season as one of the only people to suspect Dexter, and he's still one of my favorite characters after 6 seasons. He brought some serious intensity to the show. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times with Dexter's and Doakes' interactions. They're also supported by another antagonist Lila. While she isn't one of Dexter's greatest villains, she was pretty solid, and she was genuinely annoying at times, which I'm sure was the intention. Also she brought together Dexter's family sub plots with Rita and the kids, which greatly improved from last season. They were basically introduced last season, but this season we really see that Dexter really starts to care about this family, and all the characters improve. There's also another character, Frank Lundy, who's another character who gets close to discovering Dexter's secret. He was another great addition to the show. I will admit that the season finale was a little disappointing. It all gets resolved a little too convenient. The sub plots, and arcs of the story and characters don't all culminate. Some of them end earlier. Also coming off of Doakes' storyline they had too much to live up to, but it was still a solid finale, and it excites you for the next season. I do wish this season was later on in the show. It could've easily been the final season, but because of it only being the second season it had to wrap up so simply. Overall this was just an improvement over the first season in almost every way. We got more development for the characters, one of the most intense episodes of Dexter ever, and just more of what I came to love from the first season.
9.1/10Season 3Unfortunately Season 3 of Dexter is one of Dexter's weaker season. Its solid nonetheless, but coming from the really great Seasons 1 and 2 they stumbled a bit with this season. This season we see Dexter kill someone by accident, and get introduced to Miguel Prada, who becomes his partner of sorts. I think Miguel Prado's interactions with Dexter were the highlight of this season. This new dynamic with the characters was fresh, and really interesting. However I feel like there was a lot of missed potential here. There was another villain, the skinner, but we barely see anything with him. He's by far the most underdeveloped villain. However it Miguel Prada was pretty great, even though if he could've been better. We also get introduced to Joey Quinn this season. He doesn't do much this season, but he becomes one of my favorite characters later on. We also get even more of Dexter's family, and we soon find out he's going to become a father. I wasn't really a fan of the family at first, but they keep improving, and I think the family sub plot really came together this season. This season doesn't really feel like it ever takes off though. It's a lot of back and forth, and while this back and forth is usually good, it just never really hits the levels of ""Amazing"" like Seasons 1 and 2.
8.1/10Season 4The best season (In my opinion). This season we get introduced to John Lithgow as The Trinity Killer... WOAH He was so great. My favorite villain in the entire series, and one of my favorite villains in any series. He brings Dexter's biggest twist, more intensity, and I was just left speechless by him. He was just amazing. I can't praise him enough. This is the best season of Dexter in my opinion. Definitely my favorite. This season really focuses more on Dexter's family, and how he balances both of his lives. We get to see the contrast between Dexter and Trinity even though they live 2 lives in a similar way. We get Dexter's Son. We get Lundy back, which was nice. We really get a feel of Debra's broken character. We just get Dexter's best villain, and we really get to see his struggles with his double life. I just can't praise this season enough, I just loved it. The only real complaint I have with this season, is some stupid things Dexter does near the middle of the season, but I think that also adds to the series on a whole. This is when we really see Dexter's mistakes, and their consequences. Also this has the biggest collection of ""Amazing"" episodes in any other season for me. I want to talk more about it, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone, I just absolutely loved this season.
9.4/10"
465,"I think the story writer has a tendency to make the audience fall in love with a character and then kill it off! Through all the 8 seasons, many important characters have died and in really unexpected ways. Even though I didn't like it, the death of James Doakes adds some value to the story. So no complaint about that. I was shaken up by the death of Rita. But the finale was impossible for me to take. How can you kill Debra Morgan? Worst ending ever! I know, serial killers are not supposed to have a happy ending. Yet, I was hoping for a better ending. It was a 10/10 show for me until they killed Debra! It was totally meaningless!"
466,"First two seasons were truly masterpieces, i would say they were one of the best seasons from every series. Third season was average- not bad, not good either. Fourth season was great because of Trinity, not that good as first two seasons but still very enjoyable. Now it's getting only worse. Fifth season was totally crap. Boring killers, boring plot, nothing interesting. Sixth season had a good serial killer(s), really creative kills, and that all's pros of this season. Seventh season was cool for like 2 episodes because of Debra's realization about Dexter, but then it was just boring. And the worst one- season eight. Jesus Christ it isn't even worth mentiong. Ending had soooo much potential but they screwed it really hard. Exambles:
-Dexter's friends didn't realise that he was a serial killer
-Debra death
-Zach death (he had so much potential to replace Dexter)
-Dexter abandoning his son and becoming a lumberjack(???)From seasons 1-4 Dexter is one of my favourite shows. But seasons 5-8 are just crap. I don't recommend watching it after season 4."
467,There comes a point in a series where lies and secrets can only go so far before the plots become ridiculous. This is one such series. The premise is otherwise intriguing and it is well acted. Worth a watch.
468,"I loved everything about this series. Dexter is a likeable character, it made me question the morality of his actions. I viewed him as a vigilante. I found it very easy to be emersed in the story.Dexter is a blood splatter analyst but he's also a serial killer. He only kills other serial killers, hard criminals and those who commit serious crimes. He won't kill people who are innocent civilians.Throughout the story you find out more information about his family, his upbringing, his childhood etc and the plot thickens.He was adopted as a child and got very close with his step sister who he keeps at arms length. She starts to get suspicious regarding dexter and his secrets.I don't want to give too much away or give any spoilers but it's definitely worth a watch. It's a fast moving series with lots of twists. If you enjoy crime, suspense, plot twists and TV shows about serial killers this is definitely a binge worthy option."
469,"This show is a masterpiece, it makes sit on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. It took me about 6 months to watch this show, while dealing with starting with college so at times it was hard to even want to spend time to watch a 40-60 minute long episode. I eventually got so in to it that I binged watched more that half the show in under a month and that with it's amazing plot made want to continue on. Once you start the show you wonder how he is ever going to get caught. Once I got to the last season I had realized the finale got such a low rating for such a good show, which made me want to finish it faster because in some way they pissed off their audience. To my realization the series finale was the saddest episode of any t.v. that I had ever watched, but the ending was perfect. Throughout the show he mentions that what he has done affects people's lives and ruining some. Ultimately the show ends with everyone that he knew and love thinks he did and almost everyone that knew his secret is dead, while he is alive I having to live the rest of his life with what he did. This show's ending made me cry not only for the sad episode but with the fact that I finished the show and my experience watching this show was over. It was something completely different and I loved it and after finishing this show I'm glad that they ended it right but I'm sad that I finished it."
470,"Dexter is a guy who has urges
You will love his personality through out the seasons
I wish I could see more season but sadly it's not gonna happen
The serie is the best in its genre
This is a Rated R serie
It has a lot of blood , black humor and sex scenes
Also a lot of adult topics"
471,It was Thrilling. Ending of every episode makes us Thinking.. but the Ending of the whole series could have been better.
472,"One of the best tv shows i'd ever recogmend for anyone to watch
yes it's true that the show takes a ""dark theme"" one can say but even if you don't llike horors/...
this masterpiece is just so well put togheter it's unbelivable
with a great story great cast great acting great evrything... from the lighting to the amaing and simple soundtrack just beautifully and will allways say one of the best tv show's i'v ever seenaltroght the show misrepresents real psycosis it's very very well done interesting and looks realistic-looks amazing
just a must watch for anyone who dident allready... just......."
473,"The beginning of the show was absolutely perfect and I loved every single episode. I loved how they gave Dexter's point of view and his character was different. I'd say all the way until the last season was very good. The last season however was very bad though how they ended things with all the characters. I just finished the show and I'm wondering why they added the last 2 minutes of the show to the last episode. I would've been okay if they had ended it with Dexter being dead, but then they added the part where he was still alive and working for a lumber company. I don't get this ending at all. You can really tell the directors of the show had no direction and just wanted to end this completely so they had to ""kill"" off the main characters. I'm absolutely disappointed, but I'd still watch this show over again just because of the beginning seasons. They were that good! Even with the worst ending to a season/ show I still give this a solid 8 star out of 10 because it is worth the watch. I've had this show recommended to me prior, but I never gave it the time of day. I would really recommend this show myself."
474,"I have seen the entire series about 3 times now. This has to be the best show ever made. Michael c Hall is amazing as is the rest of the cast. In some ways I hope they do not do a 9th season because it should be left where it is but seeing Dexter back again would be awesome! Brilliant acting, great story lines. And the right mixture of violence, humour and sex. I defy anyone to not enjoy this show!"
475,"Honestly, I have seen many TV series over the years but none of previous series can be compared to 'Dexter'. At first I thought 'Wow he's narrating his own life? Boring but after third episode, not so boring.In fact, from the very first episode you know who is who, what their job is, but what Dexter Morgan is? At first he's a mystery. Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under, Kill Your Darling), Jennifer Carpenter (Quarantine, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), David Zayas (The Following, Bloodline), James Remar (Hawaii-5 O, Grey's Anatomy), C.S. Lee (The Stepford Wives, Chuck), Lauren Velez (Law & Order, How To Get Away with Murder), Desmond Harrington (Dragnet, The Dark Knight Rises), Julie Benz (Supernatural, Defiance, and Hawaii-5 O), and finally Keith Carradine (Criminal Minds, The Californians, NCIS, and Madam Secretary); the whole cast brought the whole book into a live-series 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' by Jeff Lindsay.The music, the ambiance, the plots, subplots, the Miami and California background; two cultures merging together, and the guest stars were excellently done by the HBO team. John Dahl, Steve Shill, Keith Gordon, Marcos Siega, Ernest R. Dickerson, Romeo Tirone, Michael Cuesta, Tony Goldwyn, S.J. Clarkson, Jeff Lindsay, James Manos Jr., Drew Greenberg, Daniel Cerone, and many other gifted crew members created something different.Hopefully, someday the gifted crew members and the talented main cast members may come back; and give us closing episode(s) after the last events on the show, which aired on September 2013. I'm sure there's more to the story and I'm sure that Steve Shill, Jeff Lindsay, Clyde Phillips, and Melissa Greenberg won't disappoint."
476,"Unbelievable. I wait 10 years to start watching this show and I'm surprised by the quality of this show.Through the years I see too many good shows, but Dexter definitely ranks top 10 in my personal book. Dexter is a complicated character, but I never found a good reason to hate him and the performance of Michael C. Hall was truly outstanding. In this times where too many shows are produced in national TV, Netflix or Hulu; I'm just grateful to find an excellent show that can match and in some way overcome series like Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad or True Detective. The reality is that this show is not for everyone, but if you like the thriller and drama:this is the kind of TV show that you're looking for."
477,"The overall plot of the show is obviously based on his sociopath serial killer ways. However, Dexter turns out to be more than what meets the eye. There is never a dull moment in the city of Miami with Dexter around! If you are looking for a jaw dropping, mind- perplexing, jaw-dropping series, Dexter is the perfect fit for you! Dexter is without a doubt the best T.V. series I have seen in a while. Despite Dexter's clear routine, which is apparent in the opening of the show, you never know what he's going to do next. Dexter is an exciting thriller that'll leave you wanting to watch non-stop yet also take a break because of the HEAT it brings in every single episode.What I like: -Michael C. Hall portrays the character Dexter in such a way that brings depth to the mind of a sociopath. -The whole cast of Dexter did an exceptional job playing their characters. -The goriness of it all; blood, dismemberment, foul play!*how exciting!* -Dexter's transformationWhat I dislike: -...There is nothing that I don't like about this series!Definitely worth 10/10 stars, I'd give it more if I could!"
478,"What can I even say about Dexter? All 8 seasons have sent me through a roller-coaster of emotions that I cannot even begin to process. The feeling I have in the pit of my stomach, the racing heart I feel within my chest; any Netflix (or otherwise) binge-watcher will know. I always thought I felt that way about Breaking Bad; but I now know I will never feel the same way as I do with Dexter. Through each series you grow more and more attached to each character (yes even Masuka); which I have never once experienced with anything else. You can feel a small part of every character's personality traits within yourself; and while trying to stay within the IMDb guidelines as far as possible, I must let my inner Debra come through when I say; what the F**K kind of F***KING ending is that to leave me?! I have never been so torn apart inside. Deb's death is so painful, the thought of Quinn being left behind is killing me. The fact Dexter staged his short lived death and is now alone and miserable kills me; Harrison and Hannah being left behind kills me; the thought of Hannah having to tell Harrison about his Dad being gone after his Mother was already killed in front of him kills me. If there is not another season or at least a movie to follow I don't know what I will do. Genuinely how do I go about my life now?Please, I am now begging; show me how all the characters left behind are dealing with this? Mr. James Manos Jr. ; please write some sort of explanation so I can stop obsessing over this and write the papers I have been putting off for (honestly I couldn't tell you how long it took me to watch all 8 seasons but i think it may have been just short of a month) so long so I can move on with my life and not fail college! In all seriousness now; your work on Dexter is phenomenal at the very least. Thank you for bringing these characters into my life."
479,"Started watching Dexter about the time it aired. At first I though it would be a boring show with no significant characters and plot. As i watched the whole first season though I was amazed. The show is full of smart characters with interesting back story. As for Dexter himself, although he is a serial killer he is capable of making all the viewers love him. As a down to earth and self conscious character he serves justice in his own way. I can't think of any other actor who could have performed as Dexter better than Michal C. Hall. His performance fits perfectly the character of this serial killer. All the seasons are amazing and I highly recommend everyone to watch them. On the other hand though, the series finale could be way better, if Dexter ended up dead and not becoming a redneck lumberjack (?)."
480,"Dexter is a brilliant thriller. One is forced to binge-watch this series to know what happens next. The main character, Dexter, a serial killer, is both dysfunctional, brilliant and lovable. Each season is wonderfully plotted and paced and gives one the satisfaction of seeing this series achieve the next plateau. The only downside, and truly, the only downside, is the disappointing ending. I didn't see it coming and considering the quality of scriptwriting up till then and the build-up of expectancy throughout the series - it was a let-down. It could have been really epic buildup and ending - a shame. Otherwise, fabulous acting and a great story overall. Still worth watching."
481,"It is one of my all time best shows ever. I love Dexter & Deb's characters. Dexter is a most Intelligent Serial Killer because He is a Forensics Technician and works for Miami Metro PD. Dialogues are short and clever. I like every part of the show like story writing, characters, casting, dialogues. The most I like about this show is the way Dexter narrates everything. Dexter & Deb are the best brother & sister. Their brother sister bonding is very nice. Every episode is interesting & thrilling. The way how the Dexter story ends in the 8th season final episode is very nice. It is unpredictable & unexpected. Its Very heart touching. This is a perfect show with no errors. This is a must watch show for people who like watching Crime, Drama, mystery and thriller genres."
482,"Great show! Instead of a typical good vs evil where the good guy kills the bad guys, the bad guy kills the bad guys and the good guy gets blown up in a shack! 11/10 fantastic show I didn't enjoy at first then before I knew it i'd watched 8 seasons on binge. well IMDb says i have to write more so i'll say the depth of Micheal C Hall's character makes you wonder about Micheal's own possible dark passenger lol. This show is riveting, disturbing, funny, pensive at times, and most importantly it's just great TV. if you like true crime you'll love dexter. i've said all I can say aside from thank you for your time in reading my piece"
483,"One of my favorite shows without doubt, although he stayed a bit in the shadow of Breaking Bad and in the last chapter as controversial. It is a series that enjoyed chapter to another and that undoubtedly, would see, so for me because, Dexter is a 10 series, totally recommended if you're wondering whether to start to see it or not !!Season to season increases the tension, I saw this series less than a week for each chapter was more addictive than earlier and he could not stop.Certainly there are bad reviews, I remember that was the reason writers strike that left the last part of the series and loose little crazy, but once you arrive you do not care, you're so involved Dexter the character you want to see how this story ends, and eye! The finish is very controversial but that does not have to be bad, there was many disappointed people but other people also liked. For I could have been something else but, as I said, my memory of this series is global not just the last part.A greeting!"

485,"Dexter is a show that, for the first season or so, blows you out of the water. The characterization done throughout this show into the mind of a vigilante sociopath is not only captivating, but tends to leave you with a thousand inferences rather than a thousand answers. You decide : is Dexter a hero or a villain? However, we see a pattern of appearances that is so often portrayed throughout crime shows; of a crime scene almost every episode, and a large portion of overplayed Drama on a case-by-case basis. Though Dexter does break this cycle from time to time, I can't help feeling a bit disappointed in what the show could have been if more focused on the inner- workings and turmoil of Dexter himself; and his perception of various things throughout the series. What sets Dexter apart from other shows is it's unique glimpse into the mind of a madman, who is distant yet relatable. Though the series has capitalized on this aspect, and the essence of psychological thriller that is increasingly ever-present; It seems to have quite a bit of wasted potential.All-in-all Dexter is a Novel and Captivating show worthy of your time. Though it has it's shortcomings, and at times feels repetitious, it makes up for this in deep psychological profiling."
486,"I would've given Dex 10 stars but the final season (8) seemed rushed and thrown together. The final episode left a lot to be desired, too. But up until that point, I was giving it 10 all the way. Sorry Dex. Also, in the beginning, Michael (Dex) and Jennifer (Deb) weren't married. There were no tell-tale signs that the relationship changed between the off-camera couple around the 2nd season, which was great. The writers handled it very well. But then when they divorced around season 6, it seemed that (even though they claim it was amicable) you could tell on set. It was strange. Palpable even that Jennifer seemed a little scornful. All-in-all, great show, just little things caused me to give 8 stars. I read that MCH wasn't happy with his salary toward the end, too...so that could be why they wrapped it up so fast in season 8."
487,"I almost always never forwarded through the opening credits to this show. one of the best opening credits. I would say it is not everybody's cup of tea. You almost feel for Dexter you know and the other characters seem more evil than he is but i bet that is what the director was going for. Just like many shows off late with plenty of deaths. Many important characters too. Some you wish didn't have to die more than others off course. It is really fast paced too. Just like many shows like Lost, Sopranos and Quantum Leap the ending was slightly disappointing but probably inevitable and most definitely I wouldn't come up with a better ending though I am tempted to try."
488,"I just finished binge-watching all 8 seasons of Dexter. The show is a unique look into a psychopath killer, Dexter, that was raised and groomed by a cop father to kill serial killers. He tries to balance his ""normal life"" (a facade, in the beginning) that the outside world sees, with his ""Dark Passenger"", the need to kill. Dexter provides the best character development of any series I have watched. Michael C. Hall as Dexter was perfect. Jennifer Carpenter as Debra, his cop sister, was perfect. Each episode/season was tense, dramatic and hilarious without being forced. There were times when it became redundant and predictable, but those feelings never lasted. Although the finale was on the lame side, it sat well with me now that I have had time to absorb it. If you want a different kind of show to watch, Dexter is it."
489,"This review will be covering what I thought of ALL of Seasons 1 and 2. If you haven't watched up to this point please stop reading as spoilers are ahead. Dexter Morgan works for the Miami Police Department as a blood spatter analyst, while he's not helping the Police Department, he finds and kills the people who fall through the justice system following the strict code taught to him by his foster farther and legendary cop Harry Morgan.Dexter is an extremely good TV show. Is it as of high quality at The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad, for me, not quite but I'm only two seasons in and it has bags of potential to just to get better and better. This show as a truly great cast, the acting of Michael Hall as Dexter Morgan is fantastic he really shows how empty he is inside and the few times he is angry it blew me away, the true intensity he showed made it even more believable and dragged you deeper into the show. I loved Jennifer Carpenter's character, Off. Debra Morgan from the start, the foul mouthed cop, is brilliant and grew immensely as the show goes on. Supporting actors like David Zayas who plays the super good guy Sgt. Angel Batista, C.S. Lee plays Vince Masuka who is the comic relief of the show with plenty of rude sex jokes and references throughout which as of yet have not got annoying and Julie Benz who, surprised me, at the start i didn't think id like her character but she really comes into her own. She plays Dexter's girlfriend, he uses her, as another layer of the 'I am normal' mask he wears to shield everyone from the monstrous killer he truly is. All this great acting is one thing but what makes it is the extraordinary writing, it helps the actors and show in general for me go from good to great. The unpredictability keeps it fresh and exciting. Having so many different tones across just one episode as well keeps you on your toes one of my favourite parts of the show is hearing Dexters thoughts like this one: 'I can kill a man, dismember his body, and be home in time for Letterman. But knowing what to say when my girlfriend's feeling insecure  I'm totally lost.' This is just one of many, all very amusing and interesting. The storyline is interesting too not only do you get the intriguing concept of dexter himself having to hide from the whole world but deeper story lines about his foster farther, his real mother and his brother. All these twist and turns make for one hell of a show and I can genuinely say it has left me with my jaw open more than once. The cinematography is quite interesting too as the show is about dexter and what happens in his life you don't get the incredible landscape shots that are available in shows like Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy I think they should take advantage of this just because he's just in Miami 90% of the time doesn't mean you cant have some nice widescreen shots. The first two seasons of Dexter were entertaining and think it is worth watching and I will be continuing my Netflix binge very soon. The two seasons are a very strong 9/10 overall."
490,"No other show even comes close. The character development in this show is phenomenal and incredibly well done. While watching the show, you grow incredibly invested in the characters. They feel real-as if you know them personally. The development of Dexter and Debra's characters is intricate and incredibly thought-provoking. I had this show and its characters on my mind long after the closing scene of the series finale. I had to tell myself multiple times that these characters were just that. Characters. This show kept me on the edge of my seat more often than not. The twists and turns and surprises were aplenty! If you need a new, addicting show to binge-watch, look no further. This is the one!!!!!!!"
491,"The life of Dexter portrayed in a very different tone. Every episode of this show starts with same video theme. The most attractive part for me is the background voice of DEXTER and at the same moment every thing goes into slow motion and he describes his feelings in his own voice. He seems to be different from others and he really is. When he tries to fake human emotions that part of Dexter is awesome. The story line of every season makes you addicted of this show. You will always want to see how he manage his normal or i should better say fake life and his real life(serial killer's life). The way he finds convicts by using his own set of rules which was given by his father to him is damn good. In the whole series Dexter's father(not biological) is not alive but he talk to him, this will make you an addictive of this show, at every point when he gets into some kind of dilemma and try to solve that.His dark life and changes in his fake life with every season make u more curious about this show. At last i can say that this is really addictive so stay away if you don't want to get addicted. Good luck"
492,"Dexter is a revolution the experience of getting to know a serial killer...He find himself the best at hiding his killing stints.And he is. The mix of his narrative and the cameras angles makes us feel like Dexter is always the victim,when he is not.It is incredible how we only discover important things when he does too.There is some kind of manipulation to make what he say and do sounds ""explainable"" and that makes this TV show amazing... Whenever you are watching you feel what Dexter can't feel,for example: Sad,sorry...The only thing that he feels is the need of Killing. It is a great TV show and I personally recommend it to everyone.It never gets boring or annoying,because the more you get to know the wolf,the more you stop seeing the sheep as a victim."
493,"Swearing doesn't really bother me. A well placed swear word serves as an efficient point enhancer. But Debra's mouth got old pretty f*cken fast. It was like she (the writers) was (were) trying too hard. She has a filthy mouth...got it! I stopped watching in the golfing scene with Dexter & the septuagenarian in the fifth season. Partially because of the growing predictability (gee will Dexter barely squeeze out of this oneagain?) But mostly because the show crossed that line from swearing (f*ck, sh*t p*ss, etc) to blaspheming. To wit, the old man in golf scene: ""J___s F*cken C___t"" Maybe I'm getting old or maybe I'm now realizing you don't have to insult someone's religion in order to make a point in a dialogue."
494,"YES! YES! YES! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THAAAAAANK YOUUUUUUU! My wish finally came true! A serial killer who only kills SERIAL KILLERS! This has everything I want; a ruthless serial killer but merciful for the weak; executioner for the guilty but protector of the innocent; mind of a monster but heart of a hero. Dexter Morgan reminds me of Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho"" only less of a yuppie (and doesn't kill innocent people) and more of a quiet blood annalist. In fact, this is better than ""American Psycho."" When your fed up with the bad guy getting away with it you can count on Dexter Morgan to put him out of your misery, and he doesn't do it nicely. He's like the Terminator; he just never stops and considering his motivations and with how the world is, why would you want him to stop? Every kill he makes is like feeding a painful and long awaited hunger. If you like good revenge shows or justice prevailed in the most sinister manner, this show is right up your ally. One of my favorite shows and my fantasy finally given life!"
495,"Orphaned at the age of three and harboring a traumatic secret, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) was adopted by Miami policeman, Harry Morgan (James Remar), who recognized his homicidal tendencies and taught him to channel his gruesome passion for human dissection in a ""constructive"" way — by killing only heinous criminals (such as child molesters, mob assassins, rapists, serial killers of the innocent etc.) who have slipped through the justice system. To satisfy his interest in blood and to facilitate his own crimes, Dexter works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department). Although his drive to kill is unflinching, he is able to emulate normal emotions and keep up his appearance as a socially-responsible human being."
496,"I have been a faithful fan of Dexter since its inception, agreeing completely with the notion that justice comes in a shade of gray rather than being black or white. Imagine my disappointment when the series ended on such a punishing tone for Dexter. It seems to me that the whole point of the show has been obliterated by one final episode. Nevertheless, I don't regret watching Dexter because it has given me a unique opportunity to see things from the perspective of a criminal and a murderer, instead of that of a officer of the law. I has surprised me like few TV shows have done before. The twists in the story line have always kept me glued to the screen. I believe that the wild success of the series originates from Dexter's frankness as in regards to what he is, a killer, and the way his acts prove he's actually capable of deeper emotions than most normal human beings. I recommend Dexter openly because it has revolutionized the 'small- screen' industry and it breaks barriers and floods the mind with new views on the human psyche."
497,"Jennifer were stunning in season 7 on Dexter, when i saw she didn't get nominee for season 7 i was so upset! I hope she gets nominated for season 8 this year, if she doesn't, as Yvonne S. said, I WILL EAT MY SHORTS AND START A RIOT! she deserves it, she's such a good actress, With Debra, she entered into her so deep, Her final scene of ""Remember the monsters"" and then the flashback, She made me cry a lot, I will never ever forget about this character, and this is not only because the story of Deb, it's also because of the good Job Jennifer made, and I really think she deserves some recognizement, even if season 8th ending was really disappointing, I think she kind of saved the show at the end (of course it is just my honest opinion)"
498,"Dexter, the perfectly chosen person for the psychopath part. If I was an actor, this guy would be my role model. He is Michael C. Hall who can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast. I used to tell ALL of my friends to come over and watch it with me until the got really possessed with ""Dexter"" as I do. I could Engage my self watching any other TV series because I was so hung up on Dexter's story so bad. The last 3 episode's were a complete huge shock for me, as I didn't at all expect neither of what he did with his sister nor to himself. Plus the way it ended, was the breath taking part. While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. It is the best combination of Drama, Suspense, Comedy, Thriller type of shows, which is the absolutely the most interesting and the best. Times was flying when I used to watch the episodes all day long. I really had amazing time watching this series. Hope this cast will work together again."
499,"Favorite among the favorites, Dexter is a dear darling of all favorite TV shows. There is no comparison to any show as to how this series is a brilliant and bloody show of all time.There is a charismatic aura to this monster that you can't help but feel intrigued and fascinated no matter how dangerous he is like a moth to a flame. Every character is vivid and lively and interesting and i don't know how else to describe it other than the word shiny. And the storyline is just brilliant and bloody fantastic.I didn't start this series until this series was well into it's eight season. And i am glade to have waited it out till it's last otherwise i would not have survived the wait after the end of every season. Probably i would have become Dexter myself just to feel the same excitement as when i watch this show. I have already watched this series like 6 times over and over again. With the end of the series, Dexter has left a big hollow inside me that hungers for just the same bloody brilliant DEXTER.The most lovable SERIAL KILLER PSYCHOPATH of all time."
500,"Well..Dexter meets your standards if you're looking for a show that keeps you running with it's strong touch and storyline.In other words, it's simply interesting,the way they created it.The script,the story,the acting....everything is so damn good.I wasn't much involved into that kind of genre before but it happened like it always does(accidental or by fate you can say).Anyways...if you're looking for a serial killer/mystery related thing then this is your Show.I remember when i started watching the first episode of Season 1 & liked it so much & after the completion of whole season,i kinda fell in love with the show.Then season 2,3,4,5,6,7 & now recently saw the final episode of 8th season & i was like... ""I'M GONNA MISS YOU DEX.""The acting of Michael C Hall(Dexter) is Brilliant as He totally fits into the Character which he was assigned to.Loved the acting style of Jennifer Carpenter(Debra),The role of James Remar(Harry Morgan) was amazing.And most importantly,with the support of other excellent members of the cast, i must say:You're gonna Love it!No need to describe the PLOT as you all know what the Storyline/Plot Summary is.So,nothing else to say i guess...As far as the Rating goes, i give it 10/10 because it became my Favorite Show.Watch it by yourself and i believe you're gonna rate it not less then 9/10.A serial-killer....Full of Suspense...Romance...Thrill...Blood...and i'm telling ya again, "" You're gonna LOVE the DARKNESS. """
501,"No point in describing what this show's about, as you've probably already read about it. This show starts out great, with seasons 1-2 providing satisfying thrills and twists, drama and dark humor. Season 3 is a step down, but season 4 picks-up again and provides the show's climax.Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. From season 5 on wards, the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous, repetitive and badly-written. Characters become stupid and uninteresting, dialogues are unconvincing. Major plot events appear to happen by coincidences, and other developments are too incredible to happen, even within the show's wild premise.Seems the show takes a steep nosedive from season 5 and on."
502,"The show is definitely not for the squeamish. As you would have to need a really good stomach. To really see this show. As Michael C Hall plays the title character with being a nice guy but inside that nice guy, a killer lurks.But here is the catch to everything. As Dexter kills the serial killers. Or killers that escape from justice. As he feels that he needs to do it himself.Sure he has gotten himself in trouble many times, from his own department to the feds. And really despite meaning well, and killing those that need to be stopped.But it seems the end is really coming near for Dexter and his antics. As Showtime says the eighth season will be it's last.Don't try this at home kids!"
503,"The acting and plotting are the highlights. Terrific casting and high writing standards - especially the dialogue - keep this going (I've seen Seasons 1-4).You do have to suspend considerable disbelief. For example, nobody locks their cars or homes, regardless of how scared they are; Dexter apparently never sleeps; is never missed even when he goes overseas; has the energy of ten men; is invisible when on the job; etc. This put me off at first and for a long time I avoided the show, thinking it was a poor derivative of the books.But in fact it is very good on its own. The exceptional things outweigh all of the negatives and shortcuts, and I'm really glad I gave it another chance. Recommended."
504,"Six Feet Under's Michael C. Hall is still dealing with death, just in a different way. In this adaptation of Jeff Lindsay's novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"" Hall stars as a forensics pathologist who moonlights as a serial killer. (He's not all evil, though; he only murders bad guys.) The first season of Showtime's ""Dexter"" is some of the best television I have ever seen. It is extremely dark material, probably the darkest TV of all time. It tries to get into the head of a serial killer, and it succeeds. What is particularly disturbing is that the viewer comes to identify with Dexter, almost hoping he lives to kill for another day. Correct: this is not for the faint of heart. Each episode is like a movie, with deeply cinematic qualities. Gorgeous cinematography, interesting dialogue, and smashing editing. Dexter is played by Michael C. Hall, who became a star via that other premium-cable pioneer, ""Six Feet Under."" Hall is absolutely superb. This character gives him a gigantic stretch, and Hall grabs the bull by the horns with gusto. The supporting characters are almost as interesting as Dexter, especially Dexter's sister, played by Hall's real-life wife, Jennifer Carpenter. I cannot believe that Carpenter hasn't gotten more praise for her work here. She brings this young woman's insecurity and cockiness to life in ways that I think make television history."
505,"There are very few shows out there (of which I had heard good things and so purchased on DVD after missing the airings on TV), of which I have felt absolutely 'compelled' to watch the next episode immediately... even if it meant I was awake until 3am or 4am, and yet knew I had to be up early the next day! Occasional shows have kept my attention so well, that I happened to 'chain-watch' episodes in one sitting, until the whole series had finished, and I physically had no DVDs left to put in the machine! The ones that spring to mind so far are: Journeyman (although, guttingly, they only ever made the one series), Prison Break, Peep Show (British), Friends, King Of Queens, and without doubt, Dexter. So if you have never really given this show a proper look, then please do so. You may lose a few nights, all-in-one-go, to this show, and may have a few 'zombie' days at work... but you will be immensely rewarded with unique entertainment like you have never seen before. And I don't think they could have found a more suitable actor to play the part of Dexter the serial-killer. I guess for those of us who watched Michael C. Hall in 'Six Feet Under', we were kind of already familiar with seeing him in a 'dark humour' role, but to be honest, it is too far a stretch to describe this show as black-comedy, because, although there are a few comedic moments in the show, it is definitely a true drama in its substance. But for something that many people describe as a 'dark' drama, it is surprisingly light viewing. By that, I mean, that for a show which focuses mostly on a serial-killer, it is not that heavy-going in the way that it is not a total gore-fest! There is a lot more to the show than meets the eye. It is not all about killing and torture. There are obviously going to be a few quease-inducing moments if you are of that inclination, but surprisingly, the producers of the show have been able to prevent alienating a massive part of the viewing public by doing it all without you having to see graphic violence. And this element of the drama definitely does not define what it actually is in its substance. There are many characters in the show which also give decent airtime, and each one of these characters is deliciously complicated. So we not only see elements of these characters which we then want to see more of, but, we get drawn into the psychology behind the characters too, which is ultimately fascinating, especially when they all seem to be so emotionally flawed in different ways. But the most startling element of the show, is that you, as a viewer, may seem to start understanding the psychology behind the main character, and almost feel as if you can 'relate' to a serial-killer! One of the ways in which the producers of the show draw you into this strange turmoil of emotions, is by making the main character so god damn likable!!! Now you are getting an idea of the complicated roller-coaster of emotions you may experience while watching this clever show. You seem to be eternally wrestling with your own morals and wondering about what we, as a society, actually accept in real life as being morally 'right'. The whole 'twistedness' of the concept, and how this constantly reflects on you and your feelings towards it as you watch it, makes it compulsive viewing for me. It really is probably THE best thing I have ever seen on TV. I gave it 10 stars, but if it was possible, I would have given it 11."
506,"This show is the best show I have ever watched on T.V. Honestly, I haven't not watched a single show that even compares to Dexter. It is very complex and always keeps you on your toes. The plot is always changing and very exciting. People who watch Dexter don't just like Dexter they LOVE Dexter. We Dexter fans are loyal. You will never get bored while watching Dexter because it is not repetitive like some other shows on T.V. The cast is full of a bunch of amazing actor who genuinely convince you of their acting. It's definitely not for the faint of heart as Dexter is a blood spatter analysis as well as murderer. Not to mention the raunchy sex scenes which would not be good for younger children watching. All these things simply add the the thrill of watching the show. So, If you like a sexy keep- you-on-your-toes vigilantly murderer Dexter is for you - no joke. The books are also worth a read."
507,"Don't listen to those sorry souls that denouncing ""Dexter"" because it glorifies a psychopathic serial killer. A glorified serial killer is exactly the type of thing you want to see on television. I have personally never been a fan of the belief the TV, movies, music, video games, or comic books influence the forms of entertainment that they enjoy. I enjoy a fair amount of violence in my entertainment, I enjoy sensationalism, & most of all, I enjoy a good antihero, especially one that attempts to moralize the horrible things he is doing. I find it entertaining, & ""Dexter"" delivers on all counts.You tune in & you get to escape into the life of a serial killer who is, at least, partly convinced that he is doing the right thing. And on top of the escapism the show can be pretty witty from time to time.I'll stand by the 10 on the basis that it's a violent TV show about a serial killer that is sort of convinced they are the good guys. It's not at all realistic, the police station is clean & very well funded, it's not real life. But you don't watch TV shows to see a realistic depiction of life.We aren't serial killers, gun totting Federal Marshals, fake psychic detectives, over sexed cops, alien obsessed FBI agents, or OCD former police officers. There is a reason why they make shows like ""Dexter,"" it's simple, our lives are boring & the better our lives are the more boring they are.Don't be offended by ""Dexter"". Don't be that PC guy that makes PC look bad. The only people that are going to act on what they see on a TV show are the people that are going to do something dangerously stupid any way. ""Dexter"" was created for entertainment & it does its job."
508,Dexter is the simply greatest thing on television right now there's nothing that can even compare MCH acting is the best and should get more dramatic roles in movies. Even tho i just started watching Dexter finished all 4 seasons in a week i just can get over it i have never been so addicted to a show in my life every single aspect of this show works which never happens on TV. The writing is bar none the best even at it's weakest in season 3 its still great season 1 IMO is the best first season ever for a show from the beginning to the end it a complete masterpiece. season 2 has a slow start but grows massively strong near the end. season 3 although i weakest s still good. Now season 4 is the best thing i've ever seen John Lithgow was spine chilling Dexter has to clean up at award shows MCH is the best actor on TV right now i am so happy i started to watch this show and cant wait for season 5
509,"Normally, by the fourth season, most TV series start to go downhill. Not so 'Dexter'. After a slump in Season three, Season four is arguably the best season since the first.There are a couple of reasons for this, first of all is the pacing. There are a number of plot points which run through the series: Dexter trying to catch the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow), dealing with Rita, Cody, Astor and the new baby Harrison, and Deborah digging deeper into Harry's past. All of these plot points are well paced throughout the twelve episodes, leading up to the shocking conclusion. Another reason is the acting: Lithgow is absolutely superb as Trinity (without doubt the best villain of the four seasons), and deserved his Golden Globe. While he starts out as a seemingly normal family man, he gets creepier as the series progresses. Michael C. Hall is brilliant as always. He manages to convey Dexter juggling his new-found ""humanity"" with his need to kill. His internal narration is better as well, as he doesn't tend to state the obvious like previous seasons. The key for most mainstream dramas is to care for the characters, Dexter has achieved this, which ensures the show will have a long shelf-life once the ""serial-killer-with-a-conscious"" novelty value wears."
510,I never read the books and wasn't into the Dexter craze during the first three seasons. One thing I love about deployments to the gulf is the chance to watch shows I never got the chance to see before. I watched the first season of Dexter which was the only season available to me and I am HOOKED! I am fascinated by the originality of the plots week by week. No other show can seriously compare to this one. I cheer for Dexter and Harry's Code more and more with every episode I watch. I can't wait for Season 4 to kick off. The fact that this show is on Showtime is great so the rules of cable TV do not apply. This show is the only reason I even subscribe to the channels.
511,"You read the plot and being so judgmental would say that never works for me. How could I possibly get into such a theme? And maybe you insist on it during the few first episodes as well. But by then you've caught on the dark comedy of this show and without caring much for the anti-hero, you follow it with a big grin on your face while sitting back, be it for the sake of the irony of the situation or the witty narration of Michael Hall.After a few episodes however, you realize you're sitting on the edge of your seat. Lo and behold, you're there. Congratulations! It's frightening how you've started caring about this sweet serial killer with that soothing voice and witty narration.Perhaps Dexter is a huge leap in neo-noir genre, since here the shadowy and dark persona only is carried through the narration, while we enjoy a colorful cinematography. And it works even better with this huge contrast between shadowy self and brilliant colors of the set.Engaging, brilliant and easily the best series I've ever seen. 10/10"
512,"I think this was perhaps the best series of 2006. The first episode felt a bit amateurish but something pulled me back in and I watched the second one. After that, I was totally hooked. It just kept getting better and better with a single not-so-good episode somewhere in the second half of the season. I really hope there will be no second season. It would be a pity if they destroyed this like all other good series - beating it to death season by season. Please producers, don't give us another Lost, 24, *insert your favorite never ending series here*.All in all - Superb!"
513,"I've watched the first two seasons and found my way to Dexter mainly by wanting to know what Michael C. Hall was doing after Six Feet Under. I am a little disappointed although his role fits and it's always a pleasure to see him act as Dexter. What disappoints me though is the storyline. It has it's ups and downs and I image some viewers might find it really interesting but if you have seen thrillers and movies like American Psycho you will find this show rather boring. Dexter is the ""good guy"" who has to go through ""adventures"" and this is not really what you would expect from a guy who can't stop loving to kill people. I know those two extremes might sound interesting but after seeing the first episode you basically know everything about the character. Of course there are some flashbacks, some minor development but in the end Dexter stays the same. I won't even get into the other characters who are just dragging the whole show down, especially Dexter's sisters (Jennifer Carpenter). She did a decent job in the remake ""Quarantine"" but only because she was a typical horror movie victim. You enjoy to see her scream and die but she won't in this show (and I have to say this: I was really happy when season 1 was over mainly because I would never have to hear her say the word ""ice-truck killer"" again) Julia Benz is the only character I found interesting ever since Dexter said about her ""in her way she is as damaged as I am"". This is good stuff. Comparing his life to a mother of two children and seeing those two ""damaged"" people kinda fall in love. They could have made a whole series just about that storyline, instead they focus on the ""bossy Cuban bitch"", the ""suspicous black colleague"", the weird sister ""I love a 30year older man"" etc. all those story lines fail to be: a)believable b)innovative c)relating to the main character (after all the show is called Dexter)I don't want to tell people not to watch this show, after all it is sometimes entertaining and if you like to see something that goes well with your popcorn, go watch an episode or two. But it is nothing more than a show a housewife would watch while ironing her clothes. If you don't pay attention to most of the show, you'd still won't miss a lot. If you dislike that watch the Sopranos (if you haven't already) where you actually do have to pay attention if you don't want to miss out on all the entertainment."
514,"I remember always being interested in the show even before i started watching it, i thought the idea of it was odd yet brilliantly original. The show follows Dexter Morgan, a killer who kill other killers. One of the best things about the show is Michael C Hall as Dexter, in my opinion, one of the best characters and actors on TV. I started watching Dexter on the internet, and I've never enjoyed a first season more. With the Ice Truck Killer storyline and other threads it provided some of the best entertainment anyone could hope for. To some up, Dexter is brilliantly written with a good comedy, drama and twist. Dexter is a definite must see."
515,"The first season of Showtime's hit show Dexter, based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, was a huge success both with critics and DVD sales. It is by and far one of the most consistently excellent seasons of a show in recent memory (apart from Heroes). So how did season two of the show measure up? Surprisingly well, actually. The acting in Dexter is just phenomenal, with one of my favorites being Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame. Also starring in the show are Julie Benz, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, James Remar, and Erik King.Unlike the first season of Dexter, season two doesn't go by the second book, Dearly Devoted Dexter, and instead relies completely on the creativity of the impressive writing team. While the story told in season one was all about self-discovery and the mystery of the Ice Truck Killer, season two begins with a shocking twist: all of Dexter's work is discovered dumped in the ocean, and the Bay Harbor Butcher is born. A huge case opens up even bigger than the Ice Truck Killer, and Dexter's secret is more threatened than ever as he meets a destructive young woman, Lila, and the annoying Sergeant Doakes remains constantly on his tail.The acting, as always, remains a shocking surprise. Michael C. Hall is simply note-perfect as Dexter, and it just further goes to show how great of a character actor he truly is. He played a homosexual man working at a funeral home in his spectacular five year run on Six Feet Under, and in Dexter he plays almost the polar opposite; a serial killer who thinks he's emotionless, but starts becoming more and more human as the episodes progress. Julie Benz, who is best known for her role as Darla on both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, has mostly starred in some small indie movies, but she is given a lot more screen time and a lot more to work with here. Whereas the character of Rita is very bland and kind of boring on paper, Benz brings to her a sense of curiosity and discovery. It is practically required for her character to remain interesting so that she doesn't get outshined by the gorgeous and accent-heavy Jaime Murray. Playing the new character of Lila, Murray outshines most of the cast with her incredible charisma and great presence. Jennifer Carpenter is simply delectable as Dexter's sister, but Erik King as Sergeant Doakes is simply one big annoyance. While he is perfectly cast, there is just no way whatsoever that anyone could find this character likable.Dexter's character gets very, very interesting this season as he goes on a journey of self-discovery and realizes that he might actually have a conscience after all. He goes through a rough patch with Rita and for the first time, he feels incredibly human. This is why Dexter is one of my favorite shows. It has so much depth and realism to it that it's hard not to grow attached to its deep characters and twisty plot lines. Season one was absolutely incredible, and season two, while it had a lot to live up to, was simply amazing. The finale was one of the best finales I've ever seen, and it leaves the viewer craving more. The season ends so perfectly, and even manages to close up some loose ends. Don't miss Dexter, one of TV's all-time greatest shows, when season two comes to DVD in 2008!"
516,"As usual, you can never rely on positive reviews when trying to decide whether or not to watch a tv show. Review after review lauds this show as brilliant, groundbreaking, etc etc. I struggled with it immediately, finding the premise contrived to the point of being indigestible. Perhaps the books managed to fully develop the premise in a clever way that made it palatable, I don't know. But to basically say, with the use of Wonder Years-style voice-over and the odd flashback that this individual exhibited warning signs to his adoptive cop father by killing animals as a child, was then TRAINED by the father to channel his tendencies towards killing only ""bad"" people is a little half-arsed as far as telling a story goes. That ""origin"" story might have made for an interesting tv show, the path from child pet-killer to a serial killer trained to efficiently kill others of his kind, but this is not that story. This is your bog-standard soap opera recipe with the serial killer ""twist"" mixed in, just as Walking Dead is the same base recipe with a half-cup of zombie mix, add pouch and stir, voila, repeat season after season. As soon as I realised this, I pulled the plug. It didn't take long. I know that positive reviewers dismiss people like me for not giving shows a chance, but when the writing is so clearly on the wall so early on, I cannot justify wasting my time. The second time Dexter/psycho-Kevin Arnold prepped his little death table I sighed. I do not want to check in each episode and see him have his adventure, executing a bad person (he doesn't just kill serial killers, he kills drunk drivers too) while dealing with the day to day distractions of his personal relationships. There wasn't anything to keep me interested; if there had been some engaging dialogue or compelling actors to counter the formulaic episode structure, maybe I could've hung in for a third episode, but there was nothing. The lead actor was almost campy, it was distracting, and the actress playing his sister was comically bad. The other characters were the typical caricatures, angry black cop, colourful, fedora-sporting Hispanic cop, power-hungry female lieutenant, all very tired and uninspired. I noticed that this show lasted for 8 seasons, similar to Sons of Anarchy (same formula, different mix-pouch) yet another indicator that viewers need to be more discerning in what they will watch if the general standard of tv is going to improve."
517,"The lead in this show is very very boring, stupid and naive. He love killing people or slowly killing people while torturing. I don't know. And after watching few episodes of season one. I don't care. I don't know how It end up getting this high rating on IMDb but. Just to be honest. It is plain stupid story and show. Since, it got such high rating. I will suggest you watch few episodes of first season. And then decide it for yourself. After few episode I was not able to handle the stupidity in this show. This show was boring me to death. Then I have to face the truth.That this is the sh1t in it's purest form."
518,"So, after the hype went away, I decided to watch the Dexter Series and write some sort of review...The pluses:As a concept, the story is intriguing. A serial killer following a code that most people will consider to be an OK one... Killing only bad people and only if the killer can find enough proof.The serial killer working for a homicide squad, having access to every bit of information.The serial killer trying to stay ahead of his colleagues while chasing the same culprit.The minuses:Too many visual and continuity errors - let's face it, corpses do not swallow and they don't move their eyes either.Dexter's girlfriend, later his wife... If ever there was a character with a terrible voice it must be her. Her stupidity is beyond believe.Dexter's sister, with her neurotic drama queen behavior... I wonder if anyone having such mental issues would ever be on a police force and survive.Too many clichés, like police officers understanding and their superiors being stupid.The horrible music between the scenes - especially in the first series - , too loud and it serves no purpose.Conclusion:This series must have been written in a hurry or with the intention to make the audience feel smart. I read comments from people that love the twists in the plot; seriously, how predictable can it all be?"
519,"http://www.nnandmr.blogspot.com/i was searching around the net for someone who can write some real reviews on the show dexter.I found it!Go to this guys blog, he reviews mainly TV shows, and i have never read reviews so accurate and detailed! Give it a chance. If you like it, follow the blog, this guy deserves some support!This guy seems to be just an average person doing what he like to you, there is no way he is getting paid to do any of this. there's no ads. just quality reviews on shows. Give it a look and help him out! This wont disappoint you!"
520,"dexter is the best show that i enjoy watching all the time, its great that the they decided to do season 3 which so far is awesome i cant wait to find out what happens and i hope (as long as he doesn't get caught) that they continue to a season 4 and beyond because it is brilliant. the choice to use M.C.Hall was fantastic as he really plays the character well and is believable instead of using some over paid actor who would not be as good, he really fits the look of the character and plays both roles well in the show as a killer, cop and boyfriend/husband. the show is really well planned and thought through as the story lines follow through and nothing is missed to ensure that the audience doesn't get lost in whats happening and one last thing when dexter talks to him self in his head that is fantastic, when he stares at someone and he saying in his mind that he wan'ts to kill them while engaging in polite conversation, absolutely amazing."
521,"A friend persuaded me to give this a go and watch it, turned out to be excellent advice. The makers have set themselves a difficult premise to sell to your everyday audience, 'rooting for an active serial killer' and its hard to explain to the uninitiated how the show really does manage to do that. But it does. Everybody involved is clearly giving their best, actors, writers etc, but there is an intangible something which is just the source of this shows appeal. If the shows surface appearance is off-putting to you, then i urge you to watch an episode, just give it a chance, i did and TV is a hundred percent better than it has been in a long time now."
522,"This show is as many have stated extremely addictive. It's amazingly well written and shot, the production is great, and you fall in love with the characters, especially Dexter. It's a brilliant blend of humor and drama, with great character development and plot. It's a bit dark and there is a bit of gore, after all he is a serial killer, but aside from that again good laughs and nail biting moments. I cannot really say enough good things about this show. It will have you talking to your TV, because you are so invested in it.I started late, after 2nd season had already been released, but I was hooked by episode 1. Don't miss out on this show. Seriously, it is some of the best TV out there."
523,"Dexter is, to make a long story short, a likable guy who tries to live a normal life while killing killers with a similar urge to kill. Let's just say he takes out the trash. Every episode paints spot-on portraits of every one of the 5 or so main characters in situations unique to their lives, personalities and problems; as a result the show has the deepest character development I've ever seen. And even though Dexter is decidedly not an intentional comedy, Dexter's serial killer alter-ego juxtaposed with his job as blood spatter specialist at the Miami Police Department makes for some hilarious dark humor.It certainly follows a storyline as far as I've gotten. So if you're thinking of just picking up a show in the middle of a season to check it out you won't get the full picture, even with Showtime's short but effective episode recaps at the beginning of each show. They serve mostly as reminders for those who haven't seen the last episode in a while. Grab the first two seasons on DVD wherever you can find them and you won't be sorry. As for content, there is nothing at all gratuitous: infrequent language and occasional bloody but not graphic violence. After all, blood is in his job description. ;)"
524,"Dexter is so good that, after finishing season 2, i went out and got the HD version of both seasons, and i'm re-watching them again.Its the first show that makes me want to be a blood-spatter-specialist cop, and go live in Miami.Is that good.The characters complexity is marvelousThe history is excellent.The acting is superlative.It also get high points for all the Latin characters and that they do speak Spanish from time to time.My only complain is that a 12 chapters season is too short."
525,"Having just read the novel and expecting to prefer it, I was shocked to Discovered that I greatly prefer the show in every respect. It has done What shows/movies should do when they are based on a book, improve and Expand taking only the good bits. I like the TV interpretation of the Dark passenger as being Dexter, rather than a different entity . The book rushes the story too much! I did however prefer Deb in the book but I didn't like her catching on, it was written so obviously and unconvincingly. This show is so rich everything is done perfectly from the music to the visual design to the acting. I was instantly hooked in by this show so that time became irrelevant."
526,"after watching the first episode i was hooked!!! this is probably the best TV show on TV. the plot is well structured and you may well think you know whats going to happen but you probably don't. every time you guess you will probably have guessed wrong.the show is based around the main character Dexter, who just so happens to be a serial killer and the more you watch the more you realise his points of view (all be them very twisted) but you learn to love the character for who he is and not what he does. he becomes a lovable character even though his ideas on life are not quite what you may expect.defiantly worth a watch."
527,"I see a lot of people have already explained the plot, so i won't. I just want to say that I love Dexter.. The story is good, the casting is good, the music is good, I even enjoy the intro. I can't think of anything I dislike. Friends of mine compare it to American Pshyco, I never got what others thought was so great about American Pshyco, sure it was an enjoyable movie but for me it was nothing more. Dexter on the other hand really hit the spot. Dexter manages to pull of what American Pshyco, in my mind, failed: convince me that one of my co-workers could be a serial killer, and it could even be the nice guy.This show is smart, fun and I want more! I've seen the first and almost all of the second season. Is there a season three on it's way? I hope so. I've been a regular visitor on IMDb for many years now and I've never felt the need to give a vote or comment. Dexter changed this. Dexter is the reason I bothered registering and writing my first comment.Highly recommended!"
528,"I took out the negative stuff about Debra. She's more to my liking now. And I'm starting to see Dexter through her eyes as well as his. But I'm having a problem with the writing of the last two episodes (Oct. 2012). The blond co-killer who is now free (and pretty) volunteers to help the cops find the buried bodies. Turns out she helped with the killing (thanks to Dex's clever deductions). But if so, why help the cops at all? Why take the chance of being found out?Another one: The Russian mob boss gets lured through a Colombian-affiliated bar and kills three guys. They put him in prison to stand trial for murder but isn't it really self-defense? All the Columbian guys tried to kill him first so why isn't his lawyer trying to get the charges dropped?Old bits from six years ago: I liked Lila until they changed her. She went from an astute observer of life's difficulties to someone who actually causes the difficulties. And because she turned into such a witch I was OK with her ultimate fate. It struck me as extremely quick but I guess Dexter doesn't mess around.OK. Now I like Debra. She's more mature and makes better boy choices. The musician is at her level in maturity and personality. And she's become a pretty good cop--seeks the truth behind the facade. I keep asking myself what she'd do if she knew Dex was a serial killer of bad guys. I don't think she'd be very forgiving. She'd cut him off and would also be heartbroken. So why do WE like him? He's inevitably correct in who he eliminates--they're all killers. In fact he feels more remorse afterward than I do. But it's a fantasy. It couldn't happen in the real world but it's nice to be in that world for a while. The Bronson Death Wish Films where he's a vigilante are a historic precedent and they struck a similar chord in me. You're a bad guy with no human side? Bang! You're gone. 2013 - Just watched the last episode. Dex ditches his son and also his lover to cut trees in the forest. Alone! How incredibly sad. He feels so snake-bit that he thinks he'll draw trouble with him to anyone around him . . . to those he loves. So he stays away from those he loves. But that's just it. He's learned how to love and now won't let himself experience it. How incredibly sad. I cried. For indeed, I loved Dexter."
529,"Michael C. Hall is my new hero. Man, he is a natural born serial killer! No doubt, it is the best TV series I've ever seen in my entire life. My girlfriend and two of my friends agree, so count them in. The plot (especially in season 1) is absolutely staggering. Season 2 is a bit weaker, but at the end it compensates and corrects ""mistakes"" the creators made at the beginning. Thriller fans will notice the depth of details, premeditation, and oh my god - originality! To think about it, I watched Prison break, Heroes, CSI, etc.? What a hell is wrong with me.. Dexter, thank you for straightening my taste! Of course 10 out of 10."
530,"Amazing show that you just want more and more of. The photo is vivid and the story is great. So high standard all through season 1 and 2. Always a new twist that keeps you totally in trance the whole time. So violently uplifting and warm at the same time. And the humor makes you laugh heavily. It has it all. Together with Twin Peaks, Seinfeld and 24 it belongs in my top 4 television shows at all time. If you thought all serial killing was always wrong, think twice. I hope they continue with more seasons. So genius to come up with the idea of a serial killing comedy drama. And extra credit to the characters Doakes and Batista. Groundbreaking to say the least..."
531,"I was first intrigued by this show while watching regular TV. A commercial came on talking about ""Everyone's favorite serial killer is back for an all new season"". Even though the commercial never showed any of the show, just Michael C. Hall, it intrigued me. I began looking up the shows premise and was hooked on it.I began watching the first season online and was hooked by the first episode. This show is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen this show, or even heard of it, then I say take a chance on the wild side and get into the world of Dexter.Nip/Tuck used to be my favorite show, but the 5th Season isn't cutting it for me. However, Dexter is cutting it for me in many ways. The first season was brilliant and the second season is even better. With each new episode I am literally on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes Dramedies.10/10 Xander Trotter"
532,"wow. I saw a dexter episode for the first time today. I thought he was just kidding, when he said he was a serial killer at the end. But when he killed I was shocked.This was really something new on TV. I must see more episodes. It was extremely exiting. I must read more on the internet about this new show.In Norway Dexter has just started. PS sorry for the bad language. I'm not used to write in English. hope you understood me anyway.hugs and kisses from a girl from a freezing cold Norway (at the moment)"
533,"Dexter is a great show for anyone looking for a show with some real substance. The basic premise of the show is that Dexter is a sociopath, and as one, doesn't feel any real human emotions, including regret and remorse. He was diagnosed in his early childhood by his policeman father, who then proceeded to teach dexter certain behavioral rules and patterns so that he may be able to function in normal society without getting caught. The father also picked up on the fact that dexter will have uncontrollable urges to kill, so he teaches him a moral code whereby he can only kill other 'bad' people. Thats basically it. The genius of the show is that its from the first person narrative, with dexter describing his thoughts and feelings as he moves along. He is constantly going back to his fathers code in situations that need him to make a decision simply because it is convenient to do so, and he does believe that doing so will allow him to survive longer. His questioning of his own motives, and his commentary on the pretend life he is living are well observed, and on simpler level allow the audience to empathize with him. Certainly we do not have urges to kill, but we can understand when dexter smiles or behaves in a friendly manner when he doesn't quite feel it. Dexter's questioning of his motivations isn't quite presented in a black and white way, and so we can see the times when we question ourselves in him. Being in first person, its interesting how the show manages to give insights into dexter's character that even dexter is unaware of to the audience. This really pushes the audience in a God like point of reference to Dexter, for at times we deduce as to his real motivations, or at least think we do, when dexter himself has no idea. but then there is always the chance that dexter has us, the audience fooled too. If you are looking for a smart character driven show, with some good acting, brilliant writing, with a morbid flavor, then you really cant go wrong with dexter. In fact if you want to start watching a new show, then you cant go wrong with dexter.Unless you hate blood that is..."
534,"This show is one of the best to come out in the last couple years! Who wouldn't like the bad-but-good-killer? Dexter is a great character and is played out terrific by Hall. The confused, yet intelligent blood obsessed serial killer is a pure HERO in my eyes! The first season introduces us to Dexter's horrible past, but great future. The cops along with Dexter are on the trail of the ""Ice Truck Killer"" who seems to be playing with them---Dexter mostly. Why isn't revealed until episode 12 and I was hypnotized by the reasons why. Even though I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed, this show had me on the edge of my seat from first show to end of season 1!!! I truly hope there are many MANY more seasons for this terrific show! I've recommended it to all my friends and am anticipating all of season 2..... If you like demented stuff (like me) in your shows, this is TRULY the top! Watch them all today and root for the BEST GOOD serial killer working today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
535,"Just watched the final of Dexter on FX, and I have throughly enjoyed the entire series. Great characterizations , the cast do a great job and the comparison between Dexter's morbid life and the brightness of Miami is just genius. Another excellent point is the gradual revealing of Dexter's history, building it up gradually till the thrilling climax. Makes me curious to go read the books the series is based on.A deeply brilliant show!!!!!!!!I am looking forward to season 2 arriving on UK shores (which I imagine will be next year)"
536,"There's not much to add to all the wonderful comments praising this excellent, wonderfully entertaining show, except to say that I hope Showtime knows what a gem they have on their hands.I, too, absolutely love Dexter and the character is brilliantly played by Michael C. Hall. I first saw Hall as David Fisher in ""Six Feet Under"" and I was skeptical that he could play a serial killer (even a likable one.) It turns out that my skepticism was totally unfounded! The supporting cast is also wonderful, and the situations presented in each episode are unfailingly entertaining.I hope ""Dexter"" lasts for many years to come! David Bunin"
537,"Within the first 10 minutes I was hooked on this show. It is entertaining. Evertime an episode ended I found myself thinking I cant wait until the next one. I really enjoyed the mystery surrounding the story. Well played out. The characters all fit their parts. I did not believe that Michael C Hall would be convincing as a serial killer after seeing him for years in 6 feet under but nothing could be further from the truth. He was entertaining and convincing in 6 feet under but it does not compare to how much he entertains you as Morgan Dexter, even though he is a serial killer you will find yourself siding with Dexter in no time. If you give it a chance you will be hooked as I was."
538,"Welcome to a new kind of madness. Do you like stories talking about tracking down a killer? Do you like to see through the eyes of a killer? What if you could have both? Certainly you would be pleased to find out Dexter Morgan is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh wait, not everything is what it appears to be. He is not your typical killer because he was raised with a conscience. A serial killer with a conscience, can it be? Not exactly, but maybe you should tune in to find out. Dexter is a killer, that much I am sure. He kills those who ""deserve"" to die and you might just agree with him on that. While he might dance in the shadows as a killer; he also works for the Miami Police Department in lab as an expert on Blood Splatter. Yes, he is a killer and a Blood Splatter Analyst. This is not because he likes blood; in fact Dexter doesn't really care too much for blood. What did I just say? You read that right. You read it all right. Just take a chance with the killer we have grown to love. Dexter is a riveting show that will make you squirm and keep you glued. Don't worry if you have already read the book because the writers of the series only based the show on the book. The book has many connections, but it was indeed done in a different way."
539,"I used to watch ""Six Feet Under"" and I am still mourning its loss after HBO nixed it after five seasons. Then when I heard that Michael C. Hall was set to play the title role of ""Dexter"" I was intrigued: a forensic expert who is also a dangerous serial killer. WOW! I ordered Showtime on Demand, etc. and I am now hooked! One of the best shows on television besides Heroes, Lost, 24, and Weeds. Michael C. Hall plays Dexter Morgan, a forensic and ""blood splatter"" expert for the Miami Police Department. By day he helps solves crimes and by night he stalks and kills individuals who are just as dangerous as he is or worse. Dexter was adopted by Harry Morgan (James Remar), a decorated police officer, who was the first and the only one to identify Dexter's sociopathic nature. Harry disciplines Dexter into succumbing into his urges by only going after those that are just as dangerous as he is, or those that have escaped justice rather than Dexter going after innocent people. In between solving crimes along side his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter, a total change from The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who is also a police detective and spending quiet evenings and weekends with his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz, who is rather lovely in this role and well suited), a single mother and victim of an abusive ex-husband, Dexter is also killing. Wonderful characters surround him: Sergeant Doakes (Erik King) is the only one in the whole series that senses that something is not right with Dexter at all; Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), who is obviously attracted to Dexter; Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, who is hilarious!), Dexter's forensic sidekick; and of course Detective Angel Batista, (Andre Zayas). This show is so amazing and incredibly addicting; Smartly written and beautifully acted led by Michael C. Hall, who is without question an actor that is severely underrated and worthy of more attention; He is so daring in his choice of roles and does not ever fall into clichés. He presents Dexter as a character that we both are frightened, sympathize, and identify with. Michael C. Hall also reminds us through his performance and delivery that Dexter is not Batman; Dexter is a monster; The only difference that distinguishes Dexter from other serial killers is that he is disciplined. The pilot episode says it all when he kills a pedophilic killer: ""I have standards."" This performance is a total 180 from the departed gay funeral director, David Fisher, of ""Six Feet Under."" The cast is also exemplary: Jennifer Carpenter is strong as Dexter's ambitious sister; Julie Benz is lovely and vulnerable as Dexter's damaged girlfriend (they have really wonderful scenes together; he could be killing someone and he answers her phone call pleasantly like a real boyfriend would; James Remar is also excellent in flashbacks as Dexter's adopted father. Without question Showtime is about to put HBO out of the spotlight with this show and it's comedy ""Weeds"" and ""Sleeper Cell.""GO SHOWTIME!!!!"
540,"All right, settle down. Well, having briefly heard about this a long time ago, and while trawling through the free movies, etc. on EoD, I decided to give this a whirl. Well, that was last night. I just finished watching the whole first season (I had to sleep, silly, but I did try to stay up all night!) This is without doubt one of the best shows ever created. The plot is compelling, the acting quite breath-takingly brilliant, and everything else is just so amazingly well conceived. There is even humor sprinkled throughout... along with all the blood. Yes folks, so much blood that it might upset some, but hey, I like my realism to be... well... real.Michael C. Hall is wonderfully cast and did a spectacular job. Who knew they could make a hero out of a serial killer? Well I'm glad they did, and I hope that this show's complete lack of promotion doesn't mean that there won't be a second and third season. Showtime have a habit of killing off perfectly good shows (Yes, it's you Dead Like Me that I'm talking about.) So, if you find that a second season isn't planned, please write your senators and congress-people. We need good entertainment and less 'reality' and definitely no more Hiltons or Lohans."
541,"Dexter is great. The acting is superb (with some exception of the sister's character), the plot is great, and if you love bloody gore with an intellectual spin, you'll love this show. Michael C. Hall is just awesome in this roll, and if you like ""Six Feet Under"" then you will probably already love his character in ""Dexter."" I have read the books, and I have to say that the show is far superior to the books. I do think that, after reading the books, it may be worthwhile to wait to read the book until after you see the show. I know, it's opposite of what you might normally think, but I think the show is so much better that the book actually ruins the ideas at times. I can't wait for the next season!"
542,"In a world of never-ending plots and unnecessary subplots, of dozens of 26 episodes seasons, this tight 12 eps. long one shot makes me want to actually but the DVD and not just half-heartedly download. Of late, series have been known to get better by the day, hiring more and more movies actors, directors, writers and technicians, so I'm not going to overwrite about how good it looks : about as good as you'd want it to be. There'd be a lot to say about many freudian and jungian aspects of the character, how it eventually reflects us (as Flaubert said, ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi""), but I'll not deflower the story - it is great, although not unpredictable (but I wouldn't trade it for a bad deus ex machina : at least it does not try and play the audience for fools), and there are to this day two more Lindsay books to be adapted (the third coming up this summer). Let's hope they don't turn it into a money making soap (you noticed how every time series writers get short of ideas, the characters start dating one another in every direction ?). Ah...and though I'm of the heterosexual persuasion, I have to admit that Michael C Hall is damn sexy in this show (especially compared to SFU)."
543,"this is my favorite show by far.it is amazing.dexter is a complex and unique character, and Michael hall is an excellent actor. the plot is like nothing i've ever seen before, and the supporting characters are also all very different, yet they fit together so well.every episode is just like another piece of a puzzle.this is a television show that really makes me think, and i find it refreshing that it's so real in a fantastical way.the episodes bring out many emotions in me while i watch.there are times where i am laughing, there are times when i feel anxious, and sad, and also times where i just have to smile at what is happening or something someone says.all i can say is i really love this show.i cant wait to see more."
544,"The first time I heard of this show was from a friend who is studying Criminal Psychology at the University of Nebraska. I bought season one from iTunes (I finished season one and have kept up with season two so far) and absolutely loved every part of it - the wit displayed in the writing of both the dialogue and the story, the complexity of the characters presented, and even the acting (Michael C. Hall is a very convincing creepy-but-trying-to-pretend-that-he's-not serial killer).I mentioned this above, but it deserves elaboration: the writing on the show is fantastic. The main reason that I rated it 10 out of 10 is because the story is so beautifully devised. The development of small stories surrounded by one large and complex story is reminiscent of comic books and makes for an interesting run of episodes.On a more technical note, the direction and production of the show are phenomenal. The camera angles are intriguing, the score (particularly the swelling strings) is incredible, and the editing is tight. Most viewers are not aware of subtleties like that, and that is partially the goal of any good direction/production theme; but the devil really is in the details.Overall, the show is fantastic. My sole complaint is that the episodes are only 50 minutes long."
545,"WOW!! This show really is something, its is compelling, it is thrilling, it is darkly humorous, and to top it all off it is R-Rated. Dexter is a show I never thought would have been made because in essence it is everything I have ever wanted to see in a TV show, down to the last drop of blood. All of the main characters are more than multi-dimensional and you feel for every last one of them. Dexter is in a whole league of his own, Michael C. Hall a relative nobody has proved himself to be one of the best lead actors working in television right now. I am not going to say much more to promote this series but trust me just watch the first episode and you will be hooked. I love this show and my hearts desire is that is go's on forever and never ends, I am devoted to this show and I love it with all my heart.Note to sensitive viewers: This is probably the most graphic show to ever hit television so be warned, there is language and nudity as well."
546,"Rated TV-MA for Violence and Language I live in Canada so I don't have HBO.However I do have The Movie Network which plays HBO shows such as The Sopranos,Entourage,Brotherhood and a couple of others.Dexter is another good show from HBO.It is a very interesting show about a man who is a forensics specialist by day and a serial-killer by night.Sort of like Patrick Bateman, the main character from the novel and film ""American Psycho"".Unlike Bateman however, Dexter only kills people who deserve to be killed.Dexter also has a girlfriend who used to be abused by her drug addicted ex-husband.His sister also works with him in the police force.There is a character named Seargent Doakes who provides the main comic-relief for the show.Dexter is a very thrilling and entertaining show and If you have not gotten around to watching it, I suggest you do."
547,"Dexter falls into the category of a great show, with a great plot, with a great cast. It is one of these dramas that crops up every couple of years, such as The Sopranos, Prison Break and stretching it to Lost.Dexter is a blood specialist, but he is so much more than that. Dexter hides his real persona, his dark side and only one person has ever known his true identity, his father harry.Dexter looks badly upon those who have committed murder but gotten away with their crimes, in his mind they must be punished, in the only way Dexter knows: revenge.Hard to say anymore without giving away any spoilers so i will give you 2 words of advice to help you.WATCH THIS"
548,"The past 2 seasons or so have seen excellent TV series one after another for the first time in decades, with hits such as Prison Break, Heroes, and lower rated but equally good if not better series such as Veronica Mars and Supernatural, among many more. Above all though Dexter stands tall, combining the perfect blend of crime/serial killer drama with dark comedy and off beat romance.Dexter tells the story of Dexter Morgan, a forensic pathologist who moonlights as a serial killer hunting other killers--but make no mistake, Dexter is no vigilante. He lives by a closely followed set of rules set forth to him by his legendary cop foster father, who recognized his nature early on. The series follows him as he struggles to understand and cope with his feelings, or lack thereof, how he tries to fit in among normal people, and as he seeks to aid the police in murder investigations while simultaneously committing many himself.More than anything else, the casting in the series is simply outstanding, as almost everyone agrees. Michael C. Hall is remarkable as the title character, and has flawlessly pulled off the role as I could imagine few would be able to. The supporting cast also fill their roles, both generic and niche alike, with such ability and nuance that you will love even the most dis-likable of the lot."
549,"One of the best shows on TV. I can't believe this show wasn't recognized in the Emmy's, but again what does they know, Veronica Mars came and gone unrecognized. You have to be Two and a Half Men to be seen by them. Back to Dexter, this show is really good, the acting is first class, Michael C. Hall is just fantastic, so is the supporting cast. It is dark without losing it's touch of humor. The violence in the show is really tuned down so you get the idea without grossing you out. Even with nudity I think Showtime has shown restrain in this department so it doesn't alienate us with unneeded scenes of sex and violence. I have seen more violence in network shows that don't have serial killers, so kudos to Showtime. Finally. I hope this show continue its success story because it so entertaining that makes you almost in no rush to see movies."
550,This is now one of my favorite TV Series. As a fan of the John Connolly/Thomas Harris books I do enjoy a darker side to my entertainment and I get what I crave from this series.I always thought to myself what if Grissom ( CSI ) was a serial Killer now that would be nail-biting stuff. Well here it is and I was right. The acting is superb and Michael C Hall is very convincing as both Forensics Expert and as a Mass Murderer. He is as twisted as any of the guys he's out to catch but he's still a likable fellow. If you like CSI you'll love this. There's also a dark humor integrated into the whole series.Start watching this and you'll be hooked.
551,"This show is different, very so!This is a scenario I have often wondered about, when the good guys take the law into their own hands to the full extent and not in a heroic glamorous way, as they do in the Hollywood-movies. This show is about exactly that, a man that has no normal feelings or bonds to speak of towards other human beings what so ever, and slaughters the bad guys just as brutally, as they do their own victims. And each time he comes across a murder that has been done in a neat way or with an unusual method, he starts to admire the murderer. A bit sick, but when you keep in mind that his goal is to eventually catch the guy and dispose of him, despite the admiration, it sort of sits OK with you. And the fact that it's all done in a dark-humorous way just makes it even more enjoyable. For example, his boss is always making a pass at him and all he can think is:""..I wish she would stop that, it's one of those human emotion-rituals I don't understand.."" This is one of those shows that you can't wait to see more of!"
552,"We looked forward every week to the latest episode. The whole family was riveted for the entire hour. Then we'd re-watch on the ""on Demand"" channel. The story lines and character development were both outstanding. The complexity of Dexter's character were both well written and acted perfectly. The theme music is fabulous and the opening sequence is up there with the best I have ever seen (and I pay attention to the details attended to in the openings of shows and movies). I don't watch TV unless there is something of quality on. Dexter met that prerequisite with flying colours. I got half the city watching it and everyone I encouraged to watch it are as hooked as we are. We were devastated when it ended. I even named my new car Dexter. It sounds like I need a life but, for what it is worth...there it is. CANNOT wait until season 2."
553,"Very unique show. When I first heard the premise I rolled my eyes, thinking it was a hokey angle to have a serial killer that kills serial killers, but the idea has remarkable depth the way it is played out. I find Dexter to be a fascinating and likable character - not as hard to relate to as some would think. The cinematography is very slick and creative - often you are repulsed by a seemingly graphic image on the screen which turns out to be a common object such as a piece of fruit. And then something graphic by definition (such as blood) is shown in an artistic and attractive way.The character of 'Harry' has to get my vote for most compassionate father of all time - the way he teaches Dexter to deal with his innate desire to kill is remarkable and believable. I also love the way Dexter takes care of his girlfriend's children and his girlfriend. The only thing I don't like much is the character of his sister, Deborah. I find it hard to take her seriously as a cop. Perhaps she will develop and I am definitely going to stick around to find out. Have watched half a dozen episodes and can't wait to see more!!!"
554,"From the first episode of dexter, I was immediately hooked. The series captured the books perfectly. Unlike other series, There was rarely a time at the end of the episode where you weren't satisfied. The plot, the suspense, and the acting was genius. The last few episodes just took my breath away, I had to leave the room, literally, just to catch my breath. The thrilling suspense was so great, that if you summed all of the episodes, into one 3 hour movie, we'd have the best thriller of all time, hands down. I would recommend dexter to anyone who likes CSI, Bones, And other series involving forensic investigations.Bravo show time, Bravo."
555,"I love this show. I'm not one for killing usually. But, there are more elements to this show than that. This show uses so much psychology. I love the complexness of the real meanings to the actions. This show keeps me entertained and on the edge of my seat. The actors are great. The man who plays Dexter is PERFECT as the character. He is such a great actor. I just wonder how long it will take for Dexter's sister to figure it out, she is a cop. But, she does trust him, so it may be a good while. This is definitely one of mew favorites for the year. I moved and ordered Showtime just for this show. If you watch nothing else this year..make sure you watch this one!"
556,"Great family show for all ages above 18. Witty, clever, and full of surprises. Truly and original experience. Cannot wait for next season, counting the days till season 2! The acting was incredible, especially Michael C. Hall. Loved him in Six Feet Under, but even better in Dexter. Hard to believe I know!! Why do i need to write ten lines about this...seriously, just watch the show. Its good, really good. Also, the actor playing Angel Batista (David Zayas) was awesome. If you are really squeamish and don't like blood and gore, do not watch this. There is lots of blood, lots of gore, and some really disturbing scenes. But they are spaced apart and balanced by really good writing and acting."
557,"The story is really interesting and gripping. Acting is fine most of the times.
Brace yourself for one of the worst endings ever. After binge watching all the first seasons, it was painful to watch the show getting destroyed in the last season.
Dexter's Finale made GOT's Finale look better."
558,"When I started the series I was like ""this is exactly the show I always wanted to see"". It had very good sense of humor and every character was written so well. Every season this was getting worse. The story always keeps in the same way, I was almost never surprised about what is going to happen next.
First two seasons 8-9/10
Rest between 3 and 5"
559,Overall a great show with a disappointing last episode
560,"This tv show was amazing and so original as any other tv show I have seen, until I watched the last few seasons... quality went down abruptly, not sure why!!! They ruined the last season in a way that is hard to explain. I didn't like it at all. But I did enjoy the first 3 seasons. Stop there and you won't regret watching it."
561,"Oh Gosh !!!! I received this garbage TV show as a gift, but what the hell can I do with this? First, I don't particularely crave for serial killers. Unless...
See for instance HANNIBAL series, THAT'S A REAL KILLING. You have in this latest TV show, an outstanding aesthetics work, unbearable scenes, very unpredictable story, a never seen before scheme, and above all a real fascinating evil hero - or mayI say anti-hero - that makes you puke and bewitches the audiences in the same time...
But HERE, this good looking, handsome, pretty face GOOD serial killer killing EVIL serial killers, a guy always smiling, a dude whom you know in advance that he will make it whatever the situation he may be glued in....
I could definitely NOT resume ONLY to the end of the first episode !!!
So, imagine nearly ONE HUNDRED épisodes !!!!
I am a human being after all. 
And a colleague of mine, who knows each of my tastes, told me after I received this poisoned gift, that the end was not for me. So, no regret to get rid of it."
562,"After watching a similar TV show called death note I had recommendations to watch Dexter. After watching the whole show on Netflix it was definitely worth watching but felt I was left feeling disappointed because of the show going down hill after four seasons and without giving any spoilers that awful ending in the final episode. What a let down. Overall it's a clever, suspenseful show. Casting choice is great. The first four seasons were binge watch worthy but after that it gets slow, repetitive and becomes a let down. I can think of other ways the show could have ended better."
563,Would have been a perfect 10 however series 8 was below average and the ending was nearly as bad as the Lost series. Great series otherwise. The acting and script were brilliant in most parts. Amazing that two people were married/divorced and then can still continue to work together.
564,"The only thing that disappoint me about Dexter is its finale. It wasn't a finale but just a regular season ending. At the end of season 7, dexter cover begin to reveal but it didn't go any where and everything become normal as it was.Could have been as good as BREAKING BAD.Yes, it could have been as good as breaking bad. Because in the end in breaking bad W.W.'s brother in law came to realize W.W. reality and how it ends was just unpredictable... but in dexter the finale was good but just not satisfying. And one more thing that disappoint me is what they did to Debra, seriously she deserved more than what given to her. But if we see every season individually, Dexter was really good.Season 1: A killer better than dexter in every way. Season 2: Protecting his real identity. Season 3: A friend that understand dexter. Season 4: Trinity killer. Season 5: Helping someone to forgive himself. Season 6: Catching Dooms Day Killer(DDK). Season 7: A girlfriend who understand dexter better than dexter. Season 8: Meeting his spiritual mother."
565,"This show, was truly amazing! In-fact, it was one of my ultimate favourites. I watched Dexter in about 2months? It's addicting. I hadn't watched it before because when I saw it advertise I was always unsure because it looked like it was too much. However, this show is like no other. It's so cleaver and it's refreshing. How many times do you see a serial killer being portrayed in a 'good light'? Not just that, but the whole storyline itself was perfect. There's obviously some plots that I wasn't to keen on, and I'm not going to lie... the ending completely destroyed it for me in a way, as I always wanted Dexter to have a good life and to be happy, he seemed like he was changing for the better, however when you think about it in a different way, what Dexter did was wrong in a lot of ways, it's not right to kill people and get away with it, we all know that... but because we fell in love with Dexter we wanted him to end up alright. Then I think again, Dexter is only a television program why couldn't it end better? So that is the only thing that I disliked about Dexter, the ending. I had to give this a 10 because it does deserve it. I'm glad I watched Dexter and experienced a different kind of television series. We probably won't see anything as good as this any time soon. So I recommend Dexter, but only if you can bare to live with the ending."
566,"This show is hard to get away from when you start. The first few episodes are good but once you get on a roll and finish Season 1, you will be grabbing your remote and turning on the next season..Every season had twists and turns to keep every bit of it interesting. It is honestly one of the best Crime Dramas out there, right under Breaking Bad. After watching every season, it is very hard not to get attached to the characters in this show. But...I've really liked this show all the way up to Season 8. The main reason why it cannot get a 10 out of 10 from me is mainly due to this season. They completely change it up and make it decent, but the last episode just ruins everything that I have come to love about this show. Sure, it makes sense that Dexter remains a killer and abandons everyone in order to keep them ""safe."" But that's just not what the average viewer wants. This is in my opinion anyway. They could have made it a happy ending easily and come up with a thrilling way to end it still (Not saying that they didn't end it one of the most thrilling ways...but C'mon). I don't even know if I could re-watch it after that ending. It is just SO IRRITATING! Loved this show and wish I hadn't seen that last episode. If you haven't seen Season 8, episode 12...I recommend to use your imagination for an ending.I had to rant about that somewhere, thank you for reading!"
567,"Best television show out there today. The television show Dexter stars a main character named Dexter Morgan who plays the character of a blood splatter pattern analyst in forensics for the Miami Metro Police department who is also a serial killer. To Dexters' defense he only kills those who have escaped the law and believes they need to be punished. This idea of balancing out the world by morally killing off the bad is classic. The entire concept of the show is just phenomenal. As a producer and actor in this series, I think Michael C. Hall plays a much more dramatic role. Hall can become his character on and off screen. The personalities that these actors have to play create the whole dynamic to the story. Without each individual part that these characters play, the story would not be a whole. There is an importance in each of these characters that hold this series together and running for so long. There is such a uniqueness to the storyline that keeps the watcher wanting more. In the first season it does not give all the information of the life of Dexter and the reason for what he does, but that is also because Dexter as a character does not discover this information until his life starts unraveling. As a child Dexter was adopted by Harry Morgan, an officer on the Miami Metro Police Department. His father, Harry, was first to see his signs and began training Dexter under the Code. He taught Dexter how to channel his killing into something good. By this code that Dexter has killed by all his life, he was taught how to set up his killing rooms, who to kill, and how to rid of any evidence. This code of Harry's was all he lived by. After the death of Harry, brother and sister, Dexter and Debra, took his place at Miami Metro Police Department working for the forensics team. As time went on Debra and Dexter when through multiple paths trying to learn who they truly were. With all the surrounding characters, especially the co-workers of the forensic team, they could evolve and grow. Dexter Morgan plays an emotionless killer who throughout time learns how to welcome those feelings into his life. Though Dexter had a loving family he could not get rid of what he called his side passenger that made him kill. Dexter is like any other character I have ever witnessed and trying to watch and guess his next move is always surprising. Watching him evolve from an emotionless serial killer to a caring, compassionate serial killer is captivating. On the other hand his sister Debra stays a static character, which also plays a crucial part. She goes in and out of relationships but can never find what she is looking for. Dexter is the man in her life she feels is always there for her. Both Debra and Dexter characters play a significant role in making this television show what is it. Without these two playing the main characters so well the storyline would have failed. Each new investigation launches a new path in which each character must learn from. One of the first major killers was Brain Moser, known as the ice truck killer. Anther major character was the trinity killer.. The trinity killer had a ritual of killing woman in the bathtub, but like Dexter he led a double life with a family. One of my favorite killers was the Doomsday killer. Travis Marshall was a student in which he believed he was following his dead professor to bring the end of the world through killings based on the Book of Revelations. These killings were very different and to think if this happened in today's world would be mind blowing. Each new round of killers holds much more in store for the storyline than can be determined. Most shows are remakes from older shows but Dexter is a whole new concept. This show is not for just any individual, it is for those you can take a concept and go with it and not question its integrity. You never know what could happen."
568,"My first encounter with Dexter was in 2012. Yes - Although many of my friends told me it was amazing, I never really checked it out until last year. I forced myself to sit through the first 3 episodes - and there has been no turning back since. The storyline: Dexter is a Serial Killer. That's all you need to know for starters.I've never seen so many people vouch for a serial killer. I think the ability to create such a character is an outrageous challenge, and the creators of this show have been able to do justice to that! The strength of the show has been its ability to create strong villains that make Dexter a necessary evil. I wish they would stick to that formula. Whenever they've failed to do that, there have been too many holes in the plot and some episodes leave me wondering how amateur the work has been.Season 1 through 4 is absolutely entertaining. Season 5, although it starred the beautiful Julia Stiles as Lumen, could not keep me hooked. Season 6 was a drag, but the premise wasn't too deploring. Season 7 was good.... And Season 8... Well... Dexter deserves a Grand Finale...When they said that Season 8 would be the last, I wasn't sure if I was ready for a finale. But here we are - just 3 more episodes away, and I'm beginning to think that all great things must come to an end... Although I'm not sure it's getting the ending it deserves...""Every contact leaves a trace. Everything and everyone we touch is changed in some way. But the changes, they are never what we anticipate."" - Dexter"
569,"I will keep this short and simple Undoubtedly one of the best series every made is Dexter. The depth of the characters are perfectly formed. So far 9/10 actors have been superb and hold a lot of weight in the series. Right from the get go the story moves at a fluid pace and doesn't linger. Unlike some series on TV Dexter isn't filled with episodes where nothing happens. SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I am on series 3 and yet to find a boring episode. Generally if I watch a series I can maybe make it to series 2 and then find it too predictable and just dam right boring. Although as you begin to understand Dexter you might just see what will happen around the corner before it does. In this case it only seems to make me want to watch it more. If you are yet to see Dexter, I would highly recommend it to just about anyone."
570,"Dexter is a serial killer with whom we can identify. He doesn't want to be this way, he just is. As a child, instead of giving Dexter the intense therapy he obviously needs, his father teaches his son how to blend in and suggests a way for him to channel his urges.It's almost painful to watch Dexter try to live a normal life with a job and girlfriend, using behaviours he has learned from his father in order to do so.But he's not normal, though he does invoke sympathy, and he's a self-confessed monster, doing things most people wouldn't be able to live with. If his character popped up in Criminal Minds we'd be rooting for the FBI, but this show gives us the other side of the coin.It's disturbing, yes, but gripping and addictive viewing. Enjoy!"
571,"Very interesting TV series. Watch it!!! What I found interesting in this serial is the basis of Dexter's thinking. His point of view and objecting the principals of life is rare and brilliant. His strong personality, even when he makes a mistake, is admirable. He keeps a good balance between his social life and his dark hobbit. Anticipating the ending is totally impossible as he passed some turning points like religion, love, family's responsibilities, relatives etc that could change his life, but his dark passenger is going to lead. I wonder how it is going to end not turning a serial killer to a hero also not down grading a hero to a low level criminal."
572,"Did they seriously make a show about a serial killer that's killing another serial killers making the world a better place to live? You got that right! Dexter without a doubt is a smart,dangerous, and charming character with no human motion. All his life his mentor/foster father taught him how fight his urge to kill by taking it on the bad people and how to fit in society by faking a smile or too. He even works for the Miami police department which is hilarious ,but also since he loves the sight of blood since dear Dexter works as a blood spatter to make him feel at home.Dexter works in the morning, becomes a very neat monster at night hunting down his victims for his slide collection. Dexter is not a guy you want to mess with him unless you want to end up in his famous kill room filled with plastic walls and a slice to your cheek! All in all, Dexter is a damn bloody good show and it deserves a shot of 10/10 to the neck."
573,"First off, I love the show. It's great series that's hardly been topped in television history. There are many great characters with varying depth and wonderful acting.All the mush aside the series is also one of the most roller coaster series I've ever seen. I rate the series as an 8/10 and I've considered giving it a 9. If I were to rate each season though they range from 5-10. The first season was amazing. A 9 or 10. The second season may have even topped that. Then the third season comes along and it's like pulling teeth. I loved Jimmy Smits in NYPD Blue and I think he did a surprisingly great job in Sons of Anarchy. Watching him in Dexter however was horrendous. It wasn't Jimmy though. It wasn't bad acting or anything like that. It was just the way the whole season was laid out. I don't know the direction the creative team was going. To this day I never looked into whether there were changes in writing, producing, directing, etc. but the third season was so bad I stopped watching for almost 3 years. Getting back to Dexter 3 years later I was pleased to see the 4th & 5th season get back into the Dexter stride. While not as good as the first couple they were both solid. The 6th season was my favorite besides the original first two. The Brother Sam character (and the actor who portrayed him) as well as Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos were terrific. The 7th season had series changing potential but to me it's been the worst since the 3rd season. It's a roller coaster series full of highs and lows. At times it'll give you exactly what you want and at other times make you mad all season.For anyone who also reads the book series, I am a fan of both. As a fan of both I'll tell you that you have to treat the two as two separate entities. You have to treat it as dual dimensions or something of that nature if you want to get nerdy about it. Treat it like the multiple Spider-man movies. Two different takes of the same stories. The first part of the first season follows the book very closely. Then by the end of the season it goes into it's own direction. The second season is influenced by the book but only slightly. Beyond season two of the series there's only a few comparisons. Oddly the series was at it's best when it was influenced by the books but I enjoy the series more than the books altogether. I will say that I won't be completely satisfied unless the series takes advantage of the incredibly controversial 5th book (Dexter is Delicious) before the TV series ends. In my opinion Dexter is Delicious is the best of the books series.8 of 10 - Not always on the same level but still overall it's one of the best."
574,"To anyone who don't know the TV show «Dexter», It's a master piece.This is coming from someone who watched most of, if not all, existing main TV show the last 5 years (as of 2012). The first seasons are slow and a bit repetitive but I'm a critic(al) person. If you have the time to go to the 7th season, this show will blow your mind. Seriously. There's nothing like it and there won't be afterward. Actors are great if not awesome, but (yes, but!) the scenario, the insight into human mind is more than way beyond what you will ever expect (or please call me). With «Dexter» You will get more than a show. The 7th season is an unthinkable climax. Please take the time to watch this, you won't regret. (I just re-read this, I agree it looks like propaganda but I'll stick to my words!)"
575,"Since s01e01 I have been drinking the juice of a true storytelling. That slow-paced story ties us with it as it goes further and further. You are that involved, deeply involved, that although it has 1-hour episodes, you fell like you just started watching it. That background music, a perfect one for its kind, keeps rolling in like thoughts in our mind. The relationships built, the way they are shown, the kind of complications occurred ,the reality shown, the level of intelligence of each character (Not like others... Only our HERO has the MIND) and each one's acting. The director knows when and how to play with each character. The way every investigation is shown is just amazing. The obsession of a serial killer, how stuck he is, facing inner as well as outer enemies... The whole series is exactly like a sniper; slow (rate) but certain. Just watched s07e07... still that effect, still that grip, still that experience, still that addiction. It is the best crime-drama series I have ever watched. Have become a huge fan of this series. A Big Big fan :D :D :D"
576,"Dexter is a Blood Spatter pattern analyst in Miami Metro Homicide , who becomes a vigilante at night. He is a serial killer , a special serial killer , who only kills special kinds of people. He kills the other serial killer who always get away with the law system and escape justice. Dexter is the best TV show ever , with the best actors(especially Michael C Hall), with the best script. With every episode you watch , your quench for more and more of Dexter, it keeps on craving. That's how I can describe Dexter! A show you want to go on and on.Hope they will make a season 8. With the current season 7 , its the best so far. Giving his season 10/10."
577,"Dexter is by day a blood forensics expert for the Miami police department. By night he is a vigilante serial killer who only kills criminals who escape the justice system. Michael C. Hall plays the role brilliantly. The first three seasons were great, only to jump the shark in Season 4 and has been on a downward spiral ever since.The First Season was great. I know you have to expect gore in a series about a serial killer, but at times it gets a bit much. Despite that, a brilliant season: 9 / 10.The Second Season toned down the gore, just a little, and ramped up the suspense. Very good: 9 / 10.The Third Season was poignant with the emotionally-distant Dexter forming and ultimately losing a friendship with a District Attorney who found the fine line between vigilante and criminal a hard one to walk. I found it very moving and the flourish at the end was genius: 9 /10.Season Four started off with the promising premise of Dexter balancing his family life with his 'hobby'. It introduced the talented John Lithgow, but plot holes emerged as the writers had Dexter taking stupid chances and doing things that just didn't make sense: Like 'Hey, I've managed to corner and drug a dangerous serial-killer who is threatening my family, but I'll leave him in my car and go and pick a fight with those cops over there so I can get arrested and he gets a chance to escape.' That sort of thing.Writers and the audience need to be able to trust each other: The Audience agrees to suspend belief and in exchange the writers promise to entertain them. When characters act stupidly the audience become alienated: This is known as the ""The Idiot in the Attic"" Syndrome. Likewise the ending smacked of overconfident writers messing around with their viewers. Once the writers lose the audience's trust, it's hard to get it back. We also got a very boring side-plot of a romance between Batista and LaGuerta. Batista was no longer the lovable oaf, and LaGuerta no longer the series much needed antagonist: 6 / 10.Season Five bought in a villain everyone should hate: Motivational Speakers! But on the whole it was lame and lacked suspense: 5 / 10.Season Six was a little better, but still far short of the series original charm: 6 / 10.If the series didn't jump the shark at the end of Season Four, it surely lost it in Season Six which had the absurd spectacle of a counselor talking Deb into an incestuous relationship with her brother. The producers claim this will be a great twist for Season Seven. I doubt it, and can only hope in a Twilight Zone-like twist that Dexter's writers wake up and find themselves strapped to Dexter's own table."
578,"The first time I heard about the show from a friend, he said ""Dude, this Dexter guy, he's a serial killer. You'll love him"" and the only response I could give at that time was ""Wait.. The Protagonist is a serial killer! How are they going to justify that?"" The question still hangs in between for me, but that is the intrigue of the show. The show challenges the moral definitions of today's world and shows it from a serial killer's point of view, of how unemotionally and scientifically he sees it and how rational he can make it seem. When a show makes you love a serial killer and hate his victims, there is seriously something to think about. The show is about a person who has surrendered to his inner serial killer and yet tries to fit in the society by observing and trying to behave like others do, and his constant struggle with his ""dark passenger"". Meanwhile the show stays true to its genre as Dexter plays part-detective to search for other killers and play his part in the society. He has the perfect front as the forensic blood work specialist of the police department.But merely having an intriguing concept does not make a good show, you need to present that concept as well. Fortunately for us, we have Michael C. Hall playing the part who is an absolute delight to watch supported by actors like Jennifer Carpenter, James Remar and David Zayas. The visual effects and the technicality by which Dexter plays cop hooks you to the show. The show never gets old and neither does the character as he overcomes the different challenges in his complicated life.No wonder the show is running successfully for nearly 7 long years now. It definitely makes it to the top of the list of my favorite TV shows."
579,"Finished my yearly DVD marathon of the previous season and found myself surprisingly disappointed, to a degree. (7.2) Even poor, Dexter is engaging and interesting. But two startling items stood out.In the first episode there were probably 6-7 shockingly obvious back-story segments. I was aghast that we'd stop this freight train to blatantly walk through story elements that we have not seen on screen. I don't quite know what the alternative was but the way they did it was the worst (and laziest) way to go.The second was the very obvious twist of Olmos not being real. It was a mile away. 100 miles away. I was 99% sure on the first scene between Hanks and Olmos. And then had to sit through a dozen scenes that screamed it. It's been done before, done in this, and done by me (in my screenplays).And the hooker that died of the drug overdose. Very obvious that it was the Police Chief, although I think we were suppose to know that. (But the one scene in the car seemed to discount such.) And I don't know what to think of Debra being in love with Dexter. It seemed forced. Maybe Dexter has jumped the shark. I hope not.But the series has become very cyclical. His encounters and mistakes have become very predicable. The near misses entertaining but old. The coincidences piling up. (The old killer from Portland? Ugh!) In previous seasons we've gone over his struggle to find a humanity and he found it with a wife, family and son. But the character is going over the same territory with no real reason. I personally get tired that he makes too many costly mistakes. I would imagine that this character would develop more guilt about such.With this self examination, I would like to see the character second-guess his need to kill. That he would develop and change. Or degenerate from failures and mistakes. He does a bit in this season but very briefly.I am looking forward to how they'll handle Debra witnessing Dexter killing Hanks. (But I won't pay the $1.99 per episode on Amazon.) But even as an intriguing plot twist, I kept thinking, ""Wouldn't he have learned to be more careful by now and locked the door?"""
580,"i was recommended this show by a few people but took my time to watch it. i thought the idea of a serial killer who worked in a cop shop was a wee bit far fetched and was always a little put off by it. but when i did get round to it (i was laid up after an operation) i watched 60 episodes (first 5 seasons) in 5 days. yes. about 12 hours a day. i could have done more but by that time i was getting to into character and feared for the criminal fraternity of north west england... i couldn't believe how good it was from the very first episode. the characters are brilliantly written. the story lines are tremendous and the acting is far and away above any expectations i had. and i just couldn't help be be behind dexter. because despite his considerable faults, the man is a dude... would recommend this to anyone. but just make sure you have time on your hands. because this show is like pringles i tell you... :)"

Jeff Lindsay's Novel (Darkly Dreaming Dexter) & other sequels to the debt story book. is slightly different to the TV series.

582,"If you're not watching Dexter, you're missing out on something special. I understand everyone has different preferences and that it won't in fact appeal to everyone, but it deserves a chance (it actually took me a few episodes to get into the story, so give it that much if you decide to do so). I would say that it is a wildly underrated show, but if you look at any outlet for fan-dom, you would see that people obsess over it (I'm bordering on that distinction myself). Considering that Dexter has won less than a third of the 109 awards for which it has been nominated as of January 2010, I can't help but wonder if the organizations dispensing these awards acknowledge quality as their true measure of excellence. If so, maybe I'm watching the wrong show! (This actually is a great feat - I just think it deserves more. Happily, most of the main characters have won at least one award.)Dexter is a show about a forensic ""blood spatter guy"" - by day. It's no secret - he's a serial killer by night, but he only kills bad guys. He follows a code which both determines who he pursues and how to keep from getting caught. It is a show meant to tug at your moral heartstrings, but for me there is no question. Dexter is a hero. It's not all black and white. Amid the sea of gray, there is an even bigger sea of red tape. What's both alarming and enraging is that in most cases, this red tape is clear enough to see through meaning that most law officials who have to let a bad guy go because of a paperwork or evidence mishap know exactly what they're doing but can't do anything about it. These are the guys that Dexter takes care of Dexter is ""taking out the trash.""Dexter is a rare gem - one that won't soon be matched for its uniqueness and pure entertainment value. There is genius in every aspect: casting, character development, setting and filming, MUSIC, the opening sequence, story lines and attention to detail, arresting plots that are both fearless and fear-inducing, and of course, the man who plays Dexter: Michael C. Hall. His portrayal is brilliant and has inspired me to want to see his other work in Six Feet Under. He started in theater, which is completely unsurprising due to his ""remarkably theatrical"" voice (as stated in an essay by Vladislav Tinchev) - which, by the way, is exceedingly valuable to the show.Dexter is signed for at least two more seasons with no known plans to end there, for which I am grateful. Inevitably, the show will end someday though, and when it does, I hope Hall continues to darken our screens as he does so well. I'm fidgety knowing that I only have two more episodes to watch of season 5 (which I am watching for the first time because I wait for the DVD's) and then I will have to wait until August for season 6. But I'm happy to re-watch the first 5 (actually this is my second time through for the first four seasons), and there are also the 5 seasons of Six Feet Under, which I have never seen and is also a highly-praised show.If I've persuaded you, enjoy!!!"
583,"Not that it is a great show, this is one of the best on TV today.When Dexter came to TV I was somehow not motivated much to see it, and after watching few episodes in time when 3rd season were on air I was not much impressed. But after my dear friend told me how this show good is, I started to watch from beginning. I get DVD's from first 2 seasons and wow.Now, I am that guy who have all of it in my private library, and who watch it all over again. And naturally I become one of the many fans of this unusual TV show.What hooked me in it is that weird idea of forensic specialist - serial killer. And that one who have moral qualities and do what most of us would do to them that law can't judge properly or that deceived the system. But not Dexter. he is a hero for us, yet it is pity he can't expose it.But man how many of them he judged. And all that under the clean ritual under strict code. With that his jujitsu mastery, totally opposed to that nerd look and behave.Well I saw the promo of new season and it is here, and as much it can be seen, this will be great ending of series. I mean I wish there will be more Dexter, as I never get enough of him but if the season 6 will be the last I hope it will be as we fans expect it to be.Even all seasons are great, and have its storyline with great casts and guest stars, my personal favorite are season 2, Mostly because dexter were dealing with his own crimes and that intrigue about will they catch him.That opening credits are magnificent as a morning ritual and narration is crucial in it. Fantastic dialogs, camera work, everything. All the best to it."
584,"Dexter is interested in seeing Jordan Chase in action. His next opportunity is at one of the seminars he is conducting in the Miami area. Dexter is surprised by the hold Chase has on his audience. He decides that he and Cole, his security director, are going to be the next ones to pay for the killing of five innocent women, plus the way these two men tortured, and almost killed Lumen.The police station is in turmoil after the killings at the Mayan club. Maria LaGuerta has decided Debra must pay for her part in the shooting. Deb defends herself, but Maria is dead set in making her the scapegoat for something that was not her fault. Maria does not feel that Cira should take the blame for what happened. She still has to contend with her husband Batista. Lumen, who is supposed to get supplies for Dexter, receives a phone call from Owen, the man she was engaged to be married back in Minnesota. He is in Miami and wants to see her. They agree to meet at an outdoor cafe. Owen has two around-the-world tickets for them, something Lumen did not plan. She has no plans on going with Owen. As she backs out of the parking lot, she crashes against Liddey's car, who has been tailing her. She has no choice but to show her insurance card where he gets to know her identity.Dexter and Lumen meet in the room he has reserved for her. As they prepare the room with all the paraphernalia, they hear moans coming from the next room where Cole has taken a woman and are having sex. Dexter had a weird experience at the seminar when Jordan Chase called him to the stage, where he went over the grief over the killing of his wife. Lumen, who had gone out of the hotel, is detained momentarily from the image of Dexter on a monitor outside the room where the seminar is being conducted. Cole happens to see her. Lumen goes back to the room, but Cole irrupts from the door that separates the suite from it. She is saved by Dexter, who comes in just in time. Cole is a goner! The next thing we see is Dexter checking out of the hotel with his suitcases where evidently pieces of Cole are stored. Later on, Dexter and Lumen take a boat ride to dispose of the different parts of the dead man. Unknown to them, Liddey had captured their images on a camera with telephoto lens.Romeo Tirone directed this episode which pack quite a lot of action. Manny Coto and Wendy West wrote this installment. All have been connected to the series and do a wonderful job. Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Desmond Harrington, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, the regulars, are at their best. Julia Stiles makes a valuable contribution to the show with her Lumen."
585,"I don't see any comments about Jonny Lee Miller performance as Jordan Chase (Eugene Greer) but I can not get over his American accent. Being British, this is as good as it gets.Peter Weller did an amazing job as Liddy, I am glad they gave him the chance to show his versatility, the poor guy is only famous for Robocop! He really convinced as a dirty cop, tough and merciless to get his position back. And by the way, I had never seen Jonny Lee Miller playing a bad guy, but he did a fine job as well. Sober, restraint, repressed and very mean, dominating others to do what he didn't have the courage to do."
586,"I know, I know it took me a really long time to get to this review and I apologize for that. The truth is this show has been one of my favorites since the very beginning. Michael C. Hall is just an awesome actor in pretty much anything he does, and apparently so is Jennifer Carpenter big ups on a great casting choice.Lets start with the mood of this show, unlike all the other stuff about serial killers the pace is nice and slow, they don't rush through the show leaving you with nothing to grasp onto in fact making it an hour long was by far the best decision made for this kind of show. As far as feel is concerned since this is actually a narration from the lead and entirely based on his view of the world you really get into it with him. He takes you inside the mind of someone who doesn't perceive killing as bad or good just as a means to an end. The acting is top notch by far, this is the only show I've seen where I can truly say it literally gets better with every episode even with this many seasons in.The show is about a serial killer who works as a blood splatter expert which gives him virtually limitless access to the files of people who got away with murder and therefore by his standard need to be killed, but also it deals with him blending in and becoming a family and society oriented person since he seems to lack the basic understanding for human response and emotions and is in turn made to fake these emotions. This is a definite must see for anyone who wants to see a spectacular show 10/10 with a bullet.... or a knife."
587,"When I first about dexter from a friend, felt it was a comedy. reluctantly i took up to watch the first season. 1st episode, it felt whats going on. but then the story unravels. you don't know when you become a part of Dexter's life and when you begin to see things that he does. every moment of the what dexter shows thrills you. its like a story that is abandoned somewhere in the darkest secrets, is being made into a live able-to-see-and-hear thing.when i completed first 2 episodes, i was besought by the fact that how this ends. In three days i completed 1st season full.Dexter is such a rare combination of crime entangled in ones life so deeply that the same crime becomes the reason for his survival. such beautifully carved out scenarios and life struggles. Its not just for the plot that the difference lies, its how livelike portrayal of the plot is with the delicate intricacies of the human psyche, that this show finds its biggest strength.**HATS OFF**"
588,"Dexter's one of the best TV shows these days. It's just too interesting that I couldn't stop watching it until I got to the end of the last season! Even though every episode is almost an hour...The writers of this show never take a break! Every season of ""Dexter"" they presented us a new, fresh, interesting and good plot, and developed the story step by step.Just a minute ago, I finished watching the last episode of the 4th season, and it just left me in shock!!! I can't wait to watch the 5th season now.I watch a lot of TV shows: Lost, Prison Break,Grey's Anatomy and more. And I have to tell you - now ""Dexter"" became one of my most favorite TV shows! If you haven't seen it 'till now, hurry up now and watch it, 'cause you wouldn't wanna miss it..."
589,"Dexter combines the elements of what makes a show interesting and well-produced, but there's another element that lifts it up another notch into real greatness. It could be said that it's an original concept, of a blood-splatter expert in the forensics team of a Homicide squad spending his spare time killing people (albeit those who go by his ""code"" as Dexter has, given to him by his step-father, hero-cop Harry). But there's even more of an edge to it that is unexpected. Part of this comes from the actor Michael C. Hall, who steals almost any scene he's in without even trying (or rather Dexter isn't trying, he just 'blends in' as always acting bright and outgoing and personable, which he really isn't).Another comes from the narration, which comes in sometimes while a conversation is going on with other people, like the other cops, in a room where Dexter drops in his humorous but deadpan two-cents, or just goes off on the truth of the matter for him: why he has to get away from something, what Harry's code means and changes or what he meant to Dexter as the series goes on. And aside from the strong supporting cast all around, from Julie Benz as the strong-willed but loving girlfriend of Dexter, Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's spunky step-sister (it takes a little while for Carpenter to grow on you, but she does after a while), it's just a series of strong narratives. Dexter is like a superhero- see an episode in season two for a more literal translation of this as ""The Dark Defender""- a man of the night ala Batman and a scientist like Bruce Banner, who just has to try to hold inside his truly evil urges.The arcs of the characters, not just Dexter but everyone, is fantastic and laid out in such a way that we can't really totally expect what will come, and so it's got some terrific suspense going for it too (re: Lila in season two, holy crap that gets good, but Jimmy Smitts in season 3 and especially John Lithgow get their moments in the spotlight too). It's a spin on the unexpected, lead by a protagonist who is somehow relatable, through his work ethic and dilemma of responsibility to his code and to those he loves, while also a total psycho. It's daring, fun, and chock-full of suspense and mystery, like good crack."
590,"Refreshing subtle morbid and anti-cyclic humor, really surprising plot changes, suspense and all of this in a rather fast tempo. Great work of art! The series must have been supported by a team of psychologists because at the end the most strange situation are explained with picture and words in such a way that you understand the reasoning behind all th different authentic characters. I just finalized the second season and can't wait for season 3 (august 3 - 09 according to Amazon UK). Lots and lots of Oscar winning movies are not able to compete with this 30-hour during movie. Not only because of the excellent and exciting story but also because the perfect casting, acting and camera-work (especially the attention for detail in many scenes)."
591,"Dexter is a really good show, even if they did deviate a lot from the novels (which are also good and I recommend reading).I hated that crazy bitch in Season 2 and the ending of S3 was very bad: Miguel dying in the episode before the last was not a good way to do things. The season felt like it ended with a thud rather than with a bang. Miguel was awesome as the show finally got an actor that could hold his own with Michael C. Hall. Every scene featuring the two was electric. It's something House could desperately use at this point. Overall I wasn't as glued to the Season as I was the first two.IMO, it goes like this - S1>S2>S3. I enjoyed all three seasons and can't wait for the next."
592,"It's hard to stop watching this show: Dark, mean, cynic, funny... yes, ""Dexter"" is not the usual stuff. If someone like Dexter could be for real ? I doubt it... but it doesn't matter, as long as you can accept this setup there's a good chance you won't get disappointed !Season one started with a ""brighter"" side of Dexter, who needs to find out about his past... or let's say the past finds him. The second edition went on with the dark side of Dexter (I liked it even better), who needs to find himself. So everything I've enjoyed the most about this show holds true to these two perfect seasons. So what I love about ""Dexter"" are the carefully written characters, which change and evolve slowly during the seasons. It is not a 08/15 set of characters and you can expect interesting social constellations. After all Dexter is not the only great character here !And considering the third installment: I'm not happy with it. Decent it is... but not as great. A slow ticking story development (far from being as deep going and personal as before), missing the dynamic evolvement of it's antecessors. Except for Dexter most characters feel static, not as fascinating. In my point of view it would had been better to cut this season down to let's say four episodes. Take it as inciting incident to get something bigger started. Probably what comes next will be more interesting - after all I'm pretty sure season three will have strong consequences for the next one !In short: If you don't know ""Dexter"" yet, start at the beginning. It's a terrific show with great potential for further great seasons. Only season three doesn't show the same qualities as before !"
593,"i started watching Dexter because of the higher ratings it has on IMDb. Honestly i enjoyed the first season. i am not a person who like blood or not like blood, i am basically neutral about it as long as the bad guy get hurt. even though Dexter is a cold blooded serial killer he only kills other serial killers, he don't harm innocent people, he had good control of his feelings, his emotions and his actions. he manage to stay on the track regardless of what comes his way. i considered him as a hero on the first season.then comes the season 2, that's where he became out of control, falling for some crazy chicks seductive acts, unable to control his actions and at last he sacrifices a good and innocent mans life for his own getaway. at that moment i feel regret about thinking him as a hero. Dexter is no hero, he is just another cold blooded killer, he just kill people to satisfy his insanity to kill people. and then i became disappointing about the show.this is not for everyone,just because it has higher ratings that does not mean its the best TV show. i like shows like NCIS LA' Hawaii five 0, white collar, arrow, Castle etc. where bad people get justice they deserve. that's it. this is the baddest TV show i ever watched.waste of time for me."
594,"Network: Showtime; Genre: Drama, Crime/Mystery; Content Rating: TV-MA (graphic violence, blood and gore, profanity, nudity, drug use and simulated sex); Available: DVD; Perspective: Classic (star range: 1 - 4); Seasons Reviewed: 2 seasons First off, let me just say what a pure joy it has been for me telling people the premise behind ""Dexter"" and watching their eyes widen, their jaw hang open and hear the words ""no way!"" come out of their mouth. Thank you Showtime.Meet Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall, ""Six Feet Under""), a likable mild-mannered everyman who by day works as a blood-splatter expert with his foul-mouthed tomboy sister, Deborah (Jennifer Carpenter), in the Miami homicide division tracking down serial killers. By night, Dexter himself is a serial killer.Having noticed Dexter's more psychotic urges as a teenager, his father, Harry (James Remar), instills in the boy a ""code"" that allows him to channel those urges into other criminals, murderers and rapists. In a transparent, but necessary, way to make the story easier to swallow, Dexter is made into a twisted vigilante cleaning up the scum of Miami.""Dexter"" just may end up being one of the best shows of this decade. It is a triumph as a crowd-pleasing thrill ride and a smart bit of dramatic storytelling. It's dark, it's bloody, it's funny. It's a riveting nail-biter and it's a daring character study, taking us into the mind of one of TV's best anti-heroes the small screen has ever seen. It is a breakout hit for Showtime, a network I've long respected but whose solid output of great shows have tragically not caught the audience or notoriety of HBO. ""Dexter"" is on par with ""Dead Like Me"", ""The L Word"", ""Sleeper Cell"" and ""Penn & Teller: Bullsh!t"", but it has that something extra. It is the kind of water cooler TV that gets people excited. Having always waded in the kind of moral ambiguity that infuriates family watchdog groups but makes for compelling character drama, Showtime takes the idea of rooting for the bad guy up to a whole new level here. ""The Sopranos"" was a ground-breaker don't get me wrong, but ""Dexter"" is a hell of a lot more of an entertaining watch.It is a triumph for Michael C. Hall as an actor. Having spent years suspecting there was something dark and sinister behind David Fischer's eyes, the transition to serial killer fits him like a glove. Hall was born to play Dexter Morgan. He captures Dexter's inner monologue in such a dryly funny way. A way that is hard not to like. And yet, without Hall changing a tick, the show is able to flip us in the head of another character and allow us to see how truly dangerous and psychotic Dexter could easily be. Hall makes something that would sound impossible on paper, fluid on the screen.""Dexter"" is based on Jeff Lindsey's ""Dexter"" novel series, which I am not familiar enough with to say how accurate the translation is. But the show is a rich, intelligent and methodical piece of storytelling. The mysteries are unfolded over entire seasons, a style that got ""Veronica Mars"" quickly canned, but I've always preferred it to the self-contained ""CSI"" mysteries. The payoffs in this way, are so much sweeter and, without giving away anything, ""Dexter"" is filled with more than a few ""holy s--t!"" moments. It's such a rare pleasure to watch a show so full of potential get to live in to all of that potential.The genius of the show goes back to it's deeply cut and uncommonly well-thought exploration of the titular character. Dexter isn't a growling, black-hat bad guy, but the show doesn't exactly let him off either. As envisioned by Lindsey and Showtime's developers, killing for Dexter is like an unavoidable sexual urge, or a drug addiction (a metaphor brought brilliantly to life in season two). Maybe because he was born that way or maybe because his earliest memory involves sitting in a pool of blood, in a cargo container, watching his mother being chainsawed to death.When we first meet Dexter he is a man without emotions. He spends every waking moment trying to blend in to a sea of normal people. He fakes it. This involves pretending to be in a relationship with Rita (Julie Benz) and pretending to enjoy normal people things like sex or bowling. Soon Dexter's illusion starts to become reality. His world is challenged, first by an affection for Rita. Then the Ice Truck Killer, a maniac who drains his victims of their blood who Dexter develops a professional awe for. Season 2 tightens the screws even more. When his dumped bodies are quickly discovered, Dexter has to think quick to stay one step ahead of the police department he works in to keep from getting caught. In either case, the ending is satisfying, will not leave you hanging and makes me all the more excited to see what this show has up it's sleeve for future seasons.This show is not to be missed. ""Dexter"" is not for the squeamish, not necessarily for the blood and guts (though there is plenty of that), as for the ideas that it puts in your head. The experience of getting inside the mind of a compulsive killer and feeling for him. Rooting for him. Is Dexter's vigilantism the right thing and the end justify the means? Can he be socialized and reformed or will the mask slip off? What gives us our humanity and is Dexter that much different than the most socialized and functional human being? The answer, in this case, is as clear as blood.* * * * ½ / 5"
595,"This is fantastic. Watch the pilot and you will never give it up. How I found myself so much in this series is another question. No I am not a serial killer. But the point is actually deep inside we are. The details in Dexter's life, the rituals that he enters in are all shown in great excellence. Another amazing point is the conversations of dexter both with his girlfriend and the around. The inner voice is used tremendously. One of those is in the pilot he is saying when he is with his girlfriend. ""I am totally not interested in sex"". This makes you believe in it. Yes I say to myself. How can it be otherwise. Another conversation is when the girlfriend asks his job. ""Yes my job is blood"" and than the inner voice saying ""My life is blood"". The Fruedian thing on one side, the emphasis on the ""Pretending not to be"" is great. Dexter's pretending philosophy is marvelous based on the Harry'S code. This is worth watching. One of the best I have ever watch."
596,"This is my epitome for a thrilling series. In some form, it's a modernized and darker version of the famous book ""The Outsider"", which presents the audience with a character who has discarded emotional ties; or, to be fair, probably never had any to begin with. The series just sucks you right into a detailed plot line which is sharpened more for every episode, and I cannot get enough. The plot is dark and displays the mindset of sociopaths as the protagonist, Dexter, is one. Despite that, however, it's hard not to like Dexter's being, and due to the scattered fragments of his past we are shown, we gain an understanding of why he is that way, and empathize with him. Throughout the series we gain an understanding of his rich inner life, as we can hear his thoughts on things, which also makes for excellent comical comments. If you enjoy a plot describing a plausible reality hidden under society's idyllic facade, then Dexter is what you want. It's of a dark nature, but has fleshed out and fully developed characters (as well as actors) who play their role in the story well. I am at a loss for why this series has gotten so little attention, as it is a masterpiece, and I will be very disappointed if this series is ever abandoned."
597,"This has got to be the best TV show ever. Michael C Hall really makes you believe he's a serial killer. If I was to see him in public I might run screaming. If you like to see the bad guy get whats coming to him, you'll love this edge of the seat thriller. The only bad thing is it's on Showtime, so if you don't have cable you have to wait till it comes out on DVD. But it would be money well spent. The first season is over, which I am truly sad about. But not as sad as having to wait till next fall for season two. I'm not real crazy about Dexter's sister, Deborah. I know she is a good actress (The exorcism of Emily Rose), but there is something about her in this that I just don't like, she nerves me. The show is based on a book by Jeff Lindsay ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"". I haven't read the book yet, but plan on it."
598,"*Story/plot* As with every review i write, i do not like to spoil anything so i suggest read the plot here on IMDb. Long story short, a forensics blood analyst leads a double life. He is a serial killer as well.*The series* I have the privilege to have seen all the 4 seasons thus far. It is a very impressive role Maikel is playing here. The way he acts, looks, narrates true-out the entire series. Keeps you involved the entire time and your begging for more with each episode that ends. Noticeable is the musical score for this particular series! Normally i do not care so much for soundtracks of series or movies but here excellent recognizable, eery ring to it all. It fits the entire series.*Supporting roles* Now here the series looses point on! E.g: Erik king? Or Miss Carpenter (sister of Dexter, there in real life married couple BTW) There both the worst actors i have ever seen in the history of movie/series. Erik dozer is a Sergeant in the series and he is not convincing AT ALL with doing his part. I know many ppl love his acting, it is save to say those ppl do not have much movie/series background who find it that way.Miss Carpenter is overacting allot, as she needs to be upset she already breaks down and cry. Instead of looking upset she looks sad ectra. Big flaws in the series if you ask me the main character Dexter steals the entire show. Who thinks different off course no problem with that, remind you I'm not talking about Erik king script here, but really how he express himself (typical B-actor) The script has nothing to do with that.*Overall* DEXTER, is a wort to have series, the story is exciting and new. The main character is very convincing (oscar wort role he plays) It looses point for the BAD casting of the supporting roles in this series. This is simply a casting mistake that choose on a Sunday morning 2 cheap actors to make the series or something (sorry this is really how i feel) I have read the bulletin boards about this, there lots if children here that react to it when someone claims that the supporting roles are thin. Well the *beeps* are countless remind you dear ppl that most of the IMDb reviewers are pll that have a extensive knowledge on movies.That does not mean you cannot have a opinion, but what i miss there is the argumentul value (to back up what the say) and cussing does not make you look more of a intellect either.Well this is it."
599,"I bought my-self season 1 of Dexter as a way of catching up with it as here in the UK we always have to wait till last until all the good TV programmes are shown and not only that but season 2 was hardly out on DVD here. I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase , rather having to stay up till late to enjoy , i got to enjoy it from the comfort of my bed. I think of anyone better than Micheal Hall who plays Dexter , his take on the ice cold serial killer makes him one of the most likable anti-heroes on TV what I really like about him is that there is probably one thing that we can see in there and relate to about him. The comedy is also funny and thats what makes it stand out and thusly makes you want to hook into it every week. Apart Micheal Hall the performances from everyone round are great it shows that the whole crew actually enjoy making the series. Dexter is another great show from the states and I am really looking forward to the next series.DEXTER : 8.1 OUT OF 10"
600,"Most women characters in the show tend to show superficiality and the common requirement of a masculine figure to be complete. Which is completely inadequate and sexist, to say the least.Dexter's sister should be a huge character in the show, but most of the time she is simply a mess that requires ANY men with her in order to function properly. How contradictory is this, if at the same time she is a great detective?!And I had to say this somewhere... Rita's character is the most stupid, annoying, superfluous I have seen quite in a while! Besides being a cute blonde, her contribution to the show is zero.Thank you for reading this."
601,"It has been a long time since i watched a well made TV series like 'Dexter'. No cheesy lines, no Armani suits for CSI people...just people as they are.Its very entertaining and a pleasure to watch for those who are tired of Crime series like 'criminal minds' and 'CSI'. Its something new and opens a whole new window for Crime series. I just cant get why SHOWTIME did not show this in their Middle east service!All in all, the story is great, the acting is great... could do with a little more emotion for dexter but i guess its what makes him and the series on the whole special,i don't know what else you would want from a TV series."
602,"I've read the Dexter Morgan series of books and I did again before popping in episode one of 'Dexter'. After finishing the last page of the first book (Which season 1 is based upon), I began to watch the show that I had so feverishly waited for.The beginning credits feel like the beginning and introduction for a short film and it works stunningly well. The lighting was one of my favorite parts of it. . . My least favorite includes the whole 'orange' thing. I felt that that was a bit disturbing. But now that I've had time to think back on it, it actually prepares the fans to see the strange killings in the show.As for the actual episode, I was a bit disappointed that the voice of Dexter (played by Micheal C. Hall) is a bit more monotone than I imagined. Though after a while, I found that the voice was, in fact, perfect. The casting for characters who were very dear to me (Deborah, Vince, Doakes, Rita) was a lot better than I thought. Deborah/Debra (Played by Jennifer Carpenter) was a bit more pretty than I would imagine, considering that Deborah could normally be seen with a frown on her face. The only thing that truly saved her character for me was when I heard her say her first curse word and it made me think that Jennifer could actually pull this character off.Vince Masuke ( Played by C.S. Lee) was slightly different than his book counterpart. but in a good way. In the books, Vince was a bigger faker than Dexter way. But this character, who was very minor in the books, is turned from a minor into a very crucial character. This is due to the incredible effort put forth by the actor. I had fun watching 'Dexter' gain a comic relief.Rita (Julie Benz) was just the type of girl I imagined for Rita: beautiful but motherly. After watching the first episode, I felt the urge to watch the second episode and I'm glad to say that this series is a very good companion to one of the best book series of the 2000's."
603,"Dexter.. It has got to be the best show ever. just cant get enough of it! i hope it goes on forever:DLove the story. and everything about itI would recommend this show to everyone that likes crime, Hell, even if you don't even like crime go watch this! Its packed with excitement. Very good acting!1 nothing more to say.i really don't know what else to say. i just love this show! i cant wait for the next episode. the waiting kills me!:DIm not really good at reviews btw :DMeh need 1 more line :D"
604,"The season with John Lithgow as a killer is my favourite (S4); however, the show starts to become predictable and not as engaging after that. Debra is one of my favourite characters and she makes the rest of the show better simply by being there. Her death is unwarranted and sloppily executed though. I think this is a problem with most shows that run for too long: Dexter looses steam after the fourth season."
605,"Just got Netflix, finally binged watched. Mixed feelings. Micheal C. Hall, great actor, his eyes & eyebrows say it all. Have to say in the 12 years since it first premiered, women's roles have evolved. What a pain in the butt the women on this show are. From the sister, Deb (glad when her mouth was finally taped shut), to the wife, Rita, with her downtrodden, abused history, always calling in the middle of action for Dexter to pick up milk in her annoying, whispery voice, jeez. Then getting pregnant, then marrying, her life's dream. Lot's of twists & turns kept it interesting. Jon Lithgow's season was terrific & Colin Hanks will make an excellent psycho in his future endeavors. It got quite campy (during) after season 6. A letdown after a stellar beginning. Definitely watch the first 4 or 5 seasons..."
606,"When we were first introduced to Dexter back in 2006, we were shocked. I had to admire the courage of the writers and producers not only to try to make you root for a serial killer, but also to justify his crimes. Often delivered with a slight dose of dark humour, we witnessed over 100 murders by his hand. Sometimes they were difficult to watch, sometimes they were hardly earned, but they were always morally challenging: can you really blame a guy for killing killers?Rescued from a crime scene and adopted when he was a young boy by detective Harry Morgan, a mentally damaged Dexter (portrayed by an excellent Michael C. Hall) soon showed signs of a ""dark passenger"". Desperate, Harry, with the help of a renowned neuro-psychiatrist, secretly worked on a ""code"" for Dexter to live by in order to avoid the electric chair. He learnt what the police is looking for at a crime scene and how to take his need to kill on those not worthy of living. His ""code"" drove him to execute every victim in a perfectly planned ritual, leaving no blood or body to prove anything happened. Dexter's obsession for blood caused him to become a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department. Looking at other killers mistakes all day, he could not only track them, but also improve is game to be practically uncatchable.In the awesome first season, as the protagonist's bloody (to say the least) childhood was unveiled with perfect timing, we became familiar with his foul-mouth sister Debra, the hilarious one-liners of Sgt. Doakes, the pain-in-the-ass attitude of LaGuerta, the socially awkward Masuka and the rest of Miami Metro. Without, of course, forgetting his new girlfriend Rita Bennett and her troubled past.The big drama of the show, is that Dexter's entire life is a lie, a cover. He's a psychopath and his brain can't process empathy. He surely cares about Rita and his sister but doesn't know what love is, he just fakes it to hide is monstrous nature. And when you seek serial killers, sometimes the people you care about get in danger. But the series also has its comedic moments, for instance you hear Dexter's inner monologue. He's a psychopath and doesn't think like normal people do. It's funny because he always says the opposite of what he was thinking, otherwise people would know he's a serial killer.Another great thing about the show is its intelligent writing. It constantly tackles deep moral and philosophical themes. The main antagonists always have a special meaning that brings another dimension to the story. For example, in the fourth season, Dexter became a father and a husband, but, simultaneously, he had to deal with Arthur Mitchell (marvellously played by John Lithgow). Mitchell, also known as Trinity, was a family man, but also a successful serial killer. Culminating in one of the most intense and jaw-dropping moments of television I've ever experienced (and I watch Breaking Bad!), he had to realize he's a monster and happiness is not something he can look forward to.After seven unequal seasons, a detective knew something was wrong with him, a murderous poisoner had a grudge against him, and his sister was a wreck and hated his guts for making her lose her humanity Everything seemed placed perfectly his world to fall apart. I wanted the final season to be a manhunt, I wanted tragedy, losses of lives, his family destroyed and him either caught or dead. Did my wish get fulfilled? Not quite. I mean yes, but by another far better show... Don't get me wrong, the final season had its moments. We learnt interesting things about his past and the rebellious apprentice theme was a good idea. But it wasn't enough, a lot of characters were either boring or irrelevant. In the end, instead of getting into trouble he was constantly getting out of it. If it wasn't written on the poster, I would have never knew it was the last season. In the series finale, Debra is shot and becomes a vegetable, arguably because of Dexter's mistakes. I would have rather seen her die with all her dignity in an emotionally intense and spectacular scene (Hank Shrader, anyone?). But instead she had to be unplugged from a machine and dumped in the ocean... Again, he realizes he's a monster and happiness is not something he can look forward to. Obviously, the smartest thing to do after that was to fake his death, leave Miami and become a lumberjack in the middle of nowhere to protect the remaining members of his family from himself, right? All in all, the show was very well acted and well written (for the most part), but Dexter's biggest weakness is its lack of consistency. The final episodes seemed rushed and not thought out, that's a bummer because I think this great show deserved a much better conclusion. As a tribute,I did a top 15 Dexter episodes, feel free to check it out: http://www.IMDb.com/list/kYqEK-xsmtE/"
607,"To put it bluntly, Dexter in my opinion the best TV show I ever seen. The show revolves around the lead character Dexter Morgan, who is a forensic blood spatter analyst by day, serial killer by night. From Dexter's birth, he has had a troubled and disturbing past as he watched his biological mother massacred in front of him as a toddler. Harry, Dexter's adopted father and police officer, saw the warning signs of a serial killer in the making and tried to stop it. Knowing it was too late, Harry taught Dexter to use his obsession and compulsion to kill to help put away criminals who have slipped through the cracks of the justice system.Each season of Dexter has a different and unique plot that carries out until the last episode of that season. The writing of the show is the absolute best part of the show. The writing is incredibly unique and comedic and times. I have found myself laughing many times throughout episodes. The show does a great job of placing the viewers inside the mind of a serial killer(Dexter) as the viewers are always aware of what he is thinking because of his inner monologue. Michael C. Hall does a near perfect job of playing Dexter, as its almost impossible to fathom any other actor playing the role of Dexter. Dexter at times can be very introspective and ""deep"" so to speak. I have recalled many times of me thinking about the way things are in my life and life in general. The show ties in morals and draws a deep and controverial line into what is truly right and wrong.To conclude, this show is simply amazing. I regret to have watched all of the episodes too fast sometimes watching up to 5 in one sitting. Its the kind of show that keeps you up late at night after watching it, leaving you the itch to find what happens next."
608,Best Show Ever. Everyone I've ever talked to that has seen this show is absolutely addicted to it. Every episode leaves me forcing myself to watch another one. Each show leaves me more in suspense of what will happen in the next. Even if you aren't a person of killing and blood it is still a great show. Especially in the later seasons the blood and gore dies down. It is a perfect show and if i had it my way I would pay for it to never end. It's the perfect action drama show that is not to much drama with enough action. Plenty of hot scenes and is perfect suspense.Absolutely love it.
609,"It's funny how so many people can relate to the character of a serial killer. It's true that maybe we don't all have the urge to kill someone from time to time, but I think anyone who has ever experienced any kind of passion or weird childhood can understand him. It takes you on a roller-coaster of human emotions, moral laws, religion and the justice system.He is definitely a superhero. He has his kill-outfit, kills by night, has a secret identity, childhood issues and he fights for justice. And that is probably one of the reasons people actually like him, even though his actions make this show the kind of thing your mother wouldn't want you to watch on TV.Michael C. Hall's portrayal of Dexter is outstanding. Just hearing the monologues gives you the chills. Other characters are so-so. I especially didn't like the character of Rita Bennett and maybe it's good she's gone, because it has opened many new doors for Dexter's characterization.The sixth season was OK, but not as good as the previous ones. Throughout the whole season the story progression was too slow and when it became a bit dull, they finished it off in the last 2-3 episodes. I just hope the writers will finish the story before they ruin it, if they're already out of ideas.All in all, it's my favorite show, that's for sure. The most exciting thing on TV."
610,"This is a show unlike anything. The protagonist is a serial killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol........................Robert C Hall as Dexter is simply brilliant. I went back and saw the series '6 feet under' in which he plays a gay undertaker. In Dexter he has become an even better and more mature actor.He is a serial killer who has had a conscience drilled into him by his much loved father. He is a lab tech with the police and on his off-time he is a vigilante. Not by choice, as he 'needs' to kill to maintain his sanity. It seems dark when I write it out like this, but its not, there is a lot of humor, family values, et all.The production, direction and editing are superb.The best part is the cast, everyone is perfect. :-)........................This is the one show that I eagerly look forward to every week. The only show whose schedule I know by-heart.Its now in its 6th season and it has not lost the least bit of steam. How many shows can make such a bold claim! Simply Amazing!!!! Do check it out. Really worth the time. :-)................Cheers. :-)........."
611,"Finished watching season1 last night. And I've something to say (with spoilers)I love this show and totally hooked to it. Till the episode Deb falls for Rudy everything was OK. But making Rudy the killer is so so so so clichéd. It was so intelligent and engazing I was thinking about a 9 rater..But I've problems with the following. 1>Dexter is surviving only because he's cautious and observes everything. But only thing or person he did not observe was Rudy and he's the killer!!! Can't accept. 2>Deb falling for Rudy. Already told, clichéd. 3>In a scene Dexter hacks into Masuka's mail and edits a word document and just saves it. WTH!!! How do u change the original document that the sender has sent. It will be still in the inbox. Dexter can't delete and the solution shown for it is so false. 4>The Cuban boy describes Jesus!!! WTF? Kuch bhi?!!! 5>All of a sudden the investigation for Valerie Castillo's murderer is stopped. And obviously everyone stops searching for Valerie Castillo's husband (who they considered as the suspect) 6>Rudy gifts the hooker's ring to Deb. WTF??? Most used cliché. 7>AND the mother of all cliché. Rudy is brother of Dexter. WTF??? Why can't he be just a worthy competitor?Apart from ^those I loved the show and gonna continue. Its different."
612,"Dexter is by far one of my favorite television series of all time. The great thing about Dexter is that it is completely different from any other TV show every made.I love the ride that you take with the characters, especially with our main man Dexter, constantly having questions unanswered and constantly wanting to know and figure out what is going to happen next. I think what makes the show so engaging is the fact that we have this guy, Dexter, who we become so emotionally and heroically attached to, and we are given a sense and feeling that we want him to prevail and we don't want him to ever be caught or found out who he really is, yet at the same time we sometimes question and doubt the actions that Dexter takes. I believe we as the audience would also find so many similarities in Dexter and his everyday life and at the same time we ask ourselves why Dexter is the way he is, which is another factor as to why he becomes such a successful protagonist.Overall this is a fantastic and thoroughly engaging and addictive TV show, that at times will leave you shocked, disgusted then at other times will leave you happy and relieved for our protagonist, among many other emotions."
613,"I was surprised very at the series, the sarcasm of the personage and I form of as history is told is very legal. The creators had applied much psychology and philosophy. Note 100000000000000000000000. All that are loving of histories you police cannot leave to attend. The end of series anger to surprise to all the beginning ones, I am very anxious for continuation that will go to be recorded in July of 2007 is what it seems. The series continues excellent and chemistry between James Roday and Dulé Hill, is being each better time. Week that comes we will have the last episode of the year, Shawn versus. The Red Ghost. Pra me optimum episode of the series, where we go to know the Magichead. Loving of the series they do not leave to comment and to help to increase popularity of this great success."
614,i have read the book darkly dreaming dexter and this show actually compares to it. great show.if you look at the first comment made some idiot made a bad comment without knowing anything about the show. i agree six feet under is a good show but this show is based on a book and not trying to compete with HBO. please chinakatt do a little research before bashing on something. i am very anxious for season two i need to read the book dearly devoted dexter before season two comes out. i recommend that anyone who likes this show read the novels written by Jeff Lindsay
615,"At first i see DEXTER is the most amazing series I watch ever , and the greatest scenario written for the American cinema, I feel, when I saw the series I feel at the same time as I read a book contains a wonderful novel by a genius author. my only criticize the sex contents and the bad sexy words and the continuously cursing, because when ""Dexter"" was amazing for watch I start to see the series with my dad to create a new relationship with him, for his urgent desire to be with him for a time, but after a few episodes I return to my room and follow-up series as usual, only with my self, I am ashamed to see the naked scenes with him and hear the obscene words i hate to hear it together in the same time,so i have a question why - in ""Dexter"" - the focus should be on the sexual scenes more than any thing even the bloody an killing scenes which is the base of the story of ""Dexter"". is sex is the main controller in us so we give it this care. really i have no problem with sex but too much in this matter, it disgusted."
616,"Okay, so at first I thought that the ice truck killer was Dexter's Father who died 10 years ago. But as it turns out the killer was his own blood brother. This is where the story gets weird. Poor Deb doesn't want to admit that her father might have lied about a couple of things. Dexter was rescued from that giant storage container at the shipping yard. So where was his brother when the first cop on the scene discovered him. He could have taken both boys. but instead he came out with only one like he was alone. So, I guess the older brother Brian played by the stunningly sexy Christian Carmargo was left behind. This rejection along with the trauma of seeing his mother sawed to death lead to his supposed anti-social personality disorder which he was later declared as cured when he was 21. This open the door for the whole story line to occur. There is a whole background story that should be covered for the next season of Dexter if there is one. Poor Deb has to deal with finding the love of her life and finding out he is a serial killer and suffering the grief of the loss of love and the sulking that comes with a bad breakup.So, next season I would hope to see that this background story is brought to the forefront. Although, the police staff cannot know to much about Dexter as the story would be over. Then after the background comes to light the rest of the second season can continue with other plot lines. Kind of hard to top this one."
617,"It's refreshing to see that there are still courageous people in showbiz. To take a novel like that, to resist the temptation of doing a 2h30 film in which would be impossible to achieve the psique intensity that Dexter transpires. This series, with great, great action, allows to see our inner sociopate, to understand the reasons for cruelty in a damaged world. It's definitely one of the best things I've ever seen, and I can wait until I get my hands on the novel.Beware: sometimes it get gory: blood, lots of blood. Its not my wave, but it isn't gratuistious, and it can be easily overcome with some shut eyes.Recommended to all who like good entertainment but is tiered of the empty explosions10 *'s"
618,"After being an addict to HBO on Sunday nights thanks to ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"", I am now a potential SHOWTIME addict as well. Granted, this is the first Showtime series I've seen, but if future ones are this good, keep them coming.I always felt Hall's character in SFU was the the most difficult one to portray, and he did it brilliantly. It would have been very easy for that character to offend heterosexual viewers, myself among them. Quite the contrary, I found David to be highly likable and the sharpest mind within his family. He was overshadowed by Nate, but both roles were played equally strong and deserved considerable acclaim.As far as I know, Hall followed up that series with his current starring role in ""Dexter"". How can someone watch a serial killer on TV and feel empathy towards him?! I do. And I doubt I'm the only one, since that's one of the foundations for the show really. We're supposed to feel that empathy towards him. And we're supposed to admire him for ridding the world of evil people that slip through the cracks of the legal system. Again, this is an extremely difficult role to play, and Hall is simply outstanding.In fact, without Hall, the overall acting in this series would be noticeably poor. The lieutenant and Dexter's sister, for example, are in desperate need of acting classes.Overall though, the series is definitely worth watching, the writing and directing is very good, the plot flow is excellent, and Hall is very magnetic as a leading actor (yes, even for a straight viewer) :)"
619,"How this show maintained an 8.7 rating throughout it's entirety is dumbfounding. Appalling really. It gets so bad in the later seasons it nearly ruins the brilliance the show initially held.If you haven't watched Dexter, I'll give you a tip right now. Watch it, but STOP watching after season 2. This show is a classic example of corporate greed overtaking art in the worst possible way. The series should've been 2 seasons long. Even 1 season and this would go down as one of the greatest shows of all time.The plot is excellent. A serial killer with a code, who hides in plain site. A brilliant vigilantly cleaning up the messes that the law can't touch. The twists and surprises and brilliance of how it all ties together in the first 2 seasons are masterful....then....someone let a grenade off and it all went to hell.It's easy to get sucked into this show because it starts off brilliant and the character development is gripping, but I warn you, just stop after season 2. By the time it gets to season 7 & 8 it's a shell of what could've been and it's down right awful. I was watching a later episode and my girlfriend overhead some of the dialogue from the other room and asked if I was watching the CW. The story line gets absurd and the acting falls apart (who could blame the actors when they're given such drivel to work with).The ending is atrociously predictable and lame. It's just sad that a show with such potential was thrown down the incinerator with such awful writing towards the end. As with many shows that go far too long, the ending fails miserably and will leave you wondering why you just spent hours and hours of your life hanging on to see the finale. STOP AFTER SEASON 2!"
620,"I kept ignoring that feel to just let myself complete something without complaining. But, for me, the truth is Dexter is not the smart kid he thinks he is . He's not even the psychopath they're trying to convince us he is. And, somehow, he's just an ordinary man with an ordinary mind who turns his talents into the wrong way. . . and even about his life with women, I first listened to him saying he's over all that and then what?!! -skip- . . he feels  he cares  he's a normal person not a legend. So, why they made a series about Normal who needs to be Normal, to watch Normal? . . Each episode is connected to the other and each season is about one thing! I can summarize the whole 12 episodes in each season in 10 min. quite boring...why I decided to watch it? Because I thought it's about forensics which I thought it'd be great to watch it applicable to dead bodies and blood *I'm a medical students* . guess what? They don't even talk about it it's all about Dexter's boring life with Rita, Lila, Deb and the kids . he didn't even show us the way he enters the doors without being seen .. is he Spiderman?  oh, there are a lot of good things on it. but, I'm so depressed to say  I just need to watch a real thing that satisfy my mind why is that so difficult to be found?"
621,"At first I was put off by the premise of having a television show where the protagonist is a serial killer. That sounded reprehensible. I mean, c'mon, are they trying to make serial killers look cool now? What is this world coming to? That's what I thought, but the show works because the whole dark serial-killer thing is compensated for by everything else in the show: the colorful, sunny, Miami setting, the relatively wholesome family values and themes about justice and protecting the innocent. The first few episodes put me off a bit with how gruesome and gory some shots were, but later the directors made a good decision to minimize that; For the most part the show doesn't dwell on the violence, and it happens tastefully off- camera.I love this show, but Dexter is the least-convincing psychopath in the history of TV psychopaths. Throughout the series he behaves in a way that is far more reasonable, thoughtful, and considerate than most 'normal' people. True psychopaths are selfish and impulsive. Psychopaths are born, not made by traumatic childhood experience. Pyschopaths are supposed to be charismatic, impulsive, reckless, while Dexter is just kind of socially awkward in a way that is far more normal than he realizes. Psychopaths generally don't have an urge to kill, they just have no remorse or empathy about it. To a psychopath killing a person is like squashing a bug. In his inner monologue in multiple occasions he says/thinks nonsense along the lines of ""If I could love anyone, I'd love my sister Debrah."" or ""If I had feelings, I'd feel bad in this situation."" When obviously if he didn't have those feelings, those thoughts would very unlikely to occur to him. Given the tone and situations where he says that, he seems less like a psychopath and more like someone who has a warped view of themself and their feelings.Dexter is not realistic, but the writers have successfully created a protagonist that is a symbol - exaggerated for story-telling purposes - a symbol of a regular person like you or me, who has demons to battle and struggle against every day. He's just a regular person who struggles with balancing work and family and a terrible addiction. This show explores the ultimate fear that is too common: The fear that if other people learn who we really are, they will all hate and shun us. Most people have more boring secrets: that they are an atheist, they are gay, they like to eat icecream straight out of the carton with potato chips late at night, but deep down inside in our inner dramas, it feels like we might as well be serial killer and so we can relate. But what really keeps you watching the show is you really want to see these bad guys caught one way or another, and you really don't feel bad when they end up on Dexter's table.This show goes on for 8 whole seasons. It seems like everyone complains that the show jumped-the-shark after the first season, or the second season, or whatever. Personally, I enjoyed all the seasons. They tend to follow a formula, it's a good formula: Every season there is a Big Bad that Dexter and the police hunt down. Dexter always makes a new friend that gets his hopes up that he finally has someone he can confide in and have a rapport with. Throw in a love interest, some family drama, and some minor side-plots about his police coworkers. It's all good except sometimes the side-plots can seem rather pointless and tacked-on. And Dexter/Michael Hall has no chemistry with his love interests. I seriously expect him to come out of the closet now that the show is over. But overall the acting is amazing, there is never that feeling that I'm just watching a show with actors. It's not realistic per-se, but it's immersive.It was only until season 8 that I really felt like the show was getting contrived and was outliving its worth. But first thing's first, the early seasons are by definition, classic good ol' Dexter. But season 4, with John Lithgow as the most excellent Big Bad of any season, is not to be missed. Over time as Dexter eventually confronts people like big-time mobsters and super-rich dudes, his whole socially- awkward insecure serial killer schtick starts looking kind of quaint in comparison. Then the show ended... I won't spoil it but I was a little surprised and slightly disappointed. The ending left some side-plots hanging. They introduce important new characters and then just forget about them. It wasn't bad, but the writers fumbled the ball there.But despite my criticism, I love this show and would recommend it. It's smartly written, engaging and suspenseful, and has lots of heart for a show about a serial killer."
622,"Earlier review after watching first 6 seasons:Dexter began as an adaptation of a Jeff Lindsay series of novels, which provided the basic premise for the plot, and provided an example for the dark humor and poetry of the interior monologues (I don't know any other film or TV show that has handled these monologues so well). Even as early as the first season, however, the show elevated itself above the novels through greater psychological subtlety and much more adept plotting. (I've read all of the Lindsay novels and he isn't that great at either; the show stops following the books by the end of season one.)Above all, in Michael Hall's incarnation of the role, the show features the single greatest TV performance of all time. Psychologically speaking, Hall embodies a crazy combination of whimsy and muscularity, authenticity and fakery the likes of which I haven't encountered anywhere else. At its best the show's depiction of an evil superhero delves into some heavy philosophical territory, examining how a sense of duty to one's fellow humanity can coexist with an indulgence of sick individual appetite.The show is also a smart inversion of the police procedural (the closer the police get to the killer, the more despondent Dexter and his audience become). While there are definitely some low points (season 6 and any plots involving Quinn), these can be excused because the show is, as a whole, pretty tight, certainly by comparison with the longueurs on, say, The Sopranos. Seasons 1, 2, and 4 compare favorably with almost anything else out there, and shouldn't be missed by anyone interested in compelling and addictive TV. The seasons stand alone pretty well, so you could probably skip a season or two without missing that much.Edit after end of season 8:Sadly, the last three seasons oblige me to lower my rating. The Clyde Phillips era was a complete success; seasons 1-4, and parts of 5, are among the best seasons ever made. At that point, the writers made glaring mistakes; with its focus on religion, season 6 could have been a fitting place for Dexter to reflect on Rita's death in a real way, but instead it was the worst, most superficial of all of the season. Scott Buck simply could not bring the show back to its prior form. Even the over-hyped season 7, despite a strong performance from Ray Stevenson, fell off because Stevenson's character was simply a fairly ordinary bad guy, a mob boss with some charismatic qualities, rather than one of the colorful psychos of other seasons. What Dexter seems to have learned from Stevenson's character was the importance of love, which was an unfortunate lesson as far as the show went: introducing Hannah was a disaster for the show. The final season began brilliantly and seemed to offer a worthy synthesis but ultimately plodded along nowhere, with too many offensive absurdities (cars in water, a treadmill, a hurricane) to name here. By the end, the writers had finally put the show itself on Dexter's table."
623,"Dexter will be forever one of the best serial in history. Idea for story about psycho-killer is brilliant. Jeff Lindsay is genius. Dexter series have only one weakness, but this weakness will notice only readers of book by J. Lindsay about Dexter. This weakness is that TV series is similarly only with first book from J. Lindsay. In first book Darkly Dreaming Dexter were Maria LaGuerta killed in the end and Dexter's brother wasn't killed, he escaped. In books is Doakes alive but injured. Next difference between book and TV series is that Rita is in book still alive and don't have son Harrison, but has daughter Lily-Anne.TV series are very good for everyone who, didn't read books before. Michael C. Hall is ideal actor for Dexter's role. Monologues talked by Dexter to himself are mostly really philosophical, Dexter's reflexions about religion, love, brotherhood are really full of true.I am horror movies fan and I'm so glad, that in Dexter series are always really gruesome murders.Dialogues with Dexter's dead father Harry are awesome too, in these parts of story we are usually looking at Dexter like teenager or child.My rating is 10 out of 10: Michael C. Hall - 2 stars, Jennifer Carpenter - 1 star, Story - 3 stars, Dexter's monologues & reflexions - 2 stars, Dialogues with Harry - 1 star and Intro & theme song - 1 star."
624,"Dexter has the perfect combination of intrigue, love, drama and comedy. It has all the elements to want to watch it over and over again. You want to know what is going to happen next because every chapter is done meticulously to build up the character. Every season explores an element that makes up the character (religiously, socially, family, etc). At the end of each season all the chapters conclude perfectly and leave an unsolved mystery for next season! Adding to an amazing story, the sound design of the series is wonderful. The sound elements help the story develop and catch indirectly the spectator's attention to all the visual elements."
625,"I think it's a great show, and I give it a well deserved 9/10. It's just so clever, you're never sure what's going to happen next, unlike on most programmes you can be like, ah it's okay, we know he's never going to get caught, but with Dexter you actually genuinely think he might just get caught at any moment.The only problem I have with the show, is that I just don't think it's my thing, I've not found the show as addictive as I'd of liked to, I am prone to addiction to TV shows and I have to watch them all in a row, but with Dexter I'm happy to watch just one a day which I am slightly disappointed about, I like to have to force myself to stop watching. But saying that most other people find it massively addictive so I'm probably just a small % of people who don't find it that addictive so chances are you'll love it.Okay I do actually have another problem with it, they killed off the only good eye candy."
626,"Some shows are bloody and mysterious in a good and attractive way but this is just awful
It begins way better than it ends, The ending is just selly and in general it's lack of smartness and mystery"
627,"As many other reviews note, this show started off great. The story was unique and the cast was great. And then it got repetitive....really repetitive. And the characters became annoying, self-destructive, and altogether annoying and frustrating to watch. The last half of this series destroyed my opinion of the entire series."
628,"Dexter.... that guy who gives a better insight in to precise care and attention to microscopic detail with not much of fuss and exaggeration.... so stubborn about his own code of ethic, and trust me it takes at least a life for him to change even a single belief to be changed or even altered. an impeccable balance of the dark-passenger and an emotional human :) the character ""Dexter"" is so amazingly created.... so composed, calm, reserved with a reason, perfect profession to fit in. never missed a show this bad. Sadly it all came to an end... Tonights the night.... its happens only once.... it has to :) wish there is a second part.. something like Dexter-2 :)"
629,"This is the best show I have ever seen. If you are thinking about checking it out, do so. It is worth watching as you can tell by all of the positive reviews posted on this website. I have seen both Season 1 and Season 2 and it kept my interest the whole time.I have seen many other supposed great shows, and this is still the best one. I watched all five Seasons of Six Feet Under, four Seasons of The Wire, and the first Season of Oz; to this point, Dexter is my favorite. Not to say that those shows aren't good. They are very good, but Dexter is extraordinary.All though the main character of the show (Dexter Morgan) is a sociopathic serial killer, you gain his trust and he gains your affection. Dexter is my favorite character on his show. It is literally the best show I have ever seen.If you are looking for a new show to Netflix, or a DVD to buy, I highly recommend Dexter. You won't be sorry!"
630,"Dexter is one of those shows that most people have never heard of, but for the people that have heard of it, it is the top show on their radar. I read the books on the show and thought that they were pretty good, but when watching the show (and i do watch it religiously, every episode) i was simply blown away. Every actor is perfect and believable, and Hall plays Dexter with the exact amount of subtlety that is needed. After watching show you have a need to keep watching it, and after every season you feel 100% percent satisfied that it has given you the full experience, i love this show and i hope they keep making new seasons. If you watch the first episode and don't really enjoy it, just watch the next couple, once you get into it, you wont be able to tear your eyes away."
631,"Dexter was a great show before season 3 to me. Dexter Morgan was a whiner with deluding denial about their humanity despite having a genuine relationship with Rita, feeling genuinely protective of Rita's kids, caring about Debra since he was a kid, and caring about his father. After Doakes and Lila West died, the future characters became dull. Doakes really brought life into the show to me. When he died, the show did to me. Not even Dexter Morgan could make the show worth watching anymore for me. All in all, I thought Dexter needed a mercy kill after season 2."
632,"i just want to share my love for this series. i live in england and I saw the first series on channel fox last year i was so impressed! its about to be released on itv2 which is great as i get to see it again. so many more people are gonna be following this! i cannot wait for the next series. its written fantastically, and Dexter's little saying are brilliant! This series will really be a hit here. seriously if your a women and you don't fall madly in love with 'dexter' then there's something wrong with you. do not miss this series. you will be sorry!!! also i hate it when people spoil it for others.its not a nice thing to do.whats the point?"
633,"Let's get this out of the way at the beginning: this show is incredible. Every main character holds his/her own in captivating the audience with performances that should all be worthy of Emmys without being over-the-top melodramatic. Michael C. Hall is simply stunning, playing the complex protagonist/antagonist so well that it leaves me haunted and thirsty for more. His binary opposition alone leaves me wide-eyed in wonder at how a person could portray so many emotions so well. Even though it is about a serial killer (or, more precisely, several serial killers), there is not too much gore or blood, even given Dexter's profession. Dexter's world is constantly changing, and yet the viewer does not get bogged down with too much information, but instead aches for more of Dexter and his issues: his girlfriend, his step-father, and, perhaps most importantly, his past (among many other things). Even though some might say that I'm addicted to this show, it is totally worth the addiction, as it does everything right."
634,"After loving the character Michael C. Hall played on Six Feet Under, I never would have guessed he could pull off the role of a serial killer who happens to work for the police force. But he does and in an amazing way. He inhabits this role and makes you understand why he is the way he is. He narrates and stars in this show with lots of flashbacks to his childhood so over time you get to know the back story and what moves him to do what he does. The challenge is not to feel compassion for a serial killer and I don't think most people will, but they will get the complex psychology that makes up this interesting character.The show is extremely well done and incredibly compelling. I highly recommend it."
635,"I am not big on TV drama. I was never into what everyone usually raves about, you know - your Desperate Housewives, House and CSIs.The first episode of Dexter however absolutely blew me away. There and then I wanted to drink Cafetiere coffee, floss after breakfast, tie my shoe laces real hard and of cause kill bad guys. I am joking of cause - I never liked to floss. God damn though, honestly even the beginning credits are so efing juicy.The whole show is brilliantly crafted affair. The acting, the characters, the music, the plot  all of the things slot into place as nicely as those blood slides into the Dexter's trophy box.The show provides the continuity of episode by episode script writing excellence I have never seen, and yes you probably refer me to my first paragraph, but I am telling you the writing is amazing.The combination of blood, sex, dexterity and wit, simply stunned me. I loved it. I watched Season 1 and 2 in one breath aright, I did pause for loo breaks a few times, and I swear, next Season I am watching it with a bucket next to me yeah-yeah I'll be watching on my own :) DEXTER  I hope there is more where it came from!!!"
636,"Dexter works for the police department as a blood splatter specialist by day...and by night, he's a serial killer. And the twist is that he only kills the bad guys. So that makes him a good guy, right? And that's the paradox with Dexter. He is at once likable, lovable, and funny. We're often in his head listening to his monotone and sarcastically witty comments. He knows he's a monster, but we also catch glimpses of his human side. However, the killing he does is graphically violent and disturbing. As much as you like him, you're repulsed by him.The writing is top notch, and the acting by Michael C. Hall as Dexter is flawless. I originally wasn't interested in this show based on the violence, but I was totally sucked in after watching the first episode.Dexter currently has two complete seasons and has been renewed for a 3rd season. The show is based on books by Jeff Lindsay. I read the first 3 books---they are good, but the show is actually better. Every episode has me on the edge of the couch. As much as I want Dexter to be all good, it's the dichotomy of good/evil that keeps me coming back for more."
637,"I just recently purchased the first season of this show. I had read some information about it, and seen a few previews (not to mention that I had thirty bucks to spend), and decided to go ahead and buy it. I was completely enthralled. I stayed up from ten at night until noon the next day watching this, and am currently writing this while still suffering from the Dexter-induced insomnia. I had my reservations, however, since after buying the season, I decided to do some more information digging, and had found that some people had said it was not very good, that the majority of the characters were flat. While I agree that a few of them don't seem very real at the beginning of the season (I don't know what it is about them, but they don't seem like very probable people), they do round out as the show progresses, and any flatness is more than made up for by the brilliantness that is Micheal C. Hall.In short, this show is amazing."
638,Definitely my favourite current TV show but I never pick the obvious.Liking the bit of originality to murder mystery format - a serial killer you will like. The pacing is fast enough that plot is developed in each episode. The voice over works really well & the flash backs to Dexters youth with his father are never overdone & always add to the story. I feel the success of this show is the way it takes you into Dexters head so you know what he is thinking especially when he thinks he is about to be found out.Michael C. Hall is the undoubted star of the show as dominants from start to finish of each episode as everything resolved around him. After his performances in Six Feet Under this surely puts him in the A list of TV actors.It is a pity this show does not greater exposure on this side of the world as stuck on limited available cable channel.Waiting to see how series 2 develops.
639,"The series gets more exciting for every episode. The thrill of watching Dexter conspire and plan new kills really sets a cool chill down the spine. The brilliance of it all, the acting, the surreal feeling of a connection with Dexter's morbid ways. Everything just add up to a fantastic thriller. And best of all, it never gets old. The only disappointment in this series for me was the first episode in season two. So for those watching it, I'd rather just skip that episode. Don't know, but it really disappointed, and didn't give the satisfaction that the other episodes so gladly gave.The episodes give a lot of variety, both seeing Dexter evolve mentally, and the excitement always builds up to the end, and usually the episodes fade to the calm voice of Dexter Morgan as he gives you a phrase that will blow you away and make the hairs on your arms stand up and clap.The series has proved to be one of the best ones I've ever had the joy to experience. I really recommend Dexter to everyone, especially those of great interest in the thriller genre, and for those just waiting for a groundbreaking series. Its as addictive as heroin! Anyone actually knows where to buy the picture that Lila paints of Dexter? Would be so cool to have hanging on the wall. If not an original, at least a poster!"
640,"I watched the first episode and found it boring. After a couple of months, my friends told me to watch it again because it's so amazing and interesting. Then I watched 10 episodes. To be honest, it was a waste of time. This show is the most naive, slow and very boring show I've ever seen!!"
641,"I hate watching TV-series. I hate having to allocate a weekly time that I have to remember. But Dexter makes the cut! Wow, this series really has great characters, not just Dexter himself, but also his annoying sister, the crime techs, the police men etc. The slow pace allows time to feel the characters. You instantly get caught identifying their characteristics, peculiarities and complexes.The story is great, just amazingly great. Not the typical TV-series syndrome, when you feel the the authors just try to catch you to have to watch the next episode or to fill out the time. There is an original story every episode. It actually seems like the authors have so many great ideas, that they have to cut it down and only keep the best parts, only what is necessary.The humor is morbid. There is plenty of excitement, awkward situations and urgent issues to solve.The low key of the story and the personalities keeps it to seem probable. Not too fantastic, not too much unlikely events or stunts to pull off, not too strange characters etc.Oh, and it is not too gory. Not long sequences where you see someone being cut into pieces. No SAW likeness at all."
642,"Friends loved this show with its narration, flashbacks, and hidden life at the police department. I watched of few Dexters and well ugh not good! The viewer is supposed to cheer for this sick guy who tortures other killers; it's like cheering a evil Nazi doctor kinda hard to swallow. Worse part is trying to like a character who has no empathy, or understanding of other humans. What we got is a nice guy version of American psycho. The premise is stupid, the guy is going garbage bag people and not stop killing duh hard to digest. If any one watched a show Dexter's evil compulsion know this is just not right. Dexter just drags, and self reflects in a boring, but strange way. 5 stars. Over rated."
643,"I applaud the creators of this show for daring to make a mass murderer a hero. They have taken an even bigger risk by wrapping each season up so neatly that even their fictional protagonist would be astounded. I just finished watching the complete second season on DVD and I am doubtful I could be more pleased with the balance of tension and satisfaction played-out in this show.Unlike other shows with an ongoing story line, this one does not leave you on the hook waiting for next year. I don't know about season 3, which I expect is in progress, but the first two seasons kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, but didn't leave me hanging until next year. I really appreciate that. I will be a repeat customer.As for the content, it is really tough to recommend this show. I usually skip the very disturbing opening sequence. When I force myself to endure it, I can recognize its brilliance. This show is so 'out of the box' which is a sad cliché I know, but that is the point. It takes a bizarre concept and fleshes it out so expertly that I cannot turn it off.This show rarely drags, but it does annoy. I really feel that those that create this show are working hard to mess with the viewer and take us on unexpected twists and turns. Unexpected twists are essential to making the show really enjoyable to watch. But they also have characters like Deb and Rita that I think other viewers will agree, are extremely annoying. I suppose that without these characters, the show would be incomplete somehow.I take the time to write this review because I think this show is truly extraordinary. It is not for everyone. The subject matter is very disturbing and makes the viewer have compassion for a mass murderer. What is up with that? It is exactly that conflict that makes this show unique. The writing and story lines actually make it good. They really pull it together after throwing out a web of questions and answering them satisfactorily.I will patiently await for season 3 to come out on DVD and watch it start to finish in just a few days as I have done with seasons 1 and 2. I cannot imagine experiencing it any other way. It is intense and very well done."
644,"I'm still working my way through season 2, but I wrote an article on my blog, http://neonblackjack.blogspot.com that says what I find meaningful about the show. I outlined the reasons that I connect with Dexter's character in a meaningful way, even though he's a serial killer. I see a lot of the same discussion of the artificial distance created between people that Virginia Wolff talks about in To the Lighthouse, and I find this meaning in a few Wilco songs. We all deal with this space that we use to protect each other from our dark secrets. I find it comforting that Dexter, a serial killer, is really only facing the same problems that everybody else does. I'd love to hear what you all think and if you like it, please digg it! Thanks."
645,"Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro PD by day, and crusading vigilante serial killer by night. Many detective characters 'always get they're man' but this one gets him and then puts him in several garbage bags on the floor of the ocean. This may sound off-putting, however Dexter is more Bruce Wayne than Patrick Bateman, as all of his victims are other killers like himself. With snappy well written dialog, and brilliant heart pounding plot twists around every corner (delivered with a complete lack of fear by the writers) this show explores themes of love and family, good and evil, nature vs. nurture, and the nature of morality itself just to name a few. Don't be fooled, this is not a crime drama, this is a very very dark comedy masquerading as a crime drama. It is without a doubt the best show on TV right now, and they're are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe the depth and brilliance of Michael C. Hall's performance in the title role. If you have not witnessed it stop reading and start watching right now you will thank me and yourself!"
646,"I just spent the entire day watching the second season of Showtime's... Drama? Yeah, but it's more than that. Um... Comedy? Has it's moments, but not quite... Let's see... Thriller? Definitely suspenseful. You know, I don't think that there's a label befitting a show like this. How about ""Dexter""? Yeah. That's the one. ""Dexter"" is the only way to classify this show, because there is truly nothing else like it on television.Not since the middle seasons of ""The X-Files"" have I been so mesmerized by a television screen. I literally just spent 12 straight hours with nary a thought outside of: ""Holy crap! What's gonna happen next?!?"".I first became a fan of this show when I started a subscription to Showtime two years ago. I saw all of the first season episodes ""On Demand"", and became curious when I read the plot summary. I hadn't heard anything about it at that point as I don't think it had quite taken off yet.Needless to say, one episode in and I had an addiction. I finished the first season in two days and immediately proceeded to tell everyone within earshot about this wonderful new televised adventure. I still love the reaction when describing Dexter to someone who knows nothing about it. ""Wait, so the title character is a serial killer? And he's the good guy? The killer?!?"" And it's not so much that Dexter is a good guy, it's that you can't help but root for him. Go ahead and try. I dare you.Dexter is truly one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and likewise one of the more interesting characters ever brought to life. Every episode has the viewer questioning Dexter's morals and whether or not he's justified in doing the things he's doing. Isn't that what great art is about? Making you ask questions? Some of which you really don't want to be asking yourself? So, if you haven't seen Dexter yet, I strongly suggest doing so. The first season is on DVD (Already have a copy and watched it through twice.) and the second season is On Demand or all over Bit Torrent sites."
647,"I stumbled upon the show, and I was hooked immediately. The characters in the show are very interesting, and the writing is superb. The allusions show the result influence of the character in present time (done with great subtle style), and the acting is solid! There are some events that allow you to fill in with your imagination, and the direction and focus of the storyline feels like I'm in the movie theater. This show should be motivation for future TV shows. This show delves into a fresh and more interesting view of fighting crime and provides a sense of completion through instilling karma. The I recommend watching this over reality TV ANY DAY! The writing is so good I wish I wrote it myself if I had the talent! Great job!"
648,"In one episode, Dexter erased some evidences that could link him to one of his victim. And we then discover that he also uses a pseudonym in order to commend certain products, that are necessary to his criminal actions : Dexter is also known as Patric Bateman ! And it's true that ""Dexter"" as a lot to share with the universe of Brett Easton Ellis, the author of ""American Psycho"". The character suffers from a total detachment from his emotions, that gives him the feeling to be an empty shell, to always have to pretend to be human, when his absence of humanity is hidden by a superficial social mask. That's maybe the greatest part of the show, to be the reflexion of such a monstrous characters' interiority. It's too bad that it too often takes the shape of a more conventional cop drama.SEASON 1. Rules of Attractions.The strange universe, all in perversion and detachment of Dexter is brilliantly introduced by the first episode. It began crudely by a violent murder, and the off-voice of the killer-narrator teaches us that he's also a blood expert, for the Miami Police department. Like a crazy vigilante, Dexter is a cop the day, and a murderer of serial-killer at night (sound stupid like that, but I assure it's a very mature show), and a monster (it's a metaphor, once again : it's an adult show) who tries to be a human the rest of the time (with his girlfriend or his sister). The character and the all bizarre atmosphere of Miami is really delectable in the first episodes, but those of the middle of the season become more and more conventional, by trying to develop the other cop's characters. Fortunatly, the last four episodes, more and more centered on ""The ice-truck-killer"" story, which defined the unity of the arc this first season tells, put dexter's personality and tortured past first again, and the all thing becomes passionating again. Let's hope that the second season stays as original and cynical as its main character.(To be continued...)"
649,"""Dexter"" is a show that gives the viewer a look into the life of Dexter Morgan, a blood-spatter analyst working for a local police department in Miami. However, Dexter has a rather interesting secret: He's a serial killer.Dexter (played splendidly by Michael C. Hall of ""Six Feet Under"" fame) is a likable character with but one flaw: he has no emotions. Thus his ability to kill for the purpose of justice. Dexter only kills those whom he believes have escaped the justice of the Miami police. Child molesters, murderers and full-blown wackaloons, all fall under Dexter's infinite care and planning.Ever aiding his foul-mouthed adoptive sister (played by a sexy Jennifer Carpenter) in her pursuit to be a detective to match their adoptive father in caliber, Dexter's adventures continue to twist the imagination.Keep it up, Showtime, you've got a... killer series on your hands."
650,"Who knew that a serial killer cop as the main charming/disturbing character could make such a fascinating show? I don't think any other actor besides Michael C. Hall (of the excellent ""Six Feet Under"" Show) could be so engaging, while killing the bad guys, while working for the good guys at the same time. I read reviews and thought there was no way they could pull this off. I was terrificly surprised and pleased at the same time. I am glad to see that a second season has already been filmed, but I will have a hard time imagining that it can be any better than the first. But being surprised the 1st time, will make me putty in its hands for the 2nd season, so here's hoping! I can't praise this enough, and it is great to see that Showtime has finally gotten the cojones to pick up their programing a-la-HBO, with some quality no holds barred shows. Most recently the absolutely terrific ""Weeds"" for example. (Haven't made up my mind about ""Californication"" yet) I'm actually surprised that this sort of show hasn't been explored before, but am glad that when it did come up, it had been done right. Recommended for anyone that gets tired of the same ol' (starting to get boring yet still pretty well written ""CSI's"" & ""Law & Orders."") for a little something more adult, and not constantly having to stop their scripts from being...well a little more real! Give this a try. I dare you not to get hooked on it. If you are looking for a ""this guy killed so & so, here's why, and here's how, and with what,"" that fits in 42 minutes, this show is not for you. If you are looking for some major character development that delves into the psyche of some truly normal looking/acting person on the outside, but holds most of his true self inside, then this show is for you."
651,"So, I finally sat down to watch Dexter after so many years, and based on all these glowing reviews and gushing fans I was quite excited . . . . . . Boy, was I disappointed. I love the premise of the show but the execution is really poor. The acting is stiff and really fake (comes off more like a daytime soap), the characters are just strange and weak. Dexters sister is weird, not very smart and permanently angry. Her serial killer boyfriend was really weird too, and how we're supposed to believe she fell for him is just beyond me. His nemesis Sgt. Doakes is absolutely terrible - lousy acting and frankly the biggest stereotypical cliche of an angry black cop that I've ever seen. It's embarrassing! That character ruined it for me. His dialogue was so fake. The other characters are also very annoying . . . . the Asian forensic scientist who's basically a pervert who constantly makes lame sexual jokes, the cliche latino detective who has problems with his wife, Dexters girlfriend, Rita, who started out as this shy, sheepish, abused woman, and ended up being a tough, take no prisoners type . . . . . . . the list goes on and on.I tried to give it a chance. The story lines are decent, but the acting is so bad I couldn't get past it!! Made it to episode 3 of Season two and gave up!"
652,"This show is soooooooo good. It is so well acted and well written. It has a great cast and Michael C. Hall's portrayal of dexter is one of the best characters only second to house.(well, maybe not that great but is in the top 5) The show is executed brilliantly and with great dialogue. Each episode flows from one to the next. Lies, deceit, murder and emotions. Dexter as a character is so complex and well executed. The show shows a very human side to the character and all of the cast members put their own stamp on there respective characters. The show is very humanised and that is all credit to the writhing and the cast. There are no bad story lines and it feels real. A great show. Hoping for great things in the future of the show. Only flaw of the show is in its disguise of the ice truck killer. You can easily spot who he is as soon as the character is introduced and you see his face. from that moment on you know who he really is. P.S. If you don't see who the ice truck killer is than you need to have your head examined."
653,"I just have to say it's incredible the ability the whole cast have (including writer, director and actors) to make such a stunning, smart and entertaining t.v series. It's original, something most of the t.v shows nowadays don't have, and also it takes you to a deep intellectual and emotional level that makes you think at the same time that you're enjoying the program. I would just like to recommend this show to everyone, and to say its a must watch, i feel sorry for the ones that do not take a look at this program. Also there's a big possibility that you will feel a connection with dexter, hes a very important character and what he does or how he is will just make you wanna love him. I've just finished season 1 but now i don't know what to do if i cant get season two fast enough, it makes you want to stay a whole day watching the whole season."
654,"I missed the 1st season and so sad that I did. This show is amazing with twists and turns. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you empathize with the dark mind of Dexter. A serial killer that only kills the bad guys. What more could you want? The cast is superb. If you want more from a series than mindless entertainment then just sit back and watch and THINK. This show is one of the best since ""Dead Like Me"" (which is sadly missed). I am a huge fan and highly recommend Dexter to anyone who just wants more. If you do not subscribe to Show Time you really should just to watch Dexter. The opening credits are the creepiest I have ever seen. Once you start to watch you just can't stop and just wait for another episode. One of the most disturbing scenes was the shot of all the body bags in the ocean where Dexter disposed of his victims. VERY EERIE! I could go on and on but why? JUST WATCH!"
655,"""Six Feet Under"" was a class act from pliot to finale.And the way the series ended, AWESOME!!! Claire driving to NYC was worth the subscription.Someone should take a lesson from it like David Ch--- Now he's the lovable serial killer.He juggles his daytime ""fighting crime"" persona with his ""avenging Son of Sam"" agenda. Superb. I watched every episode trying to find out who is killing these women.His detached emotional portrayal of his character is amazing.I can't wait for Season Two."
656,Easily in the top 10 TV shows of all time. Michael C Hall is mesmerising as Dexter Morgan. Jimmy smits as Miguel Prado and John Lithgow as Trinity are two of the best characters of the last 20 years. FACT! Forget that they completely botched the last season. GET IT WATCHED.
657,"Early on in his career, Batman, like The Shadow and others before him, wasn't above an occasional justifiable homicide. In fact, in The Caped Crusader's very first adventure (in DETECTIVE COMICS #27, way back in 1939), he went the full nine yards in his dealings with members of The Chemical Syndicate. Nor would that be the last time that he would send an evildoer to his just reward. EC (Entertaining Comics) capitalized on the blood and gore to the point that ""concerned parents"" began to take notice. Along came Wertham and The Comics Code, and killing became anethema. Heroes- super or otherwise- became little more than garishly costumed Boy Scouts. By the time the 1960s began to wind down, comic publishers were chomping at the bit. Little by little, graphic violence began to reappear in the pages of funny books. By the early 1970s, blood and guts were making a comeback (CONAN, based loosely on the stories by Robert E. Howard, was a front runner). By the mid-1980s, gun-toting heroes were making great inroads. The cover of any new title featuring a hero who wasn't sporting an arsenal was considered lacking. Heroes, no longer hampered by outmoded notions of morality, took great pleasure in torturing and killing ""the bad guys."" It's a trend that continues to this very day. (Check out the ""newsletter"" section of fanboycomics.biz- in particular, the adventures of a bloodthirsty vigilante called SLAYER...) DEXTER is merely the latest and perhaps the darkest of the Dark Knights- a ""hero"" whose compunction to kill is by no means as unique as most television watchers would like to think."
658,What a crappy ending in season4! My wife and i are done with this series and will not watch season5. We can't believe that the writer would write such a lousy ending.. thanks a lot! How can you start with such outstanding seasons en end in one bad episode? My wife was really more upset than i was.. I think a lot of people wont be watching season5 because of the last episode of season5 where Rita is found in a bath full of blood. Well that's not really original.. we think this was more like he wanted Rita to leave the series?? That does not make any sense at all. We wish Rita all the best in her show desperate housewife's!
659,"The character of Deb is really unnecessarily crass. She uses the f word too much. She is just a very unattractive, unsophisticated character. She ruins the show for me. Other than that, the show is very interesting. I hope it continues for another season. The suspense of the character Rudy was really good. Dexter is one hot guy, but his girlfriend is weak, indecisive, and really more than I feel like watching. Why is it that I like the male characters, but can't stand the female characters?In addition, I cannot imagine why I'm pulling for a serial killer. It's weird, I admit."
660,"Ugh i considered giving it one star because of hannah mckay. however it is a really good show apart from her, especially season 4. but season 8 made me want to blow my brains out (iykyk) when hannah came back. i don't know if i'm expressing enough how much i dislike the woman. she's just a terrible addition to the show"
661,"I remember I loved the show when I watched it the first time, but binge watching it for a second time didn't do the show any good. I got more and more disgusted by the selfish character of Dexter. Especially in the last few season's. Still a good show, but he started to annoy me a bit"
662,First two seasons were awesome. Then it started getting bad. I did not like Dexter stealing cases from police showing them like some dumb people. Show is good only when all characters are convincing. You cannot just have one character doing everything. I just watched keeping in background because I like to finish once I start. It got horrible when Hannah came. She is in no way likeable. Killer or no killer I cannot relate to people with no principles. Writers wanted to keep her so long they could have made her likable atleast. And Dexter son met her once and wanted her to be his mom? Whole thing was really weird. I was glad she was gone. Then she is back again. I just stopped watching and read story. Looks like it got even worse. Why kill Deb? She was only likeable character after all these. They could have killed Dexter even
663,"Dexter (2006_2013)(18+) By day, mild-mannered Dexter is a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami police. But at night, he is a serial killer who only targets other murderers.The crime series based on the books with the dark twisted storyline and the development of Dexter sociopath personality it is one of the best crime series, but i have to say some seasons were better than others, it is not a horror thought it just show you the other side of the story .

664,Who has done casting for this show. Rita looks like a supermodel not a regular single mom
665,"I liked just about everything in the series. The acting was superb, the twists in the plot engaging etc.One criticism I have is that Deb, Dexter's sister, has been given dialogue so riddled with the F-word and variations of the F-word (even substituting it for a syllable in a multi-syllabic word) it really becomes a distraction. I haven't done a statistical analysis, what would be the point?, but the impression that I get is that she very rarely says anything, in any context, to anyone --irrespective of their official rank or importance -- .
Yes, we understand she's a spunky, inquisitive detective who chafes at the rules and tries to find her own way to resolve mysteries without being bound by department protocol. But I've personally never encountered a person in real life who spoke the way she does and I've been through boot camp and have seen every Scorsese movie made. If you have children watching of an impressionable age I would think this could be a concern. And even if it isn't -- it's certainly a personal matter -- in my opinion this kind of dialogue shows an easy way out for the show's writers and adds nothing to enhance the complexity of Deb's character.Otherwise a very worthy series. It wasn't as galvanizing for me as Breaking Bad, but certainly a success, especially given the gruesome subject matter."
666,Everybody should see this show.... Very interesting and awesome.... Ever character is perfect and acting and the storyline is superb.
667,"I really loved the first season or 2 of Dexter. He's super likable and the show is clever and darkly funny. But after a few seasons, it just becomes hard to watch. It's an older show, so I'm trying to be gentle in my review. But by the time this show begins its precipitous decline, Showtime was creating such amazing shows. The writers lost their edge and their passion really quickly."
668,"I gave it 7 out of 10 because the show does have 3 major flaws.1. The first season is the show at it's best and could have just ended there and been a mini series. the main character is very well done a interesting enough to watch all the seasons For me each season got worse has it went on but not bad enough for me not to finish all the seasons.2. The ending..... if you plan on watching this show DO NOT look up the ending on the show , i wouldn't to go as far as it being pointless to watch if you find out the end but it would take away from one of the shows reasons to watch throughout the series.3. Anything non-main character ( filler storyline and other characters ) are just not great. They are just there because they have to be to make the show work and to fill time. I'm not saying all the supporting roles are just unwatchable either because of have or what they had to work with but overall it feel like the main character is a 10 out of 10 and supporting cast and later storylines are 5 out of 10.I have watched the series twice and while knowing the ending does make less enjoyable anyone that likes to binge watch a variety of different genres it is a ""must watch"" for the first season alone. Each season has a main story that wraps up within it's season so watch the first season and you like it then keep going even if you know how it ends and just do what i do and skip the last season and make up my own."
669,"Dexter is the product of a HORRENDOUS childhood incident. But, he was lucky enough to be found and raised by a very smart cop who encouraged Dexter to follow his need for vengeance, but gave him a strict, no shortcuts, to fill his need for killing.
Dexter is a forensic blood spatter specialist with Miami PD. And, when bad people slip through the clutches of Lady Justice, Dexter follows his compulsion to kill smartly by using his adopted father, Harry,s, rules to a tee."
670,"Dexter Morgan blurs the line between bad guy and good guy like no other. He is a calculating serial killer who lives by a code taught by his father to control the dark passenger that resides within him. A truly fascinating character. My main gripe with the series is that it lost a bit a of its edge early on, but regain it at the final season. If it mantain that dark feel that really set it apart I would have rate it even higher."
671,The series is god. But it becomes too much of blood after a certain point
672,"Late to this show -box set for Christmas just gone. Found the first four series gripping; my wife and I staying up to the small hours of the morning watching episode after episode. Great acting and great story lines. But along came series five and it was downhill all the way from then on. I've seen soaps with better story lines. That scene when Dexter's detective sister lets her brother's killing partner go free just does not stand up to scrutiny. It's risable. Are we to believe that a hard-nosed detective, dedicated to her job, should allow a killer - she is not aware that the girl is standing out of sight with Dexter - to go free? Not me.
For me, this series has gone the way of Homeland. Started off great but stopped watching it when the series degenerated into a soap."
673,"Seasons 1-4 of the show are amazing, but 5-8 are mediocre (and in some cases just bad). That being said, I feel as if a show shouldn't be allowed to have more than 1 or 2 seasons be bad, and this show has 4. I think a 6 is the most accurate rating for the show because of the last 4 seasons."
674,Awesome Tv Series.. Loved every bit of it . Ending could have been better.
675,"DEXTER
Five seasons completed and stopped because pirated downloads from systems are illegal."
676,"I have read the books and seen every episodes. The acting was amazing and so as the story plot. It makes you feel good about yourself when getting the justice despite if it came from a vigilant. The finale was not widely accepted just like The Sopranos, you as a viewer will have to make a decision on how you want to believe the ending. I chose to believe that he wants to be secluded to spare his son's future. He might continue on his path who knows, but I accepted his ending and had peace with it."
677,"This show is just awesome. The acting, direction, story, script, everything is excellent. One of the best seasons i've watched so far. Its so much underrated. The main reason of this show being outstanding is Michael C. Hall. He has done a termendous job."
678,"I put this on the same shelf with the other ones celebrating the human demise (iZombie, Santa Clarita diet etc). Those making the most sickening side of human behavior, appear as a social service.
The five is by courtesy to the good script."
679,"I started watching Dexter on Netflix with my dad about a year ago. My dad is an absolute fan of this series, this is his 2nd to 3rd time watching it. The first two season (about) would be the most exciting ones where you just can't stop watching and go overnight. The seasons after that, however, made me lose interest. They were just the same as season two but changing the bad guy and adding or removing a few things. Season 3 and 4, in my opinion, would be the most boring (and annoying). Dexter would just be jumping around EVERYWHERE, getting involved with EVERYTHING in seasons 3 and 4. 
Season 5, 6 and 7 were also the same. I would frequently join my dad every few episodes, he would watch the whole thing whereas I would jump in and out often. I would most of the time watch the first one or two episodes, then in the middle, then in the end. Hate me all you want, but it was just very boring.
Season 8, however, I watched the whole thing. Introducing a new character (Dr. Vogel) which I loved very much made it more interesting. That is all I am going to say about the final season, and that the finale is a great and unexpected ending to the long-running series.Because of how long the series is, the viewer would feel like there is a connection between themselves and Dexter and its cast. When Dexter ended, I now feel empty and I miss the show very much.Overall, it is a GREAT series for if you have time. I would suggest you watch the first few episodes and decide if you like the character ""Dexter"" or not. If not, I wouldn't suggest you continue to the next season."
680,"From the beginning Dexter has been one of my favorite television shows on TV. It captured what all of us look for in a character, the man behind the monster. It's why we all watch shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad. Things are not always black and white. Characters are not always fully good or bad. The first five seasons captured a man struggling with his inner demons and still trying to have a life and the writers were very good at what they did. However by season 6 I was confused. Season 6 was riddled with religious crazies, one of my least favorite themes for a show about criminals because it is one hundred percent overused and involves little creativity. And then the there was the weird bit where they tried to hook up Deb and Dexter and it was disgusting (although for me it was mainly because of my hatred for Deb's character that this bothered me). From the beginning I had issues with characters like Rita, who tried to control Dexter and let her daughter run the roost or Debra who suddenly would throw temper tantrums making every situation about her. Or LaGuerta who had seemingly no reason to be a horrible person but was always a horrible person. They annoyed me but I could tolerate it. I'm now on season 7 after Debra finds about her brother's escapades and decides that she needs to ""help"" him, basically acting as if he's some sort of monster. I realize that his actions are morally questionable but there is no denying that what he does saves lives. He kills people who are torturing and killing others and the problem stops with him. Regardless of how people feel about it though, the show is made far more long and drawn out with scenes of Dexter and Deb talking things out. The action has been lost, the feeling has been lost. What was once there disappeared almost instantly and I question whether or not I'll even make it through to the end. I had no problems with Dexter's emotions coming to light even though he regards himself as a psychopath and he constantly says he has little to no emotions, to me they were always there and he always wanted to regard himself as a monster since that what he had been taught his entire life. Him coming to realize his love for Rita, Harrison, Cody, and Aster was one of the most touching moments in the entire series. To watch him finally understand what he couldn't before was part of the reason I loved the show. Alas, all good things must end eventually it seems based on reviews of the ending that the fantastic writing has indeed come to an end. I will attempt to follow this show through to the end but I have little hope that it will turn itself around. I would give this show a ten but since the writing has gone downhill I have decided to make it an eight. Regardless of the last three seasons I feel it is a show that I would recommend to anyone who is searching for a new series."
681,"he most darkest character in the television history leading a double life as a forensic expert in the morning and as the title says a serial killer at night.You might ask why it says a sensible serial killer? It's because he kills people who deserves it.Well you might say whats the difference between 1000 other actors who have portrayed the same type of role in movies and television?There is one big difference and his name is Michael C. Hall the actor who took the toughest job and made it so simple.The show and this article is not for people under 18 and with weak hearts because it's a dark one with a lot of blood.Why it is a tough job?Well as i said the show is about a serial killer who masks his identity by being a forensic expert hiding in plain sight and helping the police catch the bad guys(he is not one because he is a sensible serial killer).That and again the amount of blood they use in the show,well there's a lot of blood,a lot of blood.Each serial killer has their own signature move after they kill their victim(wow i sounded cold in that sentence) and Dexter has a move where he cuts the face of the victim and collects the blood and save it as a trophy and also he narrates how he sees the world and explains it from his point of view.paul96.org/DEXTER-The Sensible Serial Killerpaul96.org/DEXTER MORGAN-A Sane Serial killerpaul96.org/DEBRA MORGAN-A Savvy Sisterpaul96.org/DEXTER-The Best Episodes"
682,"well i would not like to comment on the content of this dark series called Dexter as every 1 can have their different opinion... what i would like to state is that just refresh your childhood memories! can you! do you remember when grand parents use to tell stories! yeah i do :) no matter how bad the monsters were or the blood sucking of flesh eating animals? i just use to love'm the way it was told and i use to visualize them and live those moments. kind of grew up with those monsters leaving behind way back in locked box of childhood memories.. now when i watched ""Dexter"" seemed like my childhood memories were back and so the storytelling, but only difference was that the child is now grown man and the monster who was locked in the memory box is same...believe it not while watching Dexter i actually kind of became a child..just before my sleep i wanted that same old storytelling (adictive) but dint have the grandparents but had Dexter to do the job Dexter the monster .. i rate 10/10 at the end story telling matters..same story my uncles use to tell but cud not match my grand parents.. thanks team Dexter"
683,"This show is insightful, yet too brutalDexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman."
684,"First, the casting was excellent. Michael C Hall played the role of average Joe/serial killer extremely well. Jennifer Carpenter was great as the loving sister, foul mouthed police officer who had so many vices that might have been the reason she never suspected Dexter of not being who he said he was.Dexter started out excellent, the first season was one of the best opening seasons of any show I have ever seen. Everything about it was great, the twist that Deb's boyfriend was the infamous ice truck killer shocked me. However, finding out that he was not only the ice truck killer, but also Dexter's biological brother blew my mind. Season 2 and season 3 were also excellent, had the same twists and turns, and not predictable at all. But Season 4 was the best season of the entire series. It was unpredictable, suspenseful, and the ending was the biggest shock of the whole series. It made me so glad I was watching it on Netflix instead of during its time on TV. It was one of those endings that makes you want to see what happened immediately after. Season 5 and 6 were both good, but no where near as good as any of the first 4. Season 7 was when I kept thinking that the producers need to end this show before it makes the mistake of going on for too long and becoming ridiculous and stupid.Unfortunately that is exactly what they did and season 8, although it was only 12 hours worth of episodes, it felt like an eternity. The fact that they made Deb realize she was in love with him was so stupid I did not want to watch anymore, but I had gotten so close to the end so why not. I wish I would have stopped though, the finale might have been the absolute worst series finale of any series I have ever seen. Even Michael C Hall hated it, he said in an interview that that was the only episode of the series he did not watch, and frankly I don't blame him."
685,"i watch many series, but i loved Dexter the most because it is very real and unanticipated series .the series is like real life , no one is perfect .everyone compromise someday for family , friends etc .i loved the work of Debra Morgan .she worked exceptionally well. she is real a star of this series. Dexter also worked so good , Quinn is also great in his character. i got emotional when Rita died, best villain was trinity, best season was fourth . i cried in the last episode for debra Morgan, in whole series everyone loved debra so much and her honesty then her love for brother. she was the rockstar ..FUCKING AWESOME Debra Morgan. LOve you"
686,"Dexter is one of my faves TV series!. Dexter (His full name on the series is Dexter Morgan) is the name of the main actor. He has double life.. a forensics as a blood splatters analysis and as well as a serial killer that haunt criminals. His police woman sister and his co-worker doesn't knows about Dexter second life as a serial killer. Only his adopted father knows his secret.It's a serial killer TV series. Why I love the series?. Yea he has compulsion to killing people, he is mentally ill. BUT his adopted father taught him to channel his dark side by only killing criminals and create strict code that he should never kill innocent people. Beside his dark side.. He is smart, he can be a great brother for his sister, he is a good husband and father and he has great sense of humor. Not to forget that he is saving the lives of innocent people. It is interesting character!. Interesting story line how they can turn a monster into fun loving guy and could make viewers even loves him!!!."
687,"I loved watching Dexter, but if you were to ask me for my two favourite seasons i would say the first two seasons. I was impressed by Jennifer Carpenter (Debra Morgan) because for the first couple of seasons i was not her biggest fan but she got better and better as the show went on and i would easily say that in the last season she was the best actor. She was amazing in the last season. Two other characters i liked on the show were Sgt Doakes and special agent Lundey. Overall the acting was fantastic from all actors, I don't think i was annoyed by anyone on the show. I read online and saw on Youtube ( before i reached the end of Dexter) that a lot of people were disappointed with the last episode but i didn't see anything wrong because really how are you suppose to end a show because i reckon that's every writers nightmare anyway."
688,"Every episode in all Dexter seasons is a piece of art for real, A very fantastic and creative stories and scenarios, The idea of this show in itself is great, every member in the cast of this show is picked right as he/she is like that in real world especially Dexter, he is indeed a brilliant character. The one thing that I didn't really like was the ending of the final season, It was so weird and not imaginable at all just as it was created rapidly to put any ending to the show. I like the way Dexter Morgan deals with different situations and problems and even the way he lives his life. I really would like to see another season or two of that show, I really misses Dexter and his dark passenger."
689,"This review is for the release of DEXTER THE COMPLETE SERIES on blu-ray.Since I'm one of those people not enthralled by the shows and repetitive movies that movie channels like Showtime have become you'll find me among that group that waits for those series to arrive on disc before delving in. Such was the case when folks were talking non-stop about the series DEXTER. I waited, picked up the first season when it came out and loved it.For those who haven't jumped on the bandwagon let me first explain what the series was about. Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is the blood splatter forensics expert for the city of Miami. His father was a police detective and so is his sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter). Dexter is also a serial killer. But here is where things get different. Dexter only kills other serial killers and the most wretched of criminals alive. He is an anti-hero taken to the extreme.Each season found Dexter dealing with the possibility that his friends on the force as well as his own sister would discover his secret. Showing homicidal tendencies at an early age it was his adoptive father who steered him in this direction, a form of vigilante justice if you will. Think of it as Batman gone bad without the gadgets and wealth. The first season jumps in letting us know from the start who and what Dexter is. It then draws us in as a competitive serial killer who knows his secret shows up and begins copying his style. Now not only must Dexter keep his secret from the police he must track down his competition as well.Subsequent seasons found Dexter dealing with other serial killers as well. There was also the ongoing story of his relationship with a regular woman with two young children and an ex-husband who abused her. While Dexter was supposed to be a killing machine devoid of emotions in reality it was through various interactions with her and her children as well as his co-workers that the reality of his emotions came through. As I said, he was a killer you actually rooted for.The dark humor at play in this series flooded out from the first scenes of the show. The entire cast was a perfect fit for their characters. Hall was magnificent as Dexter, employing just the right amount of coldness tinged with a subtle touch of humor that made fans love him. Carpenter as the devoted officer seeking the truth and a suspect yet clueless that her brother could be involved did a fantastic job as well. The rest of the cast, too numerous to name, also was amazing.As with a number of the series in their catalog CBS has offered this one in season collections for some time now. They also released a special collection of the entire series that was contained in a microscope slide box, a tie in with the series since Dexter would collect a small blood sample on a slide from each of his victims. Now they've released the entire series in a more contained and less extravagant blu-ray box set at about half the price of that special collection.The 24 disc box set is contained enough to not take up your entire shelf or even the space the collected editions would have. Priced at around $80 it is far less money than you'd spend colleting each of those sets in total. Best of all you have the opportunity to binge watch at your leisure, starting with the first season and working your way to the series finale.I have a deeply dark sense of humor when it comes to films and TV series. I laugh at inappropriate things. And watching this series there are plenty of moments like that. If you find you have that same sort of sense of humor then this is a must have series for you. And with this particular box set you can have it all at a great price in great format. Fans of the series, this is a must have. For everyone else, it's about time you became acquainted with Dexter Morgan."
690,"All-in-all, Dexter is one of the best shows I've ever seen - it definitely makes my top three. It's not your average TV show, in fact it offers a lot more than most shows do. The viewer will find themselves strongly evoked; it's a very intriguing series for one. It has all the right characters (especially villains) and showcases all that are musts for shows of this very genre. It's a very well-written, carefully detailed series with a lot going on throughout. You won't get the same season twice, far from it actually. Every season, while connected of course, is different. Personally, my favorites are seasons 1 and 4. They're all great though. Every episode is fascinating and interesting to watch. It's an amusing show with so many awesome characters throughout, of course the main character, Dexer, is brilliant. Your entry into the mind of Dexter Morgan begins the minute you lay eyes on this fantastic, astounding masterpiece of a series."
691,"hello Dexter Morgan. Mr.Michael C. Hall.. thank you for Dexter.. please come bk with s9.. i don know what do i do..after finishing s8.. because braking bad.. Got.. Bates motel.. Hannibal.. supernatural..prison brake and many more just not good as you.. At its best, ""Dexter"" set up engrossing cat-and-mouse games, pitting its eponymous antihero against killers every bit as determined and twisted as he was. Understandably, that level of narrative discipline proved difficult to maintain, which perhaps explains (spoiler alert ahead ) the Dexter-Deb contortions undertaken to compensate for it. For Showtime, the series' place in history is certainly secure — not only ranking as one of the pay channel's first original hits, but the springboard that helped launch its Emmy-winning breakthrough ""Homeland."" Dexter might have left behind ""a trail of blood and body parts,"" as the character observes in the finale, but TV-wise, the series cast a long shadow."
692,"This show will be in my heart forever . It has all the thing you need to be your favorite . The only thing i didn't like about Dexter its how it ended . Its just that many characters had so much potential and in the end the all died . I think they have to make another spin off or a sequel , because it ended sadly and a lot of people like me did not liked it . I highly recommend to watch this if you don't have anything to watch or you are just bored .Overall the story line is a unique one that will keep you watching without stopping and in the end you will tell that to yourself some of the following sentences - ""It can end like this . Its not enough . Dafuq?"
693,"I remember seeing previews for each episodes and season finales. The advertisements for this show never sparked my interest. When I was a cop, on permanent nights, I'd come home and search for something to watch on Netflix. I kept seeing Dexter. So finally I said what the heck. After the first episode, I was hooked. The drama. The suspense. Dexter taking the justice system in his own hands. Every episode was written well. All actors played their parts great. I wished they kept some characters. The theme song is one of my ring tones. I'm currently watching the seasons again.I would LOVE if they brought this show back and I could be part of it!!"
694,"Dexter is one of those shows that if it only aired for a season or two (speaking of the first two seasons specifically), it would've amassed into a huge cult following. Regardless, each season of Dexter provides a unique experience that any one would enjoy. Michael C. Hall as the show's lead is amazing and seeing his character development throughout the series is a struggle within himself and even the viewers. Each episode has the viewer questioning morality and the criminal justice system in general. All I can say is, if you haven't checked out this show, please be warned that the first episode will instantly lead into a 12 hour binge. On my 18th birthday, my friend and I completed the first two seasons in 1 sitting (24 hours). Needless to say, I was instantly hooked. You will see a lot of complaints and criticism about the show's progression, but overall as a whole, it is still great. So take a slice out of your life and check out this amazing Showtime series!"
695,"This show is so great, every season of it. When show ended, I couldn't make my self believe it. I thought because it was so great, it will be continued. It's too bad that I am wrong for now, but one day I will be right. They will start show again. In the beginning I saw lack of performances by its actors and directing skills, but later on, after just few episodes you can see that show is becoming better and better. I would like this show to continue with huge time skip, after few years and after actors really get older, it will definitely be great. Good luck. Have fun. Acting: 7/10 Casting: 8/10 Story: 10/10 Dialogues: 10/10"
696,"This show has you on the edge of your seat, laughing, crying, yelling...its a great show. You will get attached to the characters. You will cast judgement on Dexter's killings. Is also interesting to watch the characters all working around Dexter and how people fact to the things he done even they know not what he has done. I really enjoyed the show though my moral compass battled with me connecting with dexter but wanting what was right. I would recommend watching the show...but not the last episode. The last episode really breaks your heart with no purpose. It totally made me wish I'd never watched Dexter. If you value love, justice, purpose, anything really good....don't watch the end. I'd pay the writers to write a new ending..."
697,"First of all, there was WAY too much unnecessary nudity and cussing. Because of this, it was so hard to watch sometimes. I wish they left out that garbage... it would have been a million times better without it.Anyways, I know people say season 1-4 are the best and to just stop watching there, but the next 4 seasons aren't as bad as people make them out to be. Sure, they aren't AS good, but they are still good.I was disappointed how Dexter went back on a lot of things he said when we were first getting introduced to him. I feel like he strayed away from that a lot. It made me mad how he screwed up his and Rita's relationship. And how he would always use her death as an excuse to get away. He turned into a man hoe in comparison to how he was before Rita. I also think the whole Hannah thing was stupid. Towards the ending seasons, Dexter did a lot of questionable things.Debra was super annoying. Her character finally grew on me in the last couple seasons though.The finale was extremely depressing. Poor Harrison. But again, it wasn't as bad as people say.Overall, this show is pretty brilliant. I love the twisted perspective."
698,"One of my favorites TV series so far (besides Game of Thrones). Great story/development but, unfortunately, a somehow disappointing ending :(I liked a lot Dexter and his ability to avoid getting caught and the fact that he made the viewers resonate with what is actually a bad/wrong behavior.The tension raises dramatically as the show comes to an end and the real Dexter becomes known to intimates but the creators really disappoint by not giving him a glorious ending (be it in prison/dead or free) but known (and admired as we did) by every other character of the show."
699,"I put off watching the very last episode forever, because I had heard that it was awful. Then I finally watched it and, guess what, it WAS awful. My reaction when watching kept going from ""Whyyyy??!"" to ""I call bulls***!"" What the other people failed to mention was that the last season in and of itself was pretty bad, not just the last episode. So I'm knocking a point of for that. And now I going to pretend that last season never happened. So there.Overall, Dexter, is of very high quality. Once it chucks the premise that Dexter only targets killers who have escaped justice out the window, it finds a formula that really works, where Dexter has to outsmart both the killer and his colleagues and it sticks to that, but still manages to keep it fresh most of the time. Each season comes with a longer arch and a main baddie and not all of them are equally brilliant, but when the big picture isn't working out you can take refuge in the details. Dexter is darkly funny and so painfully human in the way he observes everyone else, without really understanding them, but trying to mimic them anyway in order to fit, because everybody sometimes feels like everyone else are normal and they themselves are just faking it. The funny thing is of course that not everyone is secretly a serial killer. Dexter's internal commentator track contrasting what he says and does with what he's thinking made me laugh out loud at times. He is also brilliant at planning and at thinking on his feet when the planning goes south and it is thrilling to watch. His big tragedy is that he is so good, that when the consequences hit, they always hit the people next to him. Debra is a favourite of mine. Rude, loud-mouthed, but fiercely devoted to her brother and her job. But really, there are too many great and memorable side characters to count. And it's a joy to watch. Setting, music and everything blend together to create a distinct and compelling style."
700,"This is undoubtedly the best series I have ever watched. Even better than Breaking Bad which falls in 2nd place in my list.Dexter is a serial killer in a quest to find his true role in the society and come into terms with his violent nature. Even though on surface it seems to be a Splater story, this is not its aim. Despite the bloody scenes (especially in the early episodes), the serial killer's nature takes a secondary role and the protagonist's quest to his evolution becomes the main theme.Dexter portrays the multiple roles that every one of us plays in our life trying to balance each one according to its importance. So, the viewer, apart from the obvious story that he/she witnesses, can also enjoy the metaphor it offers; Everything is not Black and White and usually is a matter of perspective.The hero's journey, if applied in the real world of everyday life, could be translated as the conflict between Career and Family life, or Fidelity and Unfaithfulness, or even Guiltfull and Calm perception of life choices.In any way, the end product will keep you in your seats from the first episode till the last.Just Enjoy"
701,"This started out well, has some great elements. Michael C. Hall is great, , Rita is great, his nemesis is great, Doakes is great, his dad is great. But this whole thing quickly switches from being a stylish study of a serial killer living both sides of the coin into this weird feminist diatribe about grown women throwing temper tantrums to get their own way and men, including the serial killers mind, apologising to validate their bad behaviour. If you're gonna tell the serial killer story do that, if you want to make a series about women throwing tantrums and hating on men then make that, but why start out doing one then shoe-horn this silly nonsense into it and wreck it. You just end up with a ridiculous mess and it wastes people's time. The writer should be shot for this excuse for a story. Is anything in Hollywood immune from this disease? Can anyone just write a story without saturating it with some kind of agenda?"
702,"This is one of the most addictive series I have seen, it has a strange setting, the wonderful sunny Miami, with all it's beaches and people as the backdrop and the Homicide department of Miami Police in the front. If you don't know this series, we follow the calm and down to earth homicide forensic and blood spatter analyst Dexter, he sets the name of the series and everything evolves around him and how he juggles doing his job and at the same time being a serial killer.If you like this series, and I know you will :), it is strange that you actually find yourself rooting for this main character, but there is something very likable about him and the way he acts. He is a nerdy guy, with a special code, a strange characteristic and a skill set not many people can relate to, but it all works together and the people around him either likes him or think he is strange, and the viewers get the same information but we stick to the ""good"" deeds he does and hoping for him not to get caught."
703,"Dexter is one of if not my most favorite TV series ever. The acting is great especially from Michael C Hall who portrays an excellent Sociopath pretending to just be a normal guy. The events in the series are for the most part realistic which I think adds to the appeal, there could be someone like Dexter or the Trinity Killer or the Barrel girl gang. On that note John Lithgows performance as the Trinity Killer was just the best, he really made Arthur Mitchell seem like a normal guy similar to dexter who was also a prolific serial killer. I did however have some problems with season 6 onwards mainly due to the introduction of Hannah Mckay which was the worst decision they ever made with Dexter. They took away the part of dexter that made him who he was, the fact that deep down he was a Cold hearted psychopathic killer, but instead he ""falls in love"" with this girl who also happens to be a killer when he should have really killed her in the first place. The ending could have been better I would have preferred it if he had got caught or he did actually kill himself. But I do like the fact that he got away with everything; it shows how intelligent he really is. So overall I gave this a 10/10 rating just amazing. Seasons 1-5 are the best with season 4 being the standout. Seasons 6-7 get progressively worse and Season 8 is the lowest point. But make no mistake they are all good just not as good as 1-5"
704,"This is one of those shows you never want to end. When I heard the creepy catchy tune I knew I was in for some great television in the next hour. I enjoyed every second of the whole series. The suspense that is build in every episode is amazing. You can feel the tension like if you were the killer. And let's just be honest, most of us would love to get away with killing bad people if they really could. All actors from this series are excellent, there is not one actor that bugs me. The storyline, music & ambiance are amazing. Every twist in the story wants you to watch the next episode as fast as possible. I was really disappointed when this show ended. I will for sure watch this whole series again in the future."
705,"This is one of my favorites. Dexter is at times a light and funny show while at other times a dark and twisted show. The action keeps you coming back for more almost every time. Each season tends to have mini- plots that get resolved by the end of the season, but enough of an intriguing overall story that keeps each season connected. The characters, especially the main ones, transform over time, so the character development is very good. It creates a bit of a good vs. evil conflict throughout the show. Unfortunately, it can't fight to be in the ranks of the best show ever largely due to how it ended. Without giving anything away, I personally was disappointed by the ending."
706,"I've been waiting for this.Enter the mind of a serial killer. I watch and I want to kill bad people. I do not know if it's bad :), to be like Dexter. I just could not sleep. dexter has entered my mind. He is perfect avenger . The first two seasons were superb 10/10. I recommend you this series. Just take a look.great acting.amazing twists and shocking moments that you could never forget.and never see in other series.Everything about this show is just amazing.Dexter is my favorite serial killer.Wasn't expecting it to be this good. Michael C. Hall is great actor. 09/10 for the show."
707,"Funny enough got into show twice , first when aired on TV and. Got to end of mid season 2 as life gets in the way , I lost track and could not get into it.Early in the year I got Netflix and got back into there series . I would say first 2 season were the best,Season 3 and rest were really enjoyable and great to watch and the sone if final season shocked me to core.Lao msny great twist and turns that I did. Not see coming , which kept me on toes to see the next episodes.There were nights I could stop watching ep after after ep and bad gripped.I liked the first al season of the show , I was not to sure what to make if the ending at all I did not love but I did not hate either"
708,I still remember watching the first ever episode of Dexter. I was sitting on my couch and was like lets check out what the hype is all about. From the way he sets the table for the kill to every single principle he had. It got me. From the first episode i was convinced that i will cry watching its last episode.Michael C. Hall plays Dexter in it and he does it brilliantly. The way he shows love for blood in his eyes and the way he talks to his dead father his remarkable. Its like Michael C. Hall is really a serial killer.It is one of those serials that does not have a down fall. It kept going up with every season. Though i hoped for it run few more seasons but the way they ended it was not perfectly done but i have no regrets watching it till the end.
709,"Now, with all 8 seasons consecutively and within 3 months behind me, I am very pleased that I decided to watch them - in spite of my prior skepticism due to the background (although I like Death Wish movies, for example), less known actors and total duration (96 episodes!). Neither I have read the Dexter books. Anyways, its tense plot without major goofs/unrealities, pleasant acting and skilfully constructed past and present (with flashbacks) form a solid works where almost 5000 minutes of watching are worth it.True, as I watched all this afterwards, there were less unknown moments for me as I could realize that e.g. Dexter would not get caught in Season 4 :), and characters played by more famous actors would last at least for the whole season... On the other hand, Dexter's nature, working place and operating methods are rather logical - it is not realistic when an ordinary geek becomes suddenly a vigilante and does not get caught for years, fooling the best minds in the police.Well done, even better than Breaking Bad which has obtained more fame and praise. Of course, the topics concerned and related moral results do not often correspond to our daily customary ones... As for the course of events, I find later seasons even more interesting, with enhanced craziness and double-crossings.Plus that Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter will be in my wishful watch list from now on."
710,"Okay, so I have just finished watching this master piece and i can't get over it. Since then i have been reading reviews, fan comments, trivia something Dextrous has to be a part of my day since this show has ended.Loved almost everything about the show, however the one thing which i loved most after the character Dexter was the relationship Dexter has with her sister Debra. He is the least expressive person in the planet however seeing his sister pay the price of his acts makes him give himself the worst punishment of his life.Ppl criticize the climax however they don't think; it couldn't have gotten any better than this. This is how the world of a serial killer ends!In short, Dexter is the monster you surely wouldn't wanna miss and he is the monster I am absolutely in love with!"
711,"Probably one of the best series I've ever watched.Characters are well developed, and Michael Hall is superb. Watching him gradually transform from an emotionless killer to someone with real feelings is done perfectly.This is the kind of series that we need more of.Many people seem to have a problem with the finale, but to me it makes sense given what Dexter's been through in the 8 seasons. It's touching and poignant, and can only hope there may be a 9th season.Then again, personal preference. I'd rate Lost and BSG highly, but hated their endings."
712,"Well it was entertaining for the first 2 seasons. Watching this show at first was like watching a realistic version of ""Death Note"" where the main vigilante goes around killing off bad guys. Except the protagonist Dexter (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer that has the thirst and urge to kill people, but tries to follow the code of only going after the bad guys. And he is a blood splatter analysis that works for the Miami police department. So he has a lot of ins when it comes to criminals and knows the best way to get away with murders. And he is intelligent, clever and sly although he does make some mistakes then and there which becomes very costly, especially near the end. The first season with the brotherly love and rivalry aspect was cool, even season 2 with the goth girl. Season 3 got dull, dragged and got repetitive. It carries the same formula of Dexter constantly teaming up with the wrong people that he deems just might have the chance of understanding and accepting who he is and work together. Season 4 picks up with the Trinity Killer and actually does have some exciting moments. Season 5 just seemed like another rehash and just poorly done, with Dexter trying to work with a rape victim to track down the culprits. It was a very tedious season. Season 6 revolves around cults and the main killer besides Dexter doing a lot of damage to Dexter and his true identity. Season 7 is when Dexter becomes very dis-likable with him just trying to cover up his tracks by lying and breaking his code while hurting others around him that cares for him. Well at least he isn't as dis-likable as Deb (Dexter's sister who is extremely whinny and ruins it for everyone). Now season 8 starts out pretty good and it really starts to pick up. As a matter of fact it seemed like Dexter was about to create his own team of vigilantes that would actually work for once. With Evelyn neuro-psychiatrist that has his backing and helps analyze Dexter's subconscious and inner demons. Also Zach who is Dexer's actually loyal sidekick that had the chance of inheriting the code. But it starts to fall apart when Zach gets killed off. When it comes to the ending, it wasn't awful but it wasn't something amazing either. That felt like it was worth sticking through 8 seasons for. This is a well written show that just seemed to drag after the 4th season. Just about all the characters just becomes dis-likable after a while. Which is understandable since the more you spend time with people the more flaws you will see. I am glad the show ended with season 8, because it's just better to end something instead of it getting cancelled do to it running out of ideas completely. And drag even more while feeling like a rehash. Overall it's a show that has 3 or 4 season with the rest being mediocre, except season 7 which sucked. It's cleverly written show for the most part with an enticing concept going for it. If Dexter is a good vigilante or evil...You decide.8.6/10"
713,"Oh my God for all of these years I have been missing out on Dexter I have only just watched season 1 and am in the middle of season 2 on netflix in May 2014 I am gutted that I didn't get to watch it sooner and its already finished because there is no season 9 I didn't get a chance to talk to friends about it and I had the opportunity back then. It feels so odd watching a show in retrospect that I didn't get to view for some reason but I do remember I wanted to watch this show when it came out.This has got to be the best show I have ever watched in my entire life season 1 was awesome especially the ending ""Go Dexter, save the children"", ""You sliced him up good this time"" this made me laugh out loud I like how there are some funny moments which was not what I predicted. Good to see Jaime Murray in season 2, she has great taste in seeking great shows and good roles to work in. Her British accent was funny she mentioned in an interview that she had to learn how to speak in a British accent again and she had to take some classes. It was a big change from seeing her as Stacie Monroe to Lila the druggie.Dexter has been great so far I am enjoying it a bit too much he is serial killer in the end."
714,"I loved dexter and couldn't wait to watch it every week from season 1 through the end. With that being said, season 1 and the Lithgow season (4 I believe) were really the only great seasons. The later seasons bothered me more than I enjoyed them. Michael Hall was really the only character I enjoyed. His sister was just terrible, I hated LaGuerta... Angel & Quinn were okay I guess.Problem was after season 4, Dexter became so sloppy and got away from his ""code"". He should have been caught over and over again...Happy it's over!"
715,"Are we going to see any more Dexter?Really like the series. All episodes and actors are great.I like casting.John Lithgow plays a an excellent part. He is the most sinister of all the characters.The actor that plays Dexter's Father has been a favorite for years. He does well to play the part.I LOVE Dexter's sister. She is real HOT and liked her in other movies as well.It's curious, how does one write and screenplay such a display of character. Must be like a Hannibal of sorts.Are we going to see any more Dexter?"
716,"What a great intriguing series! At first I just didn't think it would be my thing - that lasted about 10 minutes into the pilot. It's suspenseful and each episode is better than the last. I was not a fan of the sister but her character began improving and didn't seem as forced as it had in earlier episodes. All the characters are realistic and their performance are outstanding. Each episode has me on the edge of my seat - all different from the last - no repetitions and thoroughly convincing. I'd never heard of the main character before, this is the first I've watched him in anything...and he is so believable it almost makes you wonder what his ""real"" life is like! If you don't think this series would be to your liking - do what I did and watch the pilot...incredibly addictive!"
717,"I loved Dexter and just finished every episode on Netflix. I truly was on the edge of my seat. I cant believe the way it ended though. Harrison is without a father in a new town and with not even his real mom a past killer. Please let there be another season to tie it all back together. I believe with how Dexter was doing there could have been a way for him to start a new life without his ""dark passenger"" even his ""father"" said Dexter didn't even need him anymore because he was able to make good decisions and to live like everybody else. Yes Deb died but that would be a reason for Dexter to want Harrison to have family and someone to grow up with a father figure."
718,"Where to begin? Well...for one thing...we're dealing with a psychopath serial killer as the protagonist, along with equally psychopathic antagonists. Second, we've got a never ending stream of voice overs and ""conscience Harry"" cameos (Dexter's deceased foster father who appears out of nowhere to ""guide"" Dexter at every critical turn). Then there's foster sister Debra, the most emotive, promiscuous homicide detective ever to grace our living room screens. There's also an incompetent lieutenant who's main skill is PR manipulation (i.e. she knows how to play the game); a string of damaged love interests for the main protagonist; and a host of bit players whose presence wouldn't be missed very much if they suddenly disappeared and/or were written out of the show. In a nutshell...THAT'S ""Dexter"".Yet somehow, the show ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. Not a whole lot greater, but definitely greater than it sounds when you break it all down to its basest elements. Dexter is not as great as its hype would suggest (and make NO mistake about it; there is a HUGE hype machine that does nothing but churn out POSITIVE PRESS about this series), and not quite as bad as its critics would have us believe. So when all is said and done, Dexter is a quirky, somewhat controversial/somewhat boring show with arguably one of the least satisfying endings of any show in TV history.(NOTE: Having read through many pages of the IMDb comments section, I seriously wonder about the age of the ""target audience"" for this show. 12 seems to be the most realistic answer, as the immaturity of the die-hard fans is rampant.)"
719,"I completely forgot how good this show really is. After jumping onto the Dexter bandwagon late I progressively continued to binge watch each episode beginning with the first season. When cable TV took a break after season three (couple of years) I started to develop a false sense of what the show was really like. I severely regret that and only now that I have picked up from where I left off have I realised that Dexter is a fantastic show.It is one of those shows that comes along every once in a while, capturing a broad audience with it's new concept and excellent production. It is never too late to start watching this show and I swear you won't regret it. Now that I have just finished watching season 4 I find myself desperate for the next episode...luckily this time I only have to wait till tomorrow."
720,"Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a blood splatter expert for the Miami P.D., and a serial killer. He is forever traumatized when his mother was killed in his presence. He is rescue by police officer Harry Morgan (James Remar) who adopted him. When he showed signs of psychopathy, Harry teaches him a system whereby he would investigate and kill only criminals. He is close to his sister police Detective Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) but she doesn't know his secret.Dexter is my favorite serial killer good guy. Come to think of it, I don't know if there are too many other serial killer good guys. I love his matter of factness, his inability to connect emotionally, and even his inner voice monologue. The first few seasons are beyond anything before it. After awhile, it does get tiring to have people constantly just miss Dexter. But the love for Dexter never dies.... at least it never gets wrap in cellophane, cut up into pieces, put into garbage bags, and dumped into the harbor."
721,"Dexter is just everything you'd want out of a TV Series. It has its own dark sense of humor, a romantic edge, and best of all- A great, teeth gritting plot line. Dexter is a character you come to grow and even after eight, long, fantastic seasons, I still want more of his character. The whole series was well strung together and, unlike some other series, didn't just throw in nonsense characters and events to make the story exciting. Now to some real reviewing. The first season, where Dexter and Brian Moser, also known as the Ice Truck Killer, is a great introduction to the series and it brings a meaningful relationship to Dexter and Brian, even with their short relationship. The second season with Lila cooled the first season off and established the viewer and Rita. The third season with Miguel is annoying to watch with Prado always in the way of Dexter. Season 4. Trinity Killer. This is the season that was the absolute best of all the seasons. Arthur is a truly strong character, with his fake family and his brutal murders and family history. Season 5 with Lumen and the rape killers is another season of inciting love for Dexter Morgan, now with Rita dead and whatnot. Season 6 with the Doomsday killer is OK, I mean the killer seems kind of weak but it's Dexter, and they always make it irresistible to turn away. The seventh season starts off as a slow season without any main person or thing going on other than Debra, but once Hannah comes in and LaGuerta starts investigating the Bay Harbor Butcher again, it hyped up the viewer for a good season and for an even better.. EIGHT SEASON. This season wrapped everything up extremely well. People constantly complained about how this was a bad finale and how it felt just like a season finale but with Dexters passion gone, Deb dead, and Hannah thinking he was dead, would the show really be worth watching Lumberjack Dexter become some kind of ""axe murderer""? No. The whole series gets into your heart, the characters are intensely touching and beautiful no matter how annoying or irrelevant. Dexter is a must watch for a watcher of any sorts."
722,"The mixture of great acting, great storytelling, a marvelous soundtrack makes Dexter one of the greatest modern TV-series. As addicting as the sopranos and breaking bad, dexter takes deep in the psych of a serial killer.It's the mixture of the brutal, emotionless dexter and the way he interacts with the people among him (who seem to cherish him no matter what) that makes the series so addicting, mix some perfectly timed humor to it and what you get is one hell of a series.Michael C. Hall plays tremendously. As no other he can change from a sweet loving brother into a brutal psychopath in only a matter of minutes. Having seeing him play in six feet under, it was quite clear that he is a great actor, nonetheless he surpasses himself.Although there is a lot of commentary on the last seasons, I must say that even though they are not as good as the first four, they are without doubt still better than anything you'll ever see on TV nowadays.If you haven't seen this and you love witty, intelligent, well-written series with outstanding acting than this is without doubt a must-see for all."
723,"I first heard about Dexter while i was watching FOX, and i thought ""that looks good."" so i decided to check it out. And boy am i glad i did!! This has to be the best show i have ever seen! its amazing from start to finish and completely addictive!! I watched Season 1 online and i became hooked and finished it in a day.(yea i have no life!) Then i decided to buy all seven seasons on DVD (Season 8 wasn't out yet) I watched them all back to back for a week. OMG! what an amazing program! This show made me laugh, and made me cry (season 4) and also there was parts where i was sitting on the edge of my seat!! When i heard that season 8 was going to be the last season i nearly cried. And with the events that happened in the final episode of season 8 i did cry! for hours! I didn't want such an amazing show to end! I give this show 10/10 because it has amazing story lines and also amazing characters. The characters became part of my family and i felt at some points i could actually relate to them. the acting from Michael C Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Julie Benz and every one else was sensational! I have every season 1-8 on DVD and re- watch every episode continually i cant get enough!! id highly recommend this show to anyone! GO WATCH IT!!"
724,"This show had me on the edge of my seat for years. This is definitely the type of show that you can not just watch one episode of and walk away to carry on with your day. I loved the family type behaviors each character had towards the Miami Metro team, Dexter stalking out his kills, the feuds, secrets, everything! The ending to this series, in my opinion, was border-line amazing. It was more then just a TV Show and viewers really got to feel that these characters were more than just a serial killer and cops. The scene with Dexter calling Harrison and Hannah then burying Debra at sea, had me in tears. I only wish that Dexter would have realized that his love for Hannah and Harrison was stronger then his urges to kill. I wish he would have met up with them in Argentina and lived ""happily ever after."" This show left me feeling like it was more than a TV Series and in the end I had hoped for that better family ending. Although, Dexter made the choice that he felt was right to protect Hannah and Harrison; I still believe that he should not have abandoned his son and should have met up with them in Argentina; but I am glad that Hannah and Harrison love each other and she is there to care for him."
725,"I watched every episodes of seasons with a passion! Too sorry for Debra's death, Dexter should have gone to Argentina! I am just surprised that Hannah back to Dexter after her last season. I'll miss the bloods in air condition ha ha! It is so bad for little Harrison, he will not able to see his daddy anymore. I guess I remember see the last scene of Dexter in the beginning of something, maybe it was a dream of Dexter. Dexter is a great character in this show, I would like to see Michael in new shows or movies! At the end of Dexter's there were people who know Dexter's real id. It was not like in the beginning.. 8 season have gone like the wind!"
726,i loved this show from the first episode but i want the writers and creators to know that the last episode was a stupid way to end it. i feel there should be a tenth season now. i can not believe that this is how its going to end so i hope the creators read this and understand that i am not happy about this. i was hoping for a better ending than what i saw. i did enjoy the rest of the show but i will continue to rant about how you ended it. i also feel more people feel the same way it makes no sense. I'm not going to watch anything else produced by you until you explain your reasoning behind the last episode. other than this little rant of mine i enjoyed watching DEXTER.
727,"""Dexter"" is one of the most brilliant TV series in history. The psychology is highly sophisticated and the scripts are remarkable gems, each and every one. The show grips us right out of the gate and moves inexorably forward with realistic, multi-faceted characters who often find themselves in bizarre situations because of Dexter's hobby of murdering murderers.The psychology is so perfectly embedded in the story by the writers that there is actually a book published in which mental health professionals discuss Dexter's mentality, life and what a psychopath is as if Dexter is a real person. Some of the discussions are very intelligent and interesting learning experiences about what creates a psychopath and how one can successfully live and work alongside ""normal"" people.I read the book the series is based on and didn't like Dexter, the psychopath, as presented in the book. But the on screen Dexter in the series is a congenial, affable, pleasant, lovable fellow who we root for as he dodges from murder to near escape week after week. His victims are such lowlife scum that we end up approving of what Dexter is doing and hope he doesn't get caught.One of the themes of the series is one's life spills over into other people's lives. Dexter's secret darkness effects others even as Dexter tries to contain his ""Dark Passenger"". This truth ebbs and flows throughout the series and crescendos in the final episode.Dexter grows over the years and begins to experience the most unpsychopathic emotions as his affection for his family and sister (who is the foil to Dexter) sprouts and grows. At the end of the series Dexter is confronted with what his existence truly means and is faced with a horrifying choice because he has come to experience genuine love and concern for others. Does he choose well?"
728,The first six seasons were great. Season seven was okay but I got the feeling it was a new and less talented team of writers or the original team was out of ideas. Season eight I think they fired the writers and just made it up as they went and when they got to the last episode they ran out of time to give it a descent ending so they just quit. In reality that probably would have been better than the ending they gave it. I came away feeling like I had wasted eight seasons and wished I could recapture that time and use it to stick bamboo under my fingernails. If you don't want to read the spoiler stop here.The real problem was that they spend so much time looking as if they are developing the human side of Dexter and then in the end treat it as though that side doesn't exist. It was a major disappointment. If this is the way Showtime develops shows I'll not bother with their sows anymore.
729,"when i watched the first episode i am really impressed by the blood shed because i am a doc and i am too a blood guy..the action was so natural....at first i got a wrong impression about Dexter regarding his serial killings but soon i have seen through his perspective and i felt he is doing good ...in the first season the way of taking the series is outstanding with a lot of surprises and believe me...i used to take my breakfast, lunch and dinner watching it ,,,i was so addicted that i have got an urge to finish the season....i am very impressed by the work of Dexter making the world better...so when i started watching the 1st season i decided to watch whole seasons no matter what....god its the best thriller....Michael C. Hall is the best and perfect..nobody replaces him..Jennifer Carpenter as his sister is hot and amazing...i really like to describe season by season but...its gonna take few days i suppose...but as far as i am concerned Dexter is the best....9/10"
730,"Dexter is both hilarious and breathtakingly thrilling. Brilliant acting and not just by Micheal C. Hall but also by Jennifer Carpenter. They are absolutely magnificent. I'd recommend watching it to everybody who can cope with the displayed violence and blood. Although I have not read the books, the Storyline is impressive and continues to grow and deepen throughout all seasons. You just can't stop watching once you're started. You'll be hooked right from the start. Dexter was nominated for 23 Primetime Emmy Awards, in the category of Outstanding Drama Series four times in a row, from 2008 to 2011, and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (for Michael C. Hall) five times in a row, from 2008 to 2012 and in my opinion that is highly deserved!My favorite TV Series of all times."
731,"Its just brilliant and discriminating with simplify reminiscing of deviliosm of the main character I had given 1 rating for the only reason I can't give it more than 10 so annihilated of the show no flaw and power packed with excellence narration from the point of main character . its just so damned good I hope somehow this series continued . I had not enough words to describe this masters of masterpiece.... .............,................. ............................................................ ................................................................. ........................ ................................................................"
732,"I have heard plenty of good things about this show, and when I first saw that the first four seasons were on Netflix, I flipped out and stopped watching Skyfall JUST so I could watch Dexter! I was hooked onto the show within the first five minutes. Here we are introduced to Dexter Morgan, a man who works for the Miami Metro Police Department, but when night comes around he ""works"" as a serial killer that only targets other killers. We see his first target, a man who has killed about three people, when this man goes to his car, Dexter is waiting for him, and he puts a garot around the man's throat, only commenting ""Drive"". They head to an isolated building, where Dexter has the bodies of the three men, he makes the man look at the bodies, and tells him ""Take a good look! Look at what you did! Look at the families' lives you've ruined! Look! Look or I will cut off your eyelids!"" This line captivated me, and I have loved the show since."
733,"I agree with the consensus that the first 2 seasons were the best, but how great were those two? Compare those seasons to Breaking Bad and the latter looks ""noobish"". Dexter started at an extremely high level, and surely no one should be surprised that the writers were running out of ideas??? Instead of thrashing the series I started to enjoy it for what it was - with its ups and downs (a lot fewer cliffhangers). I wouldn't have let out any of the 8 seasons as each one of them had something integral, though some more than others, to contribute to the character of Dexter Morgan, and the 8th season summed up the whole series pretty well. American Psycho brought us Patrick Bateman. Dexter brought us Dexter Morgan."
734,The popularity of this show doesn't reflect on how good the actual show was. There were parts that I liked but for the most part I was pretty disappointed on how the show was.I found that the problems with the show is the acting because I didn't feel completely sold on the characters they were playing because I felt that Jennifer carpenter was to anxious. To many time she over reacted over stuff that wasn't that really big of a deal. The one thing that was also very dumb of them to so is constantly change each season to where you don't need to watch beginning to end but just watch the beginning of a season.I will end this review with something positive about the show and that's there way to many cop shows and just about anytime there a cop show I never watch it but they made it good enough to where it didn't suck to bad. Where most cop shows are to much science fiction.
735,"Bye Dexter! You will be missed! For me, Dexter is the best TV show till now. The emotions we felt with Dexter were powerful, the voice off is always very ""philosophical"" and Dexter's Dad character was used with the best effect. As if he was the conscience of Dexter, always appearing when Dexter was about to do something ""not by the code"" or shall we say stupid.I am pleased with the end that the producers gave to Dexter, but a little disappointed with the last 30s-1 minute which was truly too much! (Even though I get why they did show this to us). Boy, I'm gonna miss that show for sure! And I hope that Michael C. Hall will come back with another TV show after Six Feet Under and Dexter! He surely played 2 of the best TV characters of the 21st century!"
736,"Dexter,its an amazing story about a person who is good at nothing but to kill.He has killed countless number of person and is responsible for the death of his father,godmother, his lovable sister,brother,wife,best friend and so on.But you still like him b'coz his good deed is much above his evil. Every character is great and thats If you like crime thriller then show is must for you.They always say that dexter is emotionless psycho. But i believe the least.This show draw you towards the new ways of examining a crime scenes.If you are from forensics, psychiatrist,police officer, a murderer, and from Miami then you probably attach yourself from this show. Your expectations keep on increasing with each season and the show too stands by it until it end.You never expect it to end that way.This show is bloody with low level of nudity and must not for children."
737,"It's been a while since I've been hooked on a astoundingly suspenseful show especially since the daunting release of the series""Breaking Bad"", and I abhor to admit it, but I may have a difficult time arbitrating which I find more entertaining. Nonetheless, what I really love about this series is the fact that from the very first episode, its no secret, Dexter is a serial killer; however, he is portrayed in such a unique manner perhaps somewhat-passive and innocuous- that its impossible to fear him- the way one would typically fear a psychopath. Overall, every season there is either an existing or new character who ends up either making a connection with him or is ultimately feeling conflicted about him; thus, Dexter's ""dark"" secret becomes compromised. He seemingly tries to live his simple life doing what he needs to do and taking care of the instrinsic urge of killing he cannot evade from. This is a series where at times you will find yourself fighting with the remote control every night because you realize you have to turn off the TV so you can work tomorrow, but it becomes what seems like a perennial fight against yourself!"
738,"Scot buck and the crew nailed it. show time is a channel you can blindly trust on. californication , homeland, weeds, nurse Jackie, shameless, house of lies all epic. except for the fact that kids to be kept apart. But thanks to it being premium helps and fixes it.Who is Dexter(Michael C. Hall) ??Dexter is a psychopath made by the cruel world by taking his family from him in young age, cared after by a police officer named Harry Morgan (James Remar). A psychopath who is groomed by his urges which he calls his inner monster. Harrison has to channel his urges to make him socially acceptable, concomitantly helping community get rid off influential scumbags who skips law and order and are menace to the society. This is Harry's code. A blue print which helps this psychopath pretend to to be normal and will make him a father, a husband, a forensic blood spatter analyst, a brother, a good citizen and a killer. thanks to Miami lake harbor he can dump his chopped up anger guided body parts. The ice truck killer, the bay Barbour butcher, the skin peeler, the triad killer, the whore dumpers, the religious fanatics about Doom's day and the crazy hot killer lady, no matter how good they are they will have to surrender to the perfect psychopath with a code.what will Dexter do and how he will survive? wanna know? start watching it. Your heart will come to your throat and will choke you up to breathlessness astonishment. it just keeps getting better.the potty mouth Debra Morgan(Jennifer Carpenter), the one and only Vince Masuka(C.S. Lee) with a dick in his mouth instead of tongue, overly intrigued Laguertta and Quinn with his useless presence in the show along with many other fit to the parts characters, all together make this show the best show of the millennium. Try your ass off to criticize, the more you do, the more you will fall in love with Dexter Morgan's inner monster. If you are a heart patient or chicken hearted fellow to whom thrill is a kill, you better watch stupid and innocuous shows like Downton Abbey, Cause only brave hearts can endure to watch the intensity put in these 42 minute episodes. In nut shell, Dexter is a show if any body tried to criticize even, i will kill him and i won't even need a code for that.start today and grab me from my collar if you didn't like it.You can thank me later :-)"
739,"I don't wanna be a smart ass but what strikes me before Dexter was even created was - how on Earth nobody figures out this type of story for TV?? Of course we had a serial killers such as Lecter but to take a full look inside head of one is completely new level:)We all judge them but how is to be inside of one and feel what he feels, thinks and judge after that?? Great concept but it is only partial part of this show completion!Never was fan of Spanish type of songs but suddenly here comes Daniel Licht and his music at Miami Parties scenes (especially in first season) just fits great! And of course this is just minor contribution to all other type of soundtrack used in this show.Michael C. Hall can incredibly portrait behavior of serial killer and you fully feel there is something off with Dexter:) His movements and especially that thing in his eyes! And of course his voice! how could I not mentioned:)Acting in general is something what achieve a new level of perfection on this and other great current TV Shows! Now you can really believe those characters and feel like they are real person (even if they are psycho:)) Many times I caught myself to enjoy episodes like I was in theater especially considering acting quality!You can go on and on with reviewing this...this is what just dropped of me:)"
740,"This is simply one of the most amazing series i have come across. After watching 7 seasons i must say the show has been worth spending time on. It has everything a viewer of this genre is looking for. From scenes that touch you , make you feel for a serial killer to scenes where you hate the killer. Micheal. C.Hall has done an amazing job portraying Dexter Morgan, so has every cast in the show. Casting has been really good for each character along with its characterization. The initial few season are just mindbogglingly amazing , but as the season passes by , after the 5th it starts getting slow and the pace deteriorates. The seventh season was supposedly the bad one due to poor story line , but as one is used-to watching Dexter Morgan commit crimes might still end-up watching it as well and also it lead the viewers to the most waited finale season of the show. On a whole i would say everyone must give this show a shot , because its worth it."
741,"Best show on TV since it began, period. Great cast, great story line. Writers on this show are top notch. I'm very sad for the show to end...I looked forward to it every season. It will be a long time I'm guessing that I will find a show as interesting and fun as this one!I actually like the entire cast and that is rare, there is always someone who annoys me on most shows. There is some old cast members from another show I loved, OZ (HBO).I actually got rid of Showtime until Dexter seasons would come on and then shut it off again. (HBO is better for movie selection)If you like Dexter try OZ and the Tudors, good writing there as well."
742,"He's baaack! Showtime's Dexter began its eighth and final season on Sunday, June 30th. The episode is titled ""A Beautiful Day."" I've titled this review ""Lost"" because Dexter and Deb are lost in emotional tailspins, and even little Harrison gets actually lost for a short time.I liked the way the pre-show vignettes. Before the show began, there were a few moments where some of the actors from previous seasons, whose characters were killed off, stand before the camera and talk about the show. It's a little foreshadowing, reminding us that the end is near.A new character has been introduced, Dr. Evelyn Vogel, played by Charlotte Rampling. She's a middle-aged woman who has made a study of serial killers. She's playing little cat-and-mouse games with Dexter, asking questions about The Bay Harbor Butcher. She says that the brain scooping-guy may be a former patient of hers and she wants Dexter's help to track him down. She clinches the deal by giving Dexter an envelope.And now we have ""the-big-reveal"" moment of the week. It's a shocker. Dr. Vogel knows Dexter's secret. It appears that she may have been his psychiatrist when he was first adopted into the Morgan family. The envelope contains drawings that appear to have been done by Dexter at this time.Dexter is on the verge of losing everything. There's Dr. Vogel, there's this new serial killer that Dexter will certainly not be able to resist, and do not forget, his ex-girl-friend, Hannah, herself a serial killer. He done her wrong last season (he got her arrested, but she escaped from jail), and she is sure to be back for revenge.This is an excerpt from a longer review on my blog: Premium Cable Reviews."
743,"I wasn't expecting to like Dexter at all. On face value, there's nothing here that I would normally enjoy in a story. However, I've just watched the first three episodes and am keen to keep watching. For me, I think the appeal lies almost entirely in the character of Dexter himself and in his portrayal by Michael C. Hall.""Dexter"" is really a play-within-a-play and Hall convinced me that I was watching somebody playing a part within the fictional world of the series. I really enjoyed his performance, as well as that of James Remar as Dexter's foster father. I was interested in the abnormal psychology and motivations of Dexter and of his opponent, the so-called ""Ice Truck Killer"".The end of the first episode came up very quickly for me; I had been engrossed in the story and was left wanting more. The second episode left me undecided. Normally, I only include two episodes in my roadtest of any show, but in this case, ""Crocodile"" had done so much to erode my good impressions of the series that I decided to watch a third. ""Popping Cherry"" once again captured my interest, and based on that, I want to go on and watch the rest of the season."
744,"This is my first show to watch previously I used to see only movies but not these shows, but after seeing episode to episode in a season it has created enthusiasm and anxiety in me to watch what happens in future episodes? The entire credits for these show goes to the screenplay, director and story writers departments, I know how much pressure or risk they take to complete each season. Then coming to Dexter Morgan his acting and projection of his dark side is awesome then Debra Morgan character is also excellent and again I need to thank to all departments creating each character in these show. In any show at least 1percentage of flaw will be there but while watching the show completely they should not be considered. Finally I want to say I love this show and waiting from jan2013 to watch the next season8 how they are going to end the show? Please don't mind if I had written any mistakes."
745,"So, not much of a review, but I had to post this somewhere because it was literally bugging me not to.Incredible TV series. You would be stupid to miss it. It is sheer brilliance in TV format, with heaps of excellent dark humour.The only thing which prevents me from giving it 10/10 is how I cannot help but find myself so unbelievably irritated by Dexter's sister (funnily enough I had the same problem with Dexter's sister from Dexter's Laboratory), and his girlfriend. And as the series went on, my frustrations just kept growing and growing, until they are at breaking point - and I'm not even finished with the series yet! This is probably due to the fact that Dexter is such a likable character you literally want the best for him all the way through.Regardless, watch this or miss out on something truly epic!"
746,"In recent years the caliber of television programs being produced has been superb. Showtime and HBO have been leading the charge, releasing one ground breaking program after another.Dexter is a great example of what a great television show should be. With it's well written characters to it's riveting plot lines. The problem with most television shows these days is the comfortability that the writers have with sticking to the same old tired formulaic plot lines that vary only ever so slightly from episode to episode and season to season. The writers and producers of Dexter have so many diverse side plot and sub plots on top of the main focus of the show that every time you view a season or even a singular episode for a second or third time you pick up on these that you may have missed before. It's amazing how different each season of Dexter is and yet it still is able to keep a cohesive story line and flows throughout the whole series.Unlike other long running shows, the actions that occurred in the first season are never forgotten and certain often brought back up and occasionally consequences still linger from past transgressions. No one, not even the main character Dexter, is exempt from answering for his actions.Another shining quality of this show is the dialogue. All shows have required dialogue that is needed to push the plot from beginning to finish, but its the way in which that dialogue is written and delivered that can make the difference between a good show and a bad show. The way the dialogue is written for each character individually and not just slapped together to get it done.Michael C. Hall has created a cult icon with his portrayal of Dexter Morgan. However the supporting cast is just as crucial to the success of this show. Most of the recurring cast has created memorable characters from their portrayal. Along with the regular cast, Dexter has had a number guest stars such as John Lithgow, Mos, Colin Hanks, Ray Stevenson and Johnny Lee Miller.I've started to cut down on what shows I watch, a lot of shows have fallen off that list in recent years. I started watching Dexter after season one came out and haven't stopped since. If your looking for a great show to watch, this is it."
747,"A great adaptation and true justice to the novel. Great story, great characters. It might take a few episodes to get in the groove but once done there's no going back,you'd be addicted to it. The writing and the background score is very very good and all the characters have been given a unique representation of their own. The depiction of the thought processing of dexter's and his forced desire to kill is admirable. The fight between the evil and a good conscience is neatly captured. The character and story development is brilliant. The suspense at times is real nail biting stuff. The scenic beauty represented of Miami is commendable. Highly recommended !!!"
748,"I love this show but I had to come on here and vent about a few things... It really bothered me when Quinn lost a lot of weight (in my opinion because of drugs), because it completely changed the character. He seemed weaker, they had to put more makeup on him, etc. also his relationship with deb is ridiculous, deb got really good for a while, but then she has to go and p#$% me off again. Quinn proposes at breakfast and she just starts with her F*^k F&*^ F^&% and makes him look like a bi%^$. God she can be annoying. I wouldn't have minded if they would have had him grow a pair and be like OK then fine f*(k you deb peace. And then when he offers her lieutenant she says ""f%^$ balls"". what terrible writing. Even though I wrote all of these terrible things I do keep on watching and this is one of my favorite shows.EDIT: I want to say that I am not judging the actor who plays quinn. I had a drug problem once and thats how I know he is on drugs. And also Angel Batista is a boss."
749,"I find it very hard to begin reviewing such a masterpiece and absolutely astounding work as Dexter. Of course none of this could be possible without an accomplished and magnificent actor Michael C. Hall. He really gives Dexter soul and mind of its own, and consequently it's sometimes very hard to distinguish where Michael ends and Dexter begins. The creators of this series have found a mysterious and unique way of presenting us the protagonist (Dexter), because when watching Dexter you are actually cheering for a serial killer. And I absolutely love this. The fact that they've managed to do this is enough to establish a new movie-rating scale: 1 to Dexter. There are a lot of good series out there which all lack either quality acting, sophisticated story or ""enriched"" script. Well it's safe to say that Dexter has it all. You know how they say ""nothing is perfect"". Well they obviously haven't seen Dexter. I think finding a bad side of Dexter is scientifically impossible. I mean believe me, I tried. If I really had to highlight the imperfections, it would be some of the co-stars of the series. Not all of them of course. But I think that some of the actors shouldn't be any near the set of Dexter. Although that's not such a problem because M.C.Hall fixes it every time. I undoubtedly recommend this series to everyone."
