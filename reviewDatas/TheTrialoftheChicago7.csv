0,"Legal historians and courtroom drama fans will have a field day with this Aaron Sorkin film which depicts the trial of eight radical protesters who made a name for themselves in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A disparate array of left-wing activists who took it upon themselves to demand an end to the Vietnam War instead became involved in the ghastly legal aftermath of the riots and thus faced criminal charges for allegedly instigating the violence. This film portrays the sham trial that took place.Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, who has not been in anything good for a long time, is solid as the lead federal prosecutor who reluctantly takes on the assignment of trying to put the radical protesters behind bars. Mark Rylance's modest, down-to-earth demeanor makes him a rather peculiar fit to portray defense attorney William Kuntsler, the famous defense attorney well-known for his outspoken courtroom oratory and publicity hound antics. Frank Langella is flawless as Julius Hoffman, the judge who presided over this trial and whose combustible temper and tenuous mental faculties made him a ready target for ridicule from many, including those involved in the case. Edie Redmayne is excellent as Tom Hayden, the more pragmatic but equally passionate protester and defendant. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are both stellar as defendants Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, respectively. Finally, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is eloquent as Bobby Seale, a Black Panther Party co-founder and the lone African-American defendant in the case.There are discreet details about the trial I was hoping the film would cover. There is no mention of Bobby Seale's many colorful nicknames he assigned to the judge. It mentions the poet Alan Ginsberg only as a fellow protester, when in fact he was also called as one of several celebrity witnesses. So was the musician Judy Collins who began singing an anti-war song during her testimony. These, however, are minor oversights because the fundamental essence of this circus of a trial is effectively captured in the film. Unlike much of Sorkin's earlier work, the dialogue in this film is less grandiose and more straightforward. There are less pyrotechnics and more re-creation here. I mean that as a compliment. It's the perfect portrayal of a trial which turned out to be a low point in the history of American jurisprudence. It also expertly captures the schism within the American left and how the idealists and pragmatists often locked horns even back in the 1960s. Gripping, frightening and instructive in today's world, it is not to be missed. Highly recommended to all."
1,"You know what isn't superb?
This was splendid! Although I don't know much about what's going around in U.S cause I'm from India, I felt it. I felt emotions from all over the place. The intensity was really high, the characters were so very well written with depth. The acting was really powerful and the casting... just marvellous choices there...Sacha baron Cohen, Joseph, Eddie redmayne and co. just wonderful, just wonderful.I think this film can be relatable for any country. This film captured the struggle of justice so well... the lines were so very well written! And the ending!!! So powerful!!Aaron Sorkin really is an absolute genius! He wrote this so well, such great dialogues, I absolutely love how his characters talk.The cinematography too was absolutely incredible! So fitting!Just brilliant, best film of 2020 for sure."
2,"I watched this with no real expectation, although the inclusion of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did intrigue me. That all changed when I watched the movie as I found it terrific. It is a story that shamefully I was unaware of, and which displays yet again what a dysfunctional political and justice system is alive a kicking in the US..... definitely worth a watch."
3,""" I have never been on trial for my thoughts"", this one line sums it up about the whole movie. Watch the movie, not only for 5 reasons given by Yayha Abdul Mateen, but the writing, the thoughts, and deliverance. When I decided to watch this movie, it was only for the reason of Aaron Sorkin and star cast and with very limited knowledge of the events which took place in 1968 in chicago. However, with in first 30 minutes of 2 hours, it took me back to days when a one minute long monologue of Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" gave goosebumps to an adult of 18 years of age who was not very fluent in english and not very familiar with american judicial system or revelation in "" Charlie Wilson's War"" , which was an another vantage point of looking at geo-politics happening in my country and region.The Trial of Chicago 7 may not have a room to depict drama as seen in previous work of Aaron Sorkins, however in 2 hours and 9 minutes, Aaron and cast of the movie has depicted whatever they could. The script not only provided a dimension to the trial, but the struggles of the main 7 character and the bianess they encountered from the Judicial System.The Court Room thriller, which also based on real event has become alive with this movie and surely will take back you to the days of ""Primal Fear"", ""12 Angry Men"", "" Philadelphia"", "" A Few Good Men"" , in which words, thoughts, and real human expression influenced an individual's thinking process.The entire cast of the movie has performed their best and Aaron Sorkins in his second direction venture has given a classic. The movie which for first few minutes appeared to be political satire eventually turned out to be a great political case, as told by Sacha Baron Cohen."
4,"A very good film, with a great beginning, nice pace, well developped characters, excellent text and dialogs. Eddie Redmayne proves once more that he is the best actor of his generation and that he is able to portray the most varied characters one may conceive. Sadha Baron Cohen also surprises with a suberb performance which shows that, while having comic moments, he is also perfectly able to portray serious, deep and not stylized characters just like the usual ones. This is a dynamic but also deep movie, which is competent to show that electoral regimes are not aithomatically worthy to be labeled as democracies. Racism, narrow-minded shallow patriotism and right-wing extremism, common along all political history in the United States, are shown just like they are. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is my favourite movie from 2020 so far."
5,"Wanted to see if my memories matched what really happened. And they did! The acting, the writing, the visceral affects on my body, the hatred for the police and The Daly Machine in Chicago at that time was all there. They all came flooding back.... These nasty attitudes eventually drove me to move to Colorado... boring as that was in comparison.I cried when Tom Hayden stood and started reading the names of those who had died in the (undeclared) war during the trial. I noticed the one reference to the cast standing to the names being read... but I also remember that was a nightly thing at our dinner tables, ad nauseum. We are all so conditioned to these kinds of scenes now and protected from having to see them by our addiction to our cell phones....And cheered with the audience as each stood up in solidarity with the defendants. Was not surprised to see those who got up and left... I'm grateful for the closing credits to see the outcome of the rest of the participants. Sad to see the outcome of Ruben' s death and Hoffman's suicide, however. But happy that the Judge got his in the end! Tom Hayden success we all have heard of.Most wonderful and informative movie!! Hope it wins BIG TIME!!"
6,"I think Sorkin exercised more discipline than usual in putting this film together. The script was clear, literate, and gave the right tone to each role. The editing also was excellent in bringing in flashback events at the right time during the trial, which kept the pace going forward while providing key background details. He kept the drama high, even though the history and conclusion is well known, by leaving out some of the intermediate details. He trusted his audience at just the right times without compromising the story.Can't say enough about the entire cast. Brilliant job from the seasoned veterans down to relative newbies. SBC was beyond great as Abbie Hoffman, but the entire cast worked magic together.Must see; this is one for the ages."
7,"I find that court related films, especially those based on actual events, carry the great risk of either ending up extremely intense or excruciatingly monotonous. This however, is one of the very few that pulls it off with ease in all aspects, to which also provides some unexpected humour (yes; mainly from Sacha Baron Cohen).Another part of the story I definitely didn't expect going in was how character driven it was, propelled by an absolutely extraordinary cast; who some should at least get some award recognition this coming season for when the time arrives.So far, this is probably my current favourite film to have released this year, despite the lack of competition."
8,"This is a terrific film about a story that not many people know about. It is about a group of people that were protesting the Vietnam War and headed to Chicago to do that in front of the 1968 Democratic convention. The film mostly takes place in the courtroom, with some flashbacks to the rioting and precursors to the violence. For a start I found out about this story when I watched a documentary on 1968 happenings on t.v last year. As far as the film goes I think the performances all around are terrific. Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman was one of the leaders of protesters and he was a real standout funny, heartbreaking and fierce. The film is very dialogue heavy and includes a lot of courtroom scenes but if you love that stuff you will love this movie. I feel the film is very timely as far as division with protestors and police and I just can't say really how great this film was than just to see it as soon as you can. Either watch it in a theatre or if you can't watch it as soon as it hits Netflix I think it is the best film of the year and could win best picture."
9,"Strong acting performances that give life to an old story, as relevant in 1968 as it is now in 2020. The movie has High intensity and I wouldn't be suprised if it is awarded any prizes."
10,"Movie of the year so far, for me. The is no greater master of political debate and courtroom drama than scriptwriter-turned-auteur Aaron Sorkin.
From A Few Good Men to the West Wing to the Newsroom, Sorkin's writing has captured the imagination and he absolutely knocks it out of the park with this one.Based on the true story of 7 protesters arrested as part of the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations at the1968 Democratic Convention, Sorkin has given depth and intrigue to this chilling tale of governmental overreach and revenge politics.While we have come to expect the captivating performances of Eddy Redmayne, it is Sacha Baron Cohen as the misunderstood hippie/protestor Abbie Hoffman who moves you the most.Oscar-winner Mark Rylance is terrific as the beleaguered defence lawyer while Micheal Keaton oozes gravitas in a short guest role.Must watch, especially if you are a Sorkin fan. Highly recommended"
11,"Their is a nice and upbeat pace throughout this film. As the viewer, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with energy of these characters, passionate about their cause to fight perceived injustice of their time - the 1960's. The film involves government corruption, attempts to silence protesters, an engrained racism... Some similarities in the scenes of the movie to what we see today on the news. The characters who make up the Chicago 7, the lawyers and judges, the politicians are all very different from each other and this makes things interesting and volatile. The actors are selected well. Though I love Sacha Baron Cohen, I'm not sure he got the New York accent exactly right here. The writing is great. The editing is great. Very solid film that I think most people would enjoy."
12,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Aaron Sorkin has been around for quite some time. A Few Good Men, Moneyball, Steve Jobs, and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade, The Social Network, all have one thing in common: Sorkin as a screenwriter, but not as the director. Molly's Game was Sorkin's directorial debut, which makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 only his second time in the director's chair. I've either loved or liked every film from him, so obviously, my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence. However, with the announcement of such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project...Expectations fulfilled. This is, in fact, one of 2020's very best films, without the shadow of a doubt. Based on real events, the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action: the trial. Only twenty minutes in, the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously. Sorkin's employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll. The actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline, which would reduce the trial's value. It's the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event.I couldn't take my eyes off-screen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues. Every conversation, every argument, every objection, overrule, or ""motion denied"" is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner. It's one of those movies where the ""action"" belongs to words instead of fists. I felt tremendously invested in the trial. It never loses a gram of interest, it's full-on exciting all the time. I desperately wanted to find out the result of the case (I didn't possess knowledge of the real story, but I'll address this further down). I really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions. I strongly desired to see the end of the situation.As soon as the film ends, I felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story. I spent close to forty-five minutes reading many articles about the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the riots, the presidential nominees... everything. This is one of the most important criteria I have to define how successful a historical flick truly is: how much does it compel me to research everything about it. The Trial of the Chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact. From what I've read, Sorkin changes a few details timeline-wise (something pretty common in this type of movie), but overall, it's a pretty accurate, realistic adaptation.Technically, every component is remarkable, as expected from a Netflix-Sorkin partnership. However, the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations, leaving me at the edge of my couch, biting my nails. It's a fantastic achievement from Daniel Pemberton, who also scored Birds of Prey and Enola Holmes this year. Additionally, this might not be a one-location film, but Sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants.Besides Sorkin's screenplay, the cast obviously plays a massive role. Just like I mentioned above, this is a movie where the ""action"" is played out through words. Inside the courtroom, there are constant arguments, countless contempts of court, a voir dire (it doesn't hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film), and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence. Every actor is absolutely outstanding, I was able to feel everything during that trial, but I do have four standouts.Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman) shares the laugh spotlight with Jeremy Strong (Jerry Rubin), but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief. His delivery and timing are pure gold. I can't deny that I was surprised by his performance since I've only seen him in Borat. He's extremely funny, but don't be mistaken by my words: Abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial, offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose. Eddie Redmayne brings his Oscar-winner face to the game by interpreting Tom Hayden. A vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty, they're not all exactly innocent as well. Hayden's final speech is one of Redmayne's best scenes of his career.Mark Rylance plays the role of the public, portraying the defendants' lawyer, William Kunstler. He shares the viewer's frustration with the judge's decisions but never gives up, trying to bring justice to the case. If I had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year, it would be Rylance due to his powerful display. My last standout is Frank Langella as the judge Julius Hoffman. I believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love, but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates. Langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair, racist, unqualified judge. His performance is simply extraordinary.These are my four standouts, but the entire cast is phenomenal. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't get to see more from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Bobby Seale), but after researching Bobby's involvement in this story, I understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative. He plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial, transmitting a message that humanity's behavior may have evolved regarding racism, but there's still a long way to go. A final shoutout to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is also excellent as Richard Schultz.I only have one issue. In terms of entertainment, the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move. However, the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that I could only understand who's who and their purpose during the trial. Sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are, what they did, and where the narrative is driving towards, skipping through dozens of details that (mostly) non-American audiences will struggle to understand in time. Sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially, offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations.All in all, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, probably the best at the date of this review. Aaron Sorkin's narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well. Sorkin's screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure. Maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story. Inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues, never losing steam until the very end. It's also a lot funnier than I expected. Regarding the cast, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, and Frank Langella are my standouts, but every actor delivers outstanding performances. Daniel Pemberton's score shines in an overall very well-produced film. The first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom, but it's so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyone's names and purposes. Assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move, especially for non-Americans. Nevertheless, this minor issue doesn't affect an otherwise flawless movie. Obviously, I strongly recommend it! Maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing, but don't read too much due to the usual spoilers.Rating: A"
13,"It is difficult making a period piece from the 1960s time period without making the characters look silly which is rather unavoidable because looking ridiculous is what made the counter-culture counter!Fifty years later, I so respect what the 7 were trying to do. Vietnam was a terrible war and they were trying to stop it to save lives.The police and Mayor Daly had other ideas. Footage from the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968 was harrowing. Seeing the cops brutalize those protesters, not caring if it was male or female head cracking. It was horrible at the time and televised. Seeing real footage from the police brutality is nauseating.I do remember William Kunsler as their brilliant defense lawyer. Kunsler was fearless as the judge was bananas, much like the judge in the Woburn, Massachusetts case ""A Civil Action"" case. So glad they made this Chicago 7 film, it is worth watching."
14,"... or guilty until proven innocent. Nothing like a good court room caper to ratchet up the blood pressure, especially with Frank Langella presiding as the ever so slightly biased beak, and doing it to absolute perfection. Packed full, just like the court room of top drawer performances, it leaves you aghast that these scenarios could ever exist in the first instance while thankful that three British thespians can fill the voids American actors seem unable to satisfy."
15,"The Trial of The Chicago 7 oddly feels dated, like it could've released a decade ago. Coming from Aaron Sorkin, I think many expected more and better, which in some ways it's this movie's biggest downfall. Not to say that this is a badly made film at all, it's well made in every aspect, an impressive sophomore directorial debut by Sorkin, but it lacks just that touch to make it feel something more than just ""good."" All of the performances are good, but there's none I would consider to be truly great. One of the only performances that really stands out is Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman and even he feels like he's holding back. What truly deserves praise is the structure given to the story as it cuts from the court room to flashbacks making what's mostly a slow court trial quite engaging. However, what is left is a competently made Hollywood historical piece, with an important, but shallowly presented message. The movie barely takes any time to actually delve into these characters and show us what they're dealing with. 2 of the Chicago 7, Lee Weiner and John Froines, barely get any screen time since they're mostly pointless to the story, but it could've been interesting to see more of their perspective on essentially getting used by the court. The other performance that stands out is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. I thought that section of the movie was one of the more compelling, and should've been focused on more instead of forgetting it after he leaves the trial. The antagonists are just portrayed as dumb bad guys when they could've been far more developed to give a deeper analysis of the system and government. The message is definitely important, but all this movie ends up saying is ""Government bad, system flawed."" Ultimately, I would still consider this to be a good movie, I mean there's nothing I could really point out and call bad, but it had the potential to be a powerful examination of the government, system, court, etc. This just ends up feeling like the yearly Hollywood crowd pleasing historical piece that paints a nice picture of the events from afar, but lacks the fine details once you take a step closer to examine it.(7/10)"
16,"Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who has ever been part of a peaceful, honest protest against social or political abuse/injustice, turned into mayhem by the very institutions which should uphold the state of law, will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who has ever witnessed the abuse of justice in a court of law, by the very representatives of it, will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. Anyone, from any country, under any political régime, who still believes in the eternal values of mankind- justice, empathy, honesty, love will relate to Sorkin's film 100%. This time I leave it to others to perform a critical approach. The film spoke to me on so many real levels that theory seems/is futile."
17,"This was a brilliant film, Sorkin captures the rebellious mood of the era perfectly. There is not a false step anywhere, there is even some humour.But just one thing, and this is important: it took six more years to end the war in Vietnam."
18,Having lived through the 1960s I can assure you that this film was historically correct. my Recollection of events of This time periodWithslight exaggerations but basically this is the way it went down just as you see in this movie.
19,"When 2020 seemed lost, The Trial of the Chicago 7 comes to the rescue... Finally Netflix does it again for movies, with some much ""spam"" coming in these days we needed this movie..A story based on true events that took place in Chicago in 1968, where a group of individuals spoke up and protested again the Vietnam War during the Democratic National Convention.These supposed pacific protests took a dark turn and several police aggressions painted this violent scenario, as in so many other historical occasions.
The movie takes most if its time depicting the ""circus"" (for lack of a better word to describe it) that the 5 month trial of the major 7 figures of this riot was, and the situations that were dealt by them while being defended - from a biased judge, to a cheating prosecution, and of course a not so easy to control set of defendants.
We witness once more the dark side and the hipocrisy of what was once claimed the country of opportunities and freedom, we see oppression and false sense of morality taking over and as it always happens, lives simply vanishing in the name of pointless wars.
The movie is simply fantastic, from a direction standpoint its dynamic, you feel energized throughout the entire film and it keeps you engaged to the story, mostly because of the charisma of the characters, and of course another big factor that contributes to this is the actual cast, from the fantastic Sacha Baron Cohen, to Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II basically an A-list cast that drove this movie to the high quality standards it deserves.
While it is a drama, it has a lot of comedic aspects added to it that kind of ease the tention and the serioussness of the topics discussed, but don't be fooled, I'm not an American national so discussing these topics can always be a sensitive subject, however the message is clear as history repeats itself, people fighting for basic rights of freedom and against a rotten and flawed system are marked as anti-americans while the representatives of the self procclaimed free country are themselves the oppressors and the responsibles for thousands of casualties of their own nationals.
But politics gives room to a major discussion, so not to deviate the attention of the movies, here's wy it's one of the best for this year: it's bold, gets you familiarized with an important event in American history, reminds you that fights against injustice started a long time ago, it's very well acted and written and for sure a source of pure entertainment which might be hard to find these days in movies!
I suspect we are starting to enter the award season and this might be an Academy Award front runner, with all that is been going on in the world, I do hope we will still be able to celebrate movies and specially the ones that impact us positevely and make us think about important subjects that we prefer to ignore."
20,"Aaron Sorkin is practically a guarantee, a safe home, a unique experience and a timeless idea made flesh and blood, so withouth knowing, he made The Trial of the Chicago 7 one of the best films ever written and directed. A house is built with solid foundations and that's why an exceptional and unrivaled cast is chosen, where a glorious Eddie Redmayne and an intriguing Sasha Baron Cohen stand out, not to mention the perfect Mark Rylance. Simplistic direction, but with an effect that goes far beyond the main intention; the choice of studied, but not demanding shots, which tell the story even if the film were silent, as if it were a big book of photos. The film touches on one of the most important processes in history with delicacy, respect and spreading loudly a message before and beyond these facts; therefore not only the film succeed in its intent and in the cinematographic field, but it manages to travel beyond the mere vision and meaning of the film itself."
21,"This has to be the most important movie released this year. It is also my favourite (at least so far).
Sometimes, a movie like The Trial of the Chigaco 7 comes along. These movies end up being much more than just movies. They teach us and remind us of something that we have forgotten, or something that we might have never seen or even heard of. And this film, well, it does exactly that. And it does so at a time when it's more important than ever.As someone who was born and has lived his whole life outside of the U.S, I had never heard of the trial of the Chicago Seven. I don't know if these events are common knowledge in the U.S, but I hope they are. For me, perhaps the scariest and most shocking thing about his film was how little anything seems to have changed. Reading the news depicts the U.S.A as a country where these kinds of events are commonplace. But it's also important to remember, that it's not just the U.S. We see stories like this from around the world, and this movie, I hope, will remind us of how unfair these institutions and systems can be when controlled by people who are looking to look after themselves.As a movie, I really enjoyed The Trial of the Chicago 7. Then again, I really like these types of films. Be it The Social Network, or Spotlight, or All the President's Men. I also like Aaron Sorkin as a writer. In addition, the cast is simply spectacular. Filled with some of the finest actors of today, all giving excellent performances. As such, I probably did enjoy this one more than most will. But, that shouldn't make this movie and its message any less important.Even if you don't enjoy movies like the ones I named above, watch this one just for its message. And if you do like those types of films, I think you will really enjoy this one.
So, please find a way to see this film. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an extremely important film, especially now."
22,I didn't know what it was about so I didn't have any expectations. Great cast. Everyone played their role perfectly. All the ingredients came together beautifully
23,"This is an extremely watchable courtroom, period drama with a jaw dropping back story attached.A stonkingly good cast. Wonderful character actors are: John Carroll Lynch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Michael Keaton.Splendid is Mark Rylance once again. In this, he plays defense lawyer, William Kunstler. See Rylance's acting brain going Tick. Tick. Tick., showing his character coming to terms and staying ahead of the rising challenges and irritations which materialised during the court proceedings. Rylance can do no wrong in reviewer's mind.Eddie Redmayne is Tom Hayden and he reveals, very well, a person at odds with himself. What is more important? The public persona? Or his compassion for people and social justice? Through Redmayne's performance we come to understand the man.We see a lively and a lesson in characterisation worn lightly once again by Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman), his is a great pairing with the eccentric and day dreaming, Jerry Ruben played by actor, Jeremy Strong.Reviewer could go on singing everyone's praises. No negatives, this Aaron Sorkin's film is just brilliant!for full review visit Not Compulsory blog"
24,"An interesting essay about some brave individuals whom decided war was worth speaking up against, and the corrupted and vested system that tried to chew them up for dong so.In this film, rotten police, self interested government departments and a half senile judge star as the villains. The brave anti-war protagonists are flawed, but the system they run against even more so.It's interesting to see that the kind of rampant and unwarranted police violence we observe in the film has made a bit of a come back in recent times.Will we ever evolve into a better civilisation?"

Terrific cast, superb acting, hilarious yet poignant script and solid direction.All the way through this movie you can't help but view it in the context of the current state of America. I would guess that was the intent and it delivered in spades.This is a MUST SEE!!ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT."
27,"The Trial Of The Chicago 7 was a film I wasn't planning on watching. I saw one day it just popped up on Netflix and I thought I had to watch it and I must say it really surprised me.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is about a group of seven people who have been charged with starting a riot at the democratic rally in 1968. The seven people Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and Lee Wiener (Noah Robbins) are put to trial to see if they really did start a riot. There lawyers William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and Leonard Winglass (Ben Shenkman) are arguing against Richard Shultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and possibly the Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella) as well.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is a movie I wasn't planning on watching at all. I new a little about because Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it and he is one of my favorite actors but bedsides that I didn't know much about the film. I heard this film was getting good reviews from many people and after I saw the film I must agree with those people. This movie did many things really well. First of all, the story and dialogue was obviously going to be really well done. Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed this film. He was written The West Wing, Moneyball, and The Social Network. He has also directed Molly's Game. This was only his second film he directed and it didn't show at all. He looks like a natural. The only problem I had with the writing in this film was Lee Wiener and John Froines were almost non existent in this film. They showed up at the trials and that was it. They didn't really have much dialogue in this film and you couldn't really relate with them as a character. All the other characters were really well written and you almost felt like you knew them.The acting was one of the best things in the film. All of the guys who played one of the Chicago 7 did amazing. They were spot on. Also the person who did the casting did a fantastic job with getting actors who looked like the characters that they were playing. Yahya Abdul-Mateen ll played the character of Bobby Seale who wasn't one the the seven but was a key part to the story because he was a black man who was accused of homicide in Connecticut and was rumored to have talked with members of the seven. He was brilliantly played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen ll. Mark Rylance and Rob Shenkman were tasked with paying the two lawyers who had to defend the seven. They played their roles marvelously. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lawyer trying to put the men away also played his role spectacularly. In my mind, he is one of the best actors out there. He has been pretty good in the last two decades in his films like Inception, 500 Days Of Summer, and I think this should be added to one of his best acted films. He played a very strict lawyer who would do nothing or allow anything that would break the law. He nailed that aspect of the character with a little help from Aaron Sorkin.Something that I didn't think would be as good as it was is the editing. Specifically the start to film was put together really well and gave you a good idea what has been happing ten years prior to when this film took place. There were also many scenes that would explain the riots that happened in Chicago and they were honestly incredibly intense. They were intense enough to make your palms sweat. If they only focused on the riots and didn't mix in some other things like Abbie's stand-up and the witnesses explaining what was going on, I bet the riot scenes would have been stripped of their intensity. Those scenes were the highlights of the movie for me.The Trial Of The Chicago 7 was a film that was beautifully edited and the acting was top notch but some of the characters didn't feel like they did much of anything which took away from experience."
28,"Everybody who is concerned for our country and wants a little hope, watch this movie. The writing by Sorkin was amazing, and the acting was so passionate that I could not help but clap after the movie ended (and I have never been one to do that). OSCAR WORTHY. INCREDIBLE. THE LIGHT OF 2020."
29,"Being a Brit in my 30's, I wasn't aware of this U.S. trial from the late 60's and how big it was at the time - so the movie premise intrigued me from the start.The pacing and cinematography was perfect, the acting fantastic (particularly from SBC and Mark Rylance) and I was incredibly moved.I can't comment on it's accuracy to how events really went down, but it's still a must see movie for its powerful narrative. I'll certainly be going away and learning more about this important period of history."
30,"Entertaining, albeit in the typical relentlessly quippy Aron Sorkin fashion, the occasional light touches doesn't hinder from the movie delivering on the stakes and importance of the subject matter.Sacha Baron Cohen's accent can be jarring at first, but it takes a minute to get used to. The rest of the cast do an admirable job with Yahya Abdul Mateen being the standout (even in a somewhat limited role by design). The strong cameo performance near the tail end also boosts the performance pedigree.While surely the parallels and the timing of the release of this movie is not coincidental, it is a piece of art that does what good art often do, and that is to remind us of truths. In this case, the truth is, those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it."
31,"The case of 7 individuals accused of various crimes in 1968, after the riots during the National Democratic Convention in Chicago, USA.The format isn't new, it can be called a 'court film', where practically all the action takes place in the courtroom, but thanks to the scenes of flashbacks and backstage conversations between the defendants Aaron Sorkin manages to skip the boring moments, and delivers 2 hours of a real cinematic show.Although it is about an American event, it is perfectly identifiable with anyone in the world who has his sense of justice awake.The cast is great, all very consistent in their roles, but Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne stand out from the rest, for different reasons.One of the best releases of 2020."
32,"What a brilliant gem this turned out to be. Aaron Sorkin has created a masterpiece that is not only a great piece of cinematic work but also a glaring testament to the struggles peaceful protestors continue to have with the State and its machinery to this day, in every part of the world. Inspirational movie! Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Frank Langella give stand out performances. Highly recommend this to everyone who gives a damn about their country and the world as a whole."
33,"I would watch this alone for the performances of Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne.To catch that balance of humour and seriousness in so many scenes by Sacha is incredible. It's such a fine line, I just couldn't believe how well he pulled it off.Eddie and Sacha both were incredible. I would be surprised if one of them didn't at least get a nomination for the Oscars.The story is brilliant and there are a few shocking scenes where you are just horrified at what you are seeing."
34,"""The whole world is watching!""Those words have just as much relevance today as they did back in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention. It isn't a coincidence that the problems we dealt with more than sixty years ago are still the same problems that we wrestle with today. It's also not a coincidence that Aaron Sorkin and Netflix have released their new politically charged film, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", just weeks before one of the most important elections in our nation's history.Based on a true story, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" opens like a rocket with rapid pace intercutting between all the major parties involved at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.The first of these parties is Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis as part of the Students for a Democratic Society. Next is the hippies of Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin who lead the Youth International Party. There's also David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines. These seven make up the ragtag group of the Chicago 7. Also (unfairly) part of their trial is Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale.These eight activists are on trial for their roles in the anti-Vietnam War protests in 1968 Chicago that led to a series of brawls between protestors and police. The bigwigs in the White House believe that the protestors were the ones that started the riots and want to make an example of the seven. The demonstrators (correctly) claim that it was the people dressed in blue that instigated the violence. From here the battle begins between two opposing sides with the potential nation defining verdict hanging in the balance.Director Aaron Sorkin follows up his 2017 debut feature ""Molly's Game"" with another director's showcase.Mainly set within a single courtroom, the film is ripe with technical wizardry from all facets of the production. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael incorporates a wide array of long takes and many angled shots that tell just as much of the story as the script does. Editor Alan Baumgarten doesn't allow for a single dull moment as he keeps this train moving at full speed from beginning to end.This isn't to say Sorkin is a perfect director, far from that actually. Sorkin still misses his mark in a few key areas, most notably in the final moments of the film where the attempt at a stirring finale comes off as cheesy and dated.A writer before taking over the director's chair, Sorkin has delivered some of the greatest scripts of this millennium with his work on ""The Social Network"" (which won him an Oscar), ""Steve Jobs"", and ""Moneyball"".""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" delivers yet another Oscar-worthy script from Sorkin and the exact one you would want for a courtroom drama. Sorkin instills his trademarked rapid back-and-forth dialogue during the trial proceedings as witnesses testify and lawyers verbally spar. Several lines throughout elicit a strong provocative reaction that connects the film to today's cultural climate.Like all Sorkin scripts, everything does feel a bit too clean and artificial. Every character speaks on a near-genius level as they always say the exact right thing at the exact right moments. This style of perfect dialogue is more in line with characters such as Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs instead of the ones found within this film. But, when the dialogue is this good all the time, that problem doesn't matter all that much.Sorkin has also assembled an all-star cast to relish in his whip-smart script. There isn't a single weak-link among them as they will crowd Oscar ballots with their powerhouse performances.Veteran stage and screen actor Mark Rylance, here on the opposite side of the law than his performance in ""Bridge of Spies"", leads the pack with his spectacular turn as the defense lawyer for the Chicago 7.Also a stage and screen veteran is the great Frank Langella who plays the dangerously maniacal judge who oversees the case. Langella's grumpy performance parallels closely to a certain political figure who currently occupies the Oval Office.Jeremy Strong is almost unrecognizable from his uptight role in ""Succession"" as he expertly plays the relaxed Jerry Rubin. Sacha Baron Cohen is more in line with his previous roles as the clownish Abbie Hoffman.Yahya Abdul Mateen II is great in his both intentional and unintentional small role as George Seale. His role incites the most sympathy and relates to our current situation of race and policing.Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a nostalgic old-school courtroom drama bolstered by strong modern filmmaking and terrific performances from its cast. The timeliness and importance of its message make it a must-see as the whole world will be watching during this tumultuous election season."
35,"A starstruck movie with actors really playing their rolls well, showing a not so good side of the USA"
36,"Energised and impactful, THE TRAIL OF THE CHICAGO 7 is a must-see for its superb cast, pitch perfect pacing and it's captivating, clever script. A powerful and relevant historic legal drama. Bravo Netflix!"
37,"Well done, all the way around. His script really captured the conflicts of the time. Great acting and superb scenes. Hats off! Looking forward to watching it again."
38,I really enjoyed The Trial of the Chicago 7 but people are telling me I'm a bit simple for doing so... Many people think it's too 'light' but for me that lightness of tone makes it even more tragic. To think this is a real story and a lot of it happened exactly as portrayed and some of what happened was even worse. Personally I would have enjoyed it much less if it had been totally serious/heavy in tone. The whole trial was a farce and it was rightly depicted as one
39,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 starts its act with a pure dramatic atmosphere with the key actors' performance gets perfectly blend with it. The film progresses quite smoothly throughout the first arc but gets hit by a few bumps which are caused by not so good screenplay. The gripping action of the movie is strong enough to keep you on your seat and to keep you thinking about the next outcome. Character interaction played a really good role in pushing the film upwards. Overall the movie renders a splendid presentation on the screen throughout its entire run along with few bumps but in the end, it manages to close the act without any error. Not just for once it's a movie you can enjoy more than once."
40,"Few famous trials provide more raw material for drama than the trial of the Chicago 7. Sorkin captures the outrage and anarchy of the times as well as the stylistic and ideological tensions among the leaders of the anti-war movement. This movie also shows the vendetta that the Nixon administration AG John Mitchell had against his predecessor Ramsey Clark that motivated the trial and the shocking behavior of Judge Julius Hoffman.Sasha Baron Cohen was an inspired choice to play the anarchic Abbie Hoffman despite his mangled Massachusetts accent . (Worcester native Hoffman had the same accent that my Massachusetts born and bred mother had, and Cohen's is not even close. Jimmy Fallon's Boston accent as Sully on SNL was 100 times better.)The portrayal of the seven defendants, Bobby Seale, defense attorney William Kuntsler, and the prosecutors is dimensional and fascinating. Hoffman and Rubin in particular could have been cartoons, but they are not.Sorkin dramatically reminds us that the freedom,, peace, and justice that we fought for in the '60s are more urgently needed now."
41,Aaron Sorkin's second feature gives us a spectacular film that is bound to be up for numerous awards. The movie starts slows but as it gains momentum the drama becomes more intriguing and exciting. Before going into a Sorkin movie you expect great dialogue but that does not make it any less impressive. The movie really shines when the trial is cut together with scenes from the streets of Chicago. The entire ensemble cast shines as more of their character is revealed as the story goes on. Overall the film packs the punch with political messaging needed in the divisive time of today. It is another great achievement for the esteemed writer.
42,"So, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is one which I was unfortunately unable to catch on its short ""Oscar-nom"" cinema release, but is now on Netflix. And boy, for older viewers who prefer historical drama over wham-bam action, this is definitely worth the watch.I know a decent bit of 20th century history, but this is a story I knew nothing about. At the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, anti-Vietnam protests resulted in a violent and brutal confrontation with the police. Eight of the ring-leaders were rounded up and charged with inciting the violence. What happens in the court with the eight convicted men, in front of an old and partisan judge (the wonderful Frank Langella), is simply amazing.There's a nice wiki article on the history you can look up. But its worth watching the movie blind, since it's a great rollercoaster ride.If you read my blog regularly, you'll know that one of my favourite of the awards in award season is the ""Ensemble Cast"" award from the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG). I think a good measure of which movies might be good candidates for this award is when you find it difficult to single out particular actors for an individual award when they all work so well together. For this is a cast to die for:Sacha Baron Cohen, as Abbie Hoffman: an intelligent 'straight' role, poles apart from Borat and Bruno, that he delivers on 100%;Jeremy Strong as Hoffman's buddy Jerry Rubin, doing an enormously entertaining turn;Eddie Redmayne as the apparently 'sensible one' Tom Hayden. A bit similar to his role in ""Les Miserables"", but diving off in a different direction at a key point;John Carroll Lynch as the genuine 'boy scout' David Dellinger, so good in ""The Founder"" and here as the only family man under the judgmental stare of his wife and son;Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Panther member Bobby Seale - the ""minus 1"" from the title - in an astonishingly powerful performance;Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the prosecutor Richard Schultz - always quietly dependable;And the fantastic Mark Rylance as the defense attorney William Kunstler. I appreciate I am having a tendency to gush in this review, but Rylance expresses such a range of frustration and disgust here that his performance is nothing short of electrifying.There's also a cracking cameo from Michael Keaton playing the former US Attorney General, Ramsey Clark.I would think that any of these performances might be Oscar-worthy (somewhere in the Actor/Supporting Actor categories) but my personal choices would be Rylance for Best Actor and Baron Cohen and Langella for Best Supporting Actor nods.One of my issues with the scripts of Aaron Sorkin is that they tend to be overly dense and wordy. In epic TV like ""The West Wing"" he could spread the dialogue over a whole series, but in a feature film it can become very dense and verbose. I found that in both of his last two films - ""Molly's Game"" and ""Steve Jobs"".Here, in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", even though there's a lot of speechifying, to me it never felt over the top. Although an epic courtroom drama (akin to his debut script ""A Few Good Men"") the characters are given time to breath between the lines. And many of those lines are real zingers, particularly out of the mouth of stand-up anarchist Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen).Aside from the script being a zinger, the direction here from Aaron Sorkin is also top-notch. If you thought a courtroom drama was going to be static and boring, think again. The camera never rests, and inserted flashbacks (excellent film editing from Alan Baumgarten) maintain the momentum of the story.Overall, this is a movie tour-de-force from Sorkin, and a fantastic watch. Could this be a writing/directing double Oscar nom for Sorkin?(For the full graphical review, check out the bob the movie man review on the web of One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"
43,"This movie is riveting. I was young at this time so I didn't know a lot about the riots at the Democratic convention. I got a history lesson from this movie that on several occasions brought tears to my eyes. I know quite a few people who were in Vietnam, a war that should never have happened and a draft that should never have happened. So many young people died for nothing."
44,"This one really draws you in. Keeps you thinking and emotionally engaged throughout the entire film. Great plot, relevant and terrific acting. Nuff said. Watch it."
45,This movie is a must see . When looking at the trailer for it I tried not to get too hyped up about it because Netflix has yet to have a decent original film . Normally their trailers make the film look amazing but when it comes to watching them they have all just seemed to fall flat in their face. But along came trial of the 7 and it was great from start to finish
46,There is no movie that deserves the academy award this year than The Trial Of The Chicago 7.2020 has been a dry slump for movies and the Chicago 7 has been a positive ray of hope.
47,"The Chicago Seven were seven defendants charged by the US federal government with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968.
Bobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial severed during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven.
Bobby was at first bound, gagged n chained to a chair in the courtroom and then severed from the case for a later trial.The film is very gripping, entertaining n sad at times."
48,"This feels like a Spielberg film with a really good script. I don't mean that in a negative way, I mean that there is some Spielberg influence with an outstanding script. If you didn't know, Steven Spielberg was originally supposed to direct this film but dropped out and Writer/Director Aaron Sorkin took over. The writing and directing here are excellent. Sorkin knows how to keep your attention with simple scenes by having long monologues with unique camerawork and interesting framing. The performances here are great too especially Sacha Baren Cohen and Eddie Redmayne. I would say this is probably a career best for Redmayne and one of my favorite Cohen performances but his performance in Borat still has this film beat. The story is engaging and interesting which is weird because a lot of this is court room drama but I was invested for 95% of the time. The riot scenes are sprinkled throughout the film and those scenes are excellent. My issue with the film is its historical accuracy and certain dramatic moments. Like I said in the beginning, this feels like a Spielberg film and sometimes Spielberg tends to overdramatize events and there's a little bit of that here and ties into historical accuracy. They had to take some creative liberties here and there and I really wish they hadn't because this is a fascinating court case that will be looked back on for years to come. If you're a fan of Sorkin's writing style or want a riveting drama, then definitely check this film out."
49,It is a really good movie about true events of a trial in USA. I can´t believe that a judge like this could exists. Outstanding performance of Sacha Baron Cohen also really good performance of Eddie Redmayne.
50,"In a time of pushed fake political films and utterly unentertaining movies , this is a gold."
51,I was pulled into this from start to finish. The extreme believability of this group of A listers made me feel as though I was there. One of the best films I've seen in my 68 years.
52,"There is not so many movies that will keep you interested,with hardly no violence,sex scenes & disturbing behaviour.This does ,Great film actually probably the best film, I have seen all year. RESPECT!"
53,"Great performances from everyone especially from Mark Rylance, I do wish there was more Yahya Abdul Mateen II and Michael Keaton. The editing and pacing isn't as sharp as it could be but the aforementioned acting and writing demonstrates Aaron Sorkin's ability to captivate audiences effectively."
54,"The movie was great. She doesn't really feel the time and has a funny gesture with Sasha Baron Cohen acting as Abbie Hoffman and also Eddie Redmayne. At first they both have their differences, however throughout the film they still put aside the differences to demonstrate their true intentions to demonstrate peacefully and express the reason for it. I liked the way his characters interacted."
55,"What a great, great cast. Great writing, great editing and of course great dialogue being Aaron Sorkin.I should also point out how FUNNY it is in the first half, with some classic Sorkin sarcastic dialogue and jokes happening. It's almost more of a comedy.But then things get more real as it goes deeper into the material and it's still just as great. The editing is fantastic in this movie.Also, lots of great cameos in this which I won't spoil.A most pleasant surprise. I though it would a pretty dry docu-drama--but not at all."
56,Great Movie that captures the feeling of that era perfectly. It is moving and makes you draw paralles to the present as well. Big compliment to Aaron Sorkin and all the actors for making a Great and important movie that draws you in from the beginning to the end.
57,"This is another remake of the Trial. I believe I have seen them all unless there was an all African-American Broadway musical. In this one they didn't play ""the song"" which is required during the credit role. Jeremy Strong played Jerry Rubin like he was Rick Moranis. What was that all about?Remakes of trials are never done for no reason. This one was anti-Trump if you read between the lines. It includes Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton) claiming the President is not the AG client. We see the interpretation of the laws stretched to suit the political needs of the President. We see a judge appointed and rules against accepted norms in order to prejudice a trial. There was government witness tampering. It was a political trial.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
58,"Rylance, Redmayne and Ali G on top form :)Made even better knowing that its based on a true story.Intense movie with some great dark humour and superb acting.I found the Judge's behavior incredibly hard to believe - if it was based on fiction I would have said it was way over the top - but discovering it is fact based makes it incredible. The sheer frustration and helplessness of the defendants and lawyers portrayed perfectly.I loved Ali G's american accent and likewise Mark Rylance's.
Redmayne performance is also top notch.The riot scenes really seem to portray the brutality and violence well.I was never a fan of Ali G nor the Borat movies because of the crass humour, but with this film and some more of his recent serious roles, I will be keeping an eye out for Sacha Baron Cohen.
2hrs well spent!"
59,"This is one of the best films I´ve seen in years. The story is great, the movie is amazing throughout and the actors are magnificent."
60,Incredibly moving and seemingly more relevant now than ever
61,"Loved the story telling, sharp edits and the way the whole movie comes together. This is a movie based on historic events and as the movie progresses, one is able to feel and understand the emotions that the participants of this historic event went through. All performances are great, and the movie is well paced."
62,"Making a trial film in 2020 has
become one of the most difficult things recently , due to the large number of trial films throughout the history of cinema and the shrinkage of its ideas and creative solutions.
I will start by talking about the most amazing thing in the film, which is the dialogue and the text, Aaron Sorkin is known for his wonderful writing and script and he wrote many wonderful films, but this time he excelled as he wrote a wonderful dialogue that has the double meaning of sentences and comics in the text, using The black comedy in the movie made it its own splendor, as the events are tragic and make you angry and want to cry, but you laugh at the same time, writing the judge's text was special and added a lot. The end of the film was one of the things that surprised me, also the introduction of black rights and the rights of those who died in the Vietnam War were creative, wonderful, and unexpected.As for acting, I see that Eddie redmayne has a great talent for creating new expressions and adapting new characters from his imagination. As for the actor Mark Rylance, he excelled unspeakably in his neurotic scenes and the reaction of him was truly amazing. So is the actor sacha baron Cohen. As for the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his performance was so good that he was only faulted when he didn't creat new expressions for him and that his character was the most usual and imitated.The only thing annoyed me is the dark and dark colouring of the movie, also didn't get any vibes from the filmography."
63,"Great movie , horrible to think what one corrupt and mentally insane judge can do to peoples life's"
64,"Exciting, humorous, an excellent cast that keeps your eyes on the screen - this is what a great movie should be about. The kind of movie which you rewind not for it's special effects, but because of it's dramaturgy, tension and interactions. Not to mention, it tells much about the historical aspects of a country which cannot be well undertood without all these historical/sociological references. Absolutely brilliant, a surprisingly well made quality movie. More like this, please!"
65,"During the trial, I watched correspondent John Lawrence every evening on CBS for his report on the events of that day in court. This was before cameras were allowed in courtrooms, but CBS had excellent artists renderings. The Nixonites, at the beginning of persecuting their many ""enemies"" (real or imagined) , even included John Froines and Lee Weiner as defendants, representing ""Left Wing Academia"". Both were found not guilty on all charges. My friends and I always called the real Judge Julius Hoffman ""Magoo"" because he looked liked the Mr. Magoo character in cartoons -- his physical appearance was not as intimidating as Frank Langella's is on screen, but he was just as reprehensible. One thing this film does so well is using flashbacks from when events took place to give more context to what was taking place in the courtroom. The cast performances are uniformly excellent, but Mark Rylance stands out, once again proving that he is one of the very best actors in film. Sasha Barron Cohen is also particularly convincing as Abby Hoffman."
66,"Greatly enjoyed this movie! Start to finish! I dont have any criticism at all! This movie brought it all, even a wide array of emtions! Wow, would watch again!I dont post good reviews... dont normally need to. I do post bad ones often. Im not impressed by recent films often, in fact hardly ever. Yet, here we are..."
67,"After a disappointing first foray in the director's chair with 2017's mostly forgotten about Molly's Game, screenwriting legend and politics focused Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin finds himself back in form with Netflix's latest high profile release and potential awards player The Trial of the Chicago 7.Taking us back in the politically charged Vietnam era of America, this based on a true story tale of a group of seemingly peaceful anti-war protestors and movement leaders being targeted by the government system allows Sorkin to once more return to the courtroom setting that he made his name with in 1992's A Few Good Men and the results, while not quite as memorable or moving as that piece of work or other highpoints of Sorkin's career like A Social Network, suggest Sorkin has found his grove as a writer/director.At one stage touted as a potential Steven Spielberg vehicle (Spielberg's Dreamworks production company is still on board), Trial has a lot of ground to cover as it examines the extensive and drawn out court case of the various reported troublemakers and riot instigators, as well as offering glimpses into the actual events that lead to their very public case, so much so that character development and engagement isn't as strong as it perhaps could've been but with Sorkin's on fire script and a string of solid performances front and centre throughout, this is one Netflix awards baiter that does most things right.Without a typical lead as such, Trial manages to give sufficient airplay to its loaded cast that includes Eddie Redmayne as the softly spoken but wise beyond his years Tom Hayden, Sacha Baron Cohen (in one of his rare non-comedic roles) as hippie extraordinaire Abbie Hoffman, rising star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Panther leader Bobby Seale while Mark Rylance as lawyer William Kunstler and Frank Langella as the despicable judge of the case Julius Hoffman make their marks in numerous well-played out scenes.It's always a pleasure watching actors of the caliber that are assembled here getting to play with such well-rounded and sharply written scenes and while it is a shame we don't get more of an emotional connection to these men and their plights (something no doubt Spielberg would've aimed at with more intent), there's not much of Trial that doesn't engage you throughout, particularly with its strong sense of time and place and a feeling that this story of justice being sought is more relevant than ever in todays modern political climate.Final Say -It might not quite be a new Sorkin masterpiece but this wonderfully acted and engaging piece of true life courtroom drama is a fine film in its own right and one of the best bets Netflix has as it pushes towards this years award season.4 caught eggs out of 5"
68,"Amazing writing, acting, and intens moment. Definition of ""Democracy"" at it best today. At the end of the day, L'Histoire se Répète."
69,"Aaron Sorkin wrote and directed this brilliant film about the trial of the Chicago Seven, which took place In Chicago in 1969-1970.Actually the seven represented different groups, but no matter, they were all painted with the same brush. At the Democratic Party Convention in 1968, there were protests by a group of moderates, led by Tom Hayden and militant ""Yippies"" led by Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong. Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), accused of something else, had his trial finally severed from that of the Seven. These men were arrested and arraigned on charges of Conspiracy by the Nixon administration.The trial itself was a joke, led by Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella) who had obviously decided beforehand that these men were all guilty of conspiracy and inciting violence.The prosecution lawyer was the reluctant Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon Levitt), and on the defendant's side, the fiery William Kuntsler (Mark Rylance).The Yippies as they were called made constant disturbances during the trial, which upset the moderates. Seale was in court without a lawyer and not allowed to defend himself, finally appearing in court bound and gagged.The Chicago 7 were Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) , Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins).The acting was remarkable, with Cohen and Strong bringing some humor to the situation, Langella perfect as the hateful and prejudiced judge.Mark Rylance who in my opinion can do no wrong gives an excellent performance as Kuntsler, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job as a torn federal prosecutor Richard Schultz. As Bobby Seale, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is fantasticThis is a horrible segment of American history, during times very similar to those of today. The Vietnam War, killing thousands of soldiers and civilians, had made activists out of young people, all of whom approached protesting in different ways - some with violence, others attempting non-violence, and both being thwarted by both Mayor Daley and the police, free with their billy clubs and tear gas.When former attorney general Ramsey Clark testifies, away from the jury, that under Johnson, there were no indictments because the police started the violence, the judge refuses to let the jury hear his testimony.In the end, the men (including the attorneys) had racked up hundreds of contempt citations and the defendants were found guilty not of conspiracy, but of inciting a riot. As Ramsey Clark left the courtroom, he advised Kuntsler to ""Get started on your appeal"" - and as expected, all convictions were reversed, and the judge's career was over.As for the seven, Tom Hayden became a seven-term Senator; Hoffman committed suicide some years later, Bobby Seale (actually the 8th defendant) is still going strong, as is Rennie Davis; Dellinger, a writer, was actually arrested again in 1996 for doing a sit-in with Abby Hoffman's son; Hoffman himself committed suicide in 1989; Froines taught at university; Rubin invested in Apple but was killed in a car accident in 1994; Wiener went on to work for B'nai B'rith and to this day wants to bring down capitalism.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an excellent watch, and also interesting to read about.The ending of the film, with Tom Hayden's statement and the reaction of the federal prosecutor Schultz - very powerful and to be missed."
70,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is an astonishingly gripping true story drama that's emotional, powerful and distressingly relevant to current world events. Sacha Baron Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt all give incredible performances. Michael Keaton, John Carroll Lynch, Alex Sharp, Ben Shenkman and Frank Langella are all great. Aaron Sorkin's direction is excellent with some of his best writing that's reliably smart and witty. It's also superbly edited, expertly paced and extremely well filmed. The music by Daniel Pemberton is fantastic."
71,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1968, at the height of the Civil Rights movement and as opposition to the Vietnam war grew, Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), leader of a group of student activists, announced a plan to lead a protest, that would culminate outside the Democratic National Convention, which led to the arrests of the 'Yippie' leaders Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) and their subsequent trial, on charges of conspiracy to incite violence. With assurances of a DA promotion, Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leads the prosecution, against his inner leanings, whilst a defense, mounted by communist advocate David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) and lawyer William Kuntsler (Mark Rylance), works their corner, as blatantly biased Judge Hoffman (Frank Langella) denies a lawyer to roped in Black Panther member Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.)The movie world of the last few years has been ripe with social justice dramas, seeking to juxtapose today's activism with significant milestones of the struggle from years gone past, such as this sprawling, all star yarn from writer/director Aaron Sorkin. With the flimsiest excuse of a charge, and hard won rights from years gone past blatantly denied to someone they couldn't even prove had anything to do with it, this seemed a blatant case of people in the stand for what they represent, rather than what they are alleged to have done, in a year which saw CRM leader Martin Luther King assassinated (and on this side of the pond, Conservative politician Enoch Powell deliver his 'Rivers of Blood' speech. )Sorkin has certainly gone all out, hiring a veritable who's who of cool modern talent, headlined by British heavyweight Redmayne, delivering an impassioned, committed performance, with a fine American accent, and in good company (though at ideological odds with in the film) fellow British actor Baron-Cohen, suitably in the closest thing the film has to comic relief as the wise-cracking Hoffman. Whilst not the most naturally dramatic actor, with this and his other Netflix offering from last year, The Spy, he's certainly developing his range well. There's more dynamic support from the likes of Gordon-Levitt as the ideologically conflicted prosecutor, and older heads like Carroll Lynch as the moralistic activist dedicated to pacifism, and even comeback kid Michael Keaton popping up in a significant minor role.While the pace does sag at times, and it can sometimes feel not quite as dynamic as it could be, it's still a riveting and highly rewarding dramatization of an event that marked a year marked in history as a massive cultural turning point. ****"
72,"The American dream is just that, or possibly just a nightmare for many. Although this film is quite a sanitised view of the turmoil and optimism that engulfed America in the late 60's, the injustice is very real. As it is today, still.The main characters are charming, if a bit shallow and two dimensional. The story of blatant injustice is compelling, the time flew for me. It's certainly as good as the film version of To Kill A Mockingbird, although Gregory Peck has a lot more depth than Mark Rylance, but that's obviously down to the script. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are a pastiche of Cheech and Chong, just with bigger words and play it for laughs, most of the time, and they are funny. Eddy Redmayne is the privileged college kid with a conscience, who will obviously become another well paid cog in the machine he despises. Overall the acting is solid, just not that deep. Although Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's blatant mistreatment is conveyed by a real sense of anger, I could feel it.What did I get from this film? Confirmation that nothing has changed, that the US is still a police state, that racism and classism has always been and still is institutional. It may even be worse today with a White House so blatantly crooked and incompetent; who's last option is to stoke up division and let the federal agencies run amuck and trample basic human rights. If anything it's now unpatriotic not to support war, any war, because it's 'un American'. So in one sense the nation has regressed to the basest of attitudes.If I were a teacher I'd show this film to my class and encourage a debate about what it is to be an American. But I know there'd be a ton of parents complaining that it's un patriotic to do so.With poverty, homelessness, lack of health care and a myriad of other issues blighting this once great country and the right to 'the pursuit of happiness' being no more than a foot note and almost forgotten entirely. We now have the blatantly political rigging of the Supreme Court, the highest in the land, Judge Hoffman would fit right in.A must watch film, but it's probably too late now to fix such a broken system."
73,And in turkey when we follow and read court statements we see this kind of jugdes all the time.such a luck for us.
74,"I didn't know much about the trial before seeing this and it's a fascinating bit of history; an trial more about slapping down the youth movement than about crime, ruled over by an incompetent and prejudiced judge.There are some excellent performances, most notably Frank Langella as the judge and Sasha Baron Cohen as the embodiment of Abbie Hoffman and the always terrific Mark Rylance as Kunstler.Aaron Sorkin offers his usual sharp dialogue, dramatic flair, and intelligent but somewhat shallow philosophy. The result is very entertaining and if it doesn't make you furious at the vagaries of the U.S. justice system then I don't know what to say to you.Check it out!"
75,"I was sold on the opening scene.Ahhhh murica... Has anything actually changed?The movie is good.
The acting is good.
The judge is evil.
Makes me want to join a revolution."
76,"I love this film and special actors
Eddy and sasha and yahya and mickel and josef is fucking good"
77,"This is really Sacha Baron Cohen and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's movie. Their performances stood out most, along with a usually solid Mark Rylance. It was Sacha and Yahya's delivery which actually motivated me to research more into who they were portraying afterwards.This was a solid movie, but at the end of the day it's a 2+ hour court room drama and crash course in 1960s American politics. Court room dramas have been done better. As a non-American who lives over 15,000km from the US, American politics start to just become white noise to me these days. This film probably wasn't the best choice of escapism from 2020.That said, it's still a well-written film, which has come to be expected from Sorkin. I think his directing skills haven't quite caught up to match his writing ability though. Just felt it was missing something.It certainly succeeds in making the viewer frustrated - that judge! Just wish the whole film had matched the phenomenal intro."
78,"Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" takes to a story from the 1960's and brings us a sure bet for Best Ensemble during Award Season.
Tom Hayden played by Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne brings a droll but nuanced performance to this well scripted movie. Based on the real life story, the script brings the feeling of the era to this move. However, the final product feels less like a 60's film of the era and more like a polished dialogue heavy play. This is not to say the film doesn't have its brilliant components. Because it does. The directing is strong and the performances are captivating. This is a surefire bet for a Best Screenplay nomination at the Oscars. Overall, it feels very relevant today and it hits its a nerve throughout. Sorkin delivers again and Frank Langella shines as Julius Hoffman, the judge grow to hate from the first time we meet him. His performance brings a strong response from the audience to fully engage into this story. I can't wait to see this as a play."
79,"1968. The genesis of USA 2020 is so clearly demonstrated in this movie. Feeling entitled to bend and even break the law to keep the existing power structures in place, so well demonstrated here. I would have watched this movie a few years ago and thought ... yeah, corruption in the US, we've heard this story before. But now, even though this is 50 years ago, it seems contemporary. Because these are the issues we are seeing as they rise to the top in 2020.Great cast, gripping narrative, amazing story."
80,You can watch the situations here in iraq and you will see this movie for real.......
81,"A film based on a surreal yet true story set in a context that reflects many of the issues of today.Whilst the plot can be complicated and surprisingly fast paced at times which can make it difficult to keep up, the overall storytelling and thematic evolution provides more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.Touching upon racial tension, police brutality, political activism, and abuse of power, the film is furthermore stimulating and contemporary, yet remains accessible, comedic at times and crowd pleasing."
82,Absolutely good. One of the best film in last two years ever seen.
83,"This film is amazing, it's the 60's, and truly reflects today. Im proud to say i worked with Lee Weiner, at the Anti Defamation League. He was unassuming and brilliant, what a pleasure. This film honestly shows you what the 60's were like,and also shows us all we haven't changed all that much. Certainly not the police, who are still mercilessly cutting a swath through society with no remorse."
84,Sorkin hits it out of the park with this film. The writing and performances are outstanding. The pace of the movie is excellent as it bounces between court room and the inciting incident. Cohen and Redmayne carry the emotional weight of the movie. A high recommendation for this movie
85,"Very well executed and great acting! I basically knew nothing about this trial and its background, being Dutch and born in '81, but the story baffled me! I can't believe a judge that was so politically biased and mentally incompetent was actually allowed to stay on this trial! In my country a judge can be challenged into stepping down when there's even just a suspicion of political motives or partiality. I'm sure that was already the case back in the late 60's. How could this trial continue with this judge?? Also this story seems to be even more relevant in present-day America!"
86,"Throughly enjoyably as someone from a different country, I'd like to say different time, but I'm not so sure. Jeremy Strong as Rubin actually stole the show for me, he needs to be given better roles, nice to see Sacha Baron Cohen showing his acting in a serious role as well"
87,"""This is the Academy Awards of protests and as far as I'm concerned it's an honor just to be nominated.""Let's get one thing straight. Whether it's writing or directing, it might just be impossible for Aaron Sorkin to make anything but a good movie. And The Trial of the Chicago 7 is no exception. The story follows seven people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. And since I'm in Chicago right now, everyone is freaking out about this movie. Since I'm at film school, this is all my professors are talking about whether they loved it or hated it. Personally, I can't see how anyone could really hate this movie. It's well made and such a crowd please. The way I would describe it is Green Book, just without all the controversy. The reception and reviews are very similar. Probably the only controversy is that it is not 100% historically correct. But that isn't what the movie is going for. Aaron Sorkin has been accused of this a few times, especially with The Social Network. However, the dialogue and storytelling is where the movie shines. The dialogue is very clever in the way it creates emotion. The story only enhances from that. I wanted to yell at the screen so many times from frustration. What made it worse-or rather better-is how relevant it is to the world today. It couldn't have been released at a better time. Coincidentally, the situation is similar with Da 5 Bloods in how it was released around the time of the George Floyd events. What helps in the favor of The Trial of the Chicago 7 is it doesn't take sides politically in the story. At least not in the sense that it chooses a political party.This is the ensemble of the year. The cast is stacked so high it couldn't get any better. Like this year's One Night in Miami, you can't pick a best actor. They all do well equally. Since they all have about the same amount of screen time with their own stories, you can connect with each and every one, the protagonists that is. Come awards season, the problem will be where to nominate them. I can tell you now there is a small chance anyone will be put in a lead category. The supporting category is probably the only place anyone will go. And the thing is it may only be one person getting nominated. The odds, and my personal pick, are in the favor of Mark Rylance. He plays the attorney. As an attorney you already know he's going to have some great argumentative dialogue. Plus he's the only one that you can't really get mad at at any point in my opinion. But Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Strong, and Frank Langella all do just as amazing. I won't break down every character because I'd rather you go watch the movie on Netflix yourself to see.As I mentioned before, this is an absolute crowd pleaser. Aaron Sorkin's writing is the shining jewel of it all. It's his directing that might be the cause of problem for this. I really liked his direction, but sometimes he goes for the classic route of making everyone happy. The movie follows certain beats that aren't necessarily bad, but it's a way to manipulate viewers in how they should feel regardless of their opinions. Another source of that is Daniel Pemberton's score. The score has been the main source of everyone's problem it seems. I wouldn't consider it bad but it's there to tell you how you should feel. There isn't much range to feel anything different than you're told. I don't think I would have felt much different if the direction or score were different. But those aspects don't make this any less of a great movie than it is. I would urge anyone to watch this. It showcases good cinema and will engage anyone who watches."
88,"Wasn't expecting that, at all. This movie start to somewhere you never expect to be that intense.Great great performance, genius storytelling. All i can say that last hoffman scene was the reason it deserve 9 not 8 rating."
89,Epic 2 hours of a courtroom over a period of months.
90,"I'm not an expert on American history so I can't talk about the movie's historical accuracy, but apart from that I think it was amazing. Great direction and storytelling. The flow was smooth throughout and without any slow moments. There were some great standout moments, especially the climax. There isn't one actor I felt I could complain about. All the Oscar buzz is well deserved and I won't be surprised if they won for Screenplay or Acting."
91,"This was an excellent courtroom drama. It angered me and inspired me at the same time. I dread seeing the corruption and evil perpetuated by our own system and authorities and to see that something from the late 60's is still prevalent now is very disheartening.
I am inspired though. I would like to continue learning more about politics and reading and becoming an activist. I really want to make a positive change in the world. As of now, this one is sitting at my number 1 movie of the year.I think it's excellent but the only fault I would say it has is that it slightly comes off as Oscar bait or as a typical historical drama, almost commercialized and pushed out. But, the story is an excellent and relevant one that kept me interested the whole time and really showed how excellent writing is. Also, I adore movies that combine unlikely and different groups or types of people and put them in one room together. I also love when movies cover social issues like racial injustice or political activism.11/12This was an excellent courtroom drama. It angered me and inspired me at the same time.

92,"And an All Star cast, how do you get all this talent in one place."
93,"Based on true events, this movie tells the story of a gross miscarriage of justice when 8 men are put on trial for inciting a riot in Chicago during a Democratic convention in the city. It is a shamelessly politically motivated affair, appallingly mishandled by an unashamedly partisan judge, and so obviously due to be overturned on appeal that none of the defendants ever seem to be seriously concerned at the possibility of 10 years in jail. Hell, one of the defendants (the only black man among them) is denied legal counsel throughout. Much like BlacKkKlansman, it is disturbing that dramas based on historical events like these can still seem so relevant in America in 2020."
94,A very well film that should win a lot of awards. Fills a void in the current status of cinematic thirst by taking you on a time machine ride to an event that is relevant today
95,One of the best courtroom dramas I have see. Great cast too. I have nothing to add without giving spoilers. You need to watch it.
96,I did enjoy this film and the way the story was put together was clever. It did not lack funny moments and a very good performance by both Eddie redmayn and Sacha Baron Cohen.
97,"There have been cases in human history where we have shown how magnificent we are .
At the same time as always there are these others creatures, but they are irrelevant .
One thing I can't understand, how after such events and testimonies of human greatness we still divide on black and whites.
If this event failed to reconcile us I belive this film will ."
98,Aaron Sorkin has yet another time produced the best movie of this year with profound cast and admonible screenplay.
99,4.5 out of 5 stars.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a really good historical drama film that follows several people who were trying to peacefully protest to end the war. It turns sideways when police brutality interferes and escalates further with leaving many protestors injured.The film spends majority of the screen time in a courtroom going back and forth with the group defending while the other trying to put them away. Such a powerful drama film. And if it was not for Aaron Sorkins fast moving script that keeps your attention glued with the subject such as police beatings. A person's constitutional rights. And racial prejudice. Also a movie that is relatable to what is going on now with the political stance.The cast ensemble is great. Every delivered with a powerful performance. Eddie Redmayne. Sasha Baron Cohen. Joseph Gordon Levitt. Mark Rylance. And so many others did a great job with there characters.The film does flash back to some brief events with the protesting that turned out brutal. Such as when protestors went charging up the hill towards the police. Or at a protesting event when a character witness another being beaten by the police.Aaron Sorkins sharp direction made this 2 hours and 10 mins drama went by quick with keeping you on the edge. Trying to see how it would all play out when the judge was already leaning away towards the group. Definitely worth checking out if your into realistic historical drama films.
100,"I fully loved that, I was hooked from the first minute. The judge played his role well because I hated him so much, he was so annoying. I can't believe people let the judge get away with it. I wasn't familiar with the story before the film but I did some research after and it seemed to be more or less dead on. I was very happy and pleased with the acting in The film, wasn't a single bad actor in the entire film."
101,"I was curious about The Trial of the Chicago 7 due to the cast and trailer. Paramount was going to release it theatrically but Netflix purchased it due to COVID. Chicago 7 is good as expected.The acting was good including Michael Keaton who was barely in it. People feel Sacha Baron Cohen stole the show but I feel Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stole the show. I think the characters have enough depth.I wasn't famaliar with the Chicago 7 but I was invested from the first frame due to the great writing and directing. Aaron Sorkin easily lets the audience know why the protesters are protesting the Vietnam War. The film is briskly paced mainly the first half in fact a few plot elements are rushed.Chicago 7 is a good legal drama but it's not for everyone since it's rated R. If you have Netflix, you might as well watch it."
102,"Excellent cast, brilliant story and Frank Langela what a turn.Scary that this happened in 1968 but could still probably happen now. Justice, but not necessarily for all"
103,"There's great acting here and some of the courtroom scenes are terrific. But Sorkin plays with the facts and lays it on so thick. Not bad, but not very good, either."
104,"I watched the movie yesterday in an open air cinema in Athens. I was amazed by this trial drama. Not knowing a lot about 68 in Chicago and the US it was a dense movie on the political volatility of values, society and lawmakers and judges. I reminds us all how important it is to have excellent and independent judges, lawmakers and courageous citizens to challenge the government"
105,My criticism for this movie is that it's too short. I could easily have watched another hour of it but I guess I'm just gonna go and read all I can about the real events and learn more.
106,"It is life changing to realize that our country is little changed from the late 60's. In 1968 I was a sophomore in high school. Both my parents (up in Ohio) were Republicans My small town was white upper middle class. So what did I know about protesting? Black Panthers? Yippies? Anti war? SDS. Nothing. My views were formed by my background and social norms in my town, the Presbyterian church and a Marine father. So pretty much what I thought about the Chicago Seven was formed by superficial understanding. I never questioned anything. All of this was framed in threatening terms.
Then came college, and my mind started absorbing ideas more and understanding them in terms of civil rights, anti war sentiments etc. And my conservative views gradually changed.
This movie is fantastic. I don't know if all the details are correct. It doesn't matter. I do know that this is wonderful history for me, putting a hodge podge of old memories into modern context. We still struggle with women's rights, civil rights, respect for groups that are not WASP. Scary to think the past 3 years puts us back to, what Abbie Hoffman calls, the 50's."
107,"I had been looking forward to watching this for the best part of a week and I can for sure say that I was not disappointed.I usually don't really like crime/courtroom dramas, but this film just blew me away. It was so beautiful told, the the cinematography was amazing and really showed the tension of the situation, and the storyline was beautifully executed, showing all its depth and complexity, all the while being clear to understand. On top of this you get an A-list cast supporting the story with amazing, well-realised characters.The only thing I have to say is that this film is a little intense at times and can be quite uncomfortable, and sometimes the slightly abrupt editing can make the storyline a touch confusing, but that also purposefully adds to the overall effect.Highly recommend to anyone and everyone, particularly fans of movies like Argo.
I will be genuinely surprised if this film doesn't win an Oscar.-Sasha"
108,"Aaron Sorkin does it again. A gripping, moving and brutal account of the trial of the Chicago seven. Some fantastic performances be Eddie Redmayne, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Sacha Baron Cohen and Frank Langella. This movie deserved a cinema release."
109,"Very well made film, despite the fact I've never heard about this it was an amazing story to watch, cast were incredible!"
110,"This great movie has one profound message for the people in USA, but also for the people outside of the USA - especially those who see USA as a boogieman nation: The USA had been in a constant state of stall since the 60's, and proof to that is everything that had been the pinnacle of news coming from USA in the previous two years. The people, the ordinary humans just like you and me, were so suppressed and enslaved by the domestic moguls of all kinds, be it political, economical or other, that they needed over 50 years and the explosive advancement in technology, internet and social media to get back from zero to the moment in history where people who wanted to peacefully show their numbers gathered over ideas of equality, peace and value of human life - were painted as demons of violence, sin and malice by the same ones who profited of war, death, division, racism and inequality by the tools that invest power to maim, gas, beat up and imprison anyone thinking otherwise or proposing that religion, skin color, nation, origin or beliefs are freedom of choice and not a scratch on a scale of one's value of life or level of allowed freedom to pursue happiness.This movie was released in the right time, condensing and interpreting real-life events that are horribly similar to what people, humans, are going trough now in the USA... I stand corrected - what people in the USA, and worldwide, are going trough for more than half a century in reverse, and are just now having recuperated strength and having ways to again ask for freedom and be allowed the value of life.I am not optimistic that we, as a human species, can move forward before couple of more cycles like these and more suffering and failing to see each other as equal human beings, but it gives hope. The idea of society of equality is far from dead, it is only dormant at times, but while it is sleeping under a boot - it never dies."
111,"My Review - The Trial of the Chicago 7 . Streaming on NetflixMy Rating 10/10
I have to give this fine movie the highest score as the Actors are superb, the Script by Aaron Sorkin is excellent . Aaron Sorkin also Directed this movie and its too good a movie not to have a wide Cinema release surely it must be a contender for many Academy Awards next year.
The story was new to me and is a true account of the 7 men on trial facing various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.
What was intended to be a peaceful protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention turned into a violent clash with police and the National Guard. The organizers of the protest including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Bobby Seale were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot and the trial that followed was one of the most notorious in history.
The release of this film at this time in America's history can't be an accident with the protests and violence resulting from The Black Lives Matter movement and the general turmoil we see on every news coverage in every State Republican or Democrat in the U.S.A.
Aaron Sorkin 's script has frightening parallels today with the historical events depicted in this film that took place over 50 years ago.
In fact as regards to the film's timely subject matter in 2020, Aaron Sorkin described the film as being more about modern day than the 1960's. He explained that, ""The script didn't change to mirror the times. The times changed to mirror the script.""
Whatever the result of the next American Presidential Election it's obvious that anger in a country that uses its Second Amendment Constitutional right to carry guns which was ratified in 1791 is lethal and dangerous. In the current Political climate where even talk of possible Civil War is included in conversations a law passed 230 years ago can't be appropriate in today's world of terrorism and violence.
The fact that neither Presidential Candidate has mentioned repealing or addressing the gun laws issue for fear of voter backlash is reprehensible.
No spoilers from me about the outcome of this story except to praise the actors starting with Eddie Redmayne giving the finest performance I've seen him in since his Academy Award winning role in The Theory of Everything 2014 and The Danish Girl 2015 I was beginning to think he'd lost his acting mojo with his recent films ,especially Fantastic Beasts which I disliked .
In this film he plays political activist Tom Hayden all I knew about Tom Hayden was that he was once was married to Jane Fonda and became a Senator but that happened after the trial.
Eddie Redmayne perfected a perfect American accent for this role and his body language and appearance belies his 38 years ,he looks 20 years younger.
There are many other great performance in this film including veteran Frank Langella as the inept and prejudiced Judge Julius Hoffman . I saw Frank Langella on stage in London cast as President Richard Nixon in Frost Nixon and he was mesmerising.
Nixon had just been elected President at the time of this story which and the judicial system in America never ceases to amaze me it's as odd as their voting system.
The other stand out acting performance in this movie is from Sacha Baron Cohen as off beat hippy political protester on trial with Hayden .He has some of the best scenes in the movie . Mark Rylance as William Kunstler the defence attorney of the 7 is also impressive as are the rest of this fine ensemble cast.
I read that Steven Spielberg was originally attached to direct, he was planning on meeting with Heath Ledger to discuss the role of Tom Hayden. Ledger passed away the day before he was scheduled to meet with Spielberg. Spielberg also wanted Will Smith to play Bobby Seale.
The Production was difficult to finance Amblin Partners initially shut the film down during pre-production due to budget concerns, but Paramount Pictures joined the project with Cross Creek to co-produce & co-finance the film.
It's rare today for me to find every aspect of a movie exceptional but it's a great pleasure when it happens in my opinion The Trial of the Chicago Seven joins a small group of films that successfully exposes injustice and corruption some others are Frost Nixon, Spotlight The Manchurian Candidate ,Vice, The Normal Heart, Apocalypse Now and the list goes on and no doubt more will be made about our time in history today.
I think this is a very important film and can't recommend it highly enough."
112,"Loved it, tears at the end.
Terrible judge, at least justice is served at the end.
It shows how corrupt the US Government was even in the 1960s.
Not that that was when it begin, you would have to look at least 50 years prior when Woodrow Wilson sold the USA to the Fed and bankrupted the USA in only 20 years."
113,"What a great movie. I cried, I laughed, I learnt. Thank you."
114,Best movie this year by far! Great actiuni and a great history lesson.
115,"This movies proves that the USA is one of the most disgusting places to live on the planet! If you think anything has changed with that garbage country since this happened, you're seriously delusional!"
116,"History begins here, at least for myself. I recently visited Southeast Asia simply to look at the last chapter of the Novel about the war in Vietnam 52 years after the Chicago Convention. Judge for yourself, no hypotheticals allowed, about the wast of this war. This movie is as right today as the trial was then.
Want another jolt from the past see Best of Enemies: Buckley v. Vidal. (2015). This time its to see the root of todays word warrior television format that passes for journalism. Peace."
117,"I wonder how many powerful actors and they performances will ruin the story or sideline others, but each of them stands with heartfelt performances, bringing all the characters together makes it worth to watch,"
118,"I had no prior knowledge of this film - hadn't heard of it before but thought it looked interesting when searching for something to watch and it popped up on Netflix. Absolutely fantastic! Both my husband, and I (along with my son) all thought it was an excellently made film - with a star cast (did keep having to check it was Eddie Redmayne with an American accent - it was him with very good accent!)). Thoroughly recommended if you are interested in either true stories and/or 60s American history."
119,"The whole world should be watching this. This is still happening, the unfairness of the system hasn't gone away, and we need to recognize this as the important political masterpiece that it is! The whole world is watching."
120,Eddie is amazing actor. Guys you shuld see the movie. Its best movie in 2020. Thanks Netflix for amazing movie.
121,"Give me a moment friend.... I've never been on trial for my thoughts beforeSic. 1984 , animal farmSo many high brow actors from television and tv, in a classy court room drama tget, regardless of your nationality or politics, is well worth two hours of your time"
122,"I only put this on to pass the time... Within the first 5 minutes I said to my wife ""I'm going to like this""... This is probably the first film since wolf of Wall Street that I've said wow after it ended and wanted the experience it for the first time again...It has the perfect blend of protest and truth without being patronising...Also watch the credits... The song is beautiful...First 10/10 in 2020..."
123,"I loved this movie!I was 12-years old during the trial -- albeit in a political family -- so was only vaguely aware of the players, or the outcome. My impression until now was that the seven were somehow wrong, if not technically guilty of crimes. And I knew that Judge Hoffman was irascible. And that the Chicago PD / Mayor Daley were somehow complicit in the riots. But that was it. The media at the time, and my somewhat conservative family, must have colored the events -- e.g. nasty, messy hippies up to no good. I certainly did not know the AG John Mitchell, Nixon or Ramsay Clark background. The use of the DOJ as a political tool.Also surprising: the fractiousness of he left. The Black Panthers, the SDS, and the Yippies all at odds.As for the movie itself: great performances by Eddie Redmayne and Sasha Baron Cohen (who I did not even recognize) and the rest of the cast. The story moved along quickly. Good use of archival footage from the TV networks. Great dialog, though could be a little too ""perfect"" at times, always with the brilliant comeback or quip. But no matter. Kept me glued to the screen.And above all, so, so very relevant given today's trend toward right-wing authoritarianism. It has motivated me to delve into the Port Huron statement and leftist politics of the 1960s. And what we can do to get back on track today."
124,The scprit and the directing is just wow! This is a must-watch indeed.
125,"This movie is about REVOLUTION. We need all kinds of people to fight the REVOLUTION. The smart ones, crazy ones, leaders, followers & most impt ""loyal"". Plus not getting lost in the journey of what our goal is! Together we can achieve things we otherwise cant. The release of the movie couldnt be any better as it coincided with the #BLM moment. The effed up things the govt does without any recuperation. Every generation has an important fight to fight for. The way they behave decides the course of the next generation. The movie encompasses your attention till the very end. Sorkin did a good job directing. Sacho Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong as cast. The acting is good."
126,This is the real movie they show us what was going in usa please see this i think chicago is the best movie of 2020And reymond is greeeeeeeeaaaat
127,"I saw Sorkin's Broadway adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird in June of 2019. That brilliance appears again in The Trial Of The Chicago 7. If you're trying to decide whether to watch this movie or not, your politics will answer the question for you. It's a great watch of the fight for justice and truth 50 years ago. And it's a commentary of how those evil forces are still grasping for our freedoms."
128,Entire world should watch this! Had no expectations when i started to watch it and it really surprised me! Goes on my top 10 movies!
129,"Well casted and the idea went through smoothly, specially at this time, right before an election. You can tell who are the good guys here even if their methods were not the right ones. But they got the point across.
Soooo Recommended!!"
130,Once again Aaron Sorkin blows it out of the park. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Great storytelling. Captivating. I'll definitely be watching it again.
131,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a courtroom drama about the 7 people who were accused of inciting riots back in 1968 in Chicago.Staged in the backdrop of social unrest caused by the Vietnam war, the film shows how this diverse group of activists face trial for their role in bringing about confrontations between protesters in police around the Democratic National Convention.We get to watch the escalation of the protests that ultimately turned into a riot via a series of flashbacks, making the movie into a powerful drama that doesn't end in the courtroom - although Sorkin is a master at writing for that setting.This film has one of the strongest ensembles I've seen recently.From Succession's Jeremy Strong role as co-Yuppie leader Jerry Rubin to the more palatable activist Tom Hayden played by Eddie Redmayne, all the way to the brilliantly ironic Abbie Hoffman character of Sacha Baron Cohen or Frank Langella's delusional judge, it's very hard to single out a performance.That's part of the beauty of the film.There are actors as well-known as Michael Keaton with a 5-minute screentime. Or others, like The GetDown's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who are incredibly poignant despite appearing for only half of the movie.Mark Rylance's role as the defence attorney, for example, seems to embody the audience's reaction, as he gets more and more frustrated by the developments in the trials as the movie progresses.I could be here all day. But what makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 so enjoyable is how all of these characters feed on one another.Also, in spite of years writing and producing WestWing, he only took upon the director's chair for the first time in 2017's Molly's Game, which didn't exactly wow-ed audiences.Yet, in The Trial of The Chicago 7, Sorkin translates his boldness in writing very well into the structure of the film.The film couldn't have been better constructed, as at the same time the tension rises within the courtroom, the audience also gets to see in sequence the events that led to the riots in Chicago, shown by very timely flashbacks.
Lastly, It's hard to think of a better time to watch a film about a true story of political activists who stand trial for their role in social unrest.As the divide in the United States grows deeper and the presidential election date os closer by the day, The Trial of the Chicago 7 makes for a perfect watch.All in all, this movie works so well because it is a very lively courtroom drama with ever-rising tension, that still manages to slip a few comedy moments into the cracks.Also thanks to an incredible cast - can't stress this enough - who becomes even better when put together.Sorkin pulled off a very entertaining movie, perfectly constructed which is sure to make audiences want to dive further in the social upheaval of the 60's.I would be surprised if The Trial of the Chicago 7 is not in this year's award discussion. It's certainly one of the best I've seen in 2020""The whole world is watching!"""
132,"Whether you're talking about The Social Network, Moneyball, or Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin has written some of my very favourite films over the last decade. For that reason alone I was obviously excited for whatever his next effort would be. After working on the screenplay with the assistance of Steven Spielberg, loosely over the last 14 years or so, The Trial of the Chicago 7 has finally seen the light of day. In a year that has had its best releases go straight to streaming, we now have another, and not just that, but it's also the must-see movie of the year now, at least in my opinion. Here's why, when awards season kicks in next year, I believe you'll be hearing a lot about this one.Truthfully, I didn't have a lot of knowledge of this true story prior to watching the film, so the cultural relevance was quite a shock to me. In the year of 1968, seven people stand trial for various reasons, all surrounding the riots that took place in Chigaco. With many allegories that relate to today's day, there are moments in this film that will have you scratching your head as to why we haven't exactly come further as a society since these events. More than anything, the mission of this film is both to make an exciting film, while also giving as much insight and information about this trial as possible. In that way, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a modern-day masterpiece when you're talking about courtroom dramas.Now, this may be the one area that I'm a little biased in, so maybe take this portion with a grain of salt, but I have to admit that the true star of this film is Aaron Sorkin. As both writer and director this time, his endless, quippy and clever dialogue never misses a beat here. Just when you think something about the story is going to lose your interest, the dialogue speeds up, catches your attention once again and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This screenplay takes all the tropes you've come to know about courtroom dramas and puts a very energetic spin on it. With the addition of very fluid editing by Alan Baumgarten, there wasn't a single boring moment.From Eddie Redmayne to Frank Langella, this cast is absolutely stacked. Joseph Gordon-Levitt steals the show on multiple occasions, due to his very committed line delivery, and the addition of Sacha Baron Cohen and Michael Keaton made the film that much better as well. It really came down to the stellar performance by Mark Rylance for me though. His persona is pretty much everyone watching the film itself. He's the voice of reason on many occasions, even though he too has some outbursts. This performance, along with nearly everyone else, is absolutely Oscar-worthy. This film is simply littered with talent across the board, on and off-screen.Overall, watch The Trial of the Chicago 7 was an enormous breath of fresh air for 2020 in terms of cinema. Sure, theatres aren't exactly how they used to be right now, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate the pieces of entertainment that we're still getting in other ways. This is easily one of the very best films of 2020 and probably would've still been with or without many other films being delayed. The screenplay is the true star of this film, but the subject matter is also incredibly timely and Sorkin has made his best director effort yet. I was glued to the screen from start to finish and I simply can't recommend this one enough. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a fantastic piece of cinema through and through."
133,You can tell from the first few shots that this movie is incredibly made. The dialogue is fantastic! It takes time to make you understand the entire cast of defendants yet also leaves time to develop them each in important ways.
134,"To begin with I have to say that I did not know about this trial before watching the movie. So at first I felt a bit lost with all these characters and their introduction into the story which didn't take much time. Instead they rushed it till the actual trial take place.But from this moment on I knew the characters standpoints and I could easily follow the story. Well 'easy' seems like the wrong term, because I felt so much anger and frustration. Every actor did an outstanding perfomance, especially Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, so that I could feel their emotions that they are going through. It was really moving!"
135,"I had never heard of this film before watching it, we had clicked on play something and this started. Within 2
Mins we knew we were watching the film.Well acted and directed; Sacha Cohen Baron shone in this film and was the highlight. JGL was also good.This film was one of those where you watch and laugh because of the comedy of the situation but know that there were real peoples lives ruined by this circuit court."
136,"The moment when Tom Hayden stands up in the court-room and begins reading from the list of names in his hands - that moment made me want either a time machine, or for all of us to step into the street tomorrow and begin reading our lists of the atrocities our current administration has inflicted, and is inflicting on the America people, and many other people at this ugly time.
I know my longing for those kinds of actions will be unmet. We are all far too occupied nattering around on social media and keeping ourselves busy, busy, busy. I also know that the Chicago 7 would not have had their moments of power without all the women who staffed radical offices, answered the phones, made copies, filed, and and and. The movie portrayed that injustice accurately.
Before you write, ""Okay, Boomer,"" know that I'm too old to be a Boomer. I'm a furious and heart-broken old woman."
137,Just watch it for yourself and I think you will see what everyone is talking about. A famous trail that most had never heard about but yet a important one for history.
138,Didn't know what to expect when I started this movie. Glad I didn't skip it. Captured my attention and it was very well done.
139,"There are a few memorable courthouse dramas, a Few Good Men and 12 Angry Men to name only two of which. And when they are well made, much like a winning verdict they are met with thunderous applause. That much can be said for Academy Award winning writer-director Aaron Sorkin's blistering true story of the Chicago Seven, a trial which went on for nearly a year in the late 60s. And at first when Netflix's latest drama starts it hits with immediate historical speeches, and it's a slow burner. But from the moment it starts to the final credits, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a real corker. First there's the cast, and they come in high from Oscar winning Brits to American legends, the real standout is Sacha Baron-Cohen and Eddie Redmayne who are beat for beat our their performances, Eddie probably may win another Oscar for this. And Cohen thankfully gives a career best performance and you can tell he'll want to add another gold to his trophy cabinet. Second is the writing, now courthouse dramas are smart anyway, with a lot of long words, some very fast speaking and a lot of shouting especially in a filled courtroom, and thankfully Sorkin who is known for his smart writing after The Social Network and Steve Jobs, adds to the intellect in wonderful contrast. And happily his directing adds to that too, every angle, every shot and every take are as compelling as they are stylish their is no error to his directing here, it might be a slow burner but it never drags. Every aspect of this thunderous courthouse drama delivers in spades and with the epic soundtrack it's almost as if it was made by well Sorkin there's no other way to describe that, and that is the highest compliment. The Trial of the Chicago 7 is powerful, it's smart and it looks like Netflix will be heading to the Oscars with this one. And whatever it gets its well deserved. Justice is good. 4/5. A must see."
140,"A much needed cinema for the current turmoil USA is facing. Regardless of the outcome, please remember ""the whole world is watching"" your actions will determine everything."
141,"This is easily one of the best movies of the year. It's well-acted, well-shot, and well-written. It's funny, smart, and even difficult to watch at times. It has humour, heart, and a message more relevant than ever. The Oscars might be light this year with the lack of movies, but I wouldn't be surprised if this racks up a few nominations. The only thing I have issues with is some characters getting pushed off to the side or not really having much to do. But besides that, this was an eye-opening, electrifying, well-made courtroom drama that I recommend to everyone.Score: 9 out of 10
Overall: AmazingRecommended for: Fans of courtroom dramas, fans of fighting for what's right, or fans of an Avengers-like team-up fighting for what's right."
142,"Just when you think this true story can't get any worse, it does. No wonder people lose faith in the judicial system. Unbelievable. A must watch."
143,"Very powerful movie, I really hated the judge (because of a great performance by Frank Langella), Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his best. Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen are perfect. Perfect screenplay."
144,He's the best living American screenwriter. What a phenomenal performance from Sasha Baron Cohen & Eddie Redmayne. Brava!!
145,"The best movie in 2020 until now
A lot of Oscar nominations buzzers:
Best movie
Best directing for aaron sorkin
Best adapted screenplay for aaron sorkin ( winner )
Best supporting actor for mark raylnce"
146,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is intense, shocking, and EXTREMELY relevant. Aaron Sorkin's new court room drama is a very fiery portrayal of a trial that exposed a system failing its country, and proves that as always, history repeats itself. It was a very long and theatrical case, and of course, it was politically motivated. This may not be Sorkin's best script for how over the top it can be, but the film is just bursting with energy and charisma, it's hard not to like. The performances are just wonderful in particular Mark Rylance as the defenders attorney William Kunstler, who I would personally pick for a nomination this year as he was just SO GOOD. This is a film that even if it feels on the nose, still makes a great point about the issues we're still dealing with today. Corrupt politicians, police brutality, and a country that's in pain from the people it has lost, and continues to lose. This isn't a film with new ideas, or new messages, but just really excellent delivery from its performers, it's filmmakers, all in the service of a very powerful story. While I can't say it's perfect, I still REALLY enjoyed it, and I highly recommend you give it a watch. Despite it being a dramatization of the story with some Hollywood-isms and Oscar Bait tactics, it's a truthful reflection of our current reality. Which is why I'm gonna say, it's one of my favorites so far this year. 9/10."
147,"This film is realeased on Netflix today and I watched it asap because I am a fan of Sorkin. As a non American viewer, 2 things are ahead of the rest for me:1 - It gives a perspective of the American left historically;
2 - The movie puts the upcoming / ongoing American elections in context;As the movie develops, the conflict between free thinkers like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the Judge Julius Hoffman and other state administrators unfold as well. But there are intances where law abiding characters like Tom Hayden and prosecutor Richard Schultz have internal conflicts as well. What path will they choose?? Will they follow the known path and stay within the ""system"" (as Judge Hoffman calls it at the end of the movie) or will they do what is right?So this dicothomy unrevels during the rest of the movie. There is a close distinction between ""those that wear a uniform"" and those that do not. State employees are puppets who have sold their mind and soul to the ""system"" and others are free thinkers who look at things intellectually and make free choices or they dare to be unconventional.Even though this is a 2000 year old pattern, regardless of the fact that Alan Sorkin is Jewish himself (i dont know if he describes himself so), there is also the visible pattern of Jewish identity in the courtroom. Abbie Hoffman,Jerry Rubin, Lee Weiner are Jewish members of the Chicago 7. Judge Hoffman is Jewish, defense lawyers William Kunstler and Leopold Weinglass are Jewish and prosecuter Richard Shultz is Jewish as well. Once a Rabbi at a Frankfurt Synagague in Germany has talked about controversial thinking history in the Jewish Religion. It reminded me of that. And the left though and Jewish intellectuals who contributed to that.I did not know Tom Hayden was Jane Fonda's ex husband.All in all, I enjoyed the movie so much. I hope Americans vote for the progressive intellectual politicians in the upcoming elections. And they burry the clown in the office to the ground."
148,"Just great movie. It has it all. I love it. The actrors , filmography soundtrack. All"
149,"Loved it!
Thank you Aaron Sorkin for making this masterpiece, such great dialogues,
cast is great exceptionally consistent in their roles, acted well.If you want to have a great movie night in this delicate 2020, go for it. Won't regret it. Probably the best delivered in 2020 and surely deserve the academy award this year. Bravo Netflix!"
150,"I love ""Based on true events"" movies and in addition, this one is just so well made. I'm going to be watching this movie over and over. Now, this comment might make interfere with your immersion but you should know that actors performance is incredible. So much so that you will hate this one character that if you were to see this actor in real life, you'd want to punch him in the head. Hahahahaha. Just kidding, anyway, this is a really good movie. WOW!"
151,"My new fav film of 2020, so far. The factual subject matter couldn't be any more relevant to today when most American is once again experiencing a total disconnect with the government amd its actions. It teaches veluable lessons about our less than perfect system even though we might likr to believe otherwise. Great performances! Oscar bait for sure. I found myself profoundly moved at the end of the movie. It's great."
152,""" We're not going to jail because of what we did, we're going to jail because of what we are.""
Aaron Sorkin's latest directorial (his 2nd) offering 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' resuscitates the art of courtroom drama. The film was based on trial of the Chicago seven, who are wrongfully charged by the Federal Govt. with conspiracy and violent encounters, arising from the counter-cultural revolution at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
Sorkin dramatizes(perfectly) the trial but it was itself one of the most dramatic events in American history, characterized by the judge's uncloaked hatred of the defendants; star testimony from some of the era's cultural icons, including Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Jesse Jackson, and Judy Collins; and disturbing visuals, like the only Black defendant being shackled and gagged in court.
Now we all know about Sorkin that he is one of the greatest screenwriters working today..and with his 2nd film as a director he proves his worth in directing also. Sorkin is always famous for his fast paced screenplays and cutting dialogues, suited perfectly with the characters. Really have to appreciate about the cast specially Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen did a great job, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Yahya Abdul Mateen-II also acted very well...probably best ensemble cast of this year ( oh yeah we got a cameo from Michael Keaton).
What can I say, this is classic Sorkin, one of the most engaging and entertaining courtroom drama I've seen in many years,he really outperformed himself...this one is far better than his previous work on courtroom film 'A Few Good Men'.
Sorkin's film values properly the sacrifice these young men made and applauds their willingness to stand up for what's right as the world crumbled around them..and (little spoiler alert) ofc. the ending scene when Tom Hayden (Redmayne) when read the name of the American soldiers who lost their life during the Vietnam War, that was really very emotional.
A compelling recreation of the notorious trial of 1968..a film about a certain moment in history that feels relevant and timely. - ""There are great films, and there are movies 'of their moment.' Aaron Sorkin's film is a bit of both."""
153,"Great writing, wonderful Directing. A truly quality and very important film."
154,"A compelling retelling of the trial of the Chicago 7 with brilliant acting by Eddie Redmayne, Salcha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Frank Langella."
155,I feel like every beat of this movie was doing work. A fine film that will leave you wondering how our courts and justice system have become such circuses in so many instances.
156,"Trial of Chicago 7 was a very good court room drama that had a plenty of emotional and impactful moments that are trying to expose many truths and in some cases it fails but in some it wins in most unexpected ways.Cast was very talented here and i even think that some of them could even get some award nominations for this film but i honestly doubt that for some hidden reasons.The pats that most impressed me where some characters and some actors acting,buy that i mean Sacha Baron Cohen one and Yahya Abdul Mateen 2 one they were the highlight of a entire film and they give a great acts,rest of cast was also good.Trial of Chicago 7 was a very good courtroom drama"
157,"Of course it's brilliant, funny and hugely entertaining; just what you would expect when you see the name Aaron Sorkin, who this time has also directed, as well as written, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" which may not have been 'the trial of the century' but was certainly one of the most important 'political' trials ever held in America. It was, for want of a better word, a show-trial ordered by Attorney General John Mitchell to discredit the organizers of the protests held during the 1968 Democratic Convention. The trial was presided over by one, Judge Julius Hoffman who, from the moment he put his ass on the bench, was clearly on the side of the prosecution, though in view of what he had to put up with from the likes of Abbie Hoffman and others, you might even say he was provoked.This is a classy production with an all-star cast that includes a couple of Oscar-winners. They are all outstanding with Frank Langella, (the judge), Mark Rylance, (the defense attorney), and, perhaps most surprising of all, Sacha Baron Cohen, (Abbie Hoffman) walking away with the picture and if Oscars are handed out this year surely Langella has to be a front-runner. If Sorkin portrays events in a crazy and seemingly haphazzard way then I think it's safe to assume that's exactly what they were. As for the trial itself, you couldn't make this stuff up. This is a brilliantly written, directed and acted tragi-comedy about a terrible time in recent American history, though watching it you might think you are seeing newsreel shot on the streets of America only a few days ago."
158,"A movie is not a documentary. A movie 🎥 can have a message, can be based on a truth. A movie can educate . A movie can teach about our history. None of these things should be done at the cost of making a great movie . This is a film 🎞 which delivers on all fronts. The director the crew and the cast should be very proud and to all aspiring filmmakers this is how it's done. In a time where film makers are so concerned with the message in there film they forget to make a movie 🎞 worth watching. This is worth watching"
159,"Timely and relevant, it really captures your immediate attention from the first scene. I love a well paced movie from the get go and this is another great effort from Aaron Sorkin. I wasn't expecting to be as engrossed as I was in this.
A true piece of history that really gives you something to take away.I can guarantee you wont hate on a judge in a movie more than you will on this one. Shame he is based on a real life man.."
160,"Just when I thought the Judge on ""My Cousin Vinny"" was bad....this guy takes the cake."
161,"""Encompassing a large, almost sausage-party-exclusive ensemble, the film is an embarrassment of riches relative to sterling performers, besides the aforementioned Abdul-Mateen and Langella, a bodacious Cohen might get many Oscar-voters' ballots for his uncharacteristic straight-acting that is not aimed to tickle our funny bone, though he gets snappy wisecracks once a while, his A. Hoffman (categorically no blood relation to the Judge J. Hoffman) is a stoned buffoon with enough lucidity and firm determination of his noble cause; whereas Redmayne's personage is more self-righteous (but de facto the whole blood-letting donnybrook can be partially imputed to his spur-of-the-moment outrage) and he is terrific when the clincher hits, but overall the actor's disarming and aw-shucks veneer is difficult to expunge.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
162,"To be very clear, going in, I had very less expectations and zero knowledge about the trial, because I live nowhere near America or was born before 2000. But, I instantly was made known how remarkable this movie really is. I don't like online released movies or watching ""new"" movies at home because you have the liberty to be distracted and pause the movie, but for this one, I actually enjoyed the pauses. I researched about the movie's topic and also used the pauses to gasp at the utter brilliance.The script was so tight and interesting and the performances really complimented it. Every actor worked beautifully in the limited setting of a courthouse drama. You felt for each character and you felt the rage and adrenaline as well. I have to say, I normally don't like movies produced by Netflix but this was an exception. Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant director and even a more brilliant writer. I know he tried to recreate this controversial time of the 60s the best he could. I wasn't too keen on Eddie's American accent and don't know why he particularly was chosen for the role, but the lead actor here was still the courtroom. None of the 7 in the trial were given unnecessary limelight and thus premise remained crisp.The problem here, although may not be experienced in today's time but it is still too close to home. Discrimination, police brutality, criminality of legal system and the political agendas. We still see these things just they are now spread out. Apart from the standpoint of the case described in the movie, it can also be taken as the base for many other problems countries like America are facing every day. Not getting more political now.I couldn't give this movie a perfect 10 score because as I said, I don't know how much the movie was true and honest, although I read it is mostly taken verbatim from court transcripts. It is based on a true story of a time I was not born in so giving a perfect score wouldn't be justified.Cheers."
163,"""When the people shall grow weary of their constitutional right to amend their government, they shall exert their revolutionary right to dismember and overthrow that government.""
Abraham LincolnThis is a real life, one of the most infamous courtroom dramas that depicts an impetuous, corrupt and a rude judge; a conspiring attorney general - John Mitchell, the gagging of defendant Bobby Seale, founder of the Black Panther Party...
Year 1968.. Johnson's draft call to Americans for Vietnam war , King's assassination, Robert Kennedy's assassination, Hubert Humphrey's nomination at Chicago democratic convention and a peaceful march to Chicago to protest the war, to support the civil rights, movement.. the protestors were students wing, black panthers, yippies or known as the leftists, non-conformists but the protests turned into riots and the 8 were indicted on the charges of breaking Rap Brown Law and inciting the riots.. .It was not a civil trial nor a criminal but seemingly political ...
This movie may have a Hollywood twist and flavor but it is still galvanizing, gripping, compelling, superbly acted, edited and directed..a must see"
164,"THE TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY AARON SORKIN
In 1969, American Activist Fred Hampton was shot and killed in his own apartment by the Chicago Police Department. This tragic event was followed by Black Panther Party leader Bobby Seale being bound and gagged in the courtroom for taking back to Judge Julius Hoffman. What happens 51 years later? In March of 2020, a 26-year-old African-American Woman by the name of Breonna Taylor was shot and killed in her own apartment by the Louisville Police Department. This tragic event was followed by another tragic event of a 46-year-old African-American Gentleman by the name of George Floyd being restrained and eventually murdered by the Minneapolis Police Officers. What distinguishes these tragic events that are 51 years apart from each other? Has history been used to create a better future? Or has it been used to mirror the future? These are the pivotal questions that Aaron Sorkin posses with his masterful drama about the trial of seven anti-Vietnam war activists being put on trial by the federal government for conspiracy and for crossing state lines in order to incite a riot. Aaron Sorkin's masterful storytelling blurs the lines between the events that occurred in 1968 and the events that have occurred these past four months.
The film is a classic Sorkin drama. It has all the exciting ingredients that make Aaron Sorkin the most respected and loved screenwriter working today. Rapid fire, quick-witted dialogue, non-linear storytelling, repetition - all the delicious tropes that craft a compelling Sorkin drama are embodied in this film. After making an impressive debut as a director in the exciting 2017 film Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin returns as the captain of the ship and the individual behind the camera. There were moments where Sorkin's direction stood out more than the dialogue. Take the scene towards the beginning when the first day of the trial is about to begin; in a single shot, the camera fluidly moves across the front of the courtroom showcasing every member of the trial preparing themselves for the notorious events that are about to unfold in front of them. It almost felt like a moment from a play, expect rather than just solely relying on the staging and blocking of the actors, the movement and vocabulary of the camera accentuated the feeling of immersing the viewer in the rapid sensation of anticipation.
Or take the scene when Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is just terrific) gets gagged in the courtroom; there is pure silence except for the haunting sound of Seale's handcuffs and footsteps. Aaron Sorkin has truly grown as a filmmaker; his sense of staging and blocking a scene in order to be in harmony with the words he has written on the page are evolving into, just like his writing style, a rhythmic and musical style of filmmaking.
And boy does the dialogue get even more exciting as the film progresses. Lines such as, ""You can do anything to anything by taking it out of context."", reminded me of a steroidal version of ""You can't handle the truth!"". Or the line, ""If our blood is going to flow, let it flow all over the city."", is a classic representation of how, sadly, anything can be taken out of context.
The cast is tremendous. Each actor has given a remarkable performance. The standouts being Sacha Baron Coen as Abbie Hoffman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale, Mark Rylance as William Kunstler, Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden, and Frank Langella as Judge Julius Hoffman. Everyone beautifully brought life to Sorkin's stylistic writing. Each one of them brought a humanity to their character which felt authentic. Especially towards the rousing climax, which would empower any individual to consistently commit the act of respect.
The editing by Alan Baumgarten complements Sorkin's non-linear screenplay. The editing adds a wholesome feeling to the entire rhythm of the movie. The running time is sharp and clean, not a moment affects the pacing of the film.
The Trial of The Chicago 7 is a moving and haunting portrait of the frightening parallels that run between the 1960s' and 2020. It is the perfect story to be told in times like these. Aaron Sorkin's watertight screenplay and direction, the terrific performances from an incredible ensemble cast, the fast-paced and rhythmic editing, and the terrifying relevance and parallels between the events portrayed in the film and the events that have occurred in the past four months culminate to make The Trial of the Chicago 7 the most pertinent reflection of the times we are living in. The film asserts that acts of violence, corruption, discrimination, brutality, racism, and every other traumatic incident will be worked towards being prevented by the citizens of a society who believe in civility, empathy, and compassion, because the fact of the matter is - THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING..."
165,"If it wasn't for this movie, I wouldn't have known this part of the history of Chicago. I really enjoyed watching it and I will definitely watch it again."
166,"I lived through these events and even met a few of the people on trial; I met Rubin and Hoffman in an informal, impromptu rally in Washington Square Park. The difference between the New York Police and the Chicago Police was rather stark. No one was hurt; no one was harrassed. It was a peaceful rally. I talked to both individuals and Rubin struck me as a shallow lech, while Hoffman struck me as a serious social protester. I was on leave for 30 days from the Army in 1969. I was against the war; these people were against the war; so I naturally gravitated to them. Neither individual trusted me because my hair was so short; they thought I was an undercover cop or something. Despite that, we all had a good time. This film was well-directed and produced. All of the actors did. a fine job; especially Cohen, who seems to be able to do drama as well as great comedy. I think the film correctly captured the personalities of Rubin and Hoffman and the role of Hayden was outstanding as well. I never met Hayden. However, Frank Langella almost steals the film as the judge; and gives a sterling performance. Highly recommended for those of us who have forgotten about the Vietnam war and it political effect on our individual lives. Most young people go through a political metamorphosis,; they are generally liberal as youths and become more conservative as they age. But not everyone. Some people stay either liberal or conservative their entire lives. Hoffman was one of those people."
167,"This movie wakes up emotions. Tense, keeps attention. However, I feel that the whole story was not told."
168,"The writing is masterful. The way the story unfolds takes the viewer on a journey that is riveting at every step. This is notable as a large portion of the film takes place in a courtroom. The performances are brilliant with special accolades to Sacha Baron Cohen and Yaya Abdul-Mateen II. I was riveted throughout and it left me wanting more. I almost wish this had been developed as a limited series to allow for time to delve more deeply into each of these individuals stories, but it is a brilliant movie as it is."
169,"This film is more than just a movie. It tells the story of some of America's forgotten hero's that helped shape the culture revolution and helped shine light on the iron rule of the U.S. Government. In a time when all voices were expected to speak the same language these men the ""Chicago 7"" spoke loudly against the ways of the Government and the Vietnam War. They did this by getting people to vote and have their voices heard! And boy were they heard....and they are still heard.
I'm glad this movie came out when it did and there's no coincidence of it's timing and arrival. These men have seemingly been forgotten in history and this movie retells their story of strength under restraint and principle over policy.Such a great ensemble and the acting is incredible especially Sacha Baron Cohen playing Abbie Hoffman. I highly recommend this movie and would be surprised if it isn't up for an award."
170,"If it was released pro-COVID in theaters with a huge audience, there would have been a standing ovation at the end of this movie. BRAVO! this movie is fabulous
in every aspect of it acting, screenplay, direction and all of it.
it came as a total surprise, a tale which was never told and hardly knew, story revolves around a peaceful protest gone haywire due to the conflict between protesters and Chicago PD, leads to the most dramatic and historical courtroom drama ever seen.
Ensemble starring Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, John Carroll Lynch, Mark Rylance,Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more has done a great job and makes mark rylance a definite contendar for this yer's oscars.
True on it's sense with the story line, screenplay written by Oscars winner Aaron sorkin keeps you engaged through out this highly tensed 2 hour drama. At some point, you are so engaged in that courtroom that you start feeling that you are at that place.
This hard to believe, eye opening movie currently Streaming on Netflix is one of the most surprising movie of this year. in 2019, netflix came up with ""isishman"", this year they have ""The trial of the Chicago 7"". Best of this year"
171,"I had no expectations at all for this film other than it to be somewhat of a dialogue heavy history lesson from Aaron Sorkin. To be fair a lot of the film is like that with majority of the scenes taking place within the court room, however this film is extremely easy to watch due to the cast and the pacing.As soon as this film starts it pretty much doesn't stop and has a nice flow to it going forwards and backwards in time without getting, us the audience, confused. That for one definitely helps in the enjoyment of the film, lets be honest the idea of a 2 hour court room dialogue heavy drama doesn't sound exciting, thrilling or emotional on the surface. However under the surface of this film is actually a real roller coaster of a ride for your emotions and is actually very entertaining. That is also made possible due to the great cast that was assembled for this film.I will only mention a few names because there are too many to list. For me the best performance is Eddie Redmayne for the reason being I don't usually like him in films. This is the first performance for me where I now realise why people like this guy and think he is a good actor. Although an understated performance at times, I feel majority of the most important scenes and parts of dialogue run through his character. The next for me is a surprise and that is Sacha Baron Cohen. Now its a surprise to me because initially I thought he was going to stick out like a swore thumb and be incredibly annoying. However he turned out to be the exact opposite and actually someone who was very important to the story and brought great levity to the film when needed. Its not to the same level of acclaim but gives me the same feeling watching Adam Sandler in ""Uncut Gems"", a shockingly good performance from an actor you didn't know could do it. The other mentions I'll give are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mark Rylance and Frank Langella. All of whom bring their A game to the table and are brilliant to watch in some of the most heated debates during the trial.My last points I want to make are about Aaron Sorkin because to me this is the least Aaron Sorkin like script or film. He is notoriously known for being dialogue heavy and extremely detailed and although this film is, I wouldn't have known he'd written this or directed it if I didn't have prior knowledge. That sounds like a negative but to me that is actually a positive shows his flexibility and range as a storyteller and filmmaker.Overall I really enjoyed it 75% out 100 or 7.5 out 10 I would definitely recommend it to someone who hasn't heard of the story before like me. Was an interesting history lesson that unfortunately feels all to familiar in 2020. Great cast, good pace, interesting story, great writing and good directing. Yet another good film from Netflix.....Oscar worthy maybe ????"
172,"It's been a very long time since a film brought out so many emotions in 2 hours. This is how a story like this should be told, bravo."
173,"I honestly don't know where to start describing how much I loved this movie. This is To Kill The Mockingbird of the 21st century, a true masterpiece.If I can give it 100 stars, I would."
174,Baron Cohen is fantastic. This was very well done. A must watch.
175,A well paced movie from start to finish. Mixing the action from the protests to the courtroom drama. It was A Sorkin but he's dailed down the Unrealistic dialogue spoken at 200mph.Brilliant performances from everyone and you feel the frustration every step of the way. Makes me angry yet again at the abuses of power we witness on a daily basis.
176,This is the best movie I watched in 2020.I know not many movies came out this corona season but I highly recommend you to watch this movie.
177,"Pure cinematography! It needs/deserves the Oscar! A movie to watch. Good, smart humor here and there. It has all the ingredients of a good movie!"
178,The movie was really good and acting great ! I wasn't born in 1968 and knew only little information about this Trial but the movie was really informative and I started looking for more documentation on Internet. Good to remind yourself where we come from and what history is made of.
179,Pretty funny. I like the bit with the Molotov cocktail.
180,"Documenting America entertainingly, for this and future generations , because someone has to.
Respect."
181,"...that it is an absolutely amazing, incredible, fantastic movie with a touching and hopefull story."
182,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) was written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. It's a recreation (with some actual footage) of the events at the DNC in August 1968, and the trial that resulted. (The trial lasted from September 1969 to February 1970.)Sorkin has chosen a strong ensemble cast: Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden,
Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman, Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin, John Carroll Lynch as David Dellinger, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale, and
Mark Rylance as attorney William Kunstler.The historical fact is that Judge Hoffman at the trial was so prejudiced against the Chicago 7 that this aspect of the film almost could be turned into a comedy. However, these men were being tried in federal court for serious offenses. It wasn't funny then, and it isn't funny now.I'm old enough to remember that ghastly Democratic National Convention of 1968, and the horrible (mis)trial that followed. It's really important for younger people to watch this film and learn from it. History repeats itself unless we do something to stop the repetition.Trial has a very strong IMDb rating of 7.9. I thought that it was even better than that, and rated it 10."
183,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7""... beautiful movie.It shows how the American nation had been against wars since the Vietnam war and how the U.S. government kept going against the wishes of its people onto an episode after an episode of mayhem and carnage. It also shows how corrupt the justice system can be of a super power of a country. And it also shows how power rots from within if not exercised wisely.Beautiful movie."
184,"Congrats to Sorkin, Dreamworks, and everybody who had anything to do with the production of this virtuoso piece of work. All I'm gonna say is, watch this flick for an in-depth snapshot (yes, an oxymoron -- live with it) of our nation's history forming."
185,"This is by far the most compelling, moving and powerful films to be released in recent years.
It felt like an honour to watch this true story depicted by actors who smashed their roles."
186,"Agree. One of the best movies I have seen. Immediately engage the viewer, acting is fabulous, not one minute wasted, all and everything fall in their right places."
187,The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a superb movie. But I knew that even before it's release. This is a surefire Oscar hit. All the things were perfect in this movie. I didn't like Aaron Sorkin's debut movie Molly's Game much but this was really good. Waiting for his next.
188,"A near perfect, and an incredibly emotional re-telling of one of the most important trials in history"
189,"It's so interesting from the begining to the end,
The direction and the performance is excellent, actually I want to watch it again"
190,"This is a truly excellent, powerfully entertaining dramatisation of a dark moment in American history. The only people who were criminal, corrupt and unconstitutional were the judge, the police and the federal authorities, along with the local ones in Chicago. They should have been left to peacefully protest without being battered by police for the 'crime' of climbing a flagpole, in one memorable and crucial moment that I won't spoil the film by elaborating on, nor should they have been trapped, beaten and arrested by the cops in an action that would be called 'kettling' today.The courtroom scenes were a shocking and sad endorsement of the legal establishment, the corrupt judge falsely found people in contempt, denied them counsel, had then subject to the cruel and unusual punishment of being shackled and gagged, and was biased in terms of what testimony he allowed the jury to hear. Also a defendant was framed for a murder and someone else got assassinated. There literally are and were some banana republics where the 'justice' system would be more just.The trial was clearly a political trial, in the mould of ones against the Birmingham 6 and Julian Assange in the U.K., conducted by people who have nothing but contempt for the people's right of free speech, thought and assembly but hypocritically and unrealistically expect respect themselves.A must-see film!"
191,"Aaron Sorkin vuelve a hacerlo con unos diálogos intensos y con un reparto asombroso de los que se destacan Langella y Rylance. Sacha pone su punto dramatico y cómico y lo equilibra perfectamente para un excelente personaje. La película es tensa, divertida, a veces tintes de comedia que hacen de esta un retrato ficticio majistral de un hecho real que no marcó solo a EE,UU si no que fué referencia en el mundo entero.
No es un 10 por que encuantro unos problemitas en la narración en cuanto a dirección que hacen ver que Sorkin es mejor guionista que director, 9/10."
192,"Watch this movie, get a stimulation of sense of justice so that you keep quiet for another decade."
193,"Aaron Sorkin's #TheTrialOfTheChicago7 is very solid, but doesn't reach the creative heights of some of his earlier scripts like 'The Social Network'. That said, the performances by Sacha Baron Cohen & Jeremy Strong make the film well worth a look."
194,One of the better movies if not the best of the year. Well acted never dull and very topical. Highly recommend.
195,"Full marks on every front!! Sacha baron cohen is outstanding , as usual!!"
196,Razorblade dialogues and great acting form an intense but intimate setting for this brilliant movie. sidenote: its interesting to google each of the seven's individual stories after having seen the movie (not before foe obvious reasons). keep it coming Andy!
197,"In a year where movie delays have been the highlight of the show, Aaron Sorkin's timely courtroom drama, The Trial of the Chicago 7, stands tall as one of the very best pictures to debut during these troubled times. It is both a mature filmmaker's cry for justice and change in America, and an uplifting and moving story about civil rights, freedom of thought and the importance of doing the right thing.As far as Academy nominations are concerned, I fully expect this film to be in the running for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and, I would argue, Best Directing. We knew Sorkin's writing would be fantastic, but his sure-handed direction also brought something special to the material. For performances, every person on the impressive cast gave an equally impressive performance, with standouts being (in order of personal preference) Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.Finally, thanks to brilliant and snappy writing, an awesome cast and a timely and moving message, The Trial of the Chicago 7 dethrones Tenet for the top stop on my 2020 movie ranking, and I fully expect it to end up in my top 5 when January rolls around. Consider this a strong recommandation from me!"
198,One the best court room dramas to be made. The ending was excellently emotional and gave the idea of revolution through peace.
199,"A spectacular drama based on true events.
It is about the trial carried out against 7 men who were involved in riots against the police in Chicago.
Quality.
Safety pin.
Entertaining.
A wonderful all-star cast with quality performances.
The time spectacularly recreated.
Powerful.
It shows the harshness of justice for those who do not go with the ideals of the government, the power mafia, impunity, authoritarianism, lack of democracy, censorship.
How much repression can a few simple ideas provoke?
Smart and spectacular script.
And although it is a period film, it is so current and relevant to our contexts.
If you like movies with political themes, this one is going to enchant you.
A movie that Netflix took for its platform."
200,I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this film that wasn't intentionally designed to illicit a negative response. Particularly the frustrating scenes involving the judge. The time period was so tumultuous so I guess it doesn't surprise me that much that this film wasn't made earlier but I'm glad that it was. I hadn't heard anything about this movie prior to getting an email this morning from Netflix announcing its availability and watching it made my day.
201,"A great movie that takes you back to the '60s of Chicago, where the attitude for people who are standing against the government is so terrible while the courts are treating black people like animals. The movie presents us with a trial of 8 people who protested against the war of Vietnam. The defendants of the trial were trying to terminate the US involvement in the war, while the country's representatives don't like that. The acting is very stunning and reliable. A movie worth watching altogether!"
202,"This is a great film. Quite possibly the best film of 2020 or at least the best I've seen. It is riveting, engrossing, engaging, relevant and just plain film making at its best. Yes it is depicting a real event and I am sure there are many parts where legal historians, and others will find places to nit pick and say that's not accurate or why did they leave this out. It's a depiction not a documentary. The cast was excellent from an unexpected turn by Joseph Gordon Levitt as the prosecutor to the always good Mark Rylance as the modest defense attorney, to Sacha Baron Cohen in a great turn as Abbie Hoffman. Eddie Redmayne was fine as Tom Hayden but standing out for good parts were Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin, Alex Sharp as Rennie Davis and John Carol Lynch as David Dellinger. But the two best were Yahya Abdul Mateen as Bobby Seale and Frank Langella as Judge Julius Hoffman. Langella was so powerful as the sleazy joke of a judge I wanted to hand him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He just seemed to dominate in every scene he was in. Mateen also put on a powerful performance. Others were also excellent in supporting roles and Michael Keaton came on in a brief turn as former Attorney General Ramsey Clarke. This was if nothing else an actors film. But the film went beyond that and spoke to today's deeply divided America right down to the police removing badges before attacking the protestors. This was an excellent film in many ways to the writing and direction in particular with a controversial topic. It should be seen by all."
203,"Great writing great story totally brilliant ensemble cast.
So good to watch a wonderful story which was unknown to me written so well. Set in the 60's but (sadly) could easily be set in 2020.
Very relevant and a great watch."
204,"An must watch before you die. The content is good the acting everything in this movie is worth watching, nice acting by Eddie Redmayne and sacha baron Cohen"
205,"To say that it is another excellent Netflix production is raining in the wet, a current and true theme portrayed in an intelligent, light way and with doses of humor and sarcasm, very good ... Passionate, how not to revolt with absurd racism, and if to be moved, admired by the struggle and courage of the few... Adorable ..."
206,"The Trial of the Chicago 7, extends the red CSI string between the very real threats to our constitutional rights perpetrated by the president and his attorney general in 1968 to the current criminality of Trump and Bill Barr.
Unmentioned, but very present, is the one degree of separation between J. Edgar Hoover's FBI with its secret police thuggery and Trump - namely, Roy Cohn. Mr Cohn, personal friend of Hoover, lawyer for notorious Communist persecutor, Joe McCarthy and later, mentor to young Donald Trump.
Amazing what corruption crawls out when you start turning over rocks."
207,"Legality isn't indication of morality. Great movie that shows how authorities try to blemish anyone that they deem to be ""enemy""."
208,"Fantastic Art Direction, Performance.
It's 100% Oscar Movie!!!Cheers!!"
209,"Extremely relevant, brilliantly executed and powerful; Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"" is
one of the best films of the year and could not have been released at a more perfect time.In this courtroom drama, the Chicago Seven, a group of anti-Vietnam war protestors are charged with conspiracy, rioting and crossing state lines all surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Based on the true story.Sorkin always has a way with conversations between actors. That's the beauty of his screenwriting; you just can't wait to hear what the character says next. In ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"", writer/director Aaron Sorkin grippingly dramatizes this true story with class, facts and always staying grounded. The cast is sensational and probably the best ensemble you will see this year. Having to showcase your talent in front of all these great names with a script from Sorkin must be a field day. Special mentions go out to Sacha Baron Cohen who's brilliant portrayal of Abbie Hoffman steals the show (I smell awards). I'd also like single out Jeremy Strong's incredible and wholesome performance and that of Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who embodies Bobby Seale and is terrific. There is no doubt that this film will be a top contender during awards season, and in all honesty it should be. ""The Trail Of The Chicago 7"" is moving, eye-opening and funny at times but what it really is, is the movie everyone needs to see and the one we all need right now.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
210,"If you're against progressive politics you'll likely not find much uplifting or entertaining about this movie.But for everyone else this film is a shockingly gripping 2 hours of political and personal drama that superbly showcases the foolishness of some, the intellect of others, and the general complexity of war, politics, race, and humanity.Highly recommended if you want to watch a movie that also gives you an excuse do go down the Wikipedia rabbit hole."
211,"Some very good acting of Joseph Levitt, Eddie redmane, sasha baron cohen and michael keaton. The story is set a very interesting way. You really begin to know the main characters when the story develops... "" i have never been on trial for my thoughts before"" ... wow..
And the end... so strong.. and it shows what is all about...."
212,"Great storytelling that doesn't make you feel tired throughout the 2 hours. It talks about politics, but not in a very political way. It's funny, interesting and engaging. You won't regret watching it."
213,Before I watched this movie I didn't know anything about this topic but after finishing it I thought it was an excellent movie with amazing performances from all of the cast members and I definitely recommend.
214,"Aaron Sorkin is a sort of genius, a word I almost never use when describing the products Hollywood delivers. The fact that he took a months-long show trial and spun it into probably the best film of 2020 is evidence of his talent as a writer and filmmaker.The greatest trademark of a great director is getting great performances from the actors, something this films delivers in every role.Most of them even looked like the people they were portraying.The events from back then are so completely analogous to our times. The left is a mess and has no direction, not knowing who the enemy really is and often doing more harm than good. What were they doing protesting the Democratic convention and not the Republicans? I never understood that ever since I was a child. It's just like the WTO riots in Seattle or the BLM crew today. Who are they fighting against? They just make it easier for the propaganda (something not fully in motion back during this trial) machine to demonize anyone left of fascism.The big differences between now and then is that the Right is more concentrated and sends out a laser beam of (mostly) lies directly into the brains of the nincompoops who vote completely against their own interests. Liberals today are a larger part of the public, but completely directionless, or so it seems. How else could you explain that Biden is the candidate in this election which could have been a total lay-up for any decent Democrat (under retirement age)? And forget about 2016 and Hilary."
215,2 hours and 10 minutes yet not a single moment of being bored . Bravo . Amazing acting from each member of the cast . This movie needs to be seen ! And the ending gives me GOOSEBUMPS all over me . Definitely the best movie of 2020
216,"Every time I am reminded of some of the worst examples of the so called justice system
What pigs and what a great example of what the world really must rid itself of"
217,"The script is just marvelous. Even though I live nowhere near the United States, I felt the drama."
218,"Great writing, great story, great cast, and great acting. It is a crowd-pleaser for sure, and it is extremely relevant in 2020. A couple downsides to this movie is that there is nothing extraordinary about the cinematography and it also feels a little biased/propogandaish at some times. However, I do think it poses some great questions for the audience to think about and makes some great points in the issue of police violence. I can definitely see this movie being a Best Pic nominee, and I think it's a great addition to Sorkin's resume."
219,"I had never heard of the Chicago 7 trial before, but this was a brilliant movie, gripping and superb performances from all actors involved."
220,"Very shocking film that shows how vulnerable western democracy is when the judiciary, executive and legislative branches are occupied by power-obsessed people. Fortunately, there are selfless people who manage to move the masses so that justice prevails. And this film shows this in an impressive way with a perfect cast."
221,"God bless their souls, a lot of people believe, demonstrated, fought, and changed!
Thank you for the great movie with the such sad, mind blowing facts about our history! But unfortunately corruption, manipulating and accusing still till this day!
God bless the United States of America ""We the people"""
222,"This is an amazing court room drama, every actor is Top notch every scene is compelling and requires your full attention.This movie shows a clear and deliberate plan to jail 8 activists who were against the Vietnam war, the court room drama shows how the government of the land of the free and the home of the brave fix a court case against these individuals allowing them no room to prove the innocence and therefore are ultimately jailed.This is a great movie that once again demonstrates that the USA politics is filthy."
223,"Aaron Sorkin presents probably the best courtroom drama of our time with a brilliant cast and fierce acting. Brilliantly executed, a perfect balance of comedy, excitement, drama, and content makes it one of the most wonderful movies of this year. I condemn the filmmakers for their ability to make a courtroom trial so exciting to watch and having so much relevance today. Sacha Baron Cohen, keep surprising us with your performances."
224,Base on true story. Educating young generation about American history. It is one of the movie that reveals the important story of the time.
225,"This is another well-written and produced history piece by Aaron Sorkin and DreamWorks. The recalled events of 50+ years ago on the streets of Chicago seemed eerily familiar with recent events in Portland, Kenosha, Jacksonville, and a host of other cities. Award winning performances were turned in by Sasha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmane, and Frank Langella. Put this on your ""must-see"" Netflix list!"
226,Highly watchable depiction of a 1969 court case whilst the Vietnam war is taking place. The acting is brilliant and the story is told very well. Glad that I watched it right through to the emotional end. I sincerely hope that judges like this do not exist anymore as this one is shameful.
227,Everything about this was great except for 1 small flaw.....I love everything Sacha Baran Cohen is in..He's amazing! But he sounds like he is from Boston...not Chicago. I grew up in Chicago. No one sounds like that.
228,"Thanks to Mr.Sorkin & Mr.Spielberg for bringing this story to the screen.I lived through this period of our history. Watching the nightly news for any mention of the trial/defendants. Reading the NYT & WAPO.The film brings back the raw emotions I felt as the trial unfolded. The outrage as Bobby Seale was bound and gagged , denied his right to counsel.Performances were exceptional. Frank Langella captured Mr.Magoo (Judge Hoffman) as I interpreted him at the time.Sasha Cohn brought Abby to life revealing him not as the comical lout I considered him at the time, but a genuine , thoughtful purposeful hero I never considered him to be.The ending has Mr. Sorkins signature stamp upon it. Like many ""West Wing"" moments I cried at the end."
229,"The combination of comedy with drama was done in a good away picking moments of unexpected jokes in the court room.The movie clearly shows how a judge with few powerful people and politician can cause a miscarriage of justice in a court room.The movie also shows the history of US becoming an Army nation and how some US citizens didn't agree wars that US was taking part in, one of them was Muhammad Ali who is not part of the movie but it shows other unknown heroes who are trailed in this movie that time.The movie is also released in a significant time of the year, close to US voting and the events going in the country shows how citizens can have a right form of democracy,"
230,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 deals with complex and timely topics with enough nuance and wit to make what could've been an overly overwhelming movie (which at times it is) into a moving and inspiring piece of courtroom cinema with incredible performances from its excellent ensemble cast.( Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Sacha Baron Cohen anyone? )Sorkin's direction can be a bit flat, but he still more than makes up for it with his electrifying dialogue and amazingly stylish editing (also, I'm just biased towards court dramas)."
231,"I was lucky enough to have gotten in to see a day of this trial in 1969. I was just entering High School in Chicago and a friend's aunt was a courtroom artist for WBBM-TV CBS Channel 2.I can say the entire film was fun to watch and brought back memories of a crazy time during the worst days of the Vietnam War. The Chicago police were brutal and Chicago Mayor Daley's famous malaprop ""The police aren't there to create disorder, they are there to preserve disorder"" came during the riots.Sasha Baron Cohen did a good job with Abbey Hoffman. Judge Julius Hoffman was much smaller and more maniacal in person. So, I highly recommend this film. Sometimes the dialog seemed forced and melodramatic, but there was a lot of info to get out and this is an Aaron Sorkin script!"
232,"After Molly's Game, Aaron Sorkin is back in the director's chair with The Trial of the Chicago 7 and he managed to make a great courtroom drama.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is based on the infamous 1968 trial where eight people were believed to have incited riots at the Democratic National Convention in protest of the Vietnam war.This is a film I was eagerly anticipating due to the ensemble cast and the talent that is Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin brings us an intense and fascinating courtroom drama that is well written and well acted. The opening scene wastes no time in revealing the main characters and their motivations and the fast pacing along with Sorkin's trademark dialogue grabbed my attention from the get go. It's a well edited sequence that hooks you onto the story and the rest of the film is just as entertaining. I'm a sucker for courtroom dramas and Sorkin managed to make each court scene compelling. I think he stepped up in terms of direction from Molly's Game as he brought the right amount of tension and ferocity during those court scenes and fantastic performances from each actor. Occasionally, I thought a bit too much humour was thrown around but for the most part it was handled well.Each and every cast member brought their A game here and elevated the atmosphere of each scene. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong's characters are more comedic than the rest and they pulled it off well. I'm not the biggest fan of Eddie Redmayne but he did a fantastic job as Tom Hayden. It's great to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt acting again and he was great. Mark Rylance was incredible as William Kunstler and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was absolutely amazing. A standout was Frank Langella as Judge Hoffman. His character is so unlikeable and Langella did a great job portraying that. I seriously hope some of these actors get Oscar nominations.The only major complaint I have is the ending. It may seem powerful but at the same time I thought it was very cheesy and didn't quite fit in with rest of the film. Apart from that, Aaron Sorkin gives us an intriguing courtroom drama with The Trial of the Chicago 7 and I think it's worth your time."
233,"A fantastic film that is in my opinion is not only the best film of 2020 so far but the best Netflix original movie ever. Amazing story, amazing direction and amazing acting by the entire cast. I expect several Oscar nominations. A must watch."
234,"Most all of us know the history of the 1968 drama of the riots at the ""DNC"" convention in Chicago and no matter who's side you were on or if you thought it was right or wrong this well done informative tense film ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a must see no matter what your political or social stances are. The movie is mostly in the courtroom with occasional shots and flashbacks of news footage and riot clips of the police and protesters. The film is well made and written from Aaron Sorkin as you the viewer see just how crazy this trial really was.It's U.S. history(as for any history or political buff this film is a must see) after the drama unfolded now in 1969 activists Abbie Hoffman(the wild and blunt Sacha Baron Cohen) and Tom Hayden(the strong Eddie Redmayne) and others were charged with conspiracy after a Vietnam war protest that exploded into violence the year before in 1968. All of this came from different moderate groups like society students, and many felt the charges were politically motivated.As you see in many scenes the courtroom basically was wild and a circus all colorful and blunt brash statements from most of the 7 accused as seeing scenes of some of them even showing up in judges' robes really that just shows right out passion. Compelling and raw was watching wrongfully accused Black Panther member Bobby Seale get bound and gagged for trying to state his words of defense.Thru it all one sees how politics and a harsh judge influenced this trial as it was a soul searching journey just for fairness and freedom of expression as the cast was a strong all star ensemble of Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Sacha Baron Cohen, and even a small part from Michael Keaton as out going attorney general. Overall no matter with the themes of politics, fairness, justice, conspiracy the actual trial and now film showed just how passionate seven brave men were about life, society, and speaking out for what they felt was right in crazy times."
235,"Social injustices, dirty politicians, corrupt bureaucracy, and inequities. Sadly, the same mayhem exists today, some 40 years later.
Brilliant cast, and excellent screenplay. When at the end he was asked to keep his response short and he read all the names of the soldiers lost in vietnam, I stood, I clapped and I cried. Great acting and even better"
236,"Right now, the film of the year. The actors are incredible, but Mark Rylance is the best. He deserves the Oscar. And the film right now deserves the Oscar too. The film of the year."
237,"A very good courtroom drama. One of the best of its kind we had in the last years. And the relevance of this 50 year old story is really scary. it really seems not much has changed across the pond or mistakes are done again and again. But no, I dont want this review to become political. I want it to be the great aritistic merrits. The cast is outstanding. Not only are the actors wisely chosen, they all give fantastic performances. Great performances Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne. Sacha Baron Cohen was absolutely fantastic in one of his rare serious roles. Frank Langella's character was so unbelievable (yet its true) and it was probably hard t play such a foolish role with the seriousness it needed. Therefor kudos for Langella to achieve that. Michael Keaton was also outstanding in his short role. Jeremy Strong was absolutely memorable and watch out of Yahya Abdul-Manteen who onces again gives a stand out performance and steals the screen everytime he appears on it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was also solid.
The score was great. The screenplay magnifically. I found it bit anticlimatic (in a way) but still a very good direction.
One of the most memorable films of the year so far."
238,I always thought protesters were irresponsible and uneducated attention seekers. But it turns out they aren't. This movie changed my vision. I don't like hippies or yippies but this movie made me realize some of them are really smart intellectual people and in Chicago they were trying to save 18 year olds from killing babies and getting themselves killed. 5-star performances by a stellar-cast. 5 star script and Sorkin's directorial skills totally are improved(4-star)
239,Fantastic from start to finish! Everyone does such an incredible job in this movie! One of the best g to things I've seen in a while!
240,"Sorkin has many flaws, but very few writers can pull off a historical courtroom drama that is mostly people talking. The premise of structuring a story around a blatantly unfair trial and a bunch of flashbacks sounds mind numbingly boring, but not in his hands. Not only does he pull it off, but he makes the whole thing super watchable. I mean, this is the guy who gave us ""You can't handle the truth"" and ""You have part of my attention - you have the minimum amount."" Is it perfect? Hell, no. And neither is he. (I found myself thinking the more interesting movie here would have focused on Hampton and Seale...but I would want another writer and director for that film.) Still, this time around Sorkin seemed willing to explore the less inspirational side of politics, the blatant corruption instead of the poetic compromise. Plus, his cast is exceptional, and they help his dialogue cook. This is not the best courtroom drama ever. It is not even Sorkin's best courtroom drama ever. But it is still worth watching."
241,I did not know the material of this film and must say this movie was superb in its portrayal and what I understand to be it's accuracy
242,"Amazing characterizing about every chicago 7. Brilliant using of cam language. This movie got huge historically educational meaning. So great to acknowledge this Vietnam war history. Must watch, especially in such a time when BLM going on nowadays. Stand we rise!"
243,"They say History is the best teacher. Indeed.
This film tells the story of seven (eight) revolutionaries whose name has been etched into the books of History forever. For some they are miscreants and for others much needed leaders.The cast has given award winning performances. For sure there will be multiple nominations.A must watch."
244,"The movie is about the trial begun for 7 accused for inciting the violence in a otherwise peaceful protests organised by the different youth leaders with different mindsets and way to deal with situations but protesting against the same decision of government for sending the US troops mostly young soldiers with less experience and no preparation which resulted in the death of these soldiers and grief for their family and friends. In the movie it's been depicted that the trial was politically motivated and jury was also tempered for reaching a prerecorded conviction. Movie has also shown the discrimination against the blacks in the court room except the fact that a big majority of people were still against this racism approach and they were not ready to accept that. An attorney general statement have also been not taken in front of jury as it would have been diverted the whole case in favour of the defendant, judge was already running on the guidelines sent by their akas. Movie is full of debate and you will get to learn lot from it. It is worth watching the movie."
245,"Ridiculous ensemble cast, and Sorkin's slick lines to support. Plus i LOVE a courtroom drama. This is liberal stuff with a capital L.Hoffman and his fellow defendants face off against a Government prosecution and a brazenly unsympathetic judge, Sorkin's screenplay works its magic through the sheer spectacle of the courtroom proceedings. Through testimonies and circumstantial evidence, it becomes clear that the accusations of a conspiracy are baseless, most obvious in the case of Bobby Seale (fiercely portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who is charged along with the Chicago 7 without any reasonable evidence of collusion.The confrontations between Hoffman and Tom Hayden (a steady, confident Eddie Redmayne) resonate as they explore the tensions between achieving progress through traditional, ""respectable"" means, versus disrupting the status quo by overturning a failing system.This movie would have already been a must-see film for its captivating ensemble, Sorkin script and rousing story. But its sincere plea for a more free and fair democracy makes it all the more essential in a pivotal election year for the US."
246,"If I can set aside the gravity of the subject matter for a moment, let me say that what attracted me to this film is the ""dream team"" cast. But better still is the writing of Aaron Sorkin, under whose pen has emerged works such as ""The social network"", ""Steve Jobs"" as well as the superb TV series ""The Newsroom"". Just to listen to Sorkin's dialogue is sheer joy. To watch it delivered by such a distinguished ensemble doubles the pleasure.There must be mountains of public documents and academic work on this monumental page of modern American history and I'll confine myself to the briefest details. The cause-and-effect of the ""Trial"" goes back to drafting for the Vietnam War. If that is a little forgotten during the course of the mesmerizing narrative, it is driven home by the powerful concluding coda, like a sledge hammer hitting you on the chest.The year was 1968, the ""flower power"" era. The catastrophic event was the eruption of violence in a confrontation starting from a peaceful demonstration during a Democratic convention in Chicago. The ""7"" charged with conspiracy were in fact three separate ""units"", 3 pairs (one idealistic activists, one Yippies, one inconsequential), plus a fatherly pacifist. There was an eighth, singled out because he was not represented by the lawyer of the seven. During the course of the long trial, the seven and their lawyers meet regularly in what they defiantly called ""the conspiracy room"". Most of the drama, however, unfold in the courtroom.In an IMDb interview of the cast, one actor says ""One could think that the story took place just last year"" - protests, tear gas, petrol bombs, violence breeding violence... half a century later, these events are playing again, all over the place, nay, all over the world.Now to the cast, and I'll state upfront that there are omissions, due to my own inadequacy. For want of anything better way (and all performers are, without exception, superb), I'll go in alphabetical order of the last names.Sacha Baron Cohen needs no introduction to his inimitable style with comical characters. This is put to good use in his portrayal of Yippie Abbie Hoffman. Underneath the easy flippancy, however, is a clearly demonstrated sincerity, even urgency, that Cohen brings out with impeccable precision.Michael Keaton, playing Attorney General Ramsey Clark who has just been replaced by John Mitchell, has only two scenes, both of which he completely owns. The first is in his home when he hears pleads from two of the ""conspirator"", in the presence of two of Mitchell's men, for him to take the stand. The second is in the courtroom when he does take the stand. Vintage Keaton.Frank Langelia, among the proliferation of his screen work, may be well remembered in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008), for his uncannily convincing portrayal of Richard Nixon, not by physical resemblance but by sheer acting ability. In ""The trail of the Chicago 7"", he plays Judge Julian Hoffman, depicting incompetence in such a way that it is almost amusing, in a way only he can.Joseph Gordon Levitt, one of the best in this generation of actors, plays prosecution lawyer Richard Schultz, achieving the almost impossible of earning for his character respect and even sympathy under conditions that put him in unfavourable lights with the audience.Seasoned movie and TV series veteran John Carroll Lynch plays the fatherly pacifist David Dellinger with conviction.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who served notice in ""Aquaman"" (2018) and the immensely successful TV series ""Watchmen"" (2019) that he is up and coming, plays the pivotal role of Bobby Seale, the aforementioned ""eighth"" who insists on having his own separate lawyer, has some of the most explosive (figuratively speaking) scene which he delivers admirably, with dignity.Eddie Redmayne, arguably among the ""most wanted"" in Hollywood, plays Tom Hayden, the young, idealistic intellectual whose momentary loss of control singles him out as the obvious target of the prosecutors. One of the best scenes is the confrontation between Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman in the ""conspiracy room"", two people on the same side but torn apart by difference in approaches they respectively believe in.Mark Rylance won one of the most deserved best supporting actors Oscar with ""Bridge of spies"" in 2015. In ""The trail of the Chicago 7"", with hair neck-length, he portrays William Kunstler, the flamboyant defence lawyer whose exasperated scrimmages with Judge Hoffman leads to 24 cites of contempt by the end of the trail.Ben Shenkman does not appear to be in the same league as many of the abovementioned. I am really happy to see him, however, playing Kunstler's fellow counsel Leonard Weinglass. I have watched him in the two full seasons of ""For the people"", which unfortunately has been discontinued."
247,The message is very apt for today's America. The sheer fight against a corrupt administration and law is possibly closest now to the Nixon era. Except impeachment no longer happens
248,"This was a ridiculously good movie!! After watching movies such as Mulan, I was beginning to think that we were never going to be able to watch a good movie in 2020. How blessed we are to have The Trial of the Chicago 7 now. Not only was the script fantastic, but the storyline was written so well! Aaron Sorkin is a genius. Please watch this movie."
249,"The biggest achievement of this film is not its stunning screenplay, crisp editing, terrific dialogue or the ensemble cast but Aaron Sorkin has made Eddie Redmayne look likable for the first time ever. After watching his cringeworthy Oscar bait performance of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything I had decided to skip all his movies but I had to watch this because of Sorkin and he really achieve the most difficult task.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a perfect follow up to Molly's Game in a way that it tells us about an interesting topic that we don't talk enough about but he gives a typical liberal status quo point of view of the trial. First and foremost we have to understand that institutions like court and police aren't bad because of its personnel alone, they are bad and unfair because its set up to that way. Justice Hoffman played by veteran Frank Langela is not a bad apple but he is the literal representation of judges in real life. In a way the film reminds of the sorry state of courts in my home country India, where the judges read out verdicts like its written by the fascist far right Hindu fundamentalist ruling party.Despite the only flaw, this film delivers what we expect from a Sorkin film is bound to strike a chord in this current political climate. Some of the scenes where made for the cinemas and to get loud cheers from the audience it was quite evident so its limiting when its a direct OTT release. Daniel Pemberton's score is absolutely pleasant and he has proven to be one of the most consistent composers working today. The Awards jury would absolutely adore this film and its destined to receive quite a nominations and possibly winning some."
250,"Good movie, but a bit one-sided.. It conveniently omitted the part where the anti-war protesters spit on the returning soldiers, calling them ""baby killers."" Let's not confuse them for ""patriots."""
251,"A great film based off some harrowing facts and realities and sees Aaron better himself in his second courtroom drama film although this time he's directing too.His script is perfectly sound and perfectly paced to make a 2hr 10 film feel a perfect length although every now and then keeping up with his characters can be hard in some scenes.The cast is vast, featuring all great performers even if Eddie has a slightly meandering accent. However the two stars and stand out performers of the film aren't Eddie, who one could probably perceive as the main character although the argument could be made for our friend Mr Cohen that he is in fact the lead performer since he gets to narrate the film as it goes along and as such gets great amounts of screen time, in fact the films best performers by far are Mark Rylance and Ali G himself. Sucha Baron Cohen performs brilliantly amongst the presence of actors who are more used to a typical dramatic film experience being both funny, devoted and loud whilst we the audience have to suffer like Mark Rylance's character in becoming more and more and more frustrated with the State - the state in this film being expressed the the also great performance of Frank Mangello. Yabdul Manteen II and Jospeh Gordon Levitt also give good performances, being memorable despite having less screen time, especially Manteen.The Mis en Scene, score and camera work aren't outstanding in the film however they do not need to be, ensuring that only the flow of Sorkin's script and the performers get to take centre stage within the good uses of editing which aid the story along in increasing pace with a constant use of overlapping scene dialogue."
252,What a way to capture that period of history and flawless performances from all.
253,"One of the better movies I've watched this year. You don't need to be on the left wing of politics (Personally on the right side myself in parts) to know that the Vietnam war should never have happened, beautiful country and beautiful people fighting for their own independence."
254,"An all-star cast does full justice to Aaron Sorkin's script in this quintessentially 60's protest flick end courtroom drama. In addition to star turns by Redmayne, Baron Cohen, Langhella, Rylance, and Gordon Levitt, I loved the cameo from Michael Keaton."
255,"It is no coincidence that this movie has come out right before the US elections.
It is obviously aimed at democracy lovers but also to all who hold that idea dear.
As a movie, it's a almost a classic: an unpredictable courtroom struggle between good, bad and the grey between with outstanding performances of its cast, most notably Frank Langella and Mark Rylance. 8/10"
256,"I've been Aaron Sorkin's fan ever since ""The Social Network"". And he didn't disappoint this time around either! The story is carried across in a very dynamic and captivating way so much so that you'd be surprised realising that you reached the end of the movie. I wouldn't call this a courtroom drama, since it's much more than that. Sorkin has managed to take us back to the events of Chicago protests in 1968 through the trial's aftermath of it and that shows how great storyteller he had become. It is astonishing to find out how much Nixon's era resembles Trump's era.
Highly recommended!"
257,"Best film I've watched for a long time. Massive performances from Rylance, Redmayne and Baron Cohen!"
258,"Every time I watch one of these cartoons, I wonder just how dumb can america go. If you really want to know about the chicago 7 (actually 8) I highly recommend the documentary to start with, not this shiny plastic piece of hyperbolic fluff. This is the cartoon version and the timing is not coincidental. I won't argue with the facts in the movie but the whole production reminds me of the tv afternoon special movies that came out in the late 70s and early 80s. For those not old enough to know, before cable, before streaming, before vcrs, before video games, most of us only had a handful of viewing choices, and one of those choices was the 'afternoon special'. The good people at ABC (aka OTA broadcast tv network) came out with afternoon movies designed to pass on a morality message while babysitting us until the folks got off work. These movies were heavy on message; light on very good film making. Maybe this is the voice of the new american propaganda but I can't figure out what the message is here because it's not about vietnam, or anti-war. If you want to do a film about that, then you can't omit the irony of the war is that vietnam economically today is one of the leaders in southeast asia. Heck, they even have an amusement park now outside danang that's framed around a 17th century french village. Google it, if you don't believe me. And it's not about racism because bobby seale only plays a small part of the movie and a stereotype for the 60s at that. The justice system? Geez, there's a reason why most courts, in most states, for most cases, are closed off from the public. Our legal system is far more nutty than portrayed in this movie. If it's supposed to be about the 60s and 70s, it's about as authentic as psychedelic. The closest equivalent I can think of is the way hollywood introduced and portrayed hippies, at that time, in mainstream tv as anyone who wore wide collars, beads, hip boots, bell bottoms in neon colors and said 'cool' and 'groovy' all the time. Or something on par with 'wild in the streets', which unfortunately, some people, even then and now, think as authentic real life. I mean, hollywood then had about as much understanding of the 60s culture as the plods who produced this cartoon. If you want to know more about the anti-war movement, or that period in general there's a lot of good documentaries, some on netflix dvd and youtube with actual stories and interviews with those who were there and involved. Unfortunately, this trial wasn't just about these 8 people but it was a trial of a whole generation and the irony is that the generation of chicago 7 (8) later went on to endorse 3 major wars in the middle east, and the longest war in history, and produced a baby who later went on to make this nonsense."
259,"Other than Strong, which as usual was weakest link almost everyone did a great job.
Cohen was outstanding, Gordon Levitt was so goooood as always. Rylance was great.
Very well made. Working did awesome job."
260,"Utterly compelling and absorbing depiction of the real life events in Chicago in 1968 of the trial of 7 protesters against the Vietnam war. Impressive, intelligent, sometimes funny, emotional and thought provoking dialogue and some very impressive character acting by the cast. A movie relevant to our times - the importance of bravely standing up for our principles, equalities, freedom of thought and speech, liberties and rights to question authority and to peacefully protest. A must watch movie which I will watch again when the government next lock us down again!"
261,"Emotional, controversial, unjust, to sum it up the '60s in the Us.
For me, the best movie of 2020.
Please, watch it!"
262,"It's a brilliant movie with some excellent acting and a perfectly chosen cast .
The movie starts a little confusing unless you know a lot about the US political system
but then after around 10 minutes you start to get a grasp on what the movie and storyline is really about, And then your hooked for the next 2 hours,
I found it an enjoyable and very enlightening watch and I advise you all to give it a view and I feel confident you won't be disappointed 😉"
263,"I was waiting for this movie for long time ago and I finally I watched.I really find acting perdormances amazing!! Top 4 actor for me Eddie Redmayne,Sacha baron cohen,Frank langella,Mark Rylance but Yahya and Joseph also good as well.My favorite one Eddie Redmayne.He has so cool and attractive performance in the movie as Tom hayden.At the final flash back scene he was amazing dialogue with Mark rylance.And also he was so good with sacha.Has great chemistry.This special note for myself.Eddie Redmayne's american accent It was Fantastic!! I want to say for sacha he surprised to me.He was seriously and also funny in role.All of the actors performances blow my mind 💓 I looking for oscar nominations 🌟🌟🌟🌟 The best movie of the year & the best acting performances of the year !!"
264,What an amazing film. Brilliantly acted by all. Wow wow wow speechless
265,"Amazing screenplay, stunning direction, great score, absolutely brilliant performances. It keeps you interested from beggining to end, and because of the sharp and fast dialogue you are invested in the story every second the movie is on your screen. It's totally rewatchable, a very interesting social commentary and has hilarious moments. Like I said, the performances are amazing. Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance are particularly great, I think they totally transmit everything they intend to. Amazing movie, is captivating and moving. Congrats Sorkin, you did it again."
266,"Aaron Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters working on Hollywood at the moment, and recently he started to also direct movies, this being his second feature. And one of his finest works if we include his screenplays.It's not perfect. It's really cliche, and the decision to focus on multiple characters on the Trial instead of the two that actually have arcs makes for a story not as effective.That been said, Sorkin screenplay, while not as effective as it has been in other movies like The Social Network, still is great to hear. He's very Sheaksperean in that he doesn't write as ordinary people talk. Still, he writes excellent sentences that in the mouth of the right actors, really stick with you.And what a cast! While some were better than others, there isn't a weak link in this cast. Special attention to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, his performance and lines really make Bob Sealle the most memorable character of the movie. Suppose anyone is going to be nominated for an oscar (something Netflix will definitely push for). In that case, I hope it will be him.Courtroom dramas can be boring thanks to the lack of variety in scenery. Without the right direction, even the best-written courtrooms dramas feel as dull as actual trials. And the direction here is simple, letting other professionals do their job, but still practical and that leads to the two best things in this movie: the editing and the music.Daniel Pemberton score is not as catchy and fun like his best work (Spider-Verse) but still has some headbangers. And combined to the beautiful editing of Alan Baumgarten, it produces some of the most memorable moments in the film.Is ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" cliche? Yes. But these cliches are made fresh with a great script, a strong cast, slight direction and outstanding score and editing. Check this one out!"
267,"Not a single conversation that felt authentic!
Last scene was super cringey with even the prosecutor standing up.... come on......"
268,"The Trial Of The Chicago 7 is not a bad movie but it has in my view a few problems of balance which impacts its overall ability to deliver a cohesive message.
The first problem of balance regards its narrative style, so much swinging
from farcical to self-important to make you wander if you are watching a drama or a comedy.In the same way, some characters - lime the hippy couple Hoffmann/Rubin - swing from almost clownish roles to too serious and self-righteous ones to be fully believable.
The second problem of balance is about the focus of the story; in real life, the most prominent figure in the trial was Bobby Seal, here relegated to a secondary and at times almost caricatural role in favour of the more folkloristic hippies."
269,"I am not going to say anything, just watch it and you'll like it."
270,"With multiple oscar winners the cast delivers an impeccable performance. The movie successfully creates an emotion of extreme hate for one of the characters.
Probably the best court room drama of all time not featuring mathew mcohney."
271,This film is hidden gem on Netflix. Without big promotion it came to my attention and I was surprised how the plot enthrall me. The pace and the dense of dialogues are typical Sorkinian but in light version. What impressed me the most was Baron´s performance. He easily switches between drama tone and irony. The whole crew stick together well.
272,I watched this first because it's Sorkin. But the cast made it must see. It's a moving portrayal of 60s American madness that we seem to be reliving with another madman in chief. History sadly rhymes. The C7 reminds us not to sit idly by.
273,"Such a fascinating part of American history, doesn't show much change in the way the two political sides still present themselves today. Great acting, script is superb as you would expect from Sorkin........."
274,It is amazing touching movie .i adore the last scene .it was amazing .iam sure if there is oscar ceremony this year there will be alot of nominations for them.
275,The music was annoying. It doesn't need to sound so sappy. I'm already getting all the emotion out of the scene without all these violins screaming.
276,"This is a great film, surpassing my expectations. The writer/director avoided the Sorkinisms that have bound other recent scripts to certain stylistic cliches which have reduced the effectiveness and power of his stories Molly's Game and Steve Jobs.Sorkin astonished me with a selfless script of power and imagination, his most brilliant and mature script to date. He assembled many of the greatest actors of our time, each role cast impeccably. His direction too was masterful and worthy of award.This story would have been easy to mess up in lesser hands.Hats off to Aaron Sorkin and The Trial Of The Chicago Seven!"
277,"What an amazing movie. Great acting and great characters. The ending of this movie is phenomenal! Just amazingly well crafted. The only small problem I have is that it was often a bit boring, but my age (14) could be the reason for that."
278,"POSITIVES:1) The acting is all incredible, highlights for me were Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance and Joseph Gordon Levitt
2) The Aaron Sorkin writing is fantastic as always: not just the writing of the dialogue but also the writing of the set pieces, court scenes and protest scenes
3) The film definitely doesn't pull any punches; it was a lot darker than I expectedNEGATIVES:1) There were times where I felt the film was being far too on the nose with the injustice against the Chicago 7. The judge was outrageous and the police were all portrayed as awful people
2) There is no way that the defence lawyers would have allowed the entire trial to progress without once calling for a mistrial or trying to get the judge replaced"
279,Great Job on the Intention and Obstacle. I have been doing Mr Sorkin's MasterClass online. He is Good Teacher ! I enjoyed the Film but bit tired of hearing about all the Lies they got away with back then and the Strong Arm tactics. Love Court Room scenes in General and Frank Langella is probably the most accomplished Actor in Cast but feel the GAVEL belongs in right hand not left. I wonder if Judge Hoffman was really Left Handed ?
280,"An enjoyable and very timely treatment of the sequence of events, from the '68 Chicago convention protests through to the completion of the main trial, with the deft touch of Aaron Sorkin providing appropriate gravitas and depth. First-class performances, although at least two of the characters who I personally met in meetings decades ago, Ramsey Clark (I spent several days with him when he was a controversial trouble-shooting NYC international attorney in 1990) and Jerry Rubin (in a small informal campus discussion group, as a protest leader in 1970), in no way resembled the actors who play them in the film, Michael Keaton and Jeremy Strong respectively. It's quite a switch seeing Strong, well-deserved Emmy winner as the emotionally unstable media executive Kendall Roy in Succession, playing a Yippie leader, but hey Jerry Rubin became a successful stockbroker later on in life which makes the link between the roles credible!"
281,Powerful and entertaining - a great watch and well above the usual Netflix film quality.
282,Revolutionary and bold. A great watch with a great message.
283,"After watching every Sorkin movie in anticipation for Trial, I am not at all disappointed but also don't think it's on par with his best films. Trial is a rock solid courtroom drama with a fantastic ensemble cast pulling great performances out of actors I have loved in many past performances. Movies about true stories are often easy to enjoy because of their relevance and precedent they set for what has happened since, and Trial does nail the essence of what happened in this case. It's not a groundbreaking cinematic picture and doesn't tell us anything too revelatory thematically, but the central message (that political protest and freedom of speech is essential to democracy, and that the legal system is frequently unjust) is entirely worthwhile. I enjoyed many of the performances, but Cohen was the scene stealer for me, deftly managing the balance of comedic relief early and showing his thoughtful side later on. Redmayne was the other performance I really enjoyed, as well as Abdul-Mateen, but there isn't a bad performance in the film. The biggest area where the film could have done more is in engaging the audience with the reasons for their protest rather than the execution of it. It is interesting and important to understand the interactions between protesters, police, and the legal system, but it rings a bit more hollow when we're given nothing more than allusions to the reasons they are protesting at all. The troops who died at Vietnam are brought up a couple times, but outside of the list of names we don't get nearly enough of a sense of what brought them all to Chicago, what was so important to them to risk all of this. Without that fundamental investment in their journey, it was less exciting to follow the trial. We still know that they were protesting the Democratic convention due to continuing war in Vietnam, but given that it's the entire reason for the movie's events, I wanted to delve much deeper into their views on it. Maybe that's just me, and if you want to just follow a real, unjust, politically steeped trial of historical importance then Trial is the perfect movie for you."
284,"I hope judge Hoffman, if the real one was anything like this one in the movie, died a painfull and horrible death."
285,"Not everything in the movie was true, but much of it was. Some of the shocking events really happened. Some funny things happened in real life that were left out of the movie. Definitely worth the time."
286,"Really good story, very captivating keeps you on the edge you're set for the whole move. The story and characters really drive the movie. Each character on trial is surprisingly different. Which makes the film a lot more interesting. The script is good but the film over uses dialogue. By design the movie has a lot of dialogue but there were multiple scenes where visuals could be used instead of dialogue. Overall it's good movie that lacks a few elements to be great."
287,A must watch movie for all those who still consider America the land of opportunity and equality
288,"Now the only reason I first started watching this film was because of Keaton, and there really was nothing else to watch. But thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered this masterpiece.The writing for this film is superb, adapting the true story perfectly whilst also adding an element of fiction to the mix. All characters are also memorable and enjoyable to watch all thanks to the writing.All actors also give a great performance these include Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Michael Keaton and many, many more.Other good additions to this film are its cinematography, editing, pacing, solid tone and music.Finally I must compliment how fresh and unique the vision of Aaron Sorkin was while directing this movie, you can feel his passion and desire for the project and it's easily shown in the final product, and hopefully The Trial of the Chicago 7 can snatch a few awards because of how relevant and well made it is."
289,"Inspiradora, aterradora. Lo que el poder en el poder es capaz de hacer. No dejen de verla. THE WORLD IS WATCHING"
290,OK. As someone who lived through the events and protested an unjust war. I enjoyed this slice of History. It was a fine film that contained great dialog and performances. But it was so one sided to the Left that I think it hurt the finished product. IT also did not have enough time to develop so many complicated characters. It was a topic that begged for a mini series. That said I enjoyed every minute and wanted more. It is a must watch. Many reviews are talking about this being so relevant today. I disagree strongly. Sorry I do not see the current BLM protests on the same level as the anti war protests of the sixties. Everyone should follow it up with some other works. Rich
291,"It's scary (and almost funny) how many patella there are between the 1960s depicted in this film and our modern political/social climate, and Sorkin captures the era well. The film is frustrating much like the trial itself, but we really only learn about Abdul-Mateen and Gordon-Levitt as characters. Cohen is great, too. Wish I got more out of this, but it's a quality watch in a meh year."
292,This was a great movie. My man Aaron Sorkin crushes it yet again.
293,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Manipulative but highly effective docudrama that plays with the facts a bit too much but still delivers its powerful message for our right to protest injustice most eloquently.JIM'S REVIEW: Since Crispus Attucks became America's first hero for American independence, the right to protest has long been woven into the blood-stained fabric of our nation. Wars, civil and gay rights, sexual harassment, women's liberation...you name it, people have been demonstrating against injustice for decades. Today, our polarized country still has the need to protest from both right and left sides, especially this election year. Such was the case back in 1968 when protests occurred during the Democratic Convention in Chicago and in that aftermath, a group of political activists were put on trial by the government as scapegoats for their actions under the guise of inciting a riot. The relevance of this drama resonates with today's headlines.Director/ Writer Aaron Sorkin uses actual court records, archival footage of the riots, and court testimony, along with his deft skill of wordplay, to chronicle a docudrama about those events entitled The Trial of the Chicago 7, a forgotten shameful chapter of our American history.The trial became a public spectacle highlighting the ineptitude of the court system and government bureaucracy. The accused were a varied lot and these defendants differed in their ways and means of revolution. On trial were: peace activists Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins), John Froines (Danny Flaherty), and two walking endorsement from the Yippie movement, Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) and Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen). Also standing trial was Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a militant member from the Black Panther Party who was never at the scene of the crime. These 8 protest leaders were strangers brought together by the Nixon administration with trumped-up conspiracy charges which amounted to a political vendetta. The stage was set for the drama to begin and it does in this highly watchable film.The theatrics of a world stage did not go unnoticed during the trial as presiding judge, Julius Hoffman (a scene stealing Frank Langella), watches on, unable to hide his repulsion for the accused and some of the defendants making a mockery of their plight with their courtroom hijinks could easily rival a Marx Brothers routine. On the side of the prosecution are Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Thomas Foran (J.C. MacKenzie) and assorted undercover police witnesses. For the defense, we have earnest attorney, William Kunstler (Mark Rylance) and his able assistant counsel, Leonard Weinglass (Ben Shenkman). Mr. Sorkin chooses his actors wisely and their physical appearance recall their real life counterparts. The ensemble is terrific, especially, particularly Mr. Redmayne, Mr. Rylance, Mr. Cohen, and the aforementioned Mr. Langella.Through flashbacks and court scenes, Mr. Sorkin tells his tale very adroitly. The film is not historically accurate as the filmmaker takes too much artistic liberty with his material. In fact, the actual trial is stranger than the added fiction in this film. (Omitted from this movie are true moments in the trial that would have been perfectly suited for this film: Hoffman's repeatedly calling the judge, ""Julie"" and blowing kisses to the jury, the judge admonishing famous celebrity witnesses like Arlo Guthrie and Judy Collins from singing on the stand, the defendants draping a Viet Cong flag over the defense table, the absurdity of Hoffman getting jail time for laughing in court, etc.) Why Mr. Sorkin avoided these facts seems a misstep in his narrative.Still, the overall proceedings make for riveting if not accurate drama. (However, the late filmmaker Stanley Kramer would have given his seal of approval to Mr. Sorkin's liberal voice and vision. Both directors tend to proselytize their political leanings a bit too much in their movies but one can only admire their noble intents.) Mr. Sorkin's unquestionable skill for blending rich characters, clever dialog, and much literate speechifying about current social issues are his trademark talent and that is wholly evident in this film, even if he cannot rein in his melodramatic flourishes with an unrealistic climax and closing statement that strains credibility.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a very fine courtroom drama with a wonderful cast and many nicely scripted scenes. Even with its minor flaws, the film makes some powerful connections between then and now while celebrating our fundamental right to protest and condemning those who want to suppress it."
294,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is the typical Hollywood film. Sorkin plays it too safe. Much like last year's Ford v Ferrari, this film falls on the monotony of that tedious and overdone Hollywood movie formula.We're talking Aaron Sorkin here, so let's talk about the script. As you should expect, Sorkin did a fine job, but I'm not impressed, and I think that this is not Sorkin at its finest. The writing is a bit too self-indulgent. Sorkin is in an urge to display his razor-sharp lines of dialogue, but those lines are all over the place, and they don't feel to come naturally and organically. Also, what I noticed is that those sharp lines can come from everybody. Everyone here is witty, and that I'm afraid, that does not speak well for Sorkin. Because he ""arms"" everyone with these sharp lines, but to do so, he must have deviated a bit from doing justice to the characters. Here Sorkin seems not to care much about preserving the authenticity of his characters, as long as his witty lines get to take place. And I get it, everybody likes to let loose, but man, you got to read the room.The acting also is not something I would point out as done very well, and I don't blame the actors for the most part. I think that Sorkin didn't do a good enough job of directing them. Jeremy Strong did better when compared to the rest of the cast, but again, I think that no matter how good the actors would have been, it's Sorkin that doesn't get the better of them. Sorkin's direction lacks focus and dynamic. For the most part, he did a good job here, but I think - this being his second effort from the director's chair - that he should be better at staying in the shoes of the screenwriter.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a very redundant film. It adds nothing new to the game. Things being as they are this year, with the whole pandemic situation that has made a lot of movies to be postponed, this film might get some Oscar nomination in the technical categories. But I don't think that the movie has what it takes to create a legacy like some of the other Sorkin's works have."
295,"Hollywood does a great job in romanticisng these movements and events, while completely rewriting history. I bet in 30 years from now, all ridiculous ""peaceful protest"" will be shown as fluffy flowery times by Hollywood. Soviet Union was efficient at these tactics too, so nothing new."
296,"Ah well ... I mean even without the current Potus trying to undermine the US elections with trial after trial - while being in denial ... even without that there are some similarities I reckon you can see here. Not too blunt and on the nose of course. So don't get overly excited, this is not about Trump - well not in an obvious sense.It is about a goverment that does not take its protestors for full people. What we get to see here (and man is this edited well, with powerhouse performances, not to mention great dialog) is heartbreaking and really almost crazy. Things you would not expect the American justice system would allow to happen. For the movie to work, you have to have a great villain of course and Frank Langella is quite the treat in that role ... mesmerizing. I am a bit surprised by how subtle Gordon Levitt is going about his character ... but it is fitting. Some may have issues with Sasha Baron Cohen (you may think of Borat or Ali G when you see him and maybe even hear him) ... but he also performs amazingly.So this is a drama, that you may know story wise, but will nevertheless be as engaging as they get ..."
297,"I was looking forward to this movie, but after 1 hour i had to turn it off... Its well made and and its high quality, but very slow and not entertaining"
298,"This is the type of movie where the director/ writer, in this case Aaron Sorkin, thinks one of his stars Sacha Baron Cohen as Abby Hoffman is going to win awards and therefore unintentionally goes out and ruins his performance by giving him close-ups constantly and a million speeches to deliver-all with an annoying actorish Boston accent. Then he puts him on the witness stand and has him deliver even more annoying platitudes.I can't think of another movie in which so many actors of good repute give such horrible hammy performances. Eddie Redmayne has Tom Hayden's pizza face. That's about the extent of his performance. Worst of all is Mark Rylance (a rather short man) playing the rather tall and charismatic William Kunstler. But the way that Rylance plays him, he couldn't convince you that Jesus was innocent.Surprisingly the best performance in the movie and the only one that has any professional force is Frank Langella's nasty Judge Hoffman. Considering how over the top the direction is that's no small accomplishment.if you ever want to learn anything about the '60s you'd be much better off watching a fictional movie like Coming Home. What that movie was able to do and what this movie cannot is convey a sense of the free-floating anxiety that pervaded that era. What you get with the Trial of the Chicago 7 is a preachy, arrogant, pompous, speechy mess."
299,"1-Tom Hayden said he avoided the draft because of a high number. The draft lottery was in dec 1969 when Hayden was 30 and well beyond draft eligible age.
2-not one leftie was wearing wire rim glasses which was ""de rigueur"" for lefties in 1969.
3-scenes inside the ""conspiracy room"" should have been clouded by the putrid haze of cigarette smoke..again ""de rigueur "" for 1969
4-all photos of John Froines at the trial show him with a gentlemen's coiffure and 'satche, not the GEICO caveman look."
300,"'Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains'. A compelling visual reality of power abuse and the struggle of 7 to undress it."
301,"It's team effort which made it brilliant including the judge of-course , some scenes were very itense making it a perfect 8."
302,"I know this film has a complicated history, but I am a huge Aaron Sorkin fan so let's face it, I was made to love this movie, and I did.The pace is fast, the dialog (Sorkin being Sorkin) is challenging and the viewer needs to pay attention.I can't judge this on historical accuracy, but the story is fascinating and at the same time frightening. We all pretty much know how it will end for the defendants, but what I didn't know was the level to which the government went to screw them.This is primarily a court-room drama, but there's a lot of context and the story is riveting. As mentioned, I wasn't aware of the conspiracy and corruption angles and how the government manipulated the proceedings to a horrifying extent. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering it was Nixon and his stooges, along with the Daly machine, but it is ultimately extremely disturbing, and as I write this (in the fall of 2020, with the election looming), it is another lesson in how we need to be ever watchful of our government.Sorkin and the actors did a fabulous job.There are some amazing quotes that make this film so relevant to today. ""The Whole World is Watching"" is one of them. This is not Sorkin's line but from the protest movement of the 60's. Another line, which I can't quote verbatim, was delivered by Abbie Hoffman and related to people still stuck in the 50's. They didn't grasp what was happening in the country. A third was Clark pointing out that the President is not the client of the Attorney General. See? Pay attention.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is about as perfect as can be."
303,"The film is quite simple, it is a typical representative of court films, when during the narration we are told the details of the case. Sorkin, as a master of his craft, skillfully interests the viewer and does not give out all the trumps at once, revealing them in the course of the film, and does not let interest cool down throughout the tape. Let the genre of court dramas with an admixture of documentary is quite specific, because there is no action in the direct sense, but if you like disputes and debates between the characters, here it is in bulk."
304,"I have seen The Social Network more times than you can imagine. I found the dialogues so amusing and did not want to miss any line or detail.
That being said, I was looking forward to this movie since I watched the trailer, but I found it very disappointing, and I doubt I'll ever watch it again.
It was too slow and lacked the gray areas of other Sorkin's films and characters, who you may like or dislike but at least you could still find sort of relatable in a way (like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men or the Winklevie in The Social Network). Here some characters were basically charicatures, although I still enjoyed Eddie Redmayne's and Michael Keaton's performances.
The final scene was almost like watching a 90's commedy (specially by the chosen song).
Frankly, as I read in some reviews, I believe the whole film might have turned better as a Mini Series."
305,I'm a huge Sorkin fan but his scripts are cookie cutter. Characters all say witty lines and act self righteous. I caught him repeating script lines from his previous shows/movies. He always throws in dialogue about miscommunication related to names.
306,"This is a good, entertaining courtroom drama, but was a little too long. I don't think it quite deserves all the accolades it has been getting."
307,"The infamous trial of Chicago 7 was captured brilliantly. Though, it starts as a 'political trial', with the conclusion already known, the screenplay and editing were too good and brilliant. One of the finest court room drama, that did not get boring at any point. Well made!!"
308,"Interesting, not incredible but not bad, enjoyed the majority of the storyline"
309,"To put it simply this is one of the best films I have ever seen and is everything that defines Aaron Sorkin's writing style and career in a nutshell. A story of how far a government will go to portray an agenda is masterfully and frighteningly showcased through the story's outstanding source material. While every actor does an incredible job at bringing their immensely interesting real-life inspirations to life, particularly Frank Langella as the villainous judge, Sacha Baron Cohen will be given serious Oscar considerations when the time comes. While unprecedented global events have caused 2020 cinema to be lackluster to say the least, this film has almost single-handedly saved 2020 cinema and would've been considered just as great in any era. Lastly, this movie is so good that I made an IMDB account just so I could write this review."
310,"I have never really understood why filmmakers like Aaron Sorkin, who are so focused on dialogue, are making films and not theatre plays or radioplays instead.
This film is so pumped up with dialogue, that a blind man would be able to absorb nearly as much of the story as a man who is not blind. NOT very cinematic.
And this is exactly why european films are so much better than american ones these days. Because they are much more aware of how to visualize a story, and let the images tell the story and not the dialogue.
It is is also very exhausting to watch this film, because the tempo is the same all through, with no pauses in the dialogue. which is maybe the biggest problem; that there is no subtext occurring because of the constant rapid dialogue. And that makes it a very dull experience. everything is so spelled out that it leaves no room for the audience to participate. But I guess that's how american studios want it these days. Underestimating the audience."
311,"The 129 min runtime felt like 3+ hours, and it wasn't due to slow pacing, but instead, bad editing combined with a low engaging and boring screenplay. Casting and performances were excellent, as was the cinematography. Directing was decent, and the score was on point. The story may not be forgotten, but this underwhelming film will be. A generous 7/10 from me."
312,"Sorry but this failed to engage me in most ways. It failed to excite, it fails to be dramatic. It is just a bunch of scenes playing out after each other. A lot of scenes border on comedy without being funny, I actually had to look up if it was meant to be a serious movie or not."
313,"I can see this one being taught in classrooms much as ""Twelve Angry Men"" has been. Bravo to everyone involved."
314,The title says it all..The title says it all.The title says it all.
315,I studied the Chicago 10 (8) and now 7 in college because I was obsessed with Abbie Hoffman for many years. While Richard Linklaters animated film is vastly superior because it uses the actual court transcripts and doesnt dramatize it... I never liked Sorkins writing either because the dialogue is way too unrealistic and biting. It seems like he doesnt know how to write rubin and hoffman either (and put more focus on Hayden (even though Hayden is not a good dude)) Also the focus on the lawyer was not really needed... The whole trial was based on the defendents and not him... Too many liberties for one of the most important trials after the 1950s. And honestly after social network... I kind of gave up on Sorkin. How can anyone react that fast? It's too literal.
316,"This is a timely movie politically, about the trial of protesters crossing state lines, police brutality, and resulting riots, as well as cultural and racial strife, and about the consequences of presidential elections on the direction of the Justice Department. Nominally, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a courtroom drama over the riots in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and while Aaron Sorkin, reportedly, wrote a draft of the screenplay as far back as 2007, there's no mistaking the contemporary relevance to 2020. Replace anti-war demonstrations with anti-racist ones and the listing of casualties from Vietnam with those from police killings or the pandemic, and it's essentially a commentary on 2020. Unfortunately, it's still very much a Sorkin picture, too, with all the tropes and particular manner of sanctimonious speechifying that comes with it.If Sorkin weren't such a prolific recycler, I wouldn't find his style as much of a problem, as his repartee can be flashy, but his TV shows and movies are so irritatingly, distinctly his and always the same. I'm not only talking about videos of Sorkinisms one can find on YouTube, either; besides, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" seems, to me upon an initial viewing, at least, to include less of that--maybe because the script has to contend with court and historical records, or maybe I just missed them or was persuaded by the distinction between a favored phrase such as ""I don't give a damn"" being replaced by ""I couldn't care less."" His legal dramas (this one, ""A Few Good Men"" (1992)) are treated as shouting matches, his Silicon Valley forays (""The Social Network"" (2010), ""Steve Jobs"" (2015)) as self-righteous ""Great Man"" narratives, the political ones are naively idealistic (""The American President"" (1995), ""The West Wing"" and ""The Newsroom"" series), and all of that is preferable to when he tackled in his directorial debut a subject I consider myself more knowledgeable of than his usual material, poker (""Molly's Game"" (2017)), the depiction of which was simply incompetent (enough of an indictment of such, but not the only case, is the scene where Tobey Maguire's stand-in supposedly bluffs an opponent into folding ""the nuts;"" I don't care how good a bluffer a player is, one only folds the best possible hand if they don't know what they're doing, but I digress).There are always characters lecturing other character and grand speechifying, including characters reciting obscure quotations (we get Jesus this time) and correcting grammar (those pesky possessive pronouns and vague noun modifiers) in the process, and the even more bombastic scoring. We always get eureka moments (aha, the former attorney general shall be the star witness), two characters on the same side battling over tactics (oddly, this time, it's two British actors arguing over American government, but, I suppose, at least it's not one of those screaming matches Sorkin seems to think make for good rom-com), and an opponent or two on the other side who have principles (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's only role here) while the rest of their side of strawmen are made into buffoons. The good guys, on the other hand, wind up being thin characterizations serving as little more than mouthpieces for Sorkin. The thing that especially bugs me, though, is the constant daddy issues.While Sorkin's usual psychobabble regarding fathers largely escapes the script this time, the one scene where it does emerge unfortunately converges with his slight treatment of the trial's eighth defendant and only African-American one, Bobby Seale (played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Before he disappears from the rest of the picture after the gross spectacle of him being bound and gagged in a courtroom, there's the thudding lecture delivered by him to Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) over the false equivalency of black men being lynched and white men rebelling against their fathers. ""The seven of you, you've all got the same father, right?"" I suppose that bit of dialogue is preferable to Kevin Costner playing a father and a shrink psychoanalyzing his daughter on a park bench, but. seriously, can we go one round without Sorkin psychologizing over abusive, disciplinarian, distant or otherwise imperfect dads. It's become trite. And, as an aside, I wonder whether Hayden really did tag along with his attorneys everywhere, whether or not one of them even did visit Seale in prison even though he wasn't representing him, or was it just poetic license to get Redmayne more screen time. Perhaps, it's like putting Mark Wahlberg in a fictional character to travel everywhere in a based-on-a-true-story so that we supposedly simple-minded spectators may readily follow these supposedly-complex plots.Nevertheless, turning courtrooms into theatre is par for the course for Hollywood, and it can be admittedly entertaining. There've been a few movies, including documentaries, about the trials, so one may view one of them, or read a book or search the web, for a potentially more historically-accurate presentation. By obliquely commenting and taking sides on current events through historical politics, including what I suspect may be a stronger indictment of police and promotion of protesters than may've appeared in earlier transcripts, the characteristically idealistic treatment, sometimes absurdly so, of Sorkin's rap sheet appears, whether one agrees with his views or not, more grounded in reality in this case."
317,"I know that elections are behind the corner so democrats try to highlight progressive youth... Movie is nothing special but if you like Jeremy Strong Or Eddie Redmayne,, those two guys are PHENOMENAL here in rather slow movie with bad flow and badly crafted flashbacks...
Baron Cohen is playing de facto himself.. Movie isnt surely bad, its not boring but its nothing special. My low rating isnt down to anything bad, its just normal movie with nice ending."
318,"Was it right to protest against the involvement of America in the Vietnam war?
Was it right to make life unbearable for the politicians who supported it ?
Yes it was !Undeniably so , absolutely go after those scumbags, run them out of office and put them in jail, even execute some of them if we had the power to do it.But did we need the burning of the buildings and the destruction of bystander businesses? I don't think so!There's got to be a better way to protest, a better way than we're seeing today with the same innocent businesses being destroyed by idiots.And let's face it, a lot of the protesters involved in those protests were just dumb, out of control idiots. They were just the sort of material the likes of Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden like to cash in their beliefs on.Sometimes though, that's the only thing that will get the powers that be to listen so fot the wuck do I know?I just have to hang on to the thought that there's got to be a better way. I mean, even if they're on your side there still has to be some kind of punishment to stop them going lunatic on us. There has to be some sort of responsibility placed on the organizers to keep control of their followers... why should the general public have to pay for it?As for the movie's portrayal of the main combatants, I have to say that I was disappointed in the majority of the performances... What's 'is face Cohen in particular was cringingly lousy as Abbie Hoffman, with the guy who played Rubin coming in a close second.
After seeing Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall you have to say that he was hopelessly miscast for this one. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is like a flat tire.No , this movie is typical Netflix fare, a swimming pool with no deep end, a project completed without any nuance or substructure.And yet... Netflix continues to grow, so I'm very obviously out of synch with the world."
319,"What is this movie trying to do? to me it seems to be quite a forced leftist view, probably some pseudo critique on our times and days, but its far from factual history. add to that some of the most annoying actors or characters you can imagine, very slow tempo and overlength and you get this stuff here. of course the optic is good but thats about it, there is no 60s flair, no songs that let you connect or remember certain scenes and overall i found it very boring. hyped for nothing."
320,"Despite adequately solid production and performances, there are a few major flaws in Aaron Sorkin's film. It never feels cinematic -- instead presenting itself like a television reenactment of a fifty year old trial. It also takes obvious liberties with the actual events in order to shoehorn in cheesy clichés. Perhaps most egregious is the force-fed message that harkens present day unrest. While I happen to agree with that message, it induces overt and repeated eye-rolling."
321,"What a timely piece of propaganda using a widely criticized war. Nice blend of truths and half truths to cloud the reality; open, violent protest against a government that was not responsible for the deaths of MLK or RFK. I guess this is supposed to excuse the looting and riots going on today under the guise of solidarity with the anti-Vietnam War movement?"
322,"Do yourself a favor and watch this one. It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's surely a story you've never heard if you're on the younger side of the age spectrum. Aaron Sorkin once again proves he should stick to screenwriting, but his direction isn't necessarily bad per se. And as for the screenwriting, once again, it isn't Sorkin's best, but a decent Sorkin script is still miles ahead of lots of his competition. Frank Langella portrays a reprehensible judge presiding over this case; a performance that screams Oscar nominee. In my opinion, he is easily the standout. Through his performance he embodies the very complaints the defendants were fighting against.With this said, I think this movie falls into the same trap many socially conscious movies of the 21st century fall into- one-sidedness. The film portrayed The Seven as though they were only fighting for those lives so unnecessarily lost in Vietnam; but to me that idea is so laughable. Like so many ""revolutionaries"" in America at this tome, I believe these men cared more for their roles as 'leaders,' 'figureheads,' and whatnot rather than the cause they were actually fighting for. That complex isn't explored in this movie whatsoever.All in all, this is a good movie to watch but isn't necessarily reinventing anything. Watch it if you want to see a dramatic courtroom drama with fun characters and a cool story."
323,"I am from Worcester Ma, home of Abby Hoffman. The accent of Sacha Cohen was a ridiculous Bostn exageration. It was a conspriacy trial, and the diffrent groups talked before the convention about what they should be doing so they all knew each other. I lived through the trial so I know it more pesonally. These days it was similar to Antifa. They hated the America government."
324,"The film follows the outrageously flawed trial of 7 anti Vietnam protestors accused of inciting a riot.As with all Sorkin projects the script is all and as usual if you can overcome the idea that people don't speak like this where every discussion is a knock it out the ballpark speech, there is a lot of fun to be had here. The cast are terrific including Cohen and Redmayne performing against type, but the real fun is Langella as the appallingly blinkered judge and Rylance as the defence council with the hopeless task of getting his case across.Fun for anyone who likes quick witted courtroom shenanigans."
325,"""The whole world is watching!"" This iconic chant from the protest movement of the '60s is featured multiple times in Aaron Sorkin's ""The Trial of the Chicago 7."" The timing of the film's release as laws against protest movements in the United States gain traction and one of the most important elections in the country's history looms on the horizon is not a coincidence. Sorkin and Netflix, where the film will premiere on October 16th after a three-week limited theatrical run starting today, understand the timeliness of their project. It is meant to spark conversation about how far we've come since the riots of 1968 and subsequent trial in Chicago of the men accused of conspiring to provoke violence in the streets. And it is an accomplished ensemble piece, thick with great performances pushing for space in the same frame. The weight of the subject matter combined with the intensity of the acting here will be more than enough for some people, and I expect a few awards-giving bodies, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it all felt a little too refined and manufactured. That Sorkin sense that everyone knows exactly what to say and do in any given situation, even as they express doubt with perfect diction and vocabulary, fits perfectly for a story like the invention of Facebook in ""The Social Network"" or even the birth of Apple in ""Steve Jobs,"" but the protest movement and the government's attempt to quell it should be more organic than this film ever even flirts with being. It looks and sounds great, but should it?Sorkin wastes no time throwing viewers into the chaos of 1968, introducing viewers to the key players in what would become known as the trial of the Chicago 7 as they plan their trip to the Windy City to protest the Vietnam War during the Democratic National Convention. Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp) encourage peaceful protests with an emphasis on the young lives being lost in an unjust war. Yippies Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) have a more chaotic approach to protest, arguing that dismantling the system only happens when it's disrupted first. David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) is a family man who assures his wife and son that nothing dangerous will happen in Chicago, as Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) promises he too will be in and out without much fanfare.Of course, everyone knows what happened in Chicago in 1968-chaos erupted multiple times, leading to riots that caught international attention. Sorkin starts his film months later, with an angry Attorney General John Mitchell (John Doman) tasking Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Thomas Foran (J.C. MacKenzie) with the case of their lives, trying the men he believes were responsible for the unrest. The power has shifted from LBJ and AG Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton) to Nixon and Mitchell, and they want to use Hoffman, Hayden, and the rest as examples of what will happen to those who protest the war. Mark Rylance plays the main attorney for the seven, William Kunstler, and Frank Langella is phenomenal as Judge Julius Hoffman, a man who teeters on that dangerous edge between incompetent and evil.Clearly, this is a powerhouse cast, and they all relish the opportunity to chew on Sorkin's timely and provocative language. There's really not a weak link in terms of performance, and several of them shine in unexpected ways. Strong finds a winning vulnerability in Jerry Rubin; Rylance nails Kunstler's increasing exasperation at a broken system; Mateen II's simmering rage at even being dragged through the process is palpable; Redmayne finds the right key for Hayden's righteous intellectualism; Keaton is perfect in only two scenes. There are such wonderful individual moments and beats in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" that just watching it as an acting exercise makes it worthwhile.It's when one considers the overall picture that things get a little hazy. The problems stem from Sorkin the director, not Sorkin the writer. Perhaps because of the importance he places on a script he's been developing over a decade and has even more weight with the increased protest movement in 2020, Sorkin gets too precious with his characters and dialogue. It's too polished-there's no dirt under any fingernails, even Jerry and Abbie's. Even a place that self-identifies as the Conspiracy House feels like a perfectly-lit set. These men were facing actual prison time and they very clearly understood their role in history, protest, and even public opinion of the Vietnam War, all during such a messy and uncertain era. But the stakes feel minimized here for that sheen Sorkin does so well, and it doesn't have the emotional impact it should. A different director might have allowed the story to breathe outside of the razor-sharp dialogue and might have reined Sorkin in on some of the overwrought theatrics of the final act.Still, there's much to admire in individual beats of ""The Trial of the Chicago 7."" I never would've guessed how much I would enjoy a hippie buddy comedy starring Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong. Mark Rylance proves again why he's one of our best-he's the standout of the ensemble when it comes to making Sorkin's dialogue sound like it's actually being thought of just before it's spoken. Frank Langella perfectly captures how dangerous it can be when incompetent men hold an amount of power that they're incapable of really comprehending (read into 2020 politics what you will). All of these elements and more make ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" into an engaging drama, but one that could have been as impactful as that unforgettable chant if it was more willing to embrace imperfection. The whole world may be watching, but what are they going to feel when they do?"
326,"Greetings again from the darkness. Tom Hayden, Alex Sharpe, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Bobby Seale, Lee Weiner, and John Froines. Those were the defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot at the 1968 National Democrat Convention in Chicago. So why were there 8, when they are known as the Chicago 7? Well, writer-director Aaron Sorkin (Oscar winner for THE SOCIAL NETWORK, 2010) not only answers that question, but also fills in many of the blanks for those of us who have known only the highlights of the story.This story has been told many times before in books, articles, and other movies, but it's never before had Sorkin's focus on the spoken word and the transcripts pulled from the 1969 trial. For those familiar with Sorkin's work, his penchant for absurdly rapid and a bit too on-the-nose chatter is renowned. Here, he has assembled a truly superb cast that revels not just in the words, but in the historical aspect and the modern day relevance. There are a lot of characters to get familiar with, and Sorkin doesn't delay in introducing each of them by name and affiliation.Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne, Oscar winner for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, 2014) and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp) represent Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and are focused on the lives being lost in the war. Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Rubin) are the leaders of the Youth International Party (the Yippies) and their goal is to disrupt the system through chaos. Actual Boy Scout leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) is a conscientious objector and part of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, aptly nicknamed ""The Mobe"". Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is the leader of the Black Panthers, while Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins) and John Froines (Danny Flaherty, ""The Americans"") were protesters, but can't understand why they are lumped in with the more recognizable group leaders.William Kunstler (Oscar winner, BRIDGE OF SPIES, 2015) and Leonard Weinglass (Ben Shenkman) are the attorneys for all except Bobby Seale, whose attorney was unable to attend due to a medical emergency. Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the hand-picked prosecutor for the Justice Department, while Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella) is the presiding judge. Other key players include Kelvin Harrison Jr as Fred Hampton, leader of the Chicago Black Panthers, and the always great Michael Keaton as former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Lewis.There is a lot going on here for a courtroom drama. The diverse personalities alone make this a must watch. Flashbacks to the violence and the interactions between police and protesters are mixed in between testimonies. We are also taken into the Conspiracy House, where conversations and debates between the accused get quit colorful. There are also glimpses of Abbie Hoffman's college campus speeches/performances which illuminate his thinking, and some of the best conflicts occur when Abbie and Hayden are going at each other in such contrasting manners. Langella's Judge Hoffman is a true lightning rod in the courtroom. Is he biased or incompetent ... or both? His behavior is what drives attorney Kunstler, the ultimate believer in the law, to finally understand what Abbie had said all along ... this was a political trial - a show of governmental power, and an attempt to quash anti-war activists. This trial occurred mere months after Nixon was elected, and though they never share a scene, the sword-fight between newly appointed Attorney General John Mitchell (John Doman) and outgoing AG Ramsey Lewis (Keaton) is a thing of beauty. Keaton especially shines in his two scenes.""The Whole World is Watching"" became a common protest chant as the government worked to shut down the movement to end the Vietnam War. Netflix and Sorkin have capitalized on the current political and social environment to demonstrate what happened 50 years ago ... the more things change, the more they stay the same. Abbie Hoffman states, ""I've never been on trial for my thoughts before"", and that ties in brilliantly with the desire for Cultural Revolution. Hayden's intellect in on display here, and Rylance is the real standout as Kunstler, though Langella (the Judge) and Abdul-Mateen (Bobby Seale) aren't far behind. The scene where Seale is bound and gagged in an American courtroom is one of the most uncomfortable moments I can recall. There may be some questionable directorial choices, but the story and performances make this one to watch."
327,"It's a dialogue-heavy courtroom drama with all the humour, high-stakes intensity, and fiery one-liners (""What's your price?"" ""My life"") of an action film. The script and editing masterfully ramp up the pre-, during-, and post-protest tension simultaneously (adding in Abbie's stand-up was a cool touch) and the cast is excellent (Rylance and Cohen are standouts). The prominence then disappearance of Seale's poignant sub-plot is the only real misstep here (the ending is schmaltzy but effective).
8.5/10 (Amazing)"
328,"While I am partial to the amazing character dynamics of The Social Network, the same capfivating dynamics are found here. Dynamic use of dialouge bouncing from one location to another allows us to understand the habitats of the characters without constant direct explanation.
Overall, as expected this film delivers on what we lock about Aaron Sorkin's work, alongside great performances from this star studded cast."
329,"It feels refreshing when such films are made, although they could be made better. In any case, the anticipated film is a great chance to go back and remember Jean-Luc Goddard's 'Vladimir et Rosa, inspired by the same events, as well as Woody Allen's satirical take 'Bananas', both made in 1971."
330,So relevant in today's times. An Ensemble cast that performs brilliantly together. Great lines written beautifully and delivered with panache. Superb execution of real history in the most realistic manner. I felt the right emotions for the defendants and it is a part of the American history that all other countries need to learn from. A special mention for Sacha Boren Cohen. He deserves great praise for hitting it out of the park. His first dramatic performance and he does so well.
331,"""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a legal drama written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men, The Social Network) based on the true story of the titular anti-Vietnam War protesters. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, and Frank Langella, it brings to light an interesting and overlooked moment during a tumultuous time in American history.In 1968, the Democratic National Convention is set to take place in Chicago while the highly unpopular Vietnam War rages with thousands of American soldiers already killed in the conflict. In protest, several activists set out to demonstrate their outrage over these deaths, including Youth International Party members Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Students for a Democratic Society members Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), National Mobilisation Committee to End the War in Vietnam leader David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins), John Froines (Daniel Flaherty), and Black Panther Party chairman Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). After all of them are arrested five months later, the group are put on trial for attempting to incite riots, with the court presided over by the biased Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella and not related to Abbie).Aaron Sorkin is a name that will often come up when discussing how to write successful dialogue between characters while they are going about their daily lives. He is well known for conveying to the audience a sense of realism that even the most casual of viewer can relate to no matter their social class. Here in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"", Sorkin shows us the account of a surprisingly neglected group of Americans from different walks of life that all share one belief - that the bloodshed in Vietnam needs to end. Not being American myself, the story of these individuals was initially unfamiliar to me and I wasn't sure who any of these people were, although Abbie Hoffman's name did ring a bell. With that in mind, I think the film does a fine job emphasising how much this group of people were in it together through such a lengthy trial and how their important core values united them in the face of adversity, especially when they were at such a strong disadvantage. It is this technique that makes a film like this so engrossing, as it constantly seems as though things could go either way, assuming you are unaware of how the actual trial played out in real life.In addition to writing the screenplay, Sorkin also directed the film, having previously made his debut with 2017's ""Molly's Game"", and he again proves that he is more than worthy of helming this position. Sorkin wears his dialogue trademarks on his sleeve, frequently showing the main characters bouncing off one another with hard-hitting questions related to what this whole trial is really about and if there are constitutional guidelines not being followed, all while several people dying in the war in Vietnam. This draws some thought-provoking parallels to many of the protests that are currently happening in the US today, as the anger of injustice still reverberates even after more than fifty years. Of course, I couldn't help but feel as though some of these dramatisations were clearly exaggerated or played up for entertainment reasons, but then again, a film's primary purpose is to entertain, so I suppose in that regard it succeeds greatly.Being an ensemble cast, it is kind of difficult for me to single out just one of the actor's performances as the winning one. It's always nice to see Sacha Baron Cohen showing his dramatic side, playing activist Abbie Hoffman, perhaps the best known of the titular Chicago 7, and using his skilled mimicry of foreign accents to his advantage to show a politically motivated man wanting peace for his country. I also enjoyed Eddie Redmayne and Alex Sharp as Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, respectively, a pair of students whose youthfulness makes their involvement in this trial a sad reflection of that turbulent era of Vietnam War protests. Mark Rylance also has a memorable part as William Kunstler, the group's lawyer who himself faces discrimination from his superiors. However, Frank Langella is also worth mentioning as Judge Hoffman, an unfair and often prejudiced authority figure who refuses to see things from the perspective of the defendants. All of these roles made the film so much more intriguing, not only because of the actors, but also due to Sorkin's dialogue.In conclusion, much like Spike Lee, it feels as though Aaron Sorkin is somebody who knows that no matter how many years go by, human nature will remain the same. The aforementioned parallels this film has to what is presently happening in the US only serves as proof that filmmakers like them should definitely be acknowledged in this day and age. With so many liberties now at risk in the ""land of the free"", things don't seem like they're getting any better. But at least we have films like this to remind us of what is at stake.I rate it 8/10"
332,Sharp writing as usual from Aaron Sorkin. Entertaining and gripping from the moment it starts.
333,This movie blew me away. The cast was excellent. If you have ever watched a Sorkin project before you can see fingerprints all over this one. Beautifully written and executed like all of his other work. I could watch Sorkin projects all day.I know some of these issues continue to be relevant today. My only complaint with this project and others like it is the exaggerated representation of police officers. It seems like a desperate attempt to pander to certain groups.Overall this movie is incredible. And it will definitely take home some awards.
334,"Good story line.
Good cast.It is so relevant to what happen in the world. Racism and war issues.And how justice can be so wrong because of the stubborness.That dang judge has made my nerves in entire movie.I hope he get his karma for being a bad racist judge."
335,"I expected it to be a serious movie about political movement and trials at court, but after seeing the good reviews here, I gave it a try. I am Asian and did not know about this part of American history until I watched this movie. The movie turned out to be surprisingly entertaining as well! Some of the lines are so funny and witty. The judge is also such a character. Great acting as well! Certainly worth watching!"
336,"I highly recommend The Trial of the Chicago 7 on Netflix. It's a tightly written and intense legal drama with infectious performances to tie it together. Typically I'm against fragmented storytelling, but I think the disjointed style works to the film's benefit of livening investment. It's got such a rich vibe to it, similar to The Social Network. It was written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, after all.Emotionally-driven and powerfully acted, the film poetically mirrors much of this year's racial and political unrest without straying from hard-hitting truths of the iconic 1969 trial and its preceding events. I haven't seen many films this year because of COVID-19, but this is definitely among the best. It may not be a fact-based documentary, but it's still a relevant and captivating watch, raising intriguing questions about the integrity of law and protest."
337,Sasha and JGL kill it in this limited series. I love shows covering history of the past most don't know about. Very informative . Highly recommend
338,"Trial of the Chicago 7 has the best cast of the year, a script from Aaron Sorkin, and lot of elements that are extremely timely. It's impossible to not at least be absorbed in this film, and I was absorbed from the the very beginning to the end. With that being said, I don't think Aaron Sorkin is as good of a director as he is a writer and that brings this film down in some ways, but this is still an old fashioned crowd pleaser that everyone can get something out of."
339,"Great acting, writing and directing. Highly recommend."
340,"""The Trial of Chicago 7"" showcases a very mighty true-to-life events, delivering a strong and important relevance to the present. Diector Aaron Sorkin managed to engaged viewers to the drama and intrigue-filled courtroom where every cast splendidly gave their exceptional performances, from Mark Rylance's to Sacha Baron Cohen's. While the script gave an adequate justice to the story in Sorkin's way of order, the riot scenes seemingly needed a better attachment of spectacle and intensity to tone with the potential the courtroom scenes presented. To sum up, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" is a must-see film and easily one of the best of 2020, paving its way to Academy Awards stage in 2021."
341,"When I first approached this movie, I had no idea what happened in 1968 in Chicago. I knew that there were some protests against the war in Vietnam, but I had no idea who was involved and what happened precisely. However, the movie manages to introduce events and players that took part to riots perfectly with no need of prior knowledge (but a quick visit to the Wikipedia page wouldn't hurt). It highlights flaws on both protesters and law enforcement sides. The movie, exactly like a trial, is impartial, or at least tries to be.The editing is amazing, it has a really good rhythm and kept me glued to the screen for the entire length. The movie most of the time shows the trial but sometimes comes back in time, with short but really effective flashbacks that explains what happened during the riot days. The tension buildup is amazing and everything is how is suppose to be: the music, the acting and the photography. The cast is top notch, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Cohen and Mark Rylance stole the scene: their performances were memorable. Other big names were involved such as Carroll Lynch and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that this time had a secondary role therefore not much screen time. I did not like at all the portrayal of the judge that was painted like a stupid guy that did not understand anything about the law. This is for sure the main flaw of the film, at least for me.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is engaging, I never felt bored, even if topics treated are not really easy to process, creators did their best to keep this movie simple and very entertaining."
342,"Always fond of historic movies, this is one of the better ones of late. This movie uses some real footage of those days to get that 'true story' feeling right from the start, and it's used a couple of times throughout. The era is that of the Vietnam protests, the American youth tired of a foreign war that was far away, and a government that couldn't afford to lose/end it. Since I've been watching US-movies for over 4 decades, I found a lot of scenes and decors recognizable and fairly genuine. What I did however learn over the years is that a viewer has to realize that, even though based on true events, it is still a scripted drama to keep things interesting and viewers happy. It might be interesting to read the actual courtroom papers.What Hoffman for instance says in the trial was very noteworthy, but was it actually said?
Richard Schultz: 'So how do you overthrow or dismember, as you say, your government peacefully?'
Hoffman: 'In this country, we do it every four years.He, and many others protested for change and peace, but Nixon was elected and the war went on for another 6 years."
343,"I was a middle school student when this trial was going on. At the time, I was very interested in law and government, and ultimately became an attorney. After the case concluded, I read a number of books about the trial, including many by members of the 7/8. I had the chance to see William Kunstler speak when I was in college in the mid 1970's, just a few years after the case.
I would first refer anyone to the Facebook posts of Rennie Davis and Michele Dellinger (David's daughter) regarding the film itself. As I understood them, Sorkin did not contact any of the surviving members of the 7 or their families. This concerned them, though Rennie Davis was still positive overall.
I would compare the movie to an abridged version of the case. Some dramatic license was taken, but the message was still communicated. I would recommend it to someone who wasn't around when it happened, as a starting point to learn more. The LBJ footage near the beginning refreshed my memory and made it clear the man was evil, pure and simple.
I did have some concerns. Jerry Rubin was portrayed as a fragile, passive soul in need of a relationship. In reality, he was anything but. The writing and acting performance did not do him justice whatsoever. (I have since read the ""Daphne"" agent was not real--making it stupid and unnecessary.) Weiner and Froines were less involved, but not as UNinvolved as portrayed. I have been a fan of Frank Langella, and appreciate his performance, given the cinematic license necessary in bringing a story this complicated to the screen. That having been said, he gave Julius Hoffman more dignity than Hoffman ever had. As one who followed the trial, I can say he actually made him look BETTER than the IRL ""Judge."" Foran had political ambitions and threw racist comments around during his failed campaign. He was not a potted plant who sat there and watched wheels go round and round.
In the interest of space, the other members of the 7/8 and the attorneys ranged from adequate to great.
If you watch it, enjoy it (I really did), and use it as a beginning to learn more. If you don't you'll never know the real, and complete, story."
344,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a remarkable dramatization of the trial outcome of the protest march at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. The leaders of the resistance became like rock stars for prompting the demonstrations against the Vietnam war and coincidentally police brutality: Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong), Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), Bobbie Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the national chairman of the Black Panther Party, and David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), and Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp) are featured.The docudrama does a superlative job differentiating the combatants, given the number of them and their large personalities. Hayden is depicted as the most reasonable and Bobby Seale the most volatile while Hoffman is a witty provocateur. He trial is worth seeing itself for fine actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt as the level-headed prosecutor, Richard Schultz; Mark Rylance as inveterate interrupter defense lawyer, William Kunstler; and Frank Langella as the beleaguered judge, Julius Hoffman. The actors make you feel as if you are in the courtroom with the famous participants.The courtroom is the scene of the film's most tumultuous action (even more so than the original footage of the riots), for instance, when Seale is brought back into the courtroom bound and gagged.
Today's local rioting over police brutality is a cautionary reminder of those anarchic times in 1968.Less dramatic but just as poignant is the testimony of Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton), former attorney general, for the defense. As it turns out, the judge would not allow the jurors to hear his testimony. This is real-life drama almost too hard to believe.The Trial of the Chicago 7 is historical dramatization at its best-accurate history and relevance to our own times. As Dellinger ominously told his family before the demonstration, ""Mayor Daley is not going to let his city turn into a theater of war."" An apt description of what actually happened.""So your brother's bound and gagged
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to Chicago just to sing
In a land that's known as freedom, how can such a thing be fair
Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring""
Graham Nash, ""Chicago,"" 1971"
345,"While the film is well paced, tightly scripted and well acted, it strikes me as funny that a film that seems to be made in the light of the events of 2020, has no actual substance in terms of social injustice. Bobby Seale disappears after his friend is killed by police. Never to be seen again, simply a plot device for the seven white men on trial. by the way, the real version of Sacha Baron Cohen's character was in his early thirties during this trial. Cohen is close to fifty and you can tell the whole time. anyway, continuing, every single woman in the film was either a useless body there to pad the scene (Dellingers wife), a victim of men, or a manipulative consort. the film has a scene where the secretary gets a call and a guy is harassing her, the tone of which being ""oh even she's a target because she's a woman, oh the other side is so evil"" and then the only time she's mentioned again is when Mark Ryland's turns around and gives her an order. so, yes, it's a fine movie and will probably be nominated for Oscars because this is the kind of oatmeal movie they want you to watch. but it's pretty goddamn hamfisted, probably the worst possible version of a Sorkin movie."
346,"All the rave reviews from people here puzzle me, they can't all be fake. I'm guessing that most of them are impressed with a decent movie in such a terrible year and that anything that's even remotely decent is applauded.
It's a good movie with a few compelling scenes but it not in any way moving or emotional. The court room scenes are bland and predictable and there is nothing revealing or heart warming throughout the whole movie. The ending is kinda lame.
There are far too many stories of police violence or social justice warriors that haven't been told to choose from if the director wanted to truly try to make a difference. This film feels like a safe and uncontroversial film to make without causing too much of a fuss from the government in power.
There are plenty of stories more intense, hopefully we can get more directors with a spine to come forward and risk something for a change."
347,"What keeps this movie from being great in my opinion is the organization of how the story is told. It does that thing where a movie will start in the middle of a story and reveal the beginning of the story somewhere near the end of the movie. In this movie and a few other movies I've seen, telling the story in this order is completely unnecessary and makes the film confusing at times. I also would've like to see a little more of yahya abdul mateen II and the black panthers. Other than that this movie wasn't bad at all but it could've been next level, especially considering the times we're in."
348,"When you have to add this many fake scenes to a movie because the real event was so boring, it's better to make superhero movies. Hopefully these movies at least make some people look up the real stories"
349,"The movie is good. Sharp dialogue, great performances. But I read some comments comparing the Chicago 7 with Antifa. That's the most uninformed opinion if there ever was. Main differences? Let's start with the most obvious: the Chi 7 were fighting for freedom of speech, Antifa is well known for silencing speech that they disagree with. Another one? (For the most part) the protest were very peaceful during the 60s, very intelectual, they were protesting the Vietnam War. Antifa is extremely violent and his members were masks, boots and handmade weapons. The last one? The Chi 7 were proud americans, left leaning, progressive, open minded americans, Antifa is known to burn flags and chant anti-american slogans. So get your fact straight."
350,"The film is in the spirit of today, when the mainstream liberal media glorifies the left-wing cultural revolution carried out by BLM and antifa. Any sympathy for terror and chaos is mindless."
351,"A long winded tedious film that frankly would have been better if it wasn't so verbose, hard to follow, and poorly directed. It assumes that every viewer knows the background to the Chicago7(8)."
352,"I thought about giving it a thorough review, seeing that nf is trying to do some heavyweight stuff. But decided that I'd only give praise for cinematography, acting, crew efforts. Can't praise the content. It's okay, but it is way too biased to be seen as anything other than pure entertainment cinema fiction, albeit with terrific ensemble cast. 6/10. Great toupee."
353,"Netflix has tons of uninteresting products. I had to pick one movie. I knew what I was getting into when I picked this burning bush.Let's say these events are 100% legit and organic like the moon landing.This long ugly dopey movie is about propaganda. These movies victimized, torcher and belittles the victims. Up until the very very end so we can all go home...I mean (in 2020) stay home happy.These problems always start with the BEAST SYSTEM. Then Little billy gets blamed for wanting ""freedom"". Then the BEAST SYSTEM gives you something to keep you quiet and happy.Cops, politics, government, judge are always seen as the devils in these movies but no one notices. They behave the same in all propaganda events and movies because they hold all the power.It's a redundant mess of history. We see it more so in Race bait movies. Is oppression a form of entertainment?Overall an ugly looking movie. The Acting has some up in coming greats and few recognizable actors.
Its a propaganfear and a lil of a race bait movie.Verdict: Nothing to see here but an ugly looking movie."
354,"Going into this film pretty blind as to the events i can't confirm the accuarcy of the timeline of events as some people are faulting it for, it's a fantastic piece of cinemas. The pacing is just brilliant with the way it cuts back and forth. It's not a stretch of the imagination despite your political leanings to really believe the mistreatment the defendants suffered and can easily be applied to modern day situations. Both my partner and I had tears in our eyes by the end of it."
355,What a great Movie! I was caught by it from the first second! I didn't know anything about the story and what was going on in Chicago by that time but now I really wanna find out more about it.
356,"I was highly sceptical about this film thinking it would be just another court drama about some Vietnam protests in America and to be frank, it was just that. What was different in this case was that the entire focus was shifted to the concept of protesting and thanks to Aaron Sorkin's solid writing it turned out to be a surprisingly interesting film. Oh, and of course the absolutely stacked cast managed to skillfully compliment each other without hogging the spotlight.As insinuated by it's title, the film is a long trial with flashbacks of what has caused the protesters to clash with the police. You might think, who cares about some little nameless riot 50 years ago that I should be watching a 2 hour courtroom drama about it? Personally, I felt the same but I was intrigued by all these star actors and I sort of challenged Sorkin to make me genuinely interested and I got to admit that he pulled it off.The film is a balanced blend of real life events on the streets of Chicago and the courtroom blabbering. However, here the blabbering turned out to be lively, engaging and even humorous. The cast did an outstanding job as each person played their respective part in keeping the story engaging with Mark Rylance, Sacha Baron and Frank Langelle being my favorites.While most of the story feels neat and connected, the film fails to stir up any kind of genuine emotion or an afterthought mainly because of the source material. Still, I would recommend this movie because of the sheer enjoyment of watching great actors put on a show in every scene which is a rarity in 2020.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"
357,"Sorry, but I didn't get the memo: I'd never heard of this trial and by the end of it I can't say I was actually that interested. A rather disparate collection of acting talent portray an equally imbalanced group of left-wing/hippie/civil rights protesters charged after violent confrontations with police in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic Convention. The accused consist of Eddie Redmayne (Tom Hayden) and Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman) amongst seven who are (save for Hoffman) represented by prominent civil rights lawyer William Kunstler (Sir Mark Rylance) whilst the case for the Government is led by Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has been especially chosen by the US Attorney General, ostensibly to make sure an example is made of these ""hooligans"". As the story develops, somewhat predictably, it turns out that the real star of the whole film is Frank Langella as the Judge - Julius Hoffman - who has, what I can only rather kindly describe as, competence issues - and in this role Langella shines; he is excellent and puts the others in this rather routine, seen it all before courtroom drama, to shame. I dare say that this trial - like so many we are reading about these days was a pivotal moment in the constantly fluid and evolving scenario of the US Government's heavy handed treatment of it's citizens, but after a while these stories lose potency and just fuel the increasing image that the so-called ""land of the free"" is anything but. The last twenty minutes include some inter-cut actuality of the protests that augments it no end - but largely, for me, it's OK - nothing better."
358,This is a great and compelling story but the film looses its momentum at times which is frustrating. Despite that it's one to watch.
359,"Most of the movie is great, with compelling performances by an all-star cast, (especially the judge, who legitimately chilled me at one point!)
But sadly it comes apart a bit in the final scene. To put it mildly, the ending is absurd and it undercut the gravity of everything that came before (I nearly yakked in my mouth when the PROSECUTOR stood at attention).
As he has in the past (The Newsroom) Aaron Sorkin gave in to sentimentality, and by doing so he lost credibility.
7/10. The actors gave it their all, but the writer should have let the true story speak for itself."
360,"Give me a moment would you friend, I've never been this disappointed by an Aaron Sorkin-scripted film before. The Trial of the Chicago 7 may contain the razor-sharp, fast-paced, melodic Sorkin dialogue that I adore, but the quips and banter here often feel misjudged for the film's serious subject matter. Perhaps if Spielberg (even a later-day Spielberg) had directed, as was the original intent, the film would have better balanced its crowd-pleasing sensibilities and societal critiques. Instead, despite earnest performances from the entire cast (especially Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman), Sorkin's edit is a mess - the direction is dull, the tone is inconsistent, and the score frequently undercuts the action on-screen. The script might only need a slight touch-up, but the film itself needs a whole new draft."
361,"Keep in mind , who wrote and directed this movie, Aaron Sorkin. While a very good writer, his political leanings are extremely far left.So this is his interpretation of the events that happened during the trial.He tends to showcase those characters that share his feelings, as the hero.Take the meaning of this movie with a grain of salt."
362,"Another Netflix movie with crap lighting. Court rooms, meeting rooms and offices are not that dark. People don't work in darkness. Enough with the fake side lighting from obviously fake windows. Light doesn't behave like that. Turn some damn lights on."
363,"Disgusting propaganda. This doesn't deserve one star. It is not drama, it's not documentary, it is a brutal political propaganda. Hollywood should finally do something for mankind and stop making those horse dungs."
364,"Not a bad film altho the performances of Redmayne, Cohen and Rylance make you squirm at times as their American accents flip between states - the vision of the 60s isn't caught well in the film, just throw in some people with long hair or dyed bandanas....that'll do. Overall wasn't awful but I was hoping it would be more impactful, rather than a quick skip through the trial with a comedically geriatric judge as the only interesting character"
365,"This has a lot of the hallmarks of an Aaron Sorkin work - good, rapid fire dialogue which will draw you in. It's pretty good but feels about 20 mins too long. Mark Rylance and Frank Langella are excellent. However in my opinion Baron Cohen, Strong, and Redmayne are badly cast. Strong and Baron Cohen are not good actors and it they drag the film down; their wigs also look like something from a school play. I've liked Redmayne in other things but he seems out of his depth here. Redmayne and Baron Cohen's accents are also all over the place. Worth watching if you've nothing else to do but it's not Sorkin's best."
366,"2 stars for the great cast they wasted on this film. It started out like a goofy comedy, but quickly became dull and boring. This movie never became entertaining, and I'm very easily entertained trust me. I binge stuff like this quite often! This one I had to turn off. So dumb I couldn't finish it."
367,"I won't base my review on political beliefs. Despite it being overly left-leaning, I was entertained and Mark Rylance was fantastic. It's not historically accurate (but that won't stop most viewers from taking it as factual). I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle. It's worth a watch!"
368,"Between 196..ish and today, government behavior, action and reactions did not change too much. WHAT change is MEDIA, and not in a good way, this movie is an example, take a look at PBS ""Vietnam War"", the way networks did their reporting back then and today.
In the past let say 20 years, did we see any trial like this ? Think about whistle-blowers that got convicted on a 1917 law for showing how Reuters journalists got killed; think about some that are on run for exposing government illegal activities, or maybe for journalists jailed or fined for refusing to identify confidential sources. And take a look on how media (left, right or of ""neutral"" orientation) reacted and reported."
369,I wanna hear the name of the vietnamese killed too.That was a dealbreaker for me. White guy dramatizes USA. More of the same. The scene when Bobby Seale speaks about how the fight from an intelectual mindset is different from a very physical one (ropes on a tree). Destroyed the whole point in watching the trial of the Yippies. Made it small.Also I wanna hear the names of the vietnamese men and women killed too.
370,"It's well acted and a good recount not those events but with the movie industry, like the press, is so leftist can we trust that it's an accurate depiction? Aside from that I detest the constant blasphemy of the name of Jesus Christ so prevalent in films today."
371,"This film start with a footage of the recruitment of army to Vietnam, and a bunch of people planning to demonstrate at the Democratic National Convention scene! As turnout, this film is about the trial of seven people, who incite the riot at the Democratic National Convention! Entire film quite long, slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the argument scene, overuse of the receiving phone call scene, and overuse of the flashbacks scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Rennie hit by a police on the head! At the end, Tom reading out the names of the fallen army at Vietnam, while performing his statement! Still have an article indicate each of the defendant sentence to five years in the federal prison for incite riot at the Democratic National Convention! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
372,"That's right, we're not goin' to jail because of what we did, we're goin' to jail because of who we are!There was a good film desperately trying to break out in The Trial of the Chicago 7 but it never really succeeded.
There was just too much wrong with it for it ever to work properly.The film is based on the infamous 1969 trial of seven defendants charged by the federal government with conspiracy and more, arising from the countercultural protests in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.Who better to direct a political courtroom drama than Aaron Sorkin.
I love his past work and the super fast , extremely clever dialogue but not this time .
This time Sorkin seems to have bitten of more than he can chew.For a two hour film , it's amazing how little of the story we actually see and that's not surprising as the trial lasted over six months .
Because there is so much to tell , Sorkin misses out important sections including amazingly , the court verdict!There are some really good performances from the likes of Mark Rylance and Frank Langella but there are also some poor performances from especially Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne . Miscasting can probably be blamed for that.The final moments of the film , with the sickly music , is obviously meant to be emotional and thought provoking but for me it just felt flat and flat pretty much sums up the whole film , which is such a shame ."
373,"Some great elements but had to switch it off halfway through. None of the conversations showed authenticity to me. Every line should have meaning in a film, but they don't all have to be oneliners and have such weight. Nobody talks like that and it's exhausting to watch. Loved Eddie Redmayne's performance. The ending...cringe. Haven't we seen this scene already in so many films? The crowd starts clapping, the prosecution stands up, music starts playing...Overall, glad they highlighted this story, but expectations were higher."
374,"I found it boring! I am not an American and I am not very political interested in the Vietnam war. It was slow, a lot of boring dialogue and just not much to keep me interested, to be honest. Thank God I didn't have to sit in a seat in the theatre for over 2 hours. At least the pandemic is good for something. (A little joke there)Good actors, the judge was funny. Other than that it was a waste of my time, even now that we have so much time at home.I'll give it 5/10 because I know it is important and fun for some."
