Entertainment value next level, whish I can say even I haven't watched a movie like this in Hollywood or any other industries. If someone say this movie doesn't have a good story, then probably that person doesn't know what is a epic story. Music in this movie does its best with unbeatable sounds that makes you amaze. In whole movie I didn't even saw a single scene which doesn't have no logic. This should hit The Indian Best film ever. Such a superb emotional beats that even made me cry. Suriya and all other cast had made their best action to make this film best. Beginning, ending, pacing, dialogue, editing, cinematography, camera work, costume design etc. had done their best to make this movie ""Nothing better than this Soorarai Pottru"""

30,What an inspiring and emotional movie.. Wow... Suriya lives as maara. Extraordinary acting.. What a screen play.. Aparna and oorvasi acting class.. Worth for watching üëèüëå
31,"Can't express it..go and see the film
Extraordinary performance from Suriya
GVPrakash and Sudhakongara done a magic"
32,"An inspiring story that revolutionized the aviation industry, lands as a cleverly packaged dramatic flick.Absolutely in awe with a never-seen-before #Suriya, truly a captivating performance by him and even the minute of expressions strike hard. And, his character 'Nedumaaran Rajangam' is full of üî•. #AparnaBalamurali is amusing in a terrifically-written character. The chemistry between the lead is something to talk about, there are multiple sequences between their sparkling eyes that creates magic. All the supporting artists have a purpose and have done complete justice to their roles.Easily brings in the emotional attachment from the very beginning, gets us highly invested and feel for the characters. Tears and goosebumps guaranteed. Whatever mood the scenes carry gets transformed to the viewers too, which is a crucial part of the filmmaking art, loud applause to director #SudhaKongara and team. Cinematic liberty is utilized to the perfect level, knowing the limit to which audience will be okay to believe, placing an important part of the flashback in the President-Meeting scene is a perfect example of that. The film never loses its focus from the story, on-point. Intensity-level of certain situations is sure to increase our pulse rate. There's so much that is going on-screen and the beauty is it's so clearly conveyed and the flow is seamless. Dialogues add so much value to the subject and they are very naturally placed, word choices and the slang too. Amidst the bunch of memorable scenes, business meet with villain in his flight, Udipi Hotel sequence, All India Radio interview and the climax stand out.#GVPrakash's musical treatment is rich. The songs have impressed already, visually-good too. Except for a couple of minor facts that the opening number could have choreographed in a better manner and some songs have been cut-shortened in the film. The camera work is outstanding. Set work, costumes and make-up are apt for the timeline of the setting. Some tiny jump cuts looked odd, otherwise, the film has been neatly-edited. Feels slightly stretched towards the end. Also, VFX could have been better in the flight-in-the-air shots.
Direct #OTT release,
now streaming on #AmazonPrimeVideo."
33,"Really there many goosebumps moments. And the director should be appreciated whole heartedly. Suriya, you deserve this and it deserves you Stellar performance!!!!!!!!"
34,It's one of the best movies for Suriya. GVM's songs and background score is out of the world. All the characters were given importance. Sudha mongara brings the best from every actor.. overall semma movie..

Sudha kongara direction was excellent in this movie
The actors in this movie is excellent and this is their best work in their carrier"
63,Sudha has given a simple down to the earth movie without any exaggerations. The performance of each and every major character is brilliant. Finally someone gave different acting opportunities to Suriya. Suriya's Maara makes us cry and smile along with him. But it is Aparna and Oorvasi who steal the show in many places. Strong women characters from a woman director. Kudos to that. Sudha's brilliant filmmaking downplays every big moment in the film using subtle references and good acting instead of mass masala style reveals.
64,"Suriya is back . Udipi hotel scene , airport ticket scene extrondinary"
65,After lockdown watched superb movie and one of the best motivational movie

Overall an adrenaline rush film with great writing and impactful performance from all cast."
142,"Suriya is back with a bang. Sudha Kongara has written and directed an outstanding depiction of Capt. Gopinath's life story. Every actor from Aparna Balamurali to Karunas to Paresh Rawal have done justice to their roles. But this is a Suriya film through and through. You will enjoy the power of the common man through Suriya's eyes. Only regret is that people will not be able to enjoy this inspiring movie in the theatre.
G.V Prakash's music adds so much gravitas to the film. Happy Diwali 2020! Enjoy this film with friends and family. This is a Diwali treat!"
143,That's a great movie acted by Suriya and directed by sudha kongara.

168,"Epic...film with good content
Super direction...sudha u nailed it"
169,"Roosevelt once said, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams"". Surya's new movie Soorarai Pottru can be handily deciphered using that quote.Well, the story is loosely based on the life of G.R Gopinath, the founder of Simplifly Deccan, formerly known as Air Deccan. But the story penned by Sudha Kongara took the liberty of changing the whole atmosphere to suit the cinematic language, where Gopinath became Maaran along with the portrayal of other characters.The story is no different from the usual inspirational movies that garner the viewer's appreciations. The story goes like this. A man from the lower section of society tries to achieve his dream, and while striving to make it a reality, he had to follow a path of thorns and sharp stones. Yes, it's the same old story.However, the characters are strong and their profundity makes the movie engaging. The stellar performances from the likes of Surya, Aparna, Urvashi, Paresh, Mohan Babu and many others take the movie to another level. The music by GVP is also worth mentioning. The soul of the movies like this finds the way with tunes like this.The presence of bold female characters and depictions of lower Indian society tries to talk more than the story of a person trying to fly high. Certain caricatures like Ballaiyya (Vijay Mallya) and the likes of many others are in the movie.Since the movie is loosely based, let's say that these characters are arranged for enhancing the cinematic experience. Wait, there is a scene from one of these characters that give goosebumps. Watch the movie and experience it. Let's keep it a secret.Apart from prominent features, I felt a lack of WOW factor at times. Especially, the climax should be more worked in that way. But Sudha's version went for melodrama in those places. As mentioned earlier, this story is meant to be an inspirational one, and when such a story is presented on-screen it should be able to provide in full with horripilation. But that was missing from the climax.Meanwhile, when we look at the bigger picture the movie as a whole is thought-provoking and enthralling that compels the viewers to experience the hardships that Maaran confronted in his way to achieve his dream.This is a movie that deserved a theatrical release. Sudha Kongara's directorial debut provided a quality OTT release among the likes of many who provided lacklustre experiences to the viewers. As a fan of the OTT platform, I expect much more quality movies to reach the comfort of our home."
170,"This film is completely different from what we have seen in Kollywood. Suriya's acting in this film was the best. Female lead Aparna will get more chances in coming days. GVM music was best in few scenes especially flight scene in the beginning. Villain role perfect. No fight scenes but still the movie was thrilling n gripping throughout the movie. Worth watching. Hope Suriya will take up this kind of story in future .
Flying High"
171,This movie is inspiration and very realistic acting for the Surya and all cast performance and heart touching scenes
172,Surya acting veralevelüòä direction awesome. Bgm good background score
173,Must watch. It's an super acting of suriya and Aparna. Supr direction
174,"Sooraraipottru Revolves around the character maara who dared to achieve his dream by breaking all his barriers.suriya given life to the character maara and lived like maara .The story is so inspirational because the whole movie is based on the biopic of captain G.r gopinath.Aparna and Urvashi done their best .
The music is the finest thing of the movie
Perfectly done by g.v prakash .All other characters who portrayed maara's friends also done their job best . Sudha kongara the director is the sole of the movie."
175,Very well written and directed. Amazing casting esp the lead actress.. its a must watch ..
176,"The man who was stuck in a role in varanam aaiyram for several years is finally out of it. Delivers class acting.
Sudha nailed it as a director, she crafted every frame to say the least.
Aparna should win a national award specially if she has dubbed for herself.
BGM score is elevating the movie, right level and right mixture.
All the characters gets at least a scene to prove, and they have all done it.
The movie may differ slightly from the facts but this the right story to be told."
177,I think the govt of india really wants to give an national award for best movie and for best actor . Its not just a movie it is an inspirational emotion . we are proud to have a actor like suriya sir

Suriya sir hard work never fail"
184,Absolutely in awe with suriya's performance ... Best comeback ever
185,"This not a movie. It's a dream of middle class Indian youths, Who Want to achieve.
It's biography with some masala of Capt. Gopinath.
Sudha gave üíØ justice to his story. Mara is Gopinath. Angry young man.
Aishwarya what character yaar. Every aspiring men's dreamgirl. If this kind of women in our life. We can smash our bad fate. We can help write the fate of this world.
Especially, the scene when mara refuse to sell his airlines. Literally I shed drops of tears when ""SAAPTLA VISHAM VACHITIYA"" scene"
186,Simply Fly Soorarai Pottru this will be one masterpiece in biopic. Breaking the class of barrier. what an amazing variations from Shriyanga.
187,"Absolutely loved every moments, wholesome content."
188,"I'LL KEEP MY REVIEW SHORT AND CLEAR.
Bollywood. Please learn from south Indian film industry on how to make films on biography. In other words, learn how to make movies from them."
189,"This is a best you could ever watch. Dream High untill you reach the Sky. Well Scripted and Executed. Director at her best. Suriya's acting is a Life time performance.Just Watch the Cult Classic movie. Its not a one time watchable movie, it has many details.
One WORD. ""MASTERPIECE"""
190,"Soorarai Pottru / Praise the Brave.
Easily the best of 2020, this is not just another film. This is a masterpiece. Based on Captain Gopinath and his struggle to launch Air Deccan, the cheapest airlines in the world against the tycoons that have been pumping profit into their pockets with their airline business.
This film is a rare gem that has nailed every aspect.
Surya, after a long gap returns and he does it with such a bang. He does take you on a rollercoaster ride, makes you cry and makes your blood boil.
Aparna Balamurali finally gets something to show off her ability. The character she plays is not just another woman character to romance the lead. She is a pillar that props up the lead. The other pillar? The mother, played by the great Urvashi.
Karunas, Vivek, Krishna Kumar, Gnanasambandham have been incredible. No matter how short the roles are,they do make an impact in the story, perhaps guide the protagonist and support him in his journey.
Mohan Babu as Naidu was a pleasant addition. Adding goosebumps when the protagonist lose all hopes.
Paresh Rawal- in his Tamil debut- does a brilliant job as the ruthless cunning antagonist.
Vijay Kumar- the dialogue writer- deserves an applause- every line was fuel to the fire that burns up in veins of viewers.
Sudha Kongara- the director- shows us she can make biopics that can give you goosebumps, a film that you ll remember, a story that can inspire you to dream the impossible, a movie that engages you for two and a half hours without letting your attention go astray."
191,One of the finest movies ever made in india. Suriya's acting is unbelievable. He is nailed it in each scenes.
192,"It is nothing less than Director Sudha mam's gameplay! Actors - everyone acted as like a competetion event! Also competetion is tooo terriffic.
Love,Passion,Friendship,Care everything was crafted and it came out beautifully! One of the best in Surya's career! I repeat one of the best!"
193,Excellent Movie. Everybody acted very well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. This is one of the Best Tamil Movie of 2020. Excellent Movie.
194,"Plus PointsSuriya gives one of his career-best performances with this film. The intensity which we have been missing in Suriya's recent performances is brought back superbly by the star actor. From scene one, Suriya is magnificent as the restless soul who wants to fulfill his dreams. Be it in the interval scene where his dream is shattered or the climax episode, where he goes through a roller coaster of emotions, Suriya steals the show and will arrest you with his performance.One of the biggest pillars of the film is the heroine Aparna Balamurali. She gives solid support to Suriya and plays the doting wife's role supremely well. The way she looks, expresses her emotions, and showcases solid chemistry with Suriya is the major asset of the film. Mohan Babu does not have much screen time but in the three scenes he gets, the legendary actor impresses and brings depth to the film.One can not forget the emotional aspect of the film. Sudha Kongara's writing is so strong that every emotion works in the film. The husband-wife angle, mother-son relationship, and conflict between Suriya and Paresh Rawal, all these episodes have gripping emotions.Paresh Rawal is classy in his role and brings a lot of depth to the film. The production design is solid and visuals of the bygone era have been showcased in a superb manner. The film is filled with several goosebump oriented scenes and will impress you with its engaging narration.
Minus PointsThe film runs on a very serious note and that is the reason some of the regular audiences who expect something from Suriya will be disappointed. Also, the pace of the film is a bit slow as the story unfolds leisurely and in detail. The first ten minutes post interval becomes dull with too much melodrama. There are no special twists or turns in the story and the proceedings are straightforward.Technical AspectsThis film is super strong in terms of its technical Aspects. Music and BGM are a major plus as GV Prakash fills life into the proceedings. The camerawork is astonishing as the village set up and aviation backdrop are showcased nicely. The VFX used for the film is also top-notch. Satyadev dubs for Suriya and it takes at least ten minutes for you to adjust to his voice. But once that is done, Satyadev does so well. The lyrics, Telugu dubbing, and costume design, everything falls in place perfectly.Coming to the director Sudha Kongara, she has proved her worth once again. The manner in which she mixes facts with nice fictional elements was so good to see. Sudha stays true to the emotions and showcases gritty drama which is the biggest highlight of the film. She makes us root for Suriya's character right through the film and this is where you get connected to the emotions of a man who dreams big and shows how things are achieved.
VerdictOn the whole, Aakasam Ne Haadu Ra is one of Suriya's best performances to date as he lives in his role and takes us on a roller coaster of emotions. The setup, amazing performances, superb production values, and engaging drama light up the screen from scene one. Barring a slightly slower pace, this is one of the very well made films in recent times and makes up for an inspiring watch. Don't miss it."
195,Even though inspired from a real story the movie is too overdramatic and for the sake of having an antagonist they created as usual a rich person as if being rich is evil.
196,Awesome surya as an monster.surya is king of Kollywood
197,"Amazing screenplay and bgm. A must watch movie. Expectations full filled to the core, thanks to the director and team. You really took us into the story without making us bored for a single frame . I loved it ."
198,Amazing inspirational movie from suriya. This movie will be a mile stone for suriya in his career.
199,"#Super movie
There are no words for suriya acting
Love you suriya
A good inspiring movie for the youth to stood on there dream"
200,"FEELS 2020 BEST MOVIE ‚ù§ , WORTH WATCH . . SOORARAI POTTRU üî•"
201,"I feel we often confuse good entertainment with a good movie. Was this movie a good time pass and entertainment? Yes, it was - mainly because it has played to many formulas - an overly idealistic male protagonist, love that blooms against all hardships, a super brutal villain, blow after blow to good people, and good triumphing over evil. This is the basic hero victory plot that many movies try to follow - but thanks to tight writing, good actors, and other camera elements, it succeeds here.That said, to follow this formula, the writer has taken huge liberties with logic and realism. I don't expect movies to have complete logic and be totally realistic, but I do expect a good portion of these in a semi-biopic. Also, by following the cliched arc, the director has let go of a more nuanced character development. The protagonists are all oh-so-perfect. The antagonists are laughably over-the-top horrible. The wife is loyalty and encouragement personified. The villagers are all touchingly generous. Please give us a break.I am okay with people saying they liked the film. I am just concerned that most of them claim they identify with Maran and they are inspired and such bs. Anyone who wants to become an entrepreneur or ""change the world"" or some trope like that - please take this film with a pinch of salt. Everything is a lot more grey in reality. Also, please don't go around claiming this is the best movie of the decade and such. It sounds too funny."
202,"A terrific film that features great performances from its cast. Suriya is on a roll and it was a treat to watch him on screen. The airport scene shows his caliber, Aparna was great in her role. Paresh sir was terrific as a ruthless airline owner. The BGM was great and sets the tone for the film. The emotional comtent is terrific in the movie and you will root for the lead character always. The cinematography was great. The direction by Sudha Kongara, probably the best female director in the country is great. Dont miss this gem of a film. The first OTT blockbuster."
203,"Such an emotional and inspirational blast
Suriya is back
After a long"
204,"This review will contain spoilers so to anyone who has not watched the movie, please refrain from reading the review further.The movie has got it wrong on many levels. Highly overrated by the tamil audience because it has been commercialized. When Sudha has decided to direct a movie of this kind, she should have done her homework. She has got a lot of technicalities wrong.1. How do you find suriya doing all the work?
2. How does he barge into the atc room just like that and give orders to the pilot?
3. No aircraft without prior permission is allowed to land on an air force base just like that.
4. The investigation that Mr.Naidu conducts is a joke.
5. No pilot is allowed to disobey atc orders like in the movie. Doing so will result in termination of the pilot license.The movie is a clear disappointment as I was expecting a more solid, realistic and accurate representation."
205,"The overall shade of the movie is inspirational, but the making is not so impactful as it taken inspiration from a true story. There is a lot of incompleteness in the movie. when i finished watching there is a lot of doubts and questions arises and it doesn't provide sensible answers to that. If we watch something, everything shown in that need to logically disclosed and answered perfectly. It is the important thing and that element is missing in this movie. if i rate this i will give ( this is purely with my knowledge) : For acting - 9/10, for songs and background score - 9/10, for screenplay - 6/10, for direction - 7/10 and other technical side - 6/10.
Overall it is not so bad."
206,The movie makes us emotional as the screenplay and story is very much heart touching. The music is handled well. All the castes have done their part good but casting could have been a little bit better. Thanks to team SOORARAI POTTRU for giving us such a good movie to watch...
207,"Best movie 2020 first time OTT platform Tamil movie get 9 out 10, Vera level.. Surya acting is best and director after Iruthi Sutrun another best efforts making..

Surya acting is universalüíØ"
209,"As a film, it provides you all the emotional and motivational things we look for.
Struggle of a common man from being at the bottom to rise to the top. But the big question surrounding is, whether its adapted to the real life of his ??? Big NO! at times just to elevate the hero's mass and stature, there are few unwanted scenes kept which spoils the true essence of the story."
210,"Why suriya sir, why u released this in ott? If it was released in theatres then it would have been a universal hit you were waiting for years.
Soorarai pottru is the story of nedumaaran rajangam aka maaran who dreams of making an airlines in which poor people can also travel. The various hurdles he faces and how he overcomes it is the rest of the film.
Everybody likes motivational films because after watching it one gets a sense of hope and positivity. The film shows maaran's road to success as bumpy as possible until the end. The performances are the main highlight. Suriya sir is fantastic as maaran. Aparna balamurali comes with a good debut in tamil. Urvasi is brilliant as usual. After long time, I am seeing paresh rawal in a negative role and he was very cool in it. Mohan babu shines in his extended cameo. Cinematography is also very good.
Film is predictable but the direction compensates it. On the whole, soorarai pottru is a comeback of suriya after several debacles. Hope, he comes with more promising films."
211,"Started watching without any expectations but it nailed it..some centiment scene looks soo real and surya acted very well..
Villain plays a important role and done well..
Climax is soo good it reminds me of soo many elder people who are more intersted for travelling in flight.."

213,"One Word: Extra OrdinaryOne of the best movie of Suriya that I watched in recent years. Amazed me with his power packed performance. He was totally all over. Thanks to Sudha Kongara.
Loosely based on the real life story of Mr. G.R. Gopinath, founder of Air Deccan and the book Simply Fly : A Deccan Odyssey delivered a wonderful cinematic experience. She once again proved that she is a brilliant director. The story, screenplay and the narration, she reigned in all aspects.
GV Prakash Kumar, the man who gave the movie a life with his scintillating background score and songs and was well placed.
Aparna Balamurali, the female lead delivered in and out performances as Sundari. Urvashi played the mom's role with ease and her emotional performances were commendable. Karunas, Krishnakumar, Kaali Venkat, Vivek Prasanna, Achyuth Kumar, Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, Mohan Babu and the other actors who played even the small roles stamped their own charisma.
The cinematography was top notch. Thanks to Niketh Bommireddy, the man behind the camera.An enigmatic Cinema Experience.10 on 10Missed this in Big Screen. due to the pandemic.. Corona..""Don;t miss this.. Try to watch in Amazon Prime Video...."

One of the brave and best attempt Film of the year with limited commercial dosage, you got it? What I meant? Some so called commercials directors simply choose the necessity or suffering plot from common man, while addressing or dealing with it they walks in the wrong path or they wrongly represents for business purpose. But here she doesn't took any wrong paths or doesn't added any masala dosage. If you seen the above conversation with his father? I was literally awe? Man it's written by her? A lady? Just imagine if someone else dealt with that situation by adding unwanted stuff.#sudhakongara is calm and focused in her. She always tries to extracts the bad or wild phases from her actor's. And her flawless writing, sense and sensibilities, scene constructions, sentiment, sharing the equal importance to male and female characters.
I think she's learned that from her master
#Maniratnam sir. I'm sure she's going to bag few more awards in this year.#suriya #aparnabalamurali
Dominating performances throughout the film with due respect of the length. And she's equally performed with Suriya. I think that is Sudha strength writing strong female characters. The intensity in his eyes, the energy, aggressiveness in his evry move
We missed this Suriya from ages, finally she brought it out welly by showing shades of suriya.#nikethbommi saturated colours, cool and composed frames #gvprakashkumar clumsy
Vibrant sound tunes added much intensity, impact on building #mararaI have only regret
Missed this classic or blockbuster on Big screen ! It deserves a theatre release.A must watch and best film in suriya career."

But the movie never loses it's essence n carries the emotions throughout making it a captivating watch! The powerful n astounding performance by Suriya and other casts along with Sudha Kongara's much realistic direction makes it a mesmerizing n inspirational visual n muscialial treat!

A definite must watch! The next thing close to Vaaranam aayiram!"
220,"After a long long gap I was able to see a truly inspiring film. This film convey the message that even if you fail again and again never lose hope, one day you will definitely succeed. Based on true story, I should say all the characters played their part really well. I am a non Tamil and saw the film with subtitles. But believe me the acting dont need any subtitles.
This film is 10000 times better than the Bollywood overacting movies with vulgar comments, scenes etc. Dont waste time just watch this movie once, you will love it."

It is the second best tamil movie I saw till date only after Ratchasan.
The concept the screenplay everything is good.
It delivers what was expected from it.
It inspires and motivates you throughout the movie.
There is only one thing which stops it from becoming perfect is it's songs.
I don't think so some songs were needed."
223,It is one among the best bio pic and an excellent job done by the whole team. It is a big come back from Suriya. And proved once again why he is called as Nadippin Naayakan.
224,"My rating is 9/10.
Actor Surya has literally lived the character. Truly a captivating performance by him and even the minute of expressions strike hard. His eyes speak a lot in this film.. #AparnaBalamurali is bold and beautiful. She bags an important character and she does it with ease.The chemistry between the lead is awesome, there are multiple sequences between their sparkling eyes that creates magic.Perfect casting. All the supporting artists have done complete justice to their roles. Special mentions for Urvashi , Karunas and Mohan Babu.Applause to director #SudhaKongara and team.She is genius in her writing , screenplay , hard hitting dialogues and direction.Great job of portraying Captain Gopinath's life in a very rugged way. Whatever mood the scenes carry gets transformed to the viewers too. Tears and goosebumps guaranteed.#GVPrakash's musical treatment is rich which builds more value for movie.After ""Persuit of Happiness "" this film made my eyes water and had goosebump moments in so many scenes."
225,"Soorarai Pottru is the film that will make you laugh, cry and inspire. The film is partly inspired by the life of GR Gopinath, founder of Simplify Deccan. The chemistry shared between Suriya & Aparna is delightful to watch. This movie is so emotional that you can't control your tears in some scenes.Every actor was brilliant in the film. And Suriya as Nedumaaran just nailed it. It is one of the best performances of Suriya Filmography. Sudha Kongara as director did a commendable job. No doubt it's the Best Indian film in recent times."

228,It's really an inspirational story and Good to watch. I suggest everyone to watch this for experiencing the life's lesson.
229,"First of all,it was a very good story line. It would have been heavily fictionalised when it comes to actual story of Air Deccan. But I feel the essence was captured by director. Coming to the actors now. Brilliant acting by everyone but Suriya was exceptionally good :)"
230,"Soorarai Pottru is a masterpiece. There's no dull moment throughout the film. After watching this one you'll realise Bollywood is nothing compared to South Indian scripts,contents. Surya is classy and phenomenal as usual."
231,"Soorarai pottru truly deserves all the praise coming its way. This movie has definitely raised the standard of tamil cinema. Right from the beginning I was hooked, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.From the casting, the direction, the cinematography, the music, everything felt complete. The movie wasn't overly romantic and stuck to its central theme. One of the things I loved about the movie is that it featured a strong female lead, which was long overdue especially in tamil cinema.Such nuanced acting and so many complex emotions were beautifully portrayed by the amazing lead. Surya has proved himself yet again as a versatile actor. His eyes carry so much emotion. It was amazing to watch him in his element. I don't think I have ever cried so much while watching a movie. Every obstacle Maara and his gang had faced seemed so personal; I did not feel like a observer watching them from afar, but I felt like I was there with them, sharing their emotions. Surya definitely deserves a national award for this movie in my opinion.The fact that this amazing movie was based on the story/life events of a real-life hero is even more amazing. We don't realise that we take things for granted and forget the hard work and sacrifice of some unsung heroes that went behind the things we enjoy today. This movie has opened my mind to a whole new perspective, and I would definitely think about Captain Gopinath's resolve the next time I get to travel on a plane."
232,"A must watch movie after a long time. Based on a true story, and trust me, you will not regret it. Making, dialogues, background score, music, acting, and all are to the point. Hats off to the whole team."
233,Surya lived the character as Mara. Every artist in the movie has the potential characters starting from Surya. This was missing in Tamil cinema quite a long time. Different approach was dealt in the movie that liked me very much. It showed hardwork never fail.
234,"A treat to experience such a inspiring journey
A must watch for everyone"
235,Surya shows his acting skill again in this movie. He holds this whole movie himself. GV Prakash roared as a lion in music.
236,"All you can relate to this movie. Despite knowing few predictable scenes, this movie is not a detective one to say it's predictable. It's a life story, you should travel and live with the character. Suriya and Sudha, such a great flown in the movie with beautiful naration. Go for it, it will not disappoint the viewers. May be it can make your eyes wet."
237,"Soorarai Pottru is very motivating as a film! Suriya played well in this movie. I would say this film is a comeback from Suriya after many years. My last loved Suriya movie before Soorarai Pottru was 24. I had tears watching this movie because it is so sad. All I want to say is that Suriya continues like that and gives us extraordinary films like Soorarai Pottru, Raththa Sarithiram, Singam etc ..."
238,Good story real life story a story about a real life name gopinath
239,"The movie concept was very different, such great movie. Acting was fantastic. Both actor and actress has lead roles. You should watch this movie in Telegram. Download it."
240,"A big come back from suriya after singam 2 with awesome acting to the peak. Excellent support performances by aparna, urvashi and other supporting characters. Outstanding cinematography and good screen play writing by sudha kongara. Finally, GV at his best with beautiful songs and background score to the core especially veyyon silli and kattu payale.
Overall it a must watch movie üëçüëçüëçüëç"
241,"No movie in the world is perfect but some rare movie is nearly perfect,it's one of them."
242,"What a film, recent days fully inspired film I was seen. Suriya Sir acting is marvelous. His passion, ability, hardwork, confidence, innovative thinking and emotions superb. Aparna Balamurali garu acting is too natural as a village girl. When two egos are clasing each other is perfectly classifying by both hero n heroine characters. Sudha kongara garu direction is Highlighted. She can gave a great message to each audience whom watched this film. There is no difference in Rich-Poor, all are human being. All are having their dreams to fullfill in their lifetime. Suriya sir that airport scene really touched heart. Simply 2hrs time of Inspiration."
243,"Overall excellent performace
Proud of Indian cinema"
244,"Soorarai pottru...
After a long time got to watch such an outstanding film. Every aspect of the movie left me spellbound. Suriya Sivakumar sir, you played maara so effortlessly, it couldn't have gotten any better. Aparna Balamurali you made us proud with your exceptional performance. Special mention to #urvashi ma'am, you were grace personified.
Everything about this movie is worth acknowledging. Above all #SudhaKongaraPrasad ma'am you have created a masterpiece.
After watching it I really wished I could have experienced it in the theaters."
245,This movie is completely outstanding. It's very inspirational.
246,"Watched Soorarai Pottru, one of those movies that ignites fire in ur belly, shown how new Kids on the Block are treated, balancing personal n startup life. My first domestic flight was with Air Deccan to Delhi to meet President Kalam. #SooraraiPottru #SooraraiPottruOnPrime"
247,"One of the best movie in tamil industry,surya sir performance is wonderfull and heroyin aparna bala murali is also wonderfull best movie must watch"
248,Such a fabulous movie .I have never seen suriya action fantastic and Aprana balamurli hands off. Director sudha fantastic. Music gives magic to this movie thanks Gv prakash..
249,Super Film Suriya üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•the versatile actor aparna acting ozm film is very good nice story
250,Good movie. Inspirational.Recommended to watch.Good acting by everyone
251,What an inspiring movie...Surya... Versatile actor.. He was not acting... He just lived as Nedumaran Rajangam... Proud to be a suriya fan
252,"First of all ,Kudos to Sudha the Director for choosing Suriya for this role. Not many actors in this generation, can justify the intensity of the character like him. Also, Sudha has balanced the Male-Female relationship so fresh and looks very lovely on screen. Dream Wish is that every Man needs a sensible, bold, romantic Bommi in their life.
A big salute to Sudha for breaking the MYTH that MEN FEEL WEAK IF THEY CRY. On screen every tear Maara sheds looks so meaningful, natural and intense that, we too cry along with him Irrespective of gender.
The struggles which Maara faces can be identified in everyone's real life . Hence the victory for the story and ths screenplay... Supporting characters like Oorvasi, Kali Venkat, Karunas excite you with their perfect, flawless acting. GV's BGM are so into the heart that you don't realise there is a music running at the background. Camera work is top notch and so are the Dialogues ....
Expect another movie between the same combo. One of the very sensible team in Tamil Cinema currently !!!!"
253,Great story. Happy #amazonprime is able to deliver this movie to us. Great movie
254,"A great Tamil movie after a long time. Above all, it's very inspirational. Suriya is top notch."
255,Surya sir acting hats offüôå direction awesome üôè motivation movie national award conform‚ù§
256,Superb movie.should have released in theatre blockbuster film.
257,No words to describe. The movie is just perfect. It hits all the right notes.
258,"An Amazing come back from Suriya..
Super Screen play & Dialogue..."
259,"The director has done a brilliant job. Acting is fantastic (not just the main characters, every single actor involved).The Suriya we all love is back!!! Probably his best performance so far."
260,This movie need to watched by every filmmaker. Every budding filmaker should learn how to make a 1st class film with low budget from sudha kongara maam. This movie is suriya's career's best movie. Gv prakash music was really cool. Kaali venkat once again proved he is a best actor. Aparna acting and her own voice for madurai slang is good. Totally an unusual biopic.
261,"Being a north Indian, Pardon I wasnt aware of Suriya. But what a brilliant actor he is. Had to google him :) Loved the movie and the story about Air Deccan. I am aware it would be fictionalized quite a bit as it was supposed to be a commercial movie. But it did bring out the true essence of the struggle and the characters."
262,Gripping story with great performances. Every actor lived up to their character.
263,"About the film first of all what an ""outstanding comeback"" by suriya.The acting performance of nadippin nayakan suriya was absolutely brilliant and would be the best actor of the year so far and also the carrier best movie.Not only suriya the acting performance of other actors and actresses were really good.Brilliant direction and perfect execution of screenplay by sudha kongara as well as superb music by GVP. This is just an inspiration and motivation to all youngsters."
264,"Having wanted to read ""Simply Fly"" book, but could not, had been waiting for this movie to come on OTT and when it did, it lived upto the expectations and hype it created. Screenplay & Direction of the movie was too good. Acting of Suriya, Aparna, Urvasi, Karunas & Mohan Babu was too good. Lyrics by Snehan for one of the songs was very good and not to forget the background music by GV Prakash, it upped the tempo & conveyed emotions wherever required. It gives all the business acumen for every entrepreneur and it's a must watch for everyone to follow the dreams and how to succeed in spite of all odds. I would like to watch it one more time for the business lessons it teaches!!"
265,"This movie is best forever in surya anna career
In this all character are picked perfectly
After lockdown we see this film that gives happiness and goosebumps
Fantastic effect all characters
All actors in this film are lived in their given character
I think this movie receive many awards
Gv .Prakash anna music vera level
Director mam every scene yum shot yum parthu parthu edhurukanga.
Thanks all cast and crew for giving this such a beautiful film"
266,"This a world class film with an Indian touch (The songs and the mass dance steps)
Surya is extraordinary, Aparna is apt.
Production Values are decent.
Inspiring story with engaging Screenplay.
Songs are dull but background score is good.
Paresh Rawal's character is a little cliche."
267,This movie will be an motivational story for many youngsters. Surya's acting is excellent. Some unbelievable facts are there but that is fine for this kind of good product üëçüèº
268,A film tells the story about passion and dream surya delivers some astonishing performance he gives a life to that character. Sudha kongara she creates a world of aviation and makes them a successful one technical aspects are so good especially cinematography costumes makes that character real credits to costume designer overall a very good film
269,"The underdog story which will make you cry, laugh and make you fall in love with all the characters. The cinematography is top notch with some glitchy VFX , but taking the budget into consideration it's worth it. The screen play is engaging and one of the strengths of this movie. Not your commercial masala Indian movie!"
270,"One of the best films produced in 2020 and ever inTamil industry , and the best in surya career...surya acting in this movie is exceptional,surya is surya its absurd comparing him with anyone like kamal ,vikram... i am sure this movie will place him in the top list of best actors in India we have now..."
271,An inspiring movie which is released on the right time when India is going thru a journey of entrepreneurial transformation to offer low cost products & services across the globe. Story is narrated in a very interesting manner and a stellar performance from the entire crew. Kudos to the director for bringing life to a real life extraordinary story on reels.
272,Well done Suriya as usual .. great screenplay .. beautifully written and some really proud heart touching moments..
273,Great film one of failure story that became successful. Good direction!
274,"Every person who'll miss this movie will also be missing an magnificent experience which might occur rarely in a lifetime. Nothing more, nothing less"
275,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. A true story so powerfully told by Director Sudha and her super talented team with an amazing cast. Surya is a class actor and I've watched many stellar performances from him over the years. His role as Nedumaran ( Capt Gopinath) in this movie stands out as one his best, a role essayed almost flawlessly sans the cinematic overtones. Infact the entire cast is outstanding evoking all the right emotions all through the movie with virtually no drag, something that's hard to say about many movies. Kudos to entire team for taking on a potentially controversial theme and demonstrating the power of story telling through a great narrative and endearing screenplay.. That Air Deccan changed the world of aviation in India is well known but the struggles behind the idea of taking flying to the masses and the people who made it happen despite all odds is grippingly told in Soorarai Pottru and will be etched in memory of viewers forever. Wish it is dubbed in other languages Must watch.."
276,Excellent movie with great portrayal of the story and all the characters...
277,"A wonderfully directed movie, Suriya and the entire caste deliver a brilliant performance. This is a moving film that inspires."
278,"What a movie!! I lough, I felt happiness, I got tensed, I got pain, I cried and at the end I'm feeling wonderful. Excellent cinematography, perfect screenplay, superb editing, wonderfully written. It's an amazing movie in this year."
279,"The movie is based on Capt. Gopinath and his business venture Deccan Airways (low cost airline). The screenplay is so tight and great acting from everyone. There is not a single dull moment in the film. There is no fake fight scenes or forced romance dialogues. Beautifully directed masterpiece, must watch!"
280,There are only few films which stays with you for a long time and creates a impact after completed watching and this is definitely that kind of film. I prefer watching this movie in bigscreen. Surya sir acting is terrific . Obviously the actors talent comes out with the story and director. Aparna Balamurali acting is stunning.
281,An inspirational story. Acting by lead actors is at top notch. Gripping screenplay makes you watch it till the end.
282,"Feel good
Inspirational
Dramatically powered
Think big.. big until you get big.
Good direction.
Good acts by the protagonists (particularly Aparna)
Brings the cinematic experience well..."
283,The Screen Play Can Make You Gripped towards the Movie!!
284,"Fantastic acting from every one,
The content is very original.
Extra added flavours like apj"
285,"I am not much fan of south indian, never saw them tbh. But its for the fact that the way south Indian movies are made no one can leave the movie by getting offended on any scene. They are true to the audience, complete family movies with rich touch of religions and traditions.
Starring suriya, soorarai pottru is a genius masterpiece. A rag to riches drama had every emotion blended so beautifully that anyone can be mesmerized in movie even after 20 mins of it.
150 min long film are seen as lengthy now a days but if make correctly it gives a gem like this one.Every actor did a splendid job, specially suriya. His bonding with his father is shown se beautiful. The way movie is directed is so good, songs are blended very beautifully within the film and even being a non tamilian, i can feel the importance of those songs on that occasion only with the way those are created. This movie is pure magic.Honestly, i have never seen much from tamil industry, might be some movies which are greater than this but for now it is definitely my favorite tamilian movie ever.
Perfect Diwali gift from the south"
286,"Surya is a outstanding actor.His performance loved to watch.Iam enjoy the movie and all crew was awesome.Aparna played fantastic Rolle with Surya.Their romantically acting loves more.I was cryed,laugh and experience this movie."

290,"Good,every department of the movie is top notch,hajososkwjqiqosnhsowiwksosonwiwiwhwjiwoejwjwid8d"
291,As a movie the crew has done a fantastic work. But failed to show the reality of this great man Captain Gopinath with the same movie cliches and mass dialogues in required places.You all will understand what i meant to say if you will read Captain Gopinath's biography: Simply Fly
292,The one and only thing I felt little bad was the graphics of plane crashes
293,Very good movie a biopic very well made Surya was good outstanding performance by Balamurli.
294,What a movie. This is not a flim it is the aviation. Must watch flim in 2020 .surya Anna comeback is very satisfied. While seeing this movie me and my family got tear. Surya nailed it .he deserves national award for his performance. Please watch with family. It will be a good experience.
295,"Success is not an easy ride...This film is proof for that.It shares a journey with the audience how a small town boy who didn't have any railway platform in his village...owns a Aviation Company in INDIA.This film features the journey of an Entrepreneur who not only dream about his success but also the dream of a Father who wants his son to fulfill the dream of Deficient people who want to abroad on an Airplane.It shares an amazing ride that how many obstacles an entrepreneur has to face .An outstanding Direction,Acting,Story,Music,Cinematography by the team that holds audience tight to their seat.All the Actors were so true to their characters which enabled you to watch an amazing Dramatic Emotional Rollercoaster.This is a must watch film as it is Inspiring and Outstanding reality check for the people who want to start their StartUp business."
296,Love this movie.. carried emotions all over the film.. All characters are designed superbly..Romantic scenes are good.

298,This movie shows how a brilliant script and equally brilliant performances can enhance a movie to a different level . Surya delivered one of the best performances of his career . Paresh Rawal as a shrewd businessman was amazing. Aparna balamurali was good in a limited role. A must watch
299,A tremendous movie in Suriya's carrier. He such a raw material for this character.. Well played screenplay and dialogues.. Bgm is a biggest support for this movie. GV once again proved his talent.....

302,Great movie by suda kongara. No words to praise the acting of Surya
303,"In my life time i have never watched a movie like this. Such a Motivating Story which makes you entertained with such a amazing concept. Entertainment value next level, wish I can say even I haven't watched a movie like this in Hollywood or any other industries. If someone say this movie doesn't have a good story, then probably that person doesn't know what is a epic story. Music in this movie does its best with unbeatable sounds that makes you amaze. In whole movie I didn't even see a single scene which doesn't have any logic. This should hit The Indian Best film ever. Such a superb emotional beats that even made me cry. Suriya and all other cast had made their best action to make this film best. Beginning, ending, pacing, dialogue, editing, cinematography, camera work, costume design etc. had done their best to make this movie ""Nothing better than this Soorarai Pottru"
304,"Powerful movie with emotions and ambition..

318,It left me dumbstruck. Wonderful movie. Superb planning and beautiful execution from Sudha ma'am and team. Strong acting from Surya. He handled all those intense scenarios with utmost maturity. The lady characters Aparna Balamurali and Urvashi both were outstanding. Superb movie and haven't seen something like this for so long.
319,Inspiring story. The best movie I watched in my life. Sudha Kongara made a brilliant outcome and what a stunning act from Suriya. Everyone in this movie made good job üëå. Shout out to the team.

323,I really liked the story and character in which Suriya acted. One of the best output from Suriya. I am damn sure vintage Suriya is back again with a blockbuster. Major missing is that I couldn't watch this movie in theatre. Mohan Babu sir scenes were awsome
324,"Wonderful film. Missed theatre experience. If there is a re release , I will surely grab the tickets"
325,One of the best movie in 2020 and for suriya in his career. Hats off to GVP for the wonderful BGM and melodious songs. Sudha Kongara has done a great job after Irrudhi Sutra. Overall it's a must watch for all.
326,This movie doesn't have a massive twist or amazing stunts or something but in this movie actor surya had given his best performance. He is a real performer. There is a scene in this movie that which surya had lived in it not acted. Such a performer.
327,"Even if it is taken during this pandemic, the crew presented it in such a way that they neglected all their struggle behind those shots.The mind blowing appearance of Surya made it more enthusiastic. Overall, I felt it as a theatrical magic."
328,Such an inspiring story to be done in such an extraordinary way. Nice movie.
329,"After a long time, we watching surya's original acting. He gave Stunning and extra ordinary performance. We must talk about direction and screenplay of the movie. She (director) did everything perfectly. Nothing less and nothing more. Everything was correct. It's an inspirational story for who struggle to win and achieve their dreams. So it's a must watch."
330,Outstanding performance by surya... stunning come back....
331,What a movie it is...really inspirational....got goosebumps while watching....surya is back
332,"A fictionalized strory from a Book Named ' Simple Fly ' But the Making of Movie and the Acting of actor in lead Role Surya Sivakumar Was Nothig to say . Superb , and the supporting actors Aparna balamurali Acted As Bommi,Maaras Wife was made her Carrier Best Performance , And Maaras Mother and Father .Uruvashi was a well recognized actress in Malayalam industry and she is well played in this Movie Too.
Specilay the making of movie and the background score of the movie was inspiring .
When a movie was made by real incident it has lot of difficulties but the director sudha and the Script Writer made that in easy.
There is no fault too point out it was a pure gem.
But the only concern was this movie deserves its theatre show. but due to the Corona Pandemic therr is no possibilities in showing Soorarai Pottru In theaters
Finaly the Movie was a Must Watch One, if you are Searching Movies To watch relesed after 2019."

346,"Never in my life a movie made me this much involved emotionally where I was teary eyed almost for every scene. I wonder what the Air Deccan Captain Gopinath had felt after watching this movie adaption of his 'Simply Fly'. The movie is perfectly scripted, flawless and it has achieved it's target of making your dreams come true and your economical status nor your social status does not determine your fate. The story of how the first and the largest low cost aviation space was created is a must watch. Suriya Sivakumar, words cannot express how much I love you for choosing to do this movie and the director Sudha Kongra. We need more movies like this. I am irrevocably in love with this movie."

359,Surya Anna mass performance Soorarai potru motivate the all people
360,"Suriya is simply lived in that character as #Maara and made us cry many a times, what an a outstanding performance. We are seeing Maara in us many times.

370,Its is like about the flight of rs 1 for the passengers for that it is a good story
371,"During his struggle with getting the airplanes to the sky, Nedumaaran Rajangam alias Maara(Suriya Sivakumar) takes inspiration from his wife Bommi (Aparna Balamurali) which goes something like this - ""One need lesser fuel to fly an airplane at a relatively lower altitude"". The movie, to a large extent, felt the same for me; just enough content to be a ""commercial"" success, while it could've reached the skies!"
372,What a fantabulous film. A must watch movie. Surya's performance is similar to being awestruck. Great work by the team. Kudoos!!

393,"Tremendous story plot and screen play by Sudha, Suriya's performance has propelled the entire movie to what it deserves.Aparna, just nailed her role with her wild and raw emotions. Each and every supporting actors added essence to the master piece. Will regret, if u miss this story of a common man."

406,"One of the fantabulous movie i ever seen.
Best script and screenplay. Acting was just awesome. Very strong story by sudha kongra mam."
407,"Nothing more or less to say, we really missed it on theaters. The rage, fire - Nedumaran just took the show..."
408,"This movie is not just only a biopic, but this has to be one of the best inspirational movie ever made in India. A must watch to all of them, everyone can watch it. If you need a motivation for your life, watch this movie it gives you what requires.
Suriya is the most underrated actor in India. He did what he does. He lived the character of Capt.Gopinath not acted. No other words"
409,Superb movie... It is inspiration for who is dreaming
410,"Nothing to say. Cried when Suriya cried, laughed when he laughed... A tight blow to the so called ""BOLLYWOOD"" from our South Indians... MADLY in LOVE with the film and SURIYA..."
411,What a marvelous depiction üëèüëè... Surya sir is a maestro of acting
412,"My First review in Imdb. Hats off to the direction and performance by Suriya, Urvashi and Aparna. This will somehow uplift the dead mind because of this Pandemic."
413,"Soorari potru as the name implies is the story of a normal middle class guy whose aim is not only to fly high but to make aero services accessible to each and every person in this country..
Surya with his terrific performance mesmerizes everyone and it's safe to say that this is his career best performance..He literally lived as the character Maaran..
The heroine Aparna's character showed that we don't need glamorous heroines but performance is what matters..Feminism told in a simple and effective way
All the other lead actors did well but it's remarkable to appreciate the person behind the instruments..GVP who hunted everyone with his bgm in Asuran does the same and excellent job of keeping us on the track with his outstanding bgm..
Throughout the movie , we get on with Maaran's life and in the climax we become one with him
This movie showed kollywood doesn't need massive fight scenes or fancy songs or idiotic comedies ..Just a good script with a well directed screenplay is more than enough for us.."
414,Exllent movie with crisp gripping story and screenplay....
415,"Soorarai Pottru- Awe transpiring movie for all generations. Loosely based on a true story, the director Sudha Kongara has nailed it with a fresh spin. She has shown the true reality of how the world can be and also a mirror.
It shows how entrepreneurs changed airline industry breaking every norm and mind barriers. One of the best roles Surya has portrayed and can proudly wear a feather.
An award winning, inspiring movie and multiple times clap worthy. Watch it on Amazon Prime.
""Ride the tide no matter what, as long as you have chosen the right path that aligns with your dreams- rest will follow""."
416,"The movie talks about the story of Air Decan, India's first low cost airways. Screenplay is a bit dramatized so as to make it more engaging.
The movie revolutions around Maara who is trying to make his dream come true which is to provide an airways service which can affordable for the common people of India. Story follows around his struggles and his past. It also involves a bit of his personal life too.
It's simply a man's dream to sell others big dream for a small price."
417,It is truly inspiring movie for all. Surya acting is just being Ng back memories of varaniyam aayram this time too sharp
418,What a movie! Hands down Suriya is the best actor of our generation. Excels is all sectors of acting! He is BACK! Hats off to the Director Sudha and the rest of the crew members for giving us this master piece. Everyone involved in the making did a fantastic job.
419,After Vaaranam aayiram.. this is one of the classical movie acted by surya Anna what a performance each frame & scenes I didn't seen surya...I seen only nedumaran.. starting to ending surya occupy the screen... infinity Wala Diwali treat for Surya Anna fans...and aparna also done great job...Kali venkat u nailed it man every characters done good job...Mohan babu sir also super...gvp simply mass... Sathish hold the screen brilliant cinematography...sudha what a work no words technically story wise acting wise we know the hard work of sudha... definitely worth & must watch with family &kids...
420,BEST OTT MOVIE EVER COULD HAVE GOT THEATRICAL RELEASE AMAZING CAST PERFORMANCE SURIYA STEALS THE SHOW WITH HIS EYES ALONE WHAT A FILM MOHAN BABU DID A GOOD JOB AND RESPECTIVE DIRECTOR'S BEST WORK TILL NOW
421,"A great comeback for Suriya Sir.You will never feel bored watching the movie.This movie will inspire millions that you can achieve anything you want.Performances are excellent.Suriya Sir did superb performance in this film.Every scenes,whether it's emotional scene or others.he will impress you.Other supporting cast were given importance and they did a great job.Music by GV Prakash Kumar is the best of his career.Nallu Nimisham,Aagasam and Maara theme are my favourites.Other songs are also very good and bgm is fire.The plane scenes choreographed by Action director of Fast and Furious looks brilliant.Technical departments whether it's cinematography or camera work also great.MUST WATCH."
422,"National Award should be given to SURYA and the team. Amazing there are scenes which drops tears in eyes. 'Amazon prime' support these people with Big Share.
G. R. Gopinath is such an incredible man. Make him president he will do great things. When people make movie like this do not charge location Airport fee...
Awesome Experience....."
423,"Nadippin naayakan is back with another masterclass performance. I felt this is the best movie released till date directly via OTT platform. This film doesn't disappoint us . This team has delivered us with excellency in all level of acting,story,music etc. It's a must watch inspirational story ."
424,"Dreams never die for ambitious men. Here is a beautiful movie on one such man, Maran, ex-IAF pilot who dreams to fly high in life and at at he same time provide the poor air travel with in their reach.
Want to see a movie with Songs, foreign location, fights, punch dialogues? Sorry, then this is not a movie for you! This depicts the struggles of a man in real life who wish to change aviation history.
Yes, the story might have been based on real life events of Gopinath who was the first to provide economy air travel (and others) by starting Simplifly-Deccan, but the struggles they encountered to provide the facility under tough airliners competition is not just Simplif(l)y!
Surya has done an excellent job in bringing to life the character to steal the show. It is another feather in his cap. Aparna Balamurali as his wife Bommi, who teases, pleases, gives ample support to be with him as a true wife and companion during his struggles. Director Sudha Kongara whose Irudhi Sutru (Final Round) was a hit, has again given a different movie and she needs to be appreciated. Urvashi as Surya's mother, Paresh Rawal as Villainous Paresh Goswamy, the Jas airline owner, Kaali Venkat, Karunaas, Krishna kumar as Che, his friend have done their jobs well. Mohan Babu as Surya's commodore has a pleasant role at the end.
Technical values are excellent. G. V. Kumar has provided necessary music suitable for village background.
The drawback of this otherwise good film is the length. It could have been trimmed further to bring it under 2 hours.
There are many touching scenes like villagers sending money to Maran's account, Surya's desperation to reach the village to see his dying father's face, his initial failures and so on.
Watch the movie on Amazon Prime OTT platform and let's encourage good movies!"
425,"The above statement may seem exaggerated, but the film is structured like a flight. We hear the engine sound in the title card and the swift departure takes away our breath. We are introduced to Sundari played by Aparna Balamurali on a train to meet Nedumaaran Rajangam. The character seemed to be a rebel in the beginning, but later we find him to be a calm person who bursts off when suppressed downright.
The characters are given to actors who know their job very well. Urvasi, Aparna, Maaran's friends delivers a great performance on screen. Paresh Rawal, Achyut Kumar delivers antagonist role very well. Special mention is needed for 'Poo' Ram who plays Maaran's father. Karunas gives some pleasant jokes in the film. Meanwhile Nedumaaran Rajangam played by Suriya will stay in the hearts for a long haul. This will stay as one of Suriya's career best performance among Nandha and Pitamagan.
Sudha Kongara's screenplay and direction, steer the film. One can argue that she alone holds the complete film in her shoulders. GV Prakash Kumar's music is highly enjoyable and sticks to the mood. The cinematography and the overall color tone are just splendid.
I personally wished the climatic sequences were a bit more lengthy since it would have been helpful in getting Sudha Kongara her a standing ovation like how she got in Iruthisuttru. Well that need not be considered as a flaw but I felt the film ended soon.
Overall Soorarai Pottru is the one such film that never makes you take your eye off the screen. It makes your eyes wet at times but the journey or I might flight is smooth and enjoyable."
426,Best movie in Suriya s' career.lead pair acting very good
427,"You can achieve anything if you put your mind and soul to it, even when the whole world is against you. This is the idea that Sudha Kongara wants to tell to us with her recent outing Soorarai Pottru. Based on real stories, the film follows the protagonist's dream of making every common man fly. The film is held up by Suriya Sivakumar's real to life depiction of Nedumaaran Rajangam and the way he handles both emotional and dialogue based scenes are a treat to watch. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and does so well at it. The supporting cast (Paresh Rawal, Urvashi) are well picked and give support to the main lead but fail to do so at times. Aparna Balamurali portrays Bommi ,a similar character as Nedumaaran ,does her job fairly well. But the lead characters as a pair don't have that chemistry that you expect. Cinematography is excellent and editing is efficient even when the songs are not needed for the story ,is placed forcibly in the screenplay. Background score by GV Prakash Kumar gives that peppy and arrogant tone to the movie which elevates the experience by a mile. The details in the film are a plenty and brings the feel of that 1990-2000s vibe. The story is overall a very enjoyable experience but there are some instances in the film when you feel bored or not into what's happening on the screen. With the intent and story there, I would have liked a more complete product. The film has some issues with dubbing as the dialogues are in a strong Madurai- dialect. But if you are feeling low or is in the mood for a film with a strong core story , this one's a treat to watch."
428,"One of the best movie of Suriya, past few years his potential was not used to the fullest. But for this movie Sudha Kongara and Suriya have given their life. A splendid job done by everyone in the move. G V Prakash's bgm and songs are a excellent. Aparna Balamurali did justice to her role and Kaali venkat and Karunas have made it to the fullest. There is reason why Suriya is called one of the best actor in Indian Industry, this movie is the proof for that. He is at his career best. This movie does at the end what ""Pursuit of happiness"" done to me few years back. When a person who is at his low phase watch this movies definitely he will be motivated and will try to fight till he die. Salute to the team. And last but not least, salute to the man who made us all proud Captain Gopinath."
429,This is the best movie for Suriya. The plot revolves around how flying was made possible for everyone in India at a low cost. Suriya's performance is very good and emotes well in various scenes. Urvashi has become a versatile actor long back which is evident in many scenes. This movie is a must-see for all Indians who are enjoying their air travel at a nominal cost so that they can appreciate the hardships faced in bringing this luxury and benefit to everyone enjoying it now.
430,Very inspiring movie.... People will feel the emotions of Nedumaran ranjangam. One of the best performance of Suriya
431,An inspirational flight journey by Sudha Kongara with Suriya's powerful and intense acting where you just feel the emotions yourself through his acting. Aparna Balamurali's performance is really applausable. A total package for a top quality movie.
432,"I'm not fan surya..but,I give wishes to surya...awesome acting with realistic..more scenes make inspiration..."
433,Soorarai pottru is such a inspirational movie. Its a best screenplay movie. Gv prakash movie is very high. Suriya Anna acting monster level. Aparna balamurali acting is extraordinary...... üëåüíØüòç
434,Movie is good but music is not so connected like Iruthi sutru.. that is master piece from same director...
435,His acting caried the while movie but there were some unnecessary plots within the movie and you can watch and understand that it was not so bad but some what in the middle range .
436,"The movie has all elements of a person's struggle to set up and run a business. But, some themes of competing businessman's only job is to pull down the hero looks cliche and age old. And, the other cliche is portraying hero as Socialist uplifter of poor and the Mallayas/Jet Airways as a socialite balking in riches. Come on, in reality, these are 2 different businessman with different business models and ambitions. And, the sad story is the airlines was finally merged with Kingfisher which is conveniently changed with a hero's punch on Dreams and bla bla.But, neverthless, all characters have an impact performance especially Urvashi and the father character. And, after a long time, we see a hero who was vulnerable and has his own ego. This is by far Surya's best in a looong time.I really wish a movie that portrays businessman as a business minded person rather than a ideological cine-hero of uplifter of masses!!"

458,"A sparrow cannot become an eagle but my son will change that!THIS MOVIE IS A JOURNEY. Please don't miss it. Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!"
459,"It's such a shame that this movie couldn't be released in the theatres. Out of all the movies that released on OTT platforms since the start of the lockdown, this one has huge Box office potential."

541,"One of the best movie for surya,wonderful screen play"
542,"It is noticeable that a tiny bunch of people branding this movie as a politicised and untrue biography. First of all, those expectations and comparisons are 'pointless and invalid', because this movie is already revealed to be a fiction of certain original events but not entirely a true story. Breaking the cost and caste barriers is what the plot line is and it actually starts with the protagonist who doesn't even support any caste. But there are few, who badly wants to portray the caste of Mr.Gopinath so accurately and bring back the caste discrimination. This movie is just to portray the struggles of a common man against the capitalistic ego and inspire the hard working people. It has no need to speak every politics in detail, not always!"

661,"This movie need to get attention of viewers. A story and struggle of Capt. GR Gopinath that need to be known to people. A story that will make you proud and inspire you to aim for high feats. This movie gave me similar feeling like I got after watching Manjhi.
This movie made me cried at moments, gave me goosebumps and filled me with exhilarating highs. Acting of Suriya deserves highest accolades and appreciation. He is a gem. Though I couldn't understand the Tamil but I was so immersed into the movie that I never felt the difficulty of watching the movie with subtitles alone.
Paresh Rawal was cherry on the cake. It is always pleasure to see him on screen.
Overall a complete movie that holds the potential to be among the best ones. Hardly, I am able to find any flaw or lack in the movie. Highly recommended to watch it once even if you don't know Tamil/Telugu/Kannada/Malayalam."
662,Never seen a movie like this.It will become the ttue motivational movie of all time

672,No one else can make such a movie. Amazing act and storyline. Suriya's performance is outstanding. Entire cast performed well. A must watch film.
673,"Soorarai Pottru is one of the best films of Suriya in this decade. The actor of his stature had a few misses here and there although he had given his best in each film. There is an analogy in Soorarai Pottru about how a sparrow eats a little for its flying range. Suriya is an eagle among actors but with weak scripts in the recent past, he was unable to fly high in the last few years. Thanks to Sudha Kongara, who has finally served a sumptuous meal to his fans."

4 days agoMan what a great movie.I felt so inspired and Surya juts nailed it..a huge come back and beecr expected return of Surya and the direction n cinematography was good.Sudha did a great job of portraying Gopinath's life in a very rugged way and the character of maara and his wife along with his parents and friends were strong and those two gentlemen who played as his friends were absolutely a great pair and surely cannot be neglected at all.The scene where Surya was cheated by,his wife,the whole world turning against him was the moment we saw surya's eyes filling up with tons of emotions such as fear,sad,lack of confidence,anger,lost, desperate and literally a man would have turned weak but the moment where he puts it all together and continues to do what he is meant to do as a tribute for his father,his village, his motherland and most importantly his passion was Incredible.Another scene that gave me goosebumps was the moment our dearest Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam sir was portrayed in the movie as a saviour,angel and guardian of faith and we all must be truly lucky to have lived in an era where that kind and generous man walked this earth spreading peace and love.Made us realize how many people were ready to push us down when we want to make a difference in the world and it's all because of money, jealousy and ego.Let our great nation dream big and have a greater vision and let all those who dreamt to be what they want to change this great for for good n be successful whether they are from a village or city or slums,poor or rich or middle class.Vande Mataram.

3 days agoWatched Soorarai Pottru yesterday in the early morning n am still amazed. It's one of the finest movies ever made in recent time,to be specific,the best among all the OTT releases!! the movie really deserves a thundering applause.The movie deals with the story of low cost aviation.Suriya Sir,portrayed the protagonist Nedumaaran so convincingly,he breathed n lived the character. A common man, who dreamt of making poor people fly,how his dream came true after so many impediments,the story is about that.It's a journey of a
man who never gives up even after facing hindrance time and again.The scenes in which Nedumaraan(Suriya) vented his anger and frustration is truly commendable. An out and out inspirational movie.Never felt bored,was glued to the screen.
At the end,feeling sad as it was not released in theatres. üòûüòî
BUT one thing I can assure,SURIYA SIR is back after lukewarm film like NGK(though he was as usual awesome). I am a Bengalee n I never miss his film,watch using English subtitles...wating for his next... till then all hail Soorarai Pottru!!

Wow what a performance from suriya...he lived as Maara..and good acting from female lead abarna & all actors done their best...Blockbuster movie"
760,"One of the awesome movie and this is currently my favourite movie . The acting was brilliant, hats off to the great actor Suriya . Awesome movie üòå"
761,".The above statement may seem exaggerated, but the film is structured like a flight. We hear the engine sound in the title card and the swift departure takes away our breath. We are introduced to Sundari played by Aparna Balamurali on a train to meet Nedumaaran Rajangam. The character seemed to be a rebel in the beginning, but later we find him to be a calm person who bursts off when suppressed downright. The characters are given to actors who know their job very well. Urvasi, Aparna, Maaran's friends deliver a great performance on screen. Paresh Rawal, Achyut Kumar delivers an antagonist role very well. Special mention is needed for 'Poo' Ram who plays Maaran's father. Karunas gives some pleasant jokes in the film. Meanwhile, Nedumaaran Rajangam played by Suriya will stay in the hearts for a long haul. This will stay as one of Suriya's career-best performance among Nandha and Pitamagan. Sudha Kongara's screenplay and direction, steer the film. One can argue that she alone holds the complete film on her shoulders. GV Prakash Kumar's music is highly enjoyable and sticks to the mood. The cinematography and the overall color tone are just splendid. I personally wished the climactic sequences were a bit more lengthy since it would have helped get Sudha Kongara her a standing ovation like how she got in Iruthisuttru. Well, that need not be considered as a flaw but I felt the film ended soon. Overall Soorarai Pottru is the one such film that never makes you take your eye off the screen. It makes your eyes wet at times but the journey or I might say flight is smooth and enjoyable.Even though it has predictable scenes the screenplay makes us yearn to know what happens next. That's where the magic happens."
762,Hats off to director and Suriya ( hero ) who brings the originality of the real life character. He made us cry
763,"What aaaa movie, great direction, perfect casting.two three scene are very emotional ."
764,Much watch filim what a performance by surya. Actors doing wonderful job. The director hands off
765,Gajini blockbuster movie next movie in Soorarai pottru
766,"The movie has a whole is awesome , from acting to plot holes everything is well balanced. A stellar job by the director, the team and Suriya. One of the greatest biopic I have seen. Captured the emotions perfectly"
767,"It's an wonderful movie, worth watching.
This movi gives key to success and my heartfelt gratitude to D.R.Gopinath sir and his wonderful vision to provide low cast flight to the poor Indians. Movi is amazingly made.
Thankyou."
768,"I have to wait 12 years for a inspiring film from Suriya after Vaaranam aayiram. I have to Thank Sudha kongara mam for that. I saw only Maara not Suriya and he lived as Maara. I can't remember when was the last the time I cried for a movie. In Soorarai pottru, whenever Maara cries you can't control your tears. Aparna balamurali as Bommi, bold supporting wife, every Man with a dream longing for. Chemistry between them is so natural and beautiful. Nikketh and G.V as pillars for the movie. Art work at its best and can't imagine how they recreate and created the world of Maara. This movie definitely motivates person who wants to be entrepreneur. Eventually, for Two things I respect this movie : 1) Suriya - dreams as Maara, Struggled as Maara and won as Maara 2) Mutual respect between Maara and Bommi and their passion towards their dreams."
769,Omg watch this movie at least one time it will make u watch multiple times
770,"Awesome Movie, Really MotivatingSuriya's Acting was top notch"
771,"Must watch the film. Emotional scenesüò≠
Superb Casts.and sudha kongara Mam proud of uüíû"
772,This the movie inspire you to next level its great movie

Not to forget GV Prakash scored extremely well to suit every situation and delivering the right note, so soothing to the ears and soul."
862,"Really nice movie, I am watch more time. Youngsters motivation movie this corona time."
863,An outstanding breathtaking movie. The movie is entertaining without being over the top nor following any cliches.The best thing about the movie besides the lead actor's performance in an author backed role is the characterisation of the wife of Maara played effortlessly by Aparna. It's women empowerment in its truest sense of the word. It's refreshing to see it in comparison to Hindi film industry and OTT platforms where women empowerment is reduced to drinking and having sex.Also the father son strained relation also is brought out really well.Even the most hardened person also is bound to shed tears couple of times in the movie.Overall a must watch

874,Good direction......Good script...... Exceptional Acting......Classic Movie
875,Superb movie. Must watch.acting is amazing.soorya and aparna hands off you both
876,"Pure bliss to watch this kind of motivational movie, learn from the failures is the first step for success which are clearly shown in movie in cinematic way. Bow to Suriya, Sudha kongara.... ! ""Rise Revolt and Stop Not"" followed by capt G.R gopinath and gave us low cost aviation to poor and mid class Indians."
877,"Suriya is always among my favourite actors. Only because of him, I started to watch the movie, but it amazed me when other co-actors contributed the same as the protagonist. From the beginning to the end, it's full passion and emotion. The main theme of the movie is ""never say die"". And at last, the brave one wins. Paresh Rawal as an antagonist is always enjoyable to watch. It's the endeavour of a dreamer to fulfill his dream against all odds, and that has been perfectly portrayed in ""Soorarai Pottru"". This is the power of Tamil movies. Watch it, and you will have to watch again."
878,Definitely must give national awards to the team and SuriyaaaüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüíØ
879,"Life is very challenging for many. This movie depicts the real life story of a middle class Indian villager whose dream is to make a common man fly in aeroplanes. The journey clearly shows the pressure he gets from the rich and upper class people and how it makes 'Maara's life miserable. Did he overcome those barriers?
Watch it and fly high!"
880,"Omg, what a movie! it is an true inspiration story for the youngest people who want to achieve thier dreams... It created magic in me! Must watch!"
881,"Very inspiring movie, just loved all the performances of everyone. Surya lived as Maara, whenever I feel drained I just start to watch this movie."
882,Very beautiful movie. Many scenes in the movie make our eyes water. The film is a strong comeback of actor Surya. He proved once again the talent of the actor Surya.#NadippinNayakan!!!
883,One of the career best performance of Surya after Vaaranam Aayiram
884,"Suriya sir nailed each and every frame.whenever he cried it felt very emotional.Aparna Balamurali did an excellent performence beyond expectation.Urvashi mam as usual top notch acting also suriyas friends did a good job.Sudha kongra mam u are a monster take a bow excellent no words to praise your work mam.Gv prakash killed it what a background score‚ù§‚ù§,especially in climax maara theme .And dialouges vijay kumar perfect ""tha andha flight oda owner da nanu"" was my favorite.

2 days agoA sparrow cannot become an eagle but my son will change that!THIS MOVIE IS A JOURNEY. Please don't miss it. Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!"
926,"Awesome story line, Good active, Good music and bgm....Its surya's come back!! Amazing movie ...Good message and Good Inspiration from the Movie."
927,This is an inspirational movie and a must watch film. The casting Of each characters is brilliant. Surya Sir had acted extremely well in this movie. And also Aparna balamurali had acted well .Urvashi also acted well. And this movie is a great come back for Surya sir

937,"The movie starts with a spectacular nail biting scene, which gives goosebumps. Right from the start, Surviya captures your heart and soul and has successfully kept us captivated through the movie. Every scene is mind-blowing and keeps the audience spellbound. After 6 months of pandemic and confinement in the four walls. At last, movie to celebrate and enjoy with family members. As usual, Suriya has proved his acting skills and he has made the movie more entertaining and he well suited for the role. I am positive that no person other than Suriya could do justice to the role and movie. Aparna Balamurali has also played a wonderful role and she doesn't miss a chance to grab our attention. All other actors have performed well. Director and Musician have done a great job. I love the screenplay and music. Its good movie and it sure captures your heart."

1002,"Suriya carries the entire film on his shoulders. He laughs, he cries and lives the moment - he is not Suriya but Maaran on screen. He effortlessly brings out the anguish right in his performance and at times, with just his eyes, when his over-ambitious plans, seem to go haywire, at least initially."
1003,"After 7th Sense, I was expecting a director that completely utilize the potential of Surya but even Selvaraghavan wasn't enough to break the jinx. Sudha had the real intent to make a movie that drives on the characters and not on the star cast. The way she cleared off the baggage of some mannerisms of Surya from him previous movie is indeed the best part. Surya now looked like a ""Bala"" student and he was only maara and not Surya. Aparna was so natural and she can easily play any rural subjects but not limited to that though. I never liked to see Urvashi cry but this time I cried with her too for her breathtaking performance. GV prakash is in his own league and nothing short of perfection. Che, Seba, Alapparrai, Kaali and All the other characters outperformed too and they will carry that Soorarai Potru tag with their name from now on."
1004,Good film.. must watch...and suriya rocks again....#sooraripotru#sudha kongara#suriya

1009,"Soorarai potru is by far amazon' s best release for tamil audience in a long time. The fiction is loosely based on Capt. Gopinath's inspiring story from rags to riches and his dream of making air travel accessible to the underprivileged, is definitely a must watch. The director has done a wonderful job with a tight script and a convincing execution. Actor Surya has delivered the powerpacked performance that is reminiscent of his years of yore. He has literally lived the character. He is ably supported by the female protagonist and all the veteran actors have delivered their best.The cinematography is outstanding. The bgm by GVPK is sure to raise goosebumps.The movie is sure to make u laugh and cry .. and inspire u. Don't miss it. Thank u amazon.

Entire crew great work!"
1030,"Felt the #Maara in me when achieving something on Aviation.As a Cabin Crew lucky enough to experience the feelings of an First time fliers.What a comeback for Hero Suriya after some commercial hits and Hands down this is the Best ever Suriya movie in every aspect.But for me ""VAARANAM AAYIRAM"" will be always my favorite. ""The Fault in Our Stars""with ""Dil Bechara"" and ""Pursuit of Happiness"" are My Top 3 Favorite Movies.This movie goes together with my fav ""Pursuit of Happiness"" for makes you feel everything you have to go through to make your dream come true.#sooraraipottru #sooraraipottruonprime"
1031,"A sparrow cannot become an eagle but my son will change that!THIS MOVIE IS A JOURNEY. Please don't miss it. Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!"
1032,"Its an excellent movie which reminds you to chase your dreams. Top class performance from urvasi, aparna and none other than the man himself suriya. This is the greatest comeback film for suriya and the mannerisms he has with his body language and eyes and for all the emotional sequences, deserves a national award for nedumaran rajangam aka maara."
1033,"There we can say some of logical and cinematic flaws, but that moment of watching the film made me think of my potential breed."
1034,Excellent acting by aparna urvashi and surya. All cast and crew did the best. Hats off to director.. She amazed everyone.
1035,Super movie.. best motivation.. Surya acting is too cool.

1037,Don't miss it guys such a wonderful filim. Surya the performer
1038,"Excellent movie, if it wasnt for corona, this would have been the blockbuster of 2020. Amazing storytelling, powerful acting, soothing songs and abundance of emotions. Well done guys. Really need to applaud your courage!!!!"
1039,When you passion persistence & desire you can achieve anything in the world
1040,"A fan with satisfied heart. This movies doesn't complain on your mind or create a dilemma whether the movie was good because it's too and you'll know once the movie enters into climax. There're several scene where you'll have tears filled and make you weep.
Movies bring on smal small twist and thrills yet feels completed, drama is all and all the story is, Suriya's acting is masterpiece and the GV carries the movie with his music.
Watch the movie if you haven't I can guarantee this will make you satisfied or appriciate who ever in this movie was especially the director, Suriya, Aparna, GV, phenomenal."

Surya and Aparna ruled the screen.
Naresh Goyal characterized in the movie very well.
Personally experienced this person's unwillingness to bring onboard people on the basis of status.

1044,"And that's how a movie is to be made! It should have you gripping until the end and Soorarai Pottru had me glued my eyes to the screen throughout!
The cast, crew, and direction was marvelous and hands down one of the greatest movies of the decade. What's now left is for you to watch the movie and experience it! üíØ

1126,After a Long Time Surya is Back Again with a wonderful movie. Surya has finally again brought out the actor in him and it had touched the hearts of the viewers. Not only Surya the heroine Aparna Balamurali has also done a fantabulous job by playing the wife of Surya her acting was pretty much natural. The actress called Urvashi who played the role of Surya's mother was not acting she was living as Surya's mother. Surya and Urvashi's acting made us the viewers cry. Almost everyone of the actors had done justice to their roles. Finally a Big applause to director Sudha Kongara who had made this movie extremely wonderful by casting the appropriate actors and for making every scene with extreme Carefullness and making the movie a wonderful one. Surya has hence proved his talent again by coming back with a movie which is one of the best movie that Indian Cinema had ever seen.

I would say the film is an excellent rendition to respected Ex-Captain GR.Gopinath sir.After a long time, I was entirely moved to the era(80s to early 2000s) in which the movie is designed to happen as per the storyline. I felt every emotion delivered by each and every artist in every single shot was topnotch.Every time when surya sir loses, We feel like we are losing and every time when he succeeds, we feel a complete sense of victory. That's something plausible...!
Kudos to Sudha ma'am who was once again able to successfully prove her expertise/capability to not just the entire Tamil Cinema industry, but to Indian Cinema by bringing an excellent Biopic masterpiece to OTT Boxoffice...!"

The movie however is surprisingly very interesting & keeps the audience captive lamost throughout.Really commendable performances by Suriya ,with great emotional depth ,something which has really stood out from the regular run of the mill commercial pot boilers or so called mass entertainers.Kudos suriya.
Another really fun and entertaining act was of course Aparna balamurali who has proved it Does not take stunning looks to hold the audience captive .Her acting as the ever loving ,strong headed ,village girl with bigger dreams are a treat to watch and an act equalling or superior to suriya.Hope i don't sound biased.!!!."

No cliches or typical drama. A must watch movie.There are a lot to take form the story. But, most of all don't stop chasing your dream until you own it."

Perfect and suitable casting, all the artists who did their part in this movie deserves a huge appreciation for their natural and dedicated acting which made this movie even more worth.

1273,"Right from the beginning till the end, the movie doesn't let you idle at any point. I was able to witness the Surya from Vaaranam Aayiram, whom as a fan I was missing for years. Suriya scored in every single frame. His expression speaks so much and conveys a whole story. Top notch performance by Aparna, Karunas, Kaali... GV was simply too good. Song placements were perfect and did not let the movie's screenplay down. OVERALL, a must watch and will keep u subconsciously thinking about the film even after hours of watching. Only positive vibes from the movie. Please do not support piracy and support actor Suriya by watching it on Amazon Prime as it's totally worth it.Suriya is back, and stronger than before!!!"

1278,"Nice movie with big star
Great feast for Surya fans
Nice inspiration to peopl that's it!!!"
1279,One of the best film that has been released on online platform during COVID. A film that makes the viewer travel with the emotions of the character of each and every actors in the movie. One of Surya's masterpiece after Ayan.
1280,Excellent movie... must watch...after a long time very good movie to watch in OTT please watch in amazon prime...avoid piracy.
1281,"OTT, had many Over the TOP TRASH from past 3 months, but now finally has this GEM to wipe all the previous disasters, god this is just a perfect movie with logic and emotion equally played out,. simply, this is the savior of TAMIL cinema 2020"
1282,The story is told in a way that you are a hero if you help one person to achieve their dream other yours. Help Each Other To Live Your Dreams.
1283,Heavily fictionalised and liberal cinematic liberties taken but this certainly deserved a ten star rating the guy gopinat is not a socialist but a businessman he sold out to mallaya and in the movie his wife said i would have poisoned you if u sold ROFLmax
1284,"It is about a guy doing his job and finding himself thrust into extraordinary circumstances, but suriyas acting skills is what elevates this movie to another level. A cocky, rule breaking, daredevil superpilot known as Maara starts a daring, no go startup (Kind of) known as Air Deccan. And it goes on. A lump in my throat began manifests itself sometime after the film began, and didn't go away to well past the time.Suriya deserves the most plaudits for presenting a powerful characterisation. A typically sturdy, no-nonsense directorial effort from Sudha, who tried to keep things overly neat and tidy. The movie is all about the great man remains great and very much the charismatic, triumphant individual. With admiration you can't take your eyes off Suriya.The movie is exceedingly well done, and Sudha, and GV at their finest. A feel good movie with an assortment of heroes, includes Aparna,Paresh,Urvashi,Mohan,Karunas. A wonderful and worthwhile film. Go see it. You won't regret. SURIYA IS BACK."
1285,"Inspiring, emotional and brilliant screenplay. I suggest everyone to watch the movie."
1286,"Every movie has a rotten spot due to some lack in something. But this movie is too perfect. Directors work will amaze the audience. From the main character to side roles each every cast has done their performance upto its extreme. Especially the main character maara, Actor suriya has lived through this and 100prcnt national award nominating performance. Watch the movie with the feel of maara and im sure itll be the best film uve watched"
1287,"Movie story and surya acting just amazing, it motivate more generation to grow up"
1288,"I never seen any movie like this. This movie has an extraordinary power that gives viewers an amazing experience .
Every actors and actress are really great
And a very talented director its story is very inspirational and heart touching
I've been waiting for this movie for months and i assure you #sooraraipottru became the one of my best movie . If you miss this movie it will be a lose for you"
1289,OMG suriyaisback with a bang . A MUST WATCH movie. Bollywood should learn something from south industry.
1290,"I have only one sentence to describe it that is ""this is how you make a biopic""
If you haven't watched go and watch it.suriya sir acting mind-blowing."
1291,"Wow best performance from acting beast suriya sir and good performance from all other crew.....best direction from Sudha
And music is lit....overall it is a perfect blockbuster of 2020"
1292,"Awesome performance by Suriya, Aparna and Urvashi."
1293,"This is truly an inspirational and strong motivational story. It can drive you crazy and make you run behind your dream definitely! This is based on autobiopic of Captain Gopinath from the book 'Simply fly'. When you see this movie you will surely don't believe one can't do things like when whole world is against him except his village, mom, wife and friends but Yes, this is truly happened.
To say deep into this movie, Suriya squeezed all his skills and gave the whole spell into this movie. He totally reformed as a poor normal man who fell on strangers for money, who asks money from his wife. Every scene is surrounded on this character. Aparna truly deserves lot, I just can't believe she learnt Madurai slang and dubbed her character. Sudha, the director gave equal weightage to all charcters from hero's mother to hero's in laws. I'm sure this movie will snatch all movie awards. GvPrakash gave an amusing music which controls our emotion, from emotional scene to class scene. He catched my heart. You will truly cry on seeing the sweetest part of movie at last.
I will say this movie should have released on theatres after sometime when normal conditions prevail, because this movie deserves a lot more like audience's whistle, applause and everything. This movie will be the best forever nothing can beat it. This movie is subjected to create a spark on you.
This movie catched my heart!"
1294,Awesome movie to watch and get inspire.Surya acting too good.
1295,I sow the move with thrilling and fully emotion. The movi making and casting is very well. And the inspiration is grate. Its a dream satisfying and strangles in it. Amaizing film must watsh
1296,Viewers will travel along with Surya in his journey in this movie
1297,"If pursuit of happiness is must watch movie. Then this movie also must watch movie. A dream of common man to take a common farmer in flight. And the acting of SURIYA sir will make you cry in many scenes. It will motivate everyone. And its a true story. You will get goosebumps in every frame. Hats of to director SUDHA mam. if Hollywood has PERSUIT OF HAPPINESS, we have SOORARAI POTTRU. There is a scene were maara begs for money to get the flight ticket to see his father who is deathbed, that scene will make everyone tear. Even if your heart is like a rock. Over all after seen the movie got motivated 100%."
1298,Everything about this movie is exceptional..! Right from the first scene you are hooked..! It's a rollercoaster ride with a lot of twists and turns and emotional scenes..! Simply loved it..!

Hope this was released in theaters.
Definitely it'll have done a great box office from world wide"
1305,"Best movie of the year
He deserves a national award for his best acting"
1306,I am writing this just after watching the film.Its a true drawing of the indian methodology of exploiting the talented innovative minds just for satisfying the greed of some individuals. Great work by the entire team. I am conveying to the viewers that the ending was just altered to a happy mood just for the feel of movie even it was contrary for the protogonist in real life. However it inspired me a lot and of course it reminisce about the great man GR GOPINATH.
1307,This is an Inspiring Movie... Goosebumps.. All the students must watch this movie...and see how the indian Government is...
1308,Surya's best film ever........and it's amazing........best film in 2020.....

1314,"Such an inspirational and motivational movie.. perfect comeback for Suriya Sivakumar anna. Dialogues, emotions, acting of every lead character was perfect. Suriya being such a big star no mass entry and build up scenes but completely pure versatility. Every emotional scene is goosebumps guaranteed especially those emotions carried by suriya anna. All the female lead carried her role perfectly. This movie was supposed to be released on Big Screens."
1315,"Totally Amazing, Phenomenal Direction and Screenplay.....Fresh Plot and Very Engaging Story and Acting of whole cast. No a single Scene bored you completely satisfying from start till the end. Sudha Kongara has portraited this is the best ways and SURIYA's performance, not even a single bad opinion. It was totally awesome.. Goosebumps moment till the end of the movie. To mention maara's friends, his wife and mother characters were also lit. I wish this movie goes to highest peak victory!!. Big fan of Suriya!!! He always amazes his fan with his top notch acting skill and most of us were into the movie because Maara's character was one among us. He is a Tamilian, not being state biased but we saw him as we know him by heart & Paresh Rawal (Babu Bhaiya) is Love, he always bring something new to his character and always perform overstanding. Thanks Amazon Prime Video for bring such an excellent movie."

1317,"It's lovely when the hero of a film has a solid ambition. It's lovelier when the heroine has one, too. Maaran (Suriya) - based on Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath and his book, Simply Fly - wants to create a low-cost airline. Bommi (Aparna Balamurali) wants to run a bakery. The loveliest touch is when they make a pact (her suggestion) that their earnings go into a common pool. It's not his income or hers, but theirs. I don't think I've seen household financial decisions being depicted on screen ever, less so when the couple is yet to get hitched. The Maaran-Bommi scenes are the best thing about Soorarai Pottru, directed by Sudha Kongara. (She's a friend. I had a look at an early draft of the script.) Suriya has many big acting moments here, and his most brilliant one is in the scene where - despite that pre-marital pact - Maaran hesitates to ask Bommi for money. Her business is soaring. His is just not taking off. You can see him struggle to bring out the words, which seem stuck in his throat."
1318,"Suriya is finesse actor and he proved it once again. This movie brings back the memories of Pithamagam, Mounam pesiyadhe and Varanam aayiram and all his emotional movies. Movie is bit lengthy though but its good watch. All actors gave realistic performance without any glitch. All emotional scenes father son emotion, failures and how he rise from his downfall is very touchy to watch and you will surely fell in love with the character and his dedication."
1319,"Must watchable
If there's no politics this film had an Oscar too"
1320,"An inspiring story that revolutionized the aviation industry, lands as a cleverly packaged dramatic flick.Actor Surya has literally lived the character 'Nedumaaran' and in most of the scenes his eyes talk a lot. Definitely his best performance till date!Soorarai potru easily the best film of this decade, thani oruvan was my previous favourite, this has replaced that now.Sudha kongara - Wowww , chance less , the screenplay never bored us always kept us at the edge. I like technically correct films and this satisfies my appetite for such movies. Thanks a lot !Surya - What a man !! I have always been a great fan of surya , and this movie has only made me feel in awe for this man . The best movie for the man , pushing Varanam ayiram second.Aparna Balamurali - Great talent , sooperly sketched character.GV Prakash- The music track has been really good. But in my opinion Gv prakash BGM , could have been more eruptive in certain scenes, the only drawback I could say , that too only on comparison with the quality of the movie.Urvashi ,Karunas and others - they have done justice to the film , and all characters wer sooperly sketched.My humble suggestion , don't miss the film , I m already sooperly motivated.
Thanks team Soorari potru."
1321,"A world class flim SooraraiPottru ,GOAT ACTING BY SURIYA Anna, Thaarumaaru bgm , National Award Flim,Every one watch on Amazon Prime"

Thats the message from this true story inspired epic. Great acting and characters created.Sudha Kongra never fails to amaze us with her great stories and characters.Its worth the watch in cinemas but what the heck, watch it with you family in comfort via prime video. Just be careful of some vulgarities to come.INTENSE,INSPIRING,FIERY."
1331,"Great movie
very much inspiring

acting perfect"
1332,"Inspirational!!
Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done."
1333,"The movie is truly inspiring and motivating. Hardwork of the hero to fulfill his aim. Not getting bored,"
1334,SooraraiPottru is a must watch movie..Suriya lived in a character MAARAN ..Awesome screenplay and great music.. Highly needed story to watch and get so much of positivity
1335,A movie which showed how difficult for a common man to establish a airways based on real story of captain Gopinad to make common people fly on sky.For sure this is a inspiration for modern innovative entrepreneurs.
1336,"Once again another movie proves that Indian Film makers lacking in developing quality content movies. This movie mentioned it inspires on life events of Captain Gopinath of Air deccan. What is totally disappointing in this movie it deals with poor storyline and emotional characters in this film. Example The villagers depositing their hard earned money to Surya bank account so he can buy aeroplanes! and what he does? He's very busy with romancing actress, dancing with buddies than his ambition plan to make people travel with minimum cost. Story lacks in narrating this plot clearly and potrays one sided story that rich people don't like poor people, unnecessarily targeting certain communities. Total waste movie will be Big Flop if released in Theaters."
1337,"We get it. They overcame obstacles to succeed. The movie is really good, but they just overdid with the twists."
1338,"What an waste of time.Asusual commercial Tamil cinema ,unnecessary songs and cheap villain.story was too dramatical and artificial.bad screenplay and predictable plot."
1339,"If you just look into the movie as for the acting and original story behind it then its real good, but when u look at this movie and forget that its a original story then its a average movie at best with poor screenplay, anyone could easily guess the next part of the movie in each sequence and sooner or later everyone knows that hero will achieve his goal as usual in most tamil movie, the main draw back is that there is no real story twist or new idea of any sort in any part of the movie.. everyone is saying superb acting by surya , yes he was real good but what about the story apart from that its a original story.. not special about it.."
1340,"It's a good movie,no doubt. Inspirational& Emotional story. But for some reason i didn't enjoy it as i expected. I guess it would have been a better theatre experience."
1341,"With Soorarai Pottru, writer-director Sudha Kongara once again shows that she can make strong underdog stories in the commercial format. I can confidently say that this is the Suriya movie that we've all been waiting for. As Nedumaaran (a.k.a Maara), he brings his A-game in every scene, whether it be romancing Sundari (Aparna Balamurali, in a memorable role), breaking into tears with his mother (played to great effect by Urvashi), or going neck-and-neck with Paresh Goswami (Paresh Rawal, as the baddie). Vijay Kumar's dialogues lend the screenplay a very natural, credible, and relatable flavor (""nee oru socialite, naan oru socialist"", ""nammaloda airline vaanathil parakkapora oru Udupi hotel"", and more).The supporting cast is an efficient lot here. Mohan Babu, Karunas, Vivek Prasanna, Kaali Venkat, Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, and Prakash Belawadi all get decently written scenes. Soorarai Pottru has more to do with Nedumaaran's quest to launch a low-cost airline that's accessible for every Indian, but it's also a solid family drama. The intricacies of Maaran's and Sundari's relationship are woven beautifully into the screenplay which moves at a brisk pace. Yes, it does have the mass masala moments and angles, but unlike in say a film like Kaappaan, they blend well to take the story forward rather than appearing tedious.Paresh Goswami feels a little like the corporate version of Hari Dada (from Pa. Ranjith's Kaala), despising the idea of poor people taking flights and foiling every move that Maaran makes. Suriya and Rawal play each other off well, making every scene of theirs worth a second viewing. But Goswami, on his own, is pretty dull and cardboard-like. He doesn't seem to have anything to look forward to, except ruining Maaran's life and this makes him one-note. The film also plays the safety card of letting us know in almost every frame depicting the IAF that it's all fictionalized, even with two disclaimers at the beginning and a closing card that says 'based on several true stories from low-cost aviation'.Coming to the technicalities, the CGI plane crash looks slightly messy (but not as bad as I was thinking it'd be) but the rest of the film holds up with its dazzling production design, glossy visuals (by Niketh Bommireddy), and mood-setting music (by G.V Prakash Kumar). Soorarai Pottru is one of those movies that could have been infinitely more enjoyable if experienced on the big screen purely owing to the big acting moments that Suriya, and to an extent Aparna, excel in. He is probably the only one among the present crop of Tamil superstars who can really add intensity to emotional scenes. For that and a mostly engaging narrative, Soorarai Pottru is worth sitting down for."
1342,It's just an overrated movie for me.Nothing special in this one.
1343,"It's not a commercial style movie, but it's a messed up style one.
Not entertaining, not realistic, it's a mixed up shots of scenes, trying to be a movie. Editing seems to be done in a hasty way, or if it's deliberate, then even worse.
One of the worst Suriya movies till now.
There are too many high rated (10/10) reviews, but beware of such.
Because it's not on cinemas, but on ott directly, some time will require for people's verdict to come out. It's a drag, and really boring movie to watch."
1344,"Feeling very happy to watch a meaningful and inspirational film after a very very long time. I have not seen anything like this in tamil cinema before. I wouldnt say that it really inspired me... But, I was pleasantly surprised to see a film with great direction. Surely, Sudha Kongara is a great director. Her meticulous work clearly shows. For Sooriya, after Anbuchelvan and Sanjay Ramasamy, Nedumaaran Raajangam may be a good meaningful character in his career (after a looooong time). Dialogues were very impressive. And the film has many interesting moments. All the actors in the film have given great performances. G.V.Prakash's music was apt for the film, with Veyyon silli standing out. The song transports the romantic feel to the audiences. Making a movie on aviation is not that easy. The flight scenes were terrific (that too, the first few scenes were awesome .. the team has rightly understood that these scenes are the plus of the film and has rightly kept one of these aviation scenes as the opening for the film).
Another thing I liked was that everything about the aviation business has been shown clearly - all minute details, the problems faced, the competition in the business. The heroine character was very interesting and I think that, that character has been created the way it has been, to maintain the raw tone of the film. Aparna's performance was terrific. Urvashi's too....One great thing about the film is its pace. It is super fast and uniform from start till end. But, still,I feel that, if the film had been edited differently (still maintainig the fast pace of the film) and few other minor issues fixed, this film could have been an outstanding,oscar-worthy film. My understanding of what Sudha wanted to show us in the film is that when a socially responsible person who has affinity towards his town and town's people (something that he has inherited from his father), who also happens to be a pilot, goes through a bitter experience of not being able to get a flight ticket when he desparately wants to, the result would be that he would make it his life's ambition to make flight journey a possible one for the middle/lower class people. Thats what happens here with Maara. Basically he doesnt want flying to be a prospect that only the upper class people have. In other words, when a need arised or when someone was having a lifetime dream to have a flight journey, Maara wanted to make it possible for them to do so. He did not want class or money to be a barrier in having a flight journey. And most importantly he wanted to connect the small towns and cities through flight. This would make India look more developed and sophisticated. This can be seen as an improvement to our society. This is probably what Sudha wanted to tell and if this had been presented in this manner as such, I think it would have been more acceptable. But, here it has been presented in a slightly different manner - the focus was only on Nedumaaran wanting the poor people to fly. (As though one fine morning he woke up and started wondering why poor people are not flying and he badly wants them to experience the flight travel...As though this is the pressing issue that poor people in India are having now). The film does show his experience as a pilot in defense team and also shows the incident which made him want poor people to fly... but, its all disjointed... so,the way it has been presented now, it makes one think - ' why should a poor guy fly? What is the need? why would a poor guy bother about flying when he has other pressing issues'.Though Sudha has pointed this out herself in the film and given an apt reply for it, through Maara's character, we cannot avoid thinking 'all of these struggles to achieve something luxurious like flying? As though struggling for basic necessities like water and food...' Is this ambition worthy of this much of struggle? One cant help thinking that the same amount of struggle and energy could have been spent in achieving what is 'necessary' for poor people. All of this because of the disjointed narration.
A few more drawbacks I noticed .... As the film progresses , somewhere we start feeling a little bored. This is inspite of maintaining the fast pace evenly through out the film. It feels a little monotonous and a little confusing after 1 and half hours of the film. And I felt that the villain character is very caricaturish. For a film that is aimed at being close to reality, this kind of villains dont really fit in. Another minus point is that, though Sooriya is terrific in scenes where he has to display his determination, his ambition, his frustration, his sadness, his love and the fire in him , he doesnt look convincing as a villager. In all the family scenes, he alone looks aloof. For the most part, he looks like someone who just returned from Harvard university and just got introduced to his village family and is wondering what village life is like. The rest of his family and Aparna's family are very convincing as villagers. And they are the ones who give the audiences the right feel and tone for the film. Maybe if this had been corrected, the film and the character would have touched our hearts, the way it was meant to. For, the very pulse of the film itself is the protagonist's character - an 'ordinary villager' coming from a 'middle class' family having big ambitions and that too with strong determination, dedication and perserverance. So, Sooriya, acting like Anbuselvan-trying-the-rustic-looks (or may be like the young Sooriya from Vaaranam Aayiram) is not doing any good for the film.
Overall, it was a surprisingly good film. But, it could have been a gem of a movie , if these few problems had been taken care of."
1345,I would have rated this 7/10 but because of some lunatics comparing this movie rating with top class movies in the world like Shashank redemption and interstellar I'm giving this movie 1 rating.. otherythe movie is good.
1346,"I was amused seeing the ratings for this movie especially after watching the movie. It is just another boring, fantasy illogical movie with added sadness throughout the movie. Just selling BS with BGM."
1347,"I really enjoyed this. The storyline was surprisingly intense and thrilling. I'll admit it relies way too much on drama though, they dramatized everything they could."
1348,"Soorarai Pottru is a biopic of Captain G.R Gopinath but not a documentary. So it has all the scenes that a masala movie needs.
What's good:
1. The story is good. An underdog story is not something new but is always appreciated if it's good.
2. There are many good emotional scenes that might make some people cry.
3. The director Sudha Kongara has done a good job. She has shown the story in an entertaining way.
4. Surya shines in the film as he gets the best part. Aparna Balamurali also does a good job as Surya's wife. The supporting cast has done an okay job according to their small roles.
What's bad:
1. There are some predictable scenes in the movie which could have been avoided.
2. Paresh Rawal plays the typical non south indian villain (new trend in south indian films). A great actor like him is underutilized. He doesn't get one good scene.
Overall it is a good biopic and a good family movie too but far from perfect."
1349,"Soorarai Pottru - definitely a flawless movie, you can't expect more from this movie.
Hand full of actors, doing their part effortlessly...no, living their lives in their roles.
Surya, Aparna, Urvashi, Kali, Karunas, Surya friends & Villan etc...their acting will be remembered for longer period of time. Definitely this movie's worth every penny."
1350,"Story lacks continuity where the flashbacks, locations and Tamil language accents are not synchronous. Surya has done a fabulous job. can watch for surya and background score."
1351,"It's going to be remembered until the movies are alive , what a film to see wish I watch in a theatre but it's well deserved to be seen on big screen , Suriya is beast as maaran effortlessly done as always and there are scenes u will be teared by his acting and direction is perfect and applause to GV music üé∂ masss"
1352,Suriya the Pride of Indian Cinema.SooraraiPottru best Movie in the world.I watch SooraraiPottru on Prime More than 5 time the movie SooraraiPottru not Boring
1353,Usually one can never go wrong with a Suriya movie. We may differ in our opinion of the storyline but not his performance. The intensity of his performance makes him a modern day Sivaji Ganesan. Add to it a biopic on one of the pioneers from the airline industry it's a perfect 10.. ofcourse there is a lot of dramatization on the personal aspects but I think the corporate parts are likely and absolutely close to the truth. What makes the movie a watchable entertainer is how they have combined the two. Well directed Sudha. Great to see Aparna pull off her role with elan. And GV is back. The score is difficult for such movies but he is very good.
1354,Great job done by suriya. He should get National Award.
1355,Suriya done fantabulous job..he deserves National Award.
1356,"Inspired a lot, the common man who achieved his goal via every obstacles and hardships."
1357,"Nice plot and excellent making
Outstanding performance especially by Suriya,Urvashi as usual and Aparna.
Probably its not possible to complete the with having wet eyes."
1358,I love loved in this movie is the supporting of a wife and husband should be like this. And movie is such a great inspiration.
1359,First half runs too fast with lots of twice and turns...lots of emotions scenes and fails...Set edge scenes...After intermission second half starts little slow...Good ending...All Characters in movie nailed....Screenplay stands down... Really Movitated movie..Must watch once...ü§ùü§ùü§ù
1360,"A film that showed how much an actor can use or how far he can go. The director really deserves applause. First of all, Big Salute Director Sudha Konkara.Usually when we watch a biopic you feel a little bored. The reason is that the gimmicks seen in the movie do not occur in normal life. Soorarai Pottru is different from this.The Man who said that airplanes are for the common man who has made it possible for people to travel by air for a single rupee. And it is the life of Air Deccan founder G. R Gopinath. His life must have been quite cinematic.Sometimes there are some small compromises when making a real life movie! But director Sudha, her writing, making, Vijay Kumar's dialogues and GV Prakash Kumar's music take the output of the film to another level.Let's take a brief look at the story. The protagonists are the protagonist who has a big dream of starting an airline that is affordable to the common man by avoiding intermediaries and the heroine who lives with a relatively small but strong desire to start her own bakery. The challenges they face, the larger the size of their dreams, the less likely they are to come true, but the human instinct to face the challenges is all accurately drawn.One of the best characters of the actor Surya. What sets Surya apart from other contemporary actors is his acting style which gives him unjust power. His performance, there are no words to describe it. Another testament to his range as an actor.Aparna Balamurali's character was amazing. Aparna, who was the heroine along with Surya was excellent.Urvashi's performance was not surprised because She has proved many times as a wonderful actress. That sentimental scene that performed magnificently. And finally a scene where the lady pilot who flew the flight looks on in amazement.A Movie that can be seen with eyes and mind full. The only downside is that it was a miss from the theater.Soorarai Pottru is a master watch movie. Movie lovers should never miss this."
1361,Everybody's role is awesome and they've done their best and it is one of the masterpiece movie for tamil cinema. Don't miss it
1362,"A New Flavor of Indian Cinema, Surya's acting was awesome, Colour Grading is awesome, A Amazing Movie in Indian Cinema. The best thing I have ever watched. Best Movie in this Decade of World Cinema. Must Watch, I Give 100% Guarantee."
1363,"Thank god he has done with the mass flims finally. This kind of movies brings the best for him. It worked many times before and he should continue this. Movies that has made based on true events always leave a mark that never fades. If we keep delivering flims like this, it would take tamil flim industry to the next level. A must watch and kudos to the director's and her team."
1364,"Amazon has done a great job by releasing this movie worldwide. Every Tamil movie fans can rejoice and celebrate it with this Deepavali!An excellent screenplay based on a true story, along with brilliant performances by the cast and crew.A must watch movie in 2020"
1365,Brilliant script and great performance from all the cast of the movie . Salute to Mr Paresh Rawal for the part he played . Surya is great as usual . A great bio pic displayed in a even great way.
1366,"One off the best movie ever made.amazing acting by Suriya,no its NEDUMAARAN RAAJAANGAMüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•.scrip work was awesomeBut we should see this in theater but we saw in ottüò≠üò≠"
1367,"A great film released in all this lock down , My reason for rating 9 is just the second half . It has regular tom and jerry fights between Hero and Villain , and it is felt regular climax is great his success is an inspiration , action of Suriya in airport scenes and relation between Suriya and Aparna is great , THe great plus for film is G.V.Prakash Kumar's music , Sudha Kongara direction is too good
Fully satisfied after watching this film . Suriya is back after 4 flops his comeback is good
Thanks Sudha madam
thanks again"
1368,"Very well played role by surya, it's an realistic story and shows how rich enterprises won't want other to grow further."
1369,"Actor Surya has literally lived the character 'Nedumaaran' and in most of the scenes his eyes talk a lot. Definitely his best performance till date!Aparna Balamurali bags an important character and she does it with ease. Surely she doesn't end up as an another usual heroine material.All the supporting casts are apt for their role and given their best.
Special mentions for Urvashi , Karunas and Mohan Babu.Movie starts on a slow pace but once it takes off, the rest is set assured and you are on a cloud nine!Music and bgm by GV Prakash is excellent and it definitely builds more value for the movie.Cinematography and editing is handled well. However, Second half could have been trimmed a bit, as it has few repetitive sequences.A lot of hard hitting dialogues and few particular sequences in the entire movie deserves a big clap!Director Sudha kongara is genius in her writing , screenplay , hard hitting dialogues and direction.
The work she has done is seen on screen today, surely she has poured herself out to give a best movie.Soorarai pottru directed by sudha kongara is sure shot winner with no nonsense or unwanted commercial content.
A best OTT release so far!"
1370,"This movie will give you goosebumps and will definitely leave you teary eyed.Urvashi mam,Surya and Aparna have created magic onscreen"
1371,It is a masterpiece movie. It inspires us to not give up.
1372,"Suriya extraordinary performance, truly amazing, finely tuned story with great cast"
1373,"Soorarai pottru is a must watch tamil movie in recent times. Solid performances from the entire cast. Suriya nailed it. Undoubtedly he is one of the finest actors in india. Urvashi, Aparana balamurali deliver the best. GVP, man you were rocked it!! The captain of the movie Sudha kongara presentation is mesmerized. Niketh bommi camera work is awesome. Storyline is predictable but the way of presentation was simply great. Kudos to the entire team. Must Watch!!!"
1374,Extraordinary performance by SURYA........Every common person face the very critical problems to become a unique person in this world.....
1375,Excellent movie. Loved it. The songs has been dominating the playlists for long now. Background score was amazing. It never overshadowed the essence of the movie. Thanks for OTT release. With a baby in hand I should have waited months to watch this masterpiece if it had been a theatre release.
1376,"Such a strong characters, can't get out from soorarai pottru hangover!!!"
1377,"Super movie
Must watch
What a come back from Surya Sir
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç"
1378,"It is a nice movie with brilliant screenplay and Surya at it best.
Kudos to entire team"
1379,An ordinary reviewer can't even take any one of the scene from this movie ... This movie is not dependent on reviews ...Every one's acting is so natural... And scenes are well scripted ..Best movie of 2020
1380,"After two flops he became a hero, surya was returned. A better movie. Sudha mam was a brave and intelligent director. She made surya back"
1381,"SooraraiPottru reached the altitude very greatly..
Standing ovation to the entire team..
Very interesting, inspiring and impressing..
Very Great Film!
Daring adventurous journey..
Great appreciation for Suriya sir to choose this script!
One of the best film in his career!"
1382,What a film nice and best being a vijay sir fan I I loved ajith sir and I loved suriya sir acting Paresh Rawal ji did his best a must watch diwali treat
1383,Was quite impressed with Che (Chaitanya)'s energy & charming screen presence. Krishnakumar is a promising talent. Vivek Prasanna (Seby) also shines in his given space. #Maara's 2 main pillars & best frnds - the IAF buddies!#Suriya #SooraraiPottru
1384,Good movie with great cast and crew...this biography couldn't be any better...only negative thing about this movie is length of the movie..few unnecessary scenes can be removed and the duration could have been reduced then this would have been a great movie....
1385,"The movie felt like documentary with lack of information . Below average movie
One time watchable"
1386,Well I am inspired by the original character capt gopinath but I felt the movie is a complete let down as they did not stick to the original setup. In the end became too preachy which is the case with any of the earlier actor movies.
1387,I expected a better movie from Suriya. I am very dissapointed. It was literally the worst Moviebof Suriya i've ever seen!
1388,"Worst movie I ever seen.
Surya acting was good which is why I've given 1 point to this movie"
1389,"Too much drama kills the message. Suriya needs to allow others in the screen. It becomes annoying to see his preachy self after 1/4th of the film.
A beautiful biography made in to a over drama/senti movie."
1390,Frankly speaking... i expected a movie which will be really connected to reality... The movie was good... 1st half was good.. 2nd half was little slow and lag... and highly predictable for anyone... logical mistakes are there in some scenes... dramatic scenes also... Surya acting was extraordinary... perfect Casting.... Good inspirational movie...
1391,"As it say it's really a true story based inspiration movie of an entrepreneur who choose a different path to achive something at same time change a look of village and middle class people view towards flying.About direction no doubt it really fantastic job done, which never let viewer to take rest, also very good story flow along with best dailogues and emotional touch to the story very touching.
Movie also show one side struggle of an entrepreneur who have new idea from conventional flow in system how he is pushed down by big business people.When it comes to the facts G.R.Gopinath is from Gorur, Hassan, Karnataka state of India. But in the movie they shown he is from Tamilnadu state of India. I agree they modified story according to the viewer intrest but real facts should come out from films so that movie can be a resource of knowledge."
1392,"The very first scene itself was like any Vijay movie. The airport does not give permission to land Surya's flight (due to Villain's influence) in Chennai Airport. If they still land the plane in Chennai Airport, their plane might be impounded (again due to Villain's influence). So, Surya advises to land the plane in Tambaram airforce runway. Surprisingly, by the time the flight reaches from Meenambakkam to Tambaram, Surya somehow reaches Tambaram just in a bike.
I thought only Rajni and Vijay could do this. Now, welcome to the list, Surya! Surya himself drives the plane at a point of time, he is also a flight mechanic or engineer, he is also CEO. What not!
After seeing an overwhelming positive response, at least expected the movie to be realistic. Do know that some heroisms are added to make the movie lively, but since the movie is based on real-life incidents, too much heroism was bad.
Whole of Surya's village paying for him also sounds unbelievable. Reminds me of Sangamam movie.
I also did not like the emotional scene where Surya is not able to pay for flight. Actually I believe that army officers who can fly engines are well paid and It's bit unbelievable that he did not have money. Considering that he had money, but did not take the money to airport is also unlikely, as in an era where flights were less common, he should have assumed the worse case of unavailability of economic class ticket and took more money. That scene was not okay, at least for me.
But I liked the scenes which involved the heroine. It's nice see a determined character as a heroine in movies rather than trying to portray them as cute idiot dolls.
Music was decent. The yellowish shade of cinematography was actually not pleasant to watch. I think they are good for movies that show the underworld, not for the ones like this.
Over-all the movie was okayish. But I'm glad that this movie worked out for Surya. He was waiting for a break for a long time."
1393,"The trailer gives a lots of hints for a master piece, but can't find anything in the actual movie. The trailer describes the protogonist as an uncommon man who was discouraged by the society take a small amount of money and picks a train to make his dream come true, which is really inspiring and sounds new. But the actual movie is an extremely detailed, usual, boring, Tamil hero movie that lacks logic and narration. Every one in the movie did a great job because of the director but the director didn't."
1394,Waste of time seeing this movie. Think twice before going to the movie. Not a good story. Personally I feel is more imaginative
1395,"Surya's performance is run of the mill and the character is most often running everywhere. The so called performance act are melodramatic and clich√©d scenes. Surya has portrayed real significant character play and depth in his other movies Pitha Magan and Nanda. Here SP it is predictable and alot of holes in the plot. Do not expect logic and do not play your rationale card. Well it is a hero based movie.
Aparna Balamurali stands out in her performance and projects herself as exuberantly.The photography is a definite accolade. Enriched polarization and settling in well more on the rural acts.Run of the mill. One time watch. Predictable. Time pass movie."
1396,"The plot of the movie is absolutely senseless. The idea presented by the protagonist has no connection with reality. According to the movie, he is supposed to be the first guy who thought of saving cost by not providing meals or news papers. Also, his idea of procuring cheap planes again makes no sense. Nobody ever blamed the maker of the planes for twin tower attack. Which VC says that you put in the money first and then we'll reimburse? That too for a paltry sum of 47 Lakhs? I wouldn't recommend using your brain while watching this film. The film is also full of outdated ""heroism/heropanti"" like the scene where he met the president or stormed into Paresh's office yelling. The love story was the only good part. Things do get better in the second half though."
1397,"I have read the book. The story is not slightly fictionalized, it is so heavy that it takes the message to a very low level. Apart from this the sensationalism takes the center stage than the feasibility and the originality of the story."
1398,"This is the truly selfish movie... Cinema people always tolerate the government and business man..but they don't want to fight for theater charges for common people..every time I went to theater they always check my hand bag..we Don't carry the food, snacks and water battle's also.. tickets rates are divided by certain categories like only high class people should watch in luxury theaters and multiplex .. you want to watch one movie you have to spend at least 1000rs for each one tickets, food,drinks and traveling charges and etc
You have any guts to question and fight for this problems I'll agry Surya was a great actor and sudha kongara was a great director"
1399,"Bureaucratic incompetence and corruption continues to be the biggest bane on entrepreneurship in the country, this serious topic has been trivilased by incompetent screenplay, not to mention hating the brahmins while using a brahmin Gopinath Iyengar's story of hard fought battle with the enterprise killing walfare state and poverty porn loving machinery"
1400,Watchable worthy movie and this movie contains good msg to the world and the rest of the story contains several flags and some over rated scenarios or on the must be realized
1401,"Cringe worthy, unnecessary emotional scenes and fake villains has truly destroyed Captain Gopinaths legacy."
1402,Suriya acting good. Movie was bit draggy.rem all ok
1403,The problem is the story of this man was glorified for the sake of movie. Suraya's performance was awesome as usual but did not strike a chord as the emotional scenes did not have a connection with the characters involved. The film was long enough to bore. Totally wasted my diwali weekend. Had to watch guru film to get over this unrealistic fil.
1404,"All the scenes are so dramatic. Most scenes are
exaggerated. Could be nicer."
1405,"Suriyas acting is better in this movie than in his other recent movies. But storyline is very average and no gripping content for a lengthy movie.
Every one knows that it's the biopic of captain c.r. Gopinath, then why they changed the names and unnecessary madurai slang as he is from karnataka. If the film is with original names then it would be better.."
1406,Soorarai Pottru could have been far more inspiring and even engrossing had Kongara done away with these irritants. Her plane would have had a smoother flight sans the turbulence.
1407,Indian Cinema is Trash. It's Uncreative and Corny. Go watch Hollywood Movies.
1408,"When people try to manipulate real life incidences, the worth is being degraded.
And don't try to give advice to us, show in your action. If you release this movie in threatre or OTT for 1 or 2 rupee, really we can appreciate Surya."
1409,"Its just an above average movie which have beautiful camera work and extra ordinary acting from Surya and other lead actors...it has filled with lot of cleche scenes and predictable suspenses,dramtic scenes in this movie give a lot of boring elements,"
1410,Very politically motivated too like wearing black dress (DMK supporter)
1411,"Ok average movie, over dramatised story of a startup aviation venture. Actually a Brahmin enterpreneur built the low-cost airlines and made common Indians to fly cheap (as per the Biopic on which this movie was supposed to have been made) but in this movie they purposefully told the story as if Brahmins discriminate lower caste and only a lower caste hero built a low cost airline after lot of struggle beating a corrupt system. As a movie, may be it would have achieved an emotional connect with Tamil audiance, but factually lot of over dramatisation, wrong projection of DGCA, IAF etc.which is condemnable."
1412,In real life the hero is a Brahmin. In Reel life the villan is a Brahmin. Stop this caste based hate. Hope Hindus can see through the deceitful villification of Hindu tradition by him and his family.
1413,Nothing much. just an awesome movie. as a thalapathy fan i am happy for suriya sir
1414,"Nothing to shout here. I admire Surya's performance. That's about it. Biopics should be biopics. If it's not interesting enough as it is, don't bother making a fake one."
1415,"A great theme modelled on the inspirational life of Capt. Gopinath who was a very suave and genteel man.
While it is perfectly acceptable to take creative liberties in a movie like this, there is a limit to it to avoid portraying the hero as a polar opposite of the real person.
Some examples:
* Having the lead character dance at a funeral
* Openly speaking obscenities
* Barging into the room of the President of India to fight his case
* Smooching his wife in public
It is these parts that spoil otherwise great performances by Spirits and some of the lead cast."
1416,Nice movie but some not truth scene s surya nice acting and romantic scenes are super
1417,If they avoid love scene in-between the serious scene then it was a perfect motivational flim
1418,"Horrible screenplay,acting,music nothing is close to real. Even story is not as it in biography. Just skip this movie."
1419,"Waste of a good true story . What could have been a milestone movie turned into an obnoxious, false and malicious propaganda ...."
1420,"Why u guys always distort history?
The lead man is a brahmin and u guys made brahmin a villain in this.
Pathetic"
1421,Movie is full of emotional drama. It lacks logic and intelligence. He made this film just to prove his acting skills. This movie is for people who are dumb. Not at all worth the hype. Just another disgusting melodrama by another wannabe Tamil director. I think these ratings are fake. I don't think this movie worth a Nine. They must paid a lot of people to get this rating.
1422,"Overly dramatized; fake emotions; artificially infused mother/wife/friend/(fill in the blanks) sentiments, pathetic script and acting. Be ready to see a cringe worthy ""emotional"" scene very 10 minutes. Made to appeal to the low end of the economic spectrum. Made for masses with zero substance.P.A.T.H.E.T.I.C!"
1423,"Soorarai Pottru is a Tamil movie available in Telugu and Kannada too on Amazon Prime Video. Watch for the good performance by Suriya, Aparna Balamurli, Paresh Rawal, Prakash Belawadi, Achyuth Kumar.Even though I watched in Kannada, the movie was perfectly marched for example all boards and minute details were in kannada felt so good. Effort to detail was clearly seen. Even subtitling work and voiceover was good. Songs too.There is quite a lot of drama, many tears, a near-crash and of course, actor Suriya's trademark swag.While perhaps not as dramatic as the film, his vision really did change life in India forever, and he ideas set in stone what most of us take for granted today - a flight to almost any major city in India, for a price every middle-class salaried person can afford.Born in 1951, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar Gopinath was raised in a small village named Gorur in Karnataka and is the second of eight children. His father, a school teacher and a Kannada novelist, believed that schools were a system of regimentation and decided to teach his son at home.Capt Gopinath reared cattle to sell milk, got in poultry farming, silkworm farming, then turned a motorcycle dealer, an Udupi hotel owner, a stockbroker, irrigation equipment dealer, an agriculture consultant, a politician and finally an aviation entrepreneur - struggling, falling, rising, falling, rising again and taking off.Few nuances were good in movie but real life is a different ball game or to be honest a game of balls.. üòúWatchable, inspiring and decent film making."
1424,"It will make you cry, cry, cry, and some other things like admiring (passion of nedumaaran, arc of bommi, love of nedumaaran's parents), love, amd anger.The only thing missing is the ""grip"" to hold you throughout; it makes you feel ""you are watching a movie"". Maybe it was the reason of a small screen in my hands. Don't know.Rest of it is just awe. Go for it."
