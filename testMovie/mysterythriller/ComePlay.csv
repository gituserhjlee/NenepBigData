0,"The movie is a good way to spend the evening, acting is decent, love all young talent, storyline is entertaining, I like the fact that parents believed and jumped on the train of fighting this monster quite early in the movie!The movie is heavily inspired by Stranger Things, but way scarier version that's for sure."
1,"And the acting police.
1. For all the crappy movies I have to wade through to actually find something worth watching these days is like finding a particular needle in a stack of needles.
2. This movie had an original plot, decent acting (despite what another ""reviewer"" had complained), it was creepy, and you didn't know the ending 30 minutes into it.
3. I gave this movie an eight because it's actually one of the better creepy movies I've seen in three months. I don't know about all of you, but indie movies are starting to grind on my nerves. I have to turn on the subtitles because I can't understand what they're saying most of the time. And then you have these user reviewers who critically acclaim movies where there's some hidden meaning in the ending that leaves you asking, ""wtf was that and why did I just waste ninety minutes of my life I'll never get back to watch that bunk?""So, this movie is not fantasy as another review suggests. It's a very decent horror movie that I think most people will enjoy."
2,"I think this was a good horror movie, which had something new in it that kept it interesting. The general presentation was very good.The pacing is a slow burn with more and more weird stuff happening as it goes on, which I liked a lot. Being someone who hates jump scares I was glad this one didn't really have any. The horror aspect was well done but some might find it mild maybe, and it was scary.I like that there seems to be an allegory happening in the background of technology causing people to become more isolated and lonely; which of course is sad but true. The demon could be interpreted as a representation of loneliness perhaps as you get older.I'm not sure why this one was lower on the ratings, but I think it is underrated and I enjoyed it.7/10 a good novel horror."
3,"So basically they took Babadook, took off his hat and named him Larry. Nice one time watch. View and forget"
4,"It's rare that a movie blows me away and sticks with me for hours after I've finished watching it, but that's exactly what Come Play did to me. Right from the beginning, the eerie vibe starts and it doesn't let up.I have a tendency to get deeply involved with movies of this nature, outcast child struggling through a broken home and difficulty in school. Yes, it's because I can completely identify, so it makes these films more effective and personal. In this case, Oliver is an autistic child who uses smart phones and iPads to communicate.But when an e-book titled Misunderstood Monsters appears out of nowhere, the story begins to unfold.Misunderstood Monsters is about Larry, a lonely creature just looking for a friend to protect. But it's not as simple as that, Larry is not the kind of friend you want. He taunts, torments and injures as he tries to gain enough strength to ""take"" his chosen new friend, in this case Oliver.The amount of tension is constant because Larry is persistent, and the moments of peace are very brief. Eventually, mom and dad put their differences aside as each becomes aware of Larry and his intentions, and their attempts to stop Larry become a lot more challenging than just destroying the devices of communication in the immediate vicinity.The basic story of the parents is that mom is the primary caregiver who struggles to help her child gain the ability of speech and have some sort of social interactions with others. Dad is the fun one who distances himself from the serious aspects of caring for a child with limitations, and prefers to be the lighthearted and fun parent, despite the inequality in responsibilities. Further interpersonal plots twists are one of Oliver's school bullies was once his best friend but that ended in a misguided effort by mom to protect her son from scrutiny. Larry plays on all of this in an effort to convince Oliver to take his hand and be his 'friend'.And like the best movies of this nature, the ending is very bittersweet. You realize the steps mom is willing to go to protect her son, to the point that Oliver actually understands. It's a real heart tugging finale and it has choked me up both times (so far) that I've watched the movie, and that's not an easy thing to do.This is a classic film in that you understand the director likely had aspects of Oliver's upbringing in his own childhood, and that's what gives it a very penetrating authentic feel. It's smart and scary, sweet and sad, and ultimately very effective for those who can connect with the subject matter rather than just expecting a silly knife wielding psycho looking for his next teenage victim to off.An extra mention to the child actor playing the lead role. He did an outstanding job! Right away, your heart goes out to him. He portrays a shy timidness with the innocence of a child that makes you just want to protect and comfort him. His looks and mannerisms playing such a challenging role at his age are to be commended because nothing about it seemed silly or fake. He kind of reminded me of Danny from The Shining but even more engaging.There are a number of messages in the movie, one of which is how technology has crippled human interaction and responsibility. All you need to do is look at how many millennial females cannot seem to drive a car without a phone in their hand and you completely understand.Come Play became an instant classic for me. I was never bored and was on the edge of my seat the majority of the movie. The ending that left me sitting there in the dark feeling a bit emotional helped solidify it as a new favorite. Very well done and highly recommended."
5,"While we all want something terrifying from the horror films we watch, it is nice to get some psychological and emotional aspects intertwined within the scares to give it that extra depth. This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.The film still does have its classic clich√©s with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films. There's also a very interesting entity with a great backstory with some decent enough CGI to present it. The atmosphere and tension is prevalent and there are some clever camera choices.Overall it's way better than many will think it will be after seeing the very cliche trailer, and people shouldn't take it for just a kids horror. If this is the one wide release horror film we get for Halloween, it does serve its purpose well enough."
6,"No, it's not a masterpiece that would deserve 10/10 as some have rated it here. But it's not a total crap either so it doesn't deserve 1/10 ratings either.
The story as a whole is actually good, something different. There are few jumps scares, some better than others, there's some creepiness at times. It's supposed to be a horror movie but at times it felt more as fantasy - I think that might be one of the reasons why this movie is rather weak, the director couldn't make up his mind what genre to choose.
The main actors, unfortunately, are terrible. The few ones that are actually ok play only secondary roles. The parents are annoying, you actually hope that at least one of them would die - they're so unlikable (I won't say if anyone dies or not because I don't want to give spoilers). Some the dialogues would make your eyes roll as well. I don't know what went wrong, the movie had so much potential to be so much better. I thought it might have been the budget but for 9mil (to compare: Babadook had only 2mil) I would expect something better.
In short: it's an ""ok"" movie. Definitely something different. The 5.9 score it has at the moment is fair."
7,"I thought this movie was just alright, nothing really special about it. The movie felt a little repetitive and predictable at times. I didn't find it very scary either. The monster was cool but didn't really do anything. Mostly just creeped around the entire time. Generous 6 stars."
8,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2020 is undoubtedly one of the worst years ever for movies, not even in terms of quality, but the infinite delays of highly anticipated films automatically make this year more underwhelming than what it would ever be. Nevertheless, it still delivered a few surprises along the way. Movies that I wasn't really expecting to like as much as I did (Underwater, The Call of the Wild), or even films that I knew I'd enjoy them but eventually end up absolutely loving them (The One and Only Ivan, Palm Springs, The Personal History of David Copperfield). Jacob Chase's feature directorial debut is amongst the former group. I only knew the premise and the cast, which I have to admit didn't really convince me, but I still gave it a go since this could be my last trip to a film theater this year...If it ends up truly being my last time watching a movie on the big screen this year, then it's a wonderful final film. Come Play is one of the biggest surprises of 2020. There are so many aspects that I absolutely love about it, but it doesn't escape from several issues as well. I'll start with the impressive performance of Azhy Robertson (Oliver) as a non-verbal autistic kid. As someone who has shared some time with a young autistic girl, I left the theater fully believing that Azhy was, in fact, autistic in real-life (I didn't recognize him from Marriage Story). I was mind-blown when I found out he wasn't. His display feels so realistic and authentic that I never thought his portrayal was pure acting.John Gallagher Jr. (Marty) is really good as well, but he doesn't have as much screentime as Gillian Jacobs (Sarah). The latter isn't exactly awful, but she definitely disappoints in the more sentimental moments. She's great during the horror sequences, adding to the suspenseful atmosphere, but when the time comes to really deliver heartfelt dialogues and passionate expressions, Gillian fails to offer a convincing performance. The other kids in the movie are also quite cringe-worthy, but not every young actor can be incredible at such a young age.Despite the cast's irregular interpretations, none ruins the captivating story behind Larry, the ""misunderstood monster"" on the other side of the screen. The social commentary is loud and clear, giving the film a whole other layer. Jacob Chase's commitment and dedication to this work (based on his own short) are palpable throughout the runtime, visible through the numerous tiny details spread across each storyline. I found myself astonishingly invested in the narrative. However, Chase often repeats scenes meant to pass that social message he so desperately wants to transmit, transforming many scenes that could be genuine into something extremely forced.This last aspect is compensated with innovative horror sequences with highly creative use of today's technology to generate an incredibly tense environment. There aren't many jumpscares, but most are pretty effective. Nevertheless, it's the suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire movie that elevates the overall horror vibe. Chase also employs long takes, which ultimately leaves viewers at the edge of their seats due to some excellent camera work (Maxime Alexandre) and seamless editing (Gregory Plotkin). I really like the score (Roque Ba√±os), but there are a couple of moments where the almost silent music weirdly becomes an adventure tune.Another brilliant technical decision comes from Chase's work with the VFX team. As expected from a low-budget production, the visual effects would never reach today's standards if they decided to show the monster in plain sight during daylight. If you go into the film expecting a monster movie where the latter is the protagonist, forget it. The crew was intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge the not-that-good VFX quality, so Chase ""hides"" the monster with low lighting and ""shows"" him during night sequences and/or through a smartphone/tablet's camera. It might be a disappointing aspect for many people, but I was delighted with this smart decision.It's more of a family drama than a generic horror flick. There's a fair attempt at delivering something special, and I do believe it was very close to being one of the best films of the year. The treatment of the autistic character is near-perfect. I love the fact that not only the movie shows every problem that a condition like this brings, but it also demonstrates the extraordinary qualities that autistic people possess. Even though he cannot speak, Oliver is exceptionally clever, fun, and brave, something I believe most of today's society doesn't think autistic kids can be. The ending is both bold and surprising, finishing on a significant emotional moment that will leave viewers with a bittersweet reaction.In the end, Come Play is one of my favorite surprises of this year. Jacob Chase proves that he's a dedicated filmmaker who knows his craft. With exceptional preparation, Chase presents an extremely captivating narrative, distinct from the generic horror flicks that flood every year. By focusing on the emotionally compelling story instead of the formulaic jumpscares, the horror sequences have a much more significant impact due to the viewer's connection with the main characters, especially Azhy Robertson's. The latter delivers one of the best young performances of 2020, interpreting an autistic kid with remarkable authenticity. However, the rest of the cast is not up to the task, especially Gillian Jacobs, who disappoints with an overall emotionally underwhelming display. The social commentary is important and efficiently transmitted, despite Chase eventually losing his balance and exaggerating the number of scenes that ultimately become forced. Technically, the suspenseful atmosphere steals the spotlight from the few yet effective jumpscares. Ends with a surprisingly bold, emotionally bittersweet moment. As long as you don't expect a ""monster flick"" packed with predictable scares, I sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a Halloween plan.Rating: B+"
9,"Like the top comment said (at this time) ""I wish directors would stop being directors and producers"". I agree with this sentiment exactly. Every horror film I have watched recently that fell flat on its face, has ended with ""Directed and Written By:""Movie was done well, and was probably budge-friendly due to all the low quality phone shots, but the concept was kinda dumb. Seemed like an obvious bite off of It Follows, but instead of the metaphor of STD's, it's about kids always on their phones."
10,"The movie has a decent, but flimsy, premise that sets up some good early scares. The problem is that these characters barely act like people, let alone parents of a pre teen autistic child. Even when the film tries to put a twist on a few cliches in some scenes it doubles down on those same cliches in the rest of the film. Solid CGI and a few good ideas make this horror flick at least entertaining, but too inconsistent to be more than passable."
11,"The trailer looked good so I buckled up and gave it two hours of my life. And I'm glad I did. The build up to finally seeing Larry the was worth it, and it was honestly creepy. I had a few good goose bump moments... but I never got jump scared like other reviewers said. I was kinda hoping that the story was going to go in a different direction then it did, I was hoping Larry really was misunderstood, but I'm satisfied with the ending, albeit a bit predictable... it was rather sad... so If you got a soft spot i'd recommended having a tissue nearby."
12,"I really enjoyed Come Play, I thought it was orignal and had a really creepy vibe to it. Yes it was a very simple plot but either way it was enjoyable."
13,"This movie freaked me the hell out, though I took off a star for jump scares. Overall, it had me on the edge of my seat and the monster was scary. It's a good, creepy movie and it's definitely worth the watch."
14,"Over the symbology of this film, other than say that im overwhelmed by the sensation of true fear, like the ones i felt when i was a little boy afraid of the thing called''bolla'' here in norway, and the film is completely without blood and gore, thats almost unheard of today.so i would say a nightmatre on elm street without blood and gore factor could be a good comparishion( i hate to compare ,but larry told me to do it sooo...)so plain horror you get, almost nonstop seemingly never ending, and the production has a vast variety of sound and light effects, cgi of superior quality, and the children actors are like made out of a good mix of tom and sean and some forrest in the edges. and its a film that will scare the heck out of people that are convinced that that can track ghosts via the camera we all have in our digital gadgets, and will for sure loose their senses each time a light starts blinking.im ready to declare that this is the best of its kind made in this decennium, pure horror for all its worth, hypoanemic and hypointestinosic it is, and could even be used by the round table a saturday evening with the family, not familyfriendly but rather safe wihin the frames of common scares. its a must see film is the grumpy old mans message"
15,"Grab some pillows and blankets to hide behind because today we are talking about the new terrifying film, Come Play! Come Play has brilliant jump scares flying at you left and right, and tons of scary scenes that will make you jump in odd ways. The suspense of the movie continually puts you on the edge of your seat dying to find out what happens next. Come Play provides an authentic plot. Quite frankly, I have never seen anything like Come Play, which makes it even more entertaining to watch.Come Play follows a young boy named Oliver (Azhy Robertson) who is on the autistic spectrum and, unfortunately, cannot verbalize for himself. Instead, Oliver uses his phone or tablet to communicate. However, one night his phone starts talking to him. In the middle of the night, Oliver's phone randomly gets stuck on a book called ""Misunderstood Monsters,"" and Oliver learns of a monster named Larry, who just wants a friend. Soon Oliver learns Larry's true potential and he and his family must escape the curse of this devilish monster.The most compelling characteristic that makes Come Play so entertaining is the writing. The writing is superb. It is written in a strange and clandestine way, so it doesn't scare you in the predictable ways you might anticipate. Come Play is extremely impressive with its horror approach. The writers create angst and scare you with just two innocent people walking down the sidewalk, and not with a huge creepy monster. This movie's electrical effects are extremely important because of the electrical connection Larry has. The lighting effects in this film are exceptional. They definitely make the movie even creepier.Come Play is a horror movie. I recommend it especially if this is your first experience viewing this film genre, because it is scary, but in a fun and entertaining way. Besides the typical jump scares, the movie also provides a different type of horror - bullying. Bullying is shown quite a lot in the first half of the movie and may not set the best example for children watching. Important lessons are communicated in this film, particularly the importance of friendship and family.Similar to when the jump scares made me scream, I am screaming now that my rating for Come Play is 5 out of 5 stars. It has amazing writing and electrical effects. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults, because of the frightening scenes and language. Reviewed by Jude A., KID FIRST!"
16,"I liked this movie. i had low expectations for this film due to its cheesy plot in the trailer, but ultimately was pleasantly surprised. It was scary, had good pacing so it didnt feel too long, and the heartfelt story of the family really made me connect to them. interesting yet good emotional ending. I like these horror movies that dont get a lot of fame but are done well. Plus they show the villain quite a bit. 8/10"
17,"I think this movie was great, only a bit too fast in the begining and we don't get a good picture of how Larry looks like but most of it was great, good acting from the kids, good story, Larry is scary and it had a good ending which made my heart melt."
18,"I started watching this movie without any expectations but this movie was a really nice surprise. It has a good mixture of jump scare without it being overwhelming and the storyline was good also good.
It has nice effects and good sound effects.
I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a good horror/thriller with a twist into the modern."
19,"So I went to see this movie cause it was a horror movie finally in Dolby (after Tenet held the theater for like 6 weeks) and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was paced very well for tension and excitement but it also allowed for character development which is always great to see in a horror movie. The characters that you thought would be cookie cutter roles that you seen a hundred times in scary movies end up surprising you in how they turn out. The monster was definitely scary and kept a great suspense going the whole time. And then, it finished off with a very strong ending. I want to learn more about the monster and would love a sequel. 10/10. (Gillian Jacobs definitely did not Brita this up!)"
20,"I've seen better and worse, but for what it is, as a PG-13 horror movie, I think it does really well. It's short on scares, so don't go into this hoping to be scared out of your mind, but I think the emotional power that the message conveys is definitely worth a viewing. Definitely struck my heart strings by the ending. It's definitely derivative of several movies, but it's pretty good for sure."
21,"This movie may be rated for 13+, but I know many adults that would be thoroughly spooked by this one.There's really very little that I can say I disliked about this movie, it was well-shot, the acting was good, the pacing kept me interested throughout and the idea is fairly fresh.If there's one misgiving I have about the film, is the audio. The show jumps back and forth, between using almost inaudible whispers to extremely loud bangs. Something I usually expect from horrors, getting the audience to lean-in and listen before a scare, but it was a little overused here.Overall though, fantastic film, made my Halloween much more spoopy."
22,"Movie does the excellent job to depict the struggle that every parents has with children with ASD. For me its not abut the monsters, its about cleverly interconnected pallet of art pieces, bravo !!!"
23,This movie scared the heck out of me and very sad ending
24,"This movie is a little gem of a horror film. Not saying it's the best but for what it's worth, it scores points on some decent scares using electronic devices. It's refreshing to see that we haven't run out of ideas just yet. Great acting by Julian Jacobs. Definitely worth a watch."
25,"The amount of times spongebob is referenced or clips of it that are played in this ""horror"" film is unforgivable.
This was not scary at all. I WISH I had not spent $20 to watch this. But, it had great reviews which I now believe are fake or payed for. Theres no way people actually like this movie. No way.
They also tried REALLY hard to have a deep meaning about technology and social media and it made an already bad movie suck even worse with that failed delivery. Just awful. I tried so hard to find a redeeming part of this crap show and couldnt find one. Save your money!"
26,"I kinda forgot how the story went but i'm pretty sure this is just Babadook with iphones and fwends. The sfx isn't that great and some of the characters actions are questionable, but the spooks are pretty good, just the right amount of cheap jump-scares and smart atmospheric spoopiness here and there. Still, if you haven't seen Babadook i'd recommend that over this."
27,"This movie was so hard to watch for so many reasons. The writing was awful. Totally unbelievable social interactions take place throughout the movie. In a movie this bad, I wish I would have at least gotten to see Larry clearly. I did not think there was an agenda here but I found it in the specific choices for the people helping Oliver (only kid of the three to not be a total jerk initially, the teacher, and the doctor)."
28,"Most characters have a story arch which is a rare thing in recent movies. The plot is simple and very predictable, but it doesn't hurt the overall enjoyment of the flick.The horror is tense yet offers nothing new to the genre. The monster's design could remind you of some early 2010 creepypastas (you decide if that's good or bad to you).Overall, it resembles The Babadook (2014), switching the book to everyday tech."
29,"The field of horror movies is dominated by mediocrity. A lot of horrors are actually awful, and only a select few are actually good or great. This one is perfectly medicore in every aspect. It's exactly what you can expect from a mediocre horror movie, nothing more, nothing less."
30,"Come Play tries to be something more substantial than just another cheap horror flick, and for that, I give it due credit. It's unfortunate, then, that it's often slow and boring. It's clear that it makes an effort at connecting on an emotional level, but again, it simply fails."
31,Yoh should defently watch this movie!!! Itssss soooo good!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!
32,"Totaly worth the ticket price, a good decent horror movie during the pandemic."
33,If you like those two you'll like this. Not in terms of story line but has that vibe. I was expecting it to be more sci fi from the premise. Good quality movie fully budgeted for big screen viewing
34,"And I mean the 2015 remake, but with a better story. Acting was solid, especially with this kind of premise. I think what made me like this film was that it had heart. Obviously, there are plot holes but it's better not to question it and just enjoy the ride."
35,"I really enjoyed the originality in how the movie makes a vague distinction between possible supernatural influences verses online child predators in telling a story about a very creepy and scary monster that seems to seek sympathy for being lonely and having no friends by communicating t his through an online children's book to an Autistic child who can't speak and say no to this monster. I was beginning to think this was going to be a kind of Maurice Sendack ""Where The Wild Things Are"" kind of tall tale. BIG NEGATORY ON THAT! This is some scary movie on a psychological level I've not seen in other similar movies about monsters.This is clever on so many levels in toying with the audience at the same time drawing them in as to what it is and what it wants with an Autistic child who can't speak to say no to the monster that it doesn't want to be its friend.Very good special effects and convincing looking monster and very scary. I don't know if this would freak out kids at the age of the child actors that experience this monster. I know at that age I would just soiled myself and ran out of the theater screaming.I predict this is going to be a classic horror movie on lines of the Chucky, the killer doll in The Child's Play movies. You've been warned!"
36,"Larry the monster is just plain scary, no wonder he has no friends. John Gallagher Jr is awesome as always. Gillian Jacobs is believable as a mother trying to gain her sons trust, and Azhy Robertson is an amazing child actor! Top that off with an emotional story line and a sympathetic monster and you have a good time at the movie theater."
37,"Made an account just to give this movie the rating it deserved.
I have to say I'm a huge horror fan and I was pretty excited to watch this film after the high score I saw here.
A huge disappointment would be an understatement. First of all if you read the reviews you'll see that most of them are written with the Unrecognizable Wish Chinese merchandiser language that is far distant from English. This movie is the horror movie version of 'when you order online / when it arrives home' meme.What a terrible plot that is basically non-rhyming, less inspired version of Babadook.I have to give credits to the movie, because usually I love the low budget B movies with terrible acting but NONE of them had the level of uncanniness in Gillian Jacobs' acting. This was the worst one I have ever seen.
(The part where she's ''running'' downstairs to check the children is my favorite)Throughout the film after seeing some of the well-thought out (almost artistical) jump scare scenes would indicate that someone knew what they were doing. The only scary thing about this movie is that this movie had a budget. It's not even a good bad movie.Unfriending Larry on Facebook."
38,"Nothing to see here, folks.
I had the privilege of seeing this movie alone in the theater with my friend and we had fun pointing out things during this tame movie.
For example, in one scene the dad is working in his booth and there are pamphlets blowing everywhere. The perspective shows the dad in the front of the screen with the pages flying in the background. Suddenly, a collection of papers - *gasp!* - hit something, forming the shape of a man standing there.
1. This has been done before (see ""The Conjuring"").
2. The monster in the movie looks nothing like a man... why did the collection of papers form that shape?Another scene, near the climax of the movie, the mom cries, ""I wish you were normal!"" to her son. But the monster is chasing them throughout their house and things are chaotic. The timing was awful there; shouldn't she have been more concerned about their safety?
Also, the adults are quite ignorant. Can't they think of anything to do against this baddie than run or throw electronics out of the house? The dad tries to outsmart it by locking it in his booth, but... I mean, the monster just got in with all of the doors closed, you think that's going to stop it? It didn't even work, as the dad is attacked mere moments later.""Come Play"" borrows things from more successful movies like Poltergeist and The Conjuring. It's nothing but lame jump scares that would seemingly only frighten newcomers to the horror genre. Gillian Jacobs, who I loved in Community, gives a good effort but the movie just stinks.
It's also repetitive... get used to seeing the cover of the ""novel"" the monster appears in, and get used to the first few pages; they will be read often.
Sadly, parts are also predictable. We see the kid using his dad's digital measuring tool, and sure enough, the monster, who is mostly invisible in the movie, is measured by him. The distance gets smaller and smaller... we all saw that coming. Mama asks her son to look her in the eye, which he doesn't do; he is autistic, and that's how it is. But of course, the boy eventually does.Lame movie, not worth your time."
39,"It's very child focused, but is probably too scary for little ones, all of the adults feel like they're being portrayed as childish fools & teens would most likely laugh at it, so who is Come Play for?Without looking, It feels like this is from a very junior team of writers, production staff & directors, but having said that, it does look good, but it's only a very thin veneer of horror with regular appearances of Sponge Bob & an over reliance of tech to allow the stories plot. The scene where the parents explain what they think is happening to each other is totally laughable, in fact I did!It's not bad bad & it's not funny bad, but it's just very so-so; if the point is to say get off of screens & gadgets, well we can all agree with that, so let's go........"
40,"This movie was sooo good
Decent scares, with a heartwarming message. Definitely top 5 of 2020"
41,"This movie was based on a short film by the same director and as a short it probably work but in the same way as ""Lights Out"" and ""Mama"" it's not enough to be a full feature. A scary 5 minute movie can seldom be stretched into 90 minutes without loosing the things that make it scary. The movie is decently made but not enough to make a lasting impression. It would have been better if the studio let the director make a new movie instead of just making a longer movie of his short story.I hope the director gets a chance to make another movie with new material to show his potential like David F Sandberg."
42,"I love it ... it's a wonderful movie , has a lot of excitement, thriller and emotions ‚ù§ , i think its one of the best horror movies in 2020 , watch it now ......."
43,I've seen a ridiculous amount of horror movies but this one made me want to write a review just to beware people out there of the horrors it brings. The horrors of wasting your time.
44,"To be clear, this was not nearly as good as that film, which ranks as one of my all time favorites. But it's got some similarities. We have a young boy with emotional issues, a mother troubled with how to relate to him, and something very creepy haunting the boy.
The positives: I felt that the boy's Autism was authentically portrayed. I loved the concept of how the demon presents itself. The acting is strong and there were were some good jump scares. I was also impressed with the very unexpected and satisfying ending.
The negatives: Some unrealistic character decisions, slow pacing at times, and over long.
There isn't much in the theaters right now so If you're in the mood for a horror film on the big screen, this is well worth your time."
45,"I'm left pretty speechless. This movie was so bad, I don't even know where to begin. - there was nothing scary about it (a few typical monster scenes that we have all seen 100x's in any other horror movie);, and a few routine ""jump-scares"".
Other than that, - nothing -- I fell asleep twice from boredom. - Believe me, I'm not being a jerk, just being honest with the hopes that I can save some of you some time (and possibly money if ur renting). The story was dumb, the acting was weak, and I'm just glad it's over. -"
46,"Let me just start this off by saying this film has its moments of genuinely good horror, but it's still very clunky. I think if you take out Spongebob then you have something here. I think it would've worked better if they made up a cartoon character instead of using the most innocent character known to man. He's basically the secondary antagonist. The first being Oliver's mom, of course. Ditch Spongebob and make a more focused and serious horror movie. When you watch a horror movie, you usually try to put yourself in the role of the main character and try to feel what it's to be them, and all I could think is what show Larry (awful name for a horror villain, especially when there is a Spongebob character named Larry) would try to lure me in with. If you want a good laugh, imagine this movie but replace Spongebob with the Youtuber or cartoon you were obsessed with as a kid. To me, a monster named Larry trying to kidnap me by using South Park clips is delightfully dumb. The entire movie reeks of ""3am calling Spongebob gone wrong"" Youtube videos. I'm not kidding you when I say there is a scene where Larry tries to lure the main kid in with a kitchen sponge. It was hilarious. There's not much else to say. I hope everyone who made this had fun and is proud of it, but for me, I think it was an interesting idea with some good moments, but is still heavily flawed with its characters, message, and overall badaling decisions."
47,"This movie is great!!! Its super good i also like the short film ""Larry"". But this movie was super good acting and storyline! You should watch this movie!"
48,"An interesting premise ultimately can't make up for what is a rather formulaic, overdramatic, and predictable little thriller- even despite its better qualities. The best moments in the film happen about after the halfway point. The first half of the film is the exact predictable introduction you would expect from this type of flick, and it's rather disappointing to see they settled on a setup so unoriginal. None of its characters really prove to be likable, and all their characters seem to be all over the place at times, with every character often making stupid decisions in order to keep the plot going. I guess you can just right it off as typical horror movie cliches, but it just seems so frustrating and unnecessary when you have a unique and original premise for a horror flick for the first time in a very long time. It has a decent amount of scares when the film is at the height of its powers, but sadly it isn't enough to carry the film along to the end, and eventually the scars just become rather jumpy, predictable, or simply consist of really loud noises. There is no definitive style behind the film, and a weird amount of Spongebob references and clips on screen, I have literally no clue why. At times I felt unsure what age group this was made for, as it often seems like a little kid film with its younger characters, but obviously too scary for any younger kids to enjoy. In the end, Come Play was entertaining, somewhat scary at times, but ultimately not original enough to be worth your time.
My Rating: 5.5/10"
49,"Wouldnt consider this to be a scary movie. Not sure of all the high rates it got, its a bit goofy. Its kinda sweet, has some sentiment behind it. Not worth watching again."
50,Derivitive movie that's been done countless times before.The acting -- especially the kids -- is pretty bad.You know exactly where this movie is going before you turn it on.Direction is just OK.Real problem is that there is not an original scene is the entire 90 minutes.
51,We are actually getting a few decent flicks this crazy year.Overall story was pretty cool and original'ish. The movie kept my attention all the way until the end. CGI was very good. Actors were great although it was a shame the writer had to make the parents so super lame. I feel that if they had a better character development I would have definitely given it a higher rating.This movie isn't for everyone.I would actually watch this one again sometime.
52,"I think Come Play had the potential to be something much better than the version I saw. It has an intriguing core (that connects from an emotional standpoint) and some okay jumpscares. However, the performances aren't that great (Gillian Jacobs had me laughing unintentionally on at least a couple of occasions), the kid's autism is treated as a mere plot device, and from the moment the physical manifestation of the creature is revealed, the film progressively got less scary. Now, I know it's easier to sustain viewer interest in a short film (which I'm sure was the reason for its success) but for a 95-minute feature, there has to be more meat to characters and some level of logic that works within its creepy, manipulative universe. Writer-director Jacob Chase doesn't capitalize on the premise (that of a monster using electrical devices to abduct a child) and delivers a ho-hum horror escapade that I'll forget pretty soon."
53,"This isn't a horror movie. It's basically drama with elements of low budget CGI ""horror"". You truly wouldn't be missing out on absolutely anything if you skipped this. It's basically a divorcing parents /autistic kid /technology is bad - casserole. Very few redeemable scenes, the cringe is real, and the jumpscares very 2012.
Larry lives in all screens and devices, and this movie made me want to toss my TV out the window too. Why the high rating, people?"
54,Such good acting and storyline! Many jump scares i just love everything about this movie! Dont listen to the bad reviews. This movie is great in all ways. The storyline is sometimes sad or scary but moatly scary. You should definitely watch this movie 10\10.
55,Its more of a first time horror movie for first timer.There are some scars but no gore nothing like that and no one really dies in the movie. Its not a bad movie the creature effects are very good.Worth a rental at best.
56,"I saw ""Come Play"", starring Azhy Robertson-Marriage Story, Beyond the Night; Gillian Jacobs-Community_tv, Hot Tub Time Machine 2; John Gallagher Jr.-10 Cloverfield Lane, Jonah Hex and Eboni Booth-The Punisher_tv, Daredevil_tv.
This is a horror movie that is based on a 2017 short film. It's a little different than the usual monster movies because Larry-the name of the creature-is just looking for a friend. 'Won't you be my neighbor....Ahem, I mean friend?' Azhy is a child with a speaking problem; he doesn't speak. He uses an app on his phone to do his speaking for him. He also uses an iPad, which is where he first comes across Larry. Larry lives in another dimension and uses smart phones and other mobile devices to try to materialize into our world. He uses incredible amounts of electricity while doing so-lights will dim or break when he is near. Gillian and John are Azhy's parents, who don't know how to handle him so they seek out the help of a professional doctor, Eboni. You might wonder how everyone knows anything about Larry. That's because there is a story on the iPad that explains everything you need to know about Larry-it's written much like a children's story, with pictures. Whenever Larry finds a candidate to be his friend, all he has to do is touch hands-like shaking a friends' hand-and they will accompany Larry back to his dimension.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for terror, frightening images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
57,"Interesting premise and I loved the short, but this failed on so many levels for me. There's really nothing original, and the acting is poor (especially the mom) which killed the connection. The teens will love it I'm sure - it has the typical ""scares"" that I probably would have enjoyed at that age. But if you're a horror fan don't go into this with high expectations."
58,"They just really can't make good scary movies anymore. Who thinks this cap is scary, or even good for that matter?
Predictable and boring from the opening credits to the end credits.
Don't even bother wasting your time on this one."
59,"Come Play is based on the 2017 short horror film, Larry(2017). Oliver(Azhy Robertson) discovers a supernatural entity named Larry, that can be seen through smart phones & other electronic devices. Larry has sinister motives.Come Play is a very average movie. Writer-director Jacob Chase just couldn't capture the same edge of the seat feeling that Larry(2017) has, for this feature film adaptation. The jump scares & the supposed 'creepy' scenes, have little to no effect on the viewers. The performances are the only highlight, of an otherwise disappointing movie. Azhy Robertson is spectacular as Oliver. Gillian Jacobs is superb as Sarah. John Gallagher Jr. is great as Marty. Winslow Fegley is outstanding as Byron. The supporting cast is effective. Come Play is not worth a watch. Watch the 2017 short film, instead."
60,"Probably the stupidest ""horror"" movies I've seen. Their idea of ANY kind of ghost appearance is light bulbs going off. 1,5 hours of my life I can't get back."
61,Relies on jump scares and as a hardcore horror fan you see the plot unfold in your head before it happens on screen. I am not a fan. The ending was nice though.
62,"Instead of the themes explored in the Babadook, this one focuses on screen addiction. Otherwise it plays out fairly similar. The writing is kind of weak, but it's overall watchable."
63,"Larry looking for a fd and turn out someone else be Larry fds. I would say the ending is better than many other similar story, simple and make sense. The scary parts very alike others and thats why I'm not scared. The ET looks also little hilarious. But not too bad to watch this."
64,"The movie was decent... I wasn't blown away but it did hold my interests, it explores our modern tech and even put in a lil subliminal message, the actors were good enough so all in all 5/10 for me"
65,The only reason why I say that is cause pg-13 movies have limitations that they have to follow and the options they have are pretty limited for a horror movie and also for this movie half of the cast is children.
66,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hopes are always high this time of year for a creative new horror film. As each Halloween approaches, we search for new movies that will frighten us in an entertaining way, or at least be creepy enough to make us sleep with the lights on! Looking to be this year's horror breakout, writer-director Jacob Chase has expanded his own 2017 5-minute short film LARRY into a full-length feature film.Azhy Robertson (the young son in Noah Baumbach's Oscar nominated MARRIAGE STORY, 2019) stars as Oliver, a dead-ringer for Danny Torrance in THE SHINING (1980). Oliver is an autistic, non-verbal boy who has no friends and depends on his electronic devices to communicate and entertain (he loves ""SpongeBob SquarePants""). His parents, Sarah (Gillian Jacobs, ""Community"") and Marty (John Gallagher Jr, SHORT TERM 12, 2013) constantly argue, which exacerbates Oliver's hyper-sensitivity. When Dad moves out, an overwhelmed mother does her best to follow the advice of Oliver's therapist. What she doesn't know initially is that some being or creature named Larry is tracking her son through an online story called ""Misunderstood Monsters"" that pops up on his mobile devices.""Larry just wants a friend."" As the story slowly unfolds on the tablet Oliver's dad found in the lost & found in the parking lot booth where he works, we come to understand exactly what is happening, and who and what Larry really is. The theme has some similarities to Jennifer Kent's excellent film, THE BABADOOK (2014), with a dose of THE RING (2002), but the suspense never builds to that level despite a nice performance from young Mr. Robertson.A clever twist actually ends up lessening the fright factor here. The monster can (mostly) only be seen via the mobile devices, which means the visuals are often limited by the size of the screen, although I'm a fan of the practical effects. Because of this, sound effects are critical, as are the reactions of Oliver and his parents ... as well as the classmates unfortunate enough to get volunteered for a sleepover.It seems only fitting that in 2020, loneliness is the real monster, and technology is the conduit for its impact. Additionally, all parents will relate to the extremes Sarah and Marty go to protect Oliver, and the final scene does offer an all-knowing moment that reverts to a simpler time ... one that Larry wouldn't appreciate."
67,"Shouldn't be allowed to play at the cinemas. Dull acting, worse production and even worse plot."
68,"Just know that this story is whack, the little boy Oliver is an annoying as hell autistic child, the mother and father are both dinwits and the movie was far from good. 2020 and these so call horror thrillers just constantly insult the viewing audience's intelligence. Only lying trolls are saying this film is good. Don't believe them, this film is ridiculously stupid."
69,"I mean come on ... I've watched a lot of bad movies but this one probably gets the price of the worst movie I've ever seen.
The actors' feelings felt so fake, and the voice of the voices did not suit the situation at all.
And the plot, a failure on a deeper meaning. The message that was to be conveyed felt forced and fake. However, that was a good idea.
Then on to the writing ... another disappointment, hardly anything fit and felt natural.
Finally the end, I won't spoil anything but you will be so disappointed .."
70,I am very desensitised to horror movies. I am obsessed with them. I don't know whether it was because I went in thinking it would be awful or it was actually great but I found myself scared. I jumped a lot. Very effective. I loved it. Not one second was I bored.
71,"It was like kids scary story but not horror as I expected, I liked the concept of the loneliness and the autism spectrum point but I still see it just spooky yet sad ending that broke my heart"
72,"... low level horror!!! AND I love to watch trash. Sorry. But that was - besides the jump scares - really dumb.Should have stuck to roles like in ""Community"" or ""Love"" or her great voice overs for animated stuff as in ""Rick & Morty"", ""Family Guy""...But sorry, as I loved her in so many films, series and movies, but that's a low blow...Sorry, I am German, and I love my punctuation. It let a sentence be read smoothly.Pip-pip!"
73,"I love going to the movies- especially with my son. We both love, love horror movies and have given the genre a lot of latitude when it comes to quality. But this is NOT an even okay movie. I don't expect much going in and I was still disappointed. It was definitely interesting for the first 45 mins and then it was constant eye rolling. The acting was just bad- I would say the best actor in this movie was the monster Larry- Good job Larry. Just don't."
74,"The central idea is not that bad, but the script and the direction sure are. Clichees, clichees, bad dialogs, and jumpscares. I managed to watch it up til halfpoint and that's when my patience ran out."
75,The jump scares weren't even scary. The acting was too bad and the plot is badly written and messy. The directing is mediocre at best since he doesn't build up the tense and his story was quite boring and forgettable.
76,"Based purely on the horror side of things 'Come Play' would've gotten a 4/10 from me. It was another element to the story which I'll take about a bit later that boosted it up to a 5/10 in my books. The horror element was everything I hate about the horror genre. It was safe, supernatural and instantly forgettable - not to mention unoriginal. The PG-13 rating here is barely even scraping it at that. It could've been rated G and no one would've questioned it I suspect. The supernatural side of things in horror annoys me so much when characters keep treating each other like these things could never possibly happen in their world, while they're currently happening. It's so tedious.The element of 'Come Play' that held the most interest for me was actually the autistic child and his interactions with other kids and his parents. That was all handled quite well. If this film had been a straight up drama with these same characters I think I would've enjoyed it a whole lot more. Also kids can often be quite annoying in film and particularity horror movies (see 'The Babadook'), however by having him be a mute it not only added to the complexity of the character and the situation, it also took away his ability to come across as grating to the audience.Sadly though, there wasn't enough focus on that to save the film or even come close. The film relies on unearned jump-scares and a supposedly creepy looking monster (who did nothing for me personally, but each to their own). This was a tedious and slow way to spend 90 minutes of my time. I don't recommend this one."
77,"I tried really hard to get into this movie. It just didn't happen. It started out reminding me of The Babadook movie, but it ended up feeling like a really bad version of it. It just bored me. I don't understand the good reviews."
78,"In 2017 Jacob Chase made a short prequel with same name (Larry)
without much attention to detail, since the film is short, but still available to watch."
79,"Not a bad watch, although it was a little like ""internet BAD, technology BAD"" which made me eye roll a bit. Although that can be quite true in today's society, there was a moment in the movie where it blatantly spelled that out for us which made it a little preachy.. However, I really liked the creature design (and the details were quite good at times! Like the texture of his leg while Oliver and Sarah were under the bed). I also liked that both parents realized the truth somewhat early on, I felt that broke the convention of one (or neither) believing until the very end as most movies do. I appreciated how the loneliness also applied to Sarah, and her struggle in her marriage of feeling like she alone took responsibility for the tough times in raising Oliver. While there are a number of positives, I was surprised to find Gillian Jacobs' performance a bit lacking? There was something about this movie that just lacked a bit of heart. Was it worth watching? Yes! Is it worth a rewatch? Mmmm not so much."
80,"It was not scary as I thought,i mean there were some moments i got excited for nothing,larry was not scary nor clear,acting were not that good,i felt it like more jurrasic park Low budget movie,"
81,"This blends The Badadook, lights out, slender Man, it follows, It is quite ok. The acting is ok, the monster is decent enough in creating a constant fear that nobody is safe."
82,"*There is no end credit scene*The director Jacob Chase and crew brought an enlightening horror film. The story sets when a creature targets a young boy through screen devices. It had a familiar feel like The Babadook (2014) but both of them are completely different particularly in their significance. The jump scares were weak though it did deliver a few creepy moments however not worthy for one to feel terrified. The creature's story was fascinating, but there were so many missed opportunities, it needed extra scenes of having the creature lurking more in the corners with the device in hand. When the plot established itself, suddenly it was rushing to be known which took away the creepiness and the suspense of the creature too early. Even though I did like how the parents handle it, their reactions still needed more feeling of terror.The creature's existence surrounds the theme of loneliness and it doesn't only projects when one is lonely it illuminates how society uses their screen devices more than taking in what is right in front of them. As one has things to do on any screen device, this story sets a reminder to look up and don't miss connecting with others. The movie was more of a heartbreaking story than something to be scared of. I was surprised by how moved I was especially through the theme of being overprotective which can be misunderstood and could break relationships. What an ending, while the film lacked many things, the end was perfect and beautiful in which it got me in tears.The composer Roque Ba√±os sets a good atmosphere, not scary but keeps up with the suspense. When the suspense fades, there is another tune, a soothing beautiful piece of music and it goes well with the heartbreaking moments.The main actors' performances, John Gallagher Jr., Gillian Jacobs, and Azhy Robertson's were good, but they could have been more solid if the story added further depth scenes into the lingering threat. I can't forget Winslow Fegleyand, my gosh this kid was fantastic, I was so impressed and I liked his importance in the storyline."
83,"Terrible movie! I get that there are not a lot of new movies right now so we watched it just to see and holy cow was it bad. Bad acting, bad graphics and just overall bad in every aspect. Could this have made a killer short (10 mins), sure but to draw it out for that long was ridiculous. I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
84,"This was a really fun movie to watch. Had I watched this as a kid I would have been terrified. Took me back to when I saw Child's Play when I was 11. The plot is surprisingly suspenseful. the monster is well designed and was never overused to the point where it isn't scary anymore. I didn't find many clich√©s or characters making stupid choices, which was a pleasant change. This is simply a solid horror movie that is well worth your time.Give this movie a go. You'll have fun watching it. So will your kids if they get their hands on it."
85,It is quite difficult to find good horror/ scary movies these days. This one is entertaining enough but didn't make me jump off my seat once.
86,"Metaphysical horror movie. Although it does not reach the top, it is a small pleasant surprise above average in the genre that has been declining in recent years. It gets in the mood from the beginning and keeps the interest from the beginning to the end. It is relatively mild though and does not touch top movies of the genre. Influenced by many other films, some with a demonic element, others with spirits that invade as something innocent and target children, others where televisions, screens, etc. show a metaphysical element (eg Rings), but also somewhat ET and contact with the child, while combining with a sensitive subject, autistic children and the attacks they may receive from other children. As a whole quite good and complete, it had it all and the emotion in the end, and with a little work in horror and intensity it could become quite strong perhaps. It is, however, recommended to fans of the genre."
87,"Definitely does not deserve the low rating of 5.9.I have wasted so many hundreds of hours watching seriously horrible movies in the last 10 months and very few have made me feel content at the end of it. This movie has good sound effects, good scare scenes and an ending that made me glad to sit down and finish a movie! I would definitely pick this over Stranger things."
88,"Judged the film by the dimwitted IMDB reviews and expected nothing yet watched it out of curiosity and voila, I wasn't disappointed.The film is about an 'autistic?' kid and a story that he reads on his phone/ tab where the character from the story is out to make friends with him.The film has it's scares but they aren't 'jump out of your seat' scares. But they are good. The story is good and I didn't expect the ending. For a moment, I thought this is going 'The Babadook' way but no. This one's totally evil.The mentality of kids during their school years and how parents need to take it is well written. With a bitter-sweet ending, this film is a worth watch."
89,"Movie is great but its exactly the hash slinging slasher.
in the middle of the movie i literally turned to my friend as the lights would flicker on and off i said oh i get it ""its the hash slinging slasher"" what's the second thing? the phone will ring and no one will be there. well the creature uses phone screens and electronic screens to communicate but he is really not there. then what is the third thing? HE GETS YOU!! and that's what happens. great movie go see it and be ready for tons of spongebob."
90,"I watched this with pretty low expectations of just another 'creature' movie. But I was pleasantly surprised.
The story centres around a young non verbal autistic boy called Oliver who communicates via electronic devices, namely an adapted phone that allows him to 'speak', however something is 'living' in his phone and wants to be his friend. It opens an app telling the story of Larry. Pretty much friendless he lives with his bickering parents. After an incident at school, with his former best friend, his phone is lost to him leaving him more isolated than ever.
Oliver's Dad finds and ipad in a lost property box at work, takes it home and the story of Larry reappears. Larry is, according to the story, a 'Misunderstood Monster' who simply wants to be friends with Oliver, but Oliver senses all is not right and he hides the ipad to protect himself.
Thinking that she can help her son to come out of his isolated existence, Oliver's Mother invites his old friend and two other boys to a sleepover, in the hope that they will befriend her son. However when the boys find the ipad that Oliver had hidden Larry decides to make himself known to them.The story is pretty good, the parents are nice people, the kids are lovely and you actually root for them.
There are a few genuinely creepy moments as Larry pops up in different places or skulks around in the background. And there are also a couple of quite touching moments, something which I didn't expect.
It's a good movie, not a groundbreaking horror by any means, but I've seen a hell of a lot worse in the past few lockdown months."
91,"Well, ""Come Play"" from writer and director Jacob Chase wasn't exactly the most scary of horror movies, nor were it overly outstanding. Now, don't get me wrong, because ""Come Play"" is a watchable movie and it certainly was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. I, however, had just hoped for a bit more scary movie.The storyline is pretty straight forward, with the obligatory jump scares throughout the movie, of course. However, while the storyline was bordering on being generic and mundane, it was actually the message of the entire movie, the concept around which Larry took place, that was the most interesting aspect of the movie. And on that part writer Jacob Chase managed to deliver something interesting enough.Visually ""Come Play"" didn't disappoint. The CGI were good and the creature design of Larry was actually quite nice. However, I just wished that we would have been given more prolonged on-screen time with the creature, instead of it being the usual flashes and glimpses that you usually see in horror movies.The cast in the movie was good, and I especially enjoyed the performance of child actor Azhy Robertson - playing Oliver - because his performance was amazing, and he was the main source of carrying the movie for the bigger parts. He really performed quite well in that role.""Come Play"" is an adequate modern horror movie, but it didn't really bring much of anything new to the horror genre.My rating of ""Come Play"" is a six out of ten stars. Yes, I was entertained by what the movie turned out to be. Sure, I had wished for more, but writer and director Jacob Chase managed to churn out something that was adequately entertaining."
92,"This movie was rough to watch, scary, intense, surprisingly moving and super deep!!!! Different kind of horror with a great twist!"
93,"Thought it was gonna be another dumb scary movie but this one really surprised me and was actually very good. It has a good storyline, characters, and ending. Its actually pretty scary too ! I even teared up at the end. Great movie I recommend"
94,"Fun horror movie of 2020, while there are not many good horror movies nowadays I'd kindly recommend this movie to everyone who'd like to watch something new, it's not a 10/10 movie but it's a decent little horror kinda fantasy movie that will keep you entertained."
95,Okay I originally only saw this cause of previews and the fact that let him go which I intended to see was sold out however I must say this is a good classic horror movie like how it used to be when they were actually scary it wasn't perfect but it was extremely close to it the frights are real and present here as is every other horror element I recommend seeing it
96,"This is a fairly typical scary movie with a somewhat interesting premise. There were some choices made for the plot that I really appreciated. It made the movie not as predictable as some of these other horror movies that are churned out.Decent movie if you are looking for something to watch, but do not expect it to be anything that's going to blow you away."
97,I don't know why its rating is 5.8 because it seems like most of the recent reviewers gave around 8-10. It is definitely recommended! One of the best of this year in its genre. Unique content with great character depths.
98,"Wasn't expecting much. I was wrong. This a great little horror/drama... lots of suspense and a great story to boot. Disagree completely with the comment about bad acting from the kids. They were great actors especially the lead boy! I've watched a lot of horrors and yes, this is one of the best so far (this year). I'm not saying it didn't have a few cliche moments, but I think that made me enjoy it more. Would recommend even if you don't like horror."
99,"""Come Play"" is very similar to ""The Babadook"" in the sense that you read a book and the creature will appear. Unfortunately, this film does not live up to the same heart-pounding, edge of your seat watching as ""The Babadook"" gives. Instead of being absolutely terrified of Larry, the creature, we're drawn in to feel sorry for him, and rather than hoping the family doesn't meet an unfortunate end, we're left almost cheering for Larry to get the friend he wants. The meaning behind the story was great. Don't be a bully, everybody needs a friend, and family is incredibly important. However, this movie only tries to scare with the slamming of doors, or other everyday objects, and therefore not the horror movie we deserve on Halloween.Overall, I'm right in the middle for whether to recommend this film or not. If you need to see this film now rather than later. Go on a cheap night. Otherwise, I'd say wait for it to come out on a streaming service. Again, story premise is great, but the execution of actual scares is poor."
