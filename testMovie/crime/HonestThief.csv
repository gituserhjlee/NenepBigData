0,"The action plot is quite ok. The character build up is poor and the reason you hear at the end for Liam being a robber is just lame. Worst of the movie for me were the romantic dialogues. I really like Liam Neeson, but those romantic lines he had to do were just horrible."
1,"As discussed in my One Mann's Movies review of ""Cold Pursuit"", Liam Neeson has had a rather rocky PR road of late. But - unlike Kevin Spacey - he is clearly not being put on the naughty step by Hollywood, since he is filming/announced for five other features at the time of writing. His latest release - ""Honest Thief"" - has Mark Williams directing and co-writing (with Steve Allrich), and sees Neeson back on VERY familiar territory in an exciting and sometimes violent thriller.The nice concept behind the story sees Tom (Liam Neeson) as a hugely successful bank robber meeting the love of his life in Annie (Kate Walsh) and committing to jack it all in for love. Furthermore, not wishing to have to live with the deception and guilt of his hidden life, he determines to hand himself over to the FBI, along with the $9 million stolen cash, in return for a lenient sentence.There's a problem though: he's about the fifteenth person calling the FBI claiming to be the ""In and Out burgler"", so no-one wants to take him seriously. Boston area chief Sam Baker (Robert Patrick - the ""Terminator"" cop!) and his deputy Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) casually put it on the ""to-do"" pile of agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos).The best laid plans run off the rails in a big way though when Nivens and Hall investigate and find that Tom is the real deal.The concept here works nicely for a thriller, but the rest of the script is so formulaic that it's fairly and squarely a 'park your brain in the foyer' movie. For several of the actions and motives going on here, suspension of disbelief was required . Even given the limited competition in 2020, the script is in no way going to trouble the Academy.All that being said, Mark Williams has put together a tight and well-executed movie, not outstaying its welcome at only 99 minutes long. Even with the 15 year age difference, Neeson and Walsh make a believable couple (given that Neeson looks pretty good for his 68 years) and the chemistry between them is great. And for a pretty 'small' movie, the supporting cast is pretty impressive.Another standout for me was the cinematography by Shelly Johnson (whose had a busy year with the latest ""Bill and Ted"" and ""Greyhound"" under his belt). Boston - always a great movie location - looks spectacular, and the framing of the car chase action impressed me.For me, there was only one really dodgy element of the movie: the special effects used in a house explosion/fire. The budget clearly didn't stretch to using practical effects! More work on Adobe ""After Effects"" (or similar) was required here!Is Honest Thief worth seeing? - My expectations for this movie were pretty low. But I'm pleased to say that they were exceeded. Is it a masterpiece? No. Will I readily remember much about it in six month's time? No. But in rather a desert of new releases, this one was at least entertaining and I think it's worth the ticket price for a long overdue night out at the flicks. I'm willing to guess that my feelings were partially influenced by the sheer joy of being back in a cinema again... so I will temper my rating perhaps by a star here.(For the full graphical review, please check out bob-the-movie-man on the web or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"
2,"Worse Liam Neeson Film 2020!
No one ever would do this ever!!! Ever!!! No one knows who you are?!! You've stolen money for over a period of a decade! 9 million to be precise! So You meet some chick and decide to turn yourself in and the money!Mean while no one is even looking for you?! You don't even know if this woman will even accept you after learning who you are & what you've done!
Don't know! Don't Care!..cause I didn't even finish watching this mess!
Stupid plot makes no sense!"
3,"I hated this movie. The characters where poorly written and contained rational logic and emotional logic flaws. The action is realistic when compared to a singke fact that nobody can shoot straight in real life but is not entertaining on screen and ruins a viewing experience. The characters portrayal and stereotypes where also off putting, they where all portrayed as fatalistic desperate losers. The tough guy personas was really odd, I will never make eye contact with those actors, in any private area. The production was great, the score was a little above tolerable but it mismatched the odd script. The movie did not give a homogenous feeling or a unified artistic sense. It seemed as it got dragged through being corporated out sourced, to make a quick dollar with no unified management."
4,There are many ways he could solve this matter. Simply record the audio and handed over to the police when he attacked the partner in police in his home garage. And also he could have given the security footage to Police. but he is going here and there and screw things up.
5,"You always know what you are going to get with a Liam Neeson film...good acting, good action and an hour or two of very watchable entertainment. Nothing less, nothing more. This is no different, but nothing wrong with that either. Look past the cringes, somewhat predictability of a theme done multiple times before and enjoy Liam Neeson doing what he does best (with Kate Walsh delivering a stellar performance as well)."
6,"I thought I'd see some plot twists, none. The movie lacks character development."
7,"Liam Neeson 2020 is no different than 2019, 2015, 2010, or 1995 Liam Neeson.
Don't mess with someone he loves and everything will be fine - if you do, we have yet another fairly generic film to add to his never-ending filmography.
Normally, I might have felt a bit fatigued by another familiar Liam Neeson entry...but we have been going through a pandemic for 7 or 8 months...and to sit in a theatre and watch Liam Neeson growl and get his usual revenge...it felt like the world was back to normal again. And for an hour and forty minutes, I forgot about all my worries.
The rest of the cast works really well. Kate Walsh plays the love interest well - and hold good chemistry with Neeson.
Jeffery Donovan stole the show many times, with his pouty take on the world and forced to partner with his his ex's pet dog - it wasn't a type of character I expected to see in a film like this.
Anthony Ramos and Robert Patrick round out the supporting cast well enough...and then we have Jai Courtney chewing up the bad guy vibes...which felt both entertaining and somewhat comical. His character may be divisive for some.
Over all, not a bad trip back to the movie theatre!"
8,Hell yeah! It has given me a vibe of Taken! Another amazingly crafted action film of Liam! I just love this man!
9,"This could've been much better, had producer-turned-newb writer and director Mark Williams seeked some guidance from seasoned filmmakers. Williams mainly has experience in writing for the <1 hour Ozark series, so trying to fill in a 99 min runtime slot wasn't done effectively with this film. The story was very predictable, with plot and technical issues, and felt dragged out, with not as much action one would expect from a Neeson film. Personally, I would've done much better with the ending (no spoilers), considering it had the perfect setup for the final ""shift in trust with the boxes"", especially when Mr. FBI was alone during all the meet-ups. I also felt Neeson wasn't enthusiastic with his performance and was there for the paycheck. Nevertheless, considering the slim-pickings of blockbuster films, this one was still a refreshing and adequate watch. It's a generous 8/10 from me."
10,"An entertaining thrill ride through and through, Honest Thief may look like a generic action flick at first glance, but surprisingly- due to Neeson's terrific performance and a decent script, this film actually has some heart. I am not a huge Liam Neeson fan, I have absolutely nothing against him, I have just never been one for his type of movies. Thus, I ended up seeing this flick due to lack of options, and surprisingly I was very amused, and very delighted to see how truly good and charismatic Neeson can be on screen. He's, for lack of better words, a total bada** on screen- and I find his performance as well as several others throughout the film, a large driving force in what makes it so good. Kate Walsh also provides a good performance, as well as Jai Courtney, and Jeffrey Donovan. The action scenes are very well choreographed, none of that shaky cam crap that makes me anxious to even think about, and the cinematography in general is very grounded- which is a nice change of pace for this kind of film. The script certainly has some familiar, or even generic elements to it, but once you continue to follow this story, you truly start to feel for the characters and the situations they are involved in. It isn't just well written do its rounded characters, but it is truly made with passion and heart, which I adore in any film, especially in one with such dire circumstances as this one. In the end, Honest Thief is more than an enjoyable way to spend your time at the movies. Go see it if you can, its at least one of the better films out right now, and please support your local theaters. Luckily my showing of the film had quite a few people in it, theaters really need the help, and may soon go extinct without help, and Liam Neeson seems like a good way as any to help save them
My Rating: 8.75/10"
11,I thoroughly enjoyed this action flick! The characters are like-able and the plot is engrossing. Liam Neeson is awesome as usual. Lots of fun!
12,"A professional thief (Liam Neeson) decides to turn over a new leaf, when he falls in love with a woman (Kate Walsh), but feeling he won't be able to live with himself for what he has done while trying to live a good life, so he decides to turn himself in and turn over the money to the F.B.I., in hopes of getting a reduced sentence. But things don't go has planned when an agent (Jai Courtney) gets greedy, deciding to keep the money for himself, and frame him for murder, now he must get the agent and clear his name before it's too late.Liam Neeson is pretty in the role of a thief trying to turn over a new leaf, and showing he is flawed but not a bad guy, Kate Walsh is also good here, she and Neeson have great chemistry, making it quite convincing that are in love. Jai Courtney is quite good here, giving a real menacing performance. Jeffrey Donovan and Robert Patrick are also good. Some action scenes are pretty good, keep you interested until the thrilling end."
13,"As soon as I learned that my city would be locked down again and that arenas, bars, museums, restaurants, theatres and similar places would close for several weeks, I went to the cinema to enjoy watching some new movies for the last time in quite a while. The first film I gave a try was Honest Thief and I certainly don't regret my choice. This emotional, pacey and suspenseful drama stars excellent actors like Jai Courtney, Jeffrey Donovan and obviously Liam Neeson. The story revolves around a thief who wants to come clean and give back all the money he has stolen to serve a reduced prison sentence and then marry the woman of his dreams. He calls the Federal Bureau of Investigation that sends two rookies who are doubtful at first. When the thief shows them a third of the money, one of the investigators sees this opportunity as a chance to get rich and convinces his nervous partner to follow his plan through. Just as they are about to murder the honest thief and make the money disappear, their superior shows up and gets shot in an escalating confrontation. The thief knocks out the two investigators and manages to flee with his girlfriend. The two investigators predictably accuse the thief of murdering their superior and the fugitive now needs to clear his name while protecting his girlfriend.This movie convinces on numerous levels. The action scenes are short but intense and focus on realistic settings rather than artificial special effects. The story is suspenseful from start to finish. The film has some strong dramatic elements due to the convincing love story. The characters are intriguing with a remorseful thief, a ruthless investigator and his nervous partner and a reliable veteran agent looking for the truth. The movie also includes a few funny scenes such as every moment involving the veteran agent's dog and the memorable car bomb scene.On the negative side, Liam Neeson seems to be typecast for emotional action films and isn't given the occasion to unfold his full potential in this film. The story is predictable and by the numbers and therefore not really memorable.However, the film is produced with care, energy and professionalism that make you forget about the minor flaws as it offers one hour and a half of gripping entertainment. Fans of action films, dramas and even thrillers should enjoy this film alike. Anyone who appreciates Liam Neeson should also admire this movie even though it can't compete with his career highlights such as Cold Pursuit, Schindler's List or Taken. The fact that the veteran actor manages to play an action film so credibly despite being sixty-eight years old certainly deserves attention, recognition and respect as well. Even though Liam Neeson has been typecast for more than a decade now, that isn't a problem as long as the final products remain as convincing as Honest Thief. Enjoy this movie at your local cinema while you still can and support local businesses while doing so."
14,Honest thief movie looking for action and thriller movie.Laim neeson is good actor i hope so that movie will break the previous record.Trailer of this movie full of suspence.
15,"HONEST THIEF is actually a terrific thriller, Liam Neeson's best one since the original TAKEN. He and the rest of the cast are all great in it. Fans of Jeffrey Donovan from BURN NOTICE and Robert Patrick from TERMINATOR 2 and SCORPION, will love seeing them here. Loved the chemistry between Neeson and Kate Walsh. Walsh didn't just play the girlfriend. Her character is the reason that Neeson's bank robber decides to turn himself in to the FBI. The ways that the script had of her character and the other characters interacting with Neeson's character were very satisfying. Writer/Director Mark Williams pares his film down to a sleek 92 minutes or so (not counting the final credits). This was a wise choice. Not a moment in the story is wasted."
16,"With movie fans suffering from cinema withdrawal and dying to see anything half decent it's good to have a solid action movie in the cinemas again.The film is not exactly original but it is good and Liam Neeson plays the part of a man on a revenge mission so well.Good action, good story and fine acting. A fine popcorn action flick that will give you a good night out in these crazy times."
17,I really enjoyed the movie it reminded me so much of taken 3 in a different type of look has the potential to grow. I liked his character and I don't get all the bad reviews I honestly prefer this one a lot better than 2019 Cold pursuit where the movie ends in less than 20 minutes in.
18,"This is very much a straightforward movie, which seems to belong to an earlier, simpler, age. It moves along at a brisk pace, and keeps the viewers attention. My only grumble is that I would have liked another twenty minutes of story so as to give us some more character development, and perhaps making the ending a little less obvious."
19,"Awesome, it kept me on the edge of my seat. Liam Neeson makes the films so good, people just hating on him because social media tells them, or simply because they can't think for themselves so they go along with the flow.
People also just hating because of the casting, which got nothing to do with anything.
Imagine if it were tom holland and robert downey jr? Would you all praise it? Probably would since all people do is judge films based on the casting over anything else lol.Not a way to judge/rate movies lol."
20,Liam Neeson chooses his scripts wisely and this film is no exception. The storyline is new and unique with many twists that will keep you entertained and involved constantly.
21,Honest Thief wants to be like Taken 3 but wants to also be a Bridget Jones-like romantic story all written by a 3 year old
22,"There was nothing to watch so I was forced to watch this movie. Thought it would be decent with Jai Courtney and Liam Neeson but it isn't. It's an extremely cheap, boring, predictable movie. You can't relate to any of the characters and the antagonists just act in such a irrational way. It just feels like a movie made by high schoolers who have just enough money to produce a feature length film."
23,"I really liked the movie. It's really interesting, exciting and it made me cry."
24,"A great ride, despite knowing the premise, and of course, the eventual outcome."
25,I enjoyed the movie Liam Neeson was not disappointing lots of action and never a dull moment!!! cant imagine any negative reviews on this box office winner l see why it was rated no 1 two weeks in a row.
26,"Worlds dumbest FBI agents and worlds dumbest thief are trying to outdumb themselves All other things aside - an FBI agent has been killed and no one is investigating? Or should I say the guy, who's allegedly investigating, is just walking around with his dog and feeding it cookies? I really want to describe all the things that are wrong with this movie, but this one doesn't even deserve it. It's just sad. People rating this abomination with 8+ stars is why we can't have nice things."
27,"A refreshing twist , a thief who calls up to get arrested like calling for room service and winds up arresting the cops who were supposed to arrest him ..superb movie"
28,"So, the world's dumbest bank robber, Tom decides one day that to impress a woman he wants to start a new life with, he's going to confess to the FBI and use his money as leverage to work out a deal. He feels guilty about stealing from banks even though it's revealed he did it to seek revenge against a CEO who ripped off his dad's pension. So by confessing, he's essentially giving that evil CEO back his money? Wut? Ok, I know he's just giving it back to the Feds, but still...The Feds don't believe Tom and finally decide to send agents after a few days. They actually think he's insane and search through his storage locker, digging through trash and almost missing the loot until Agent Hall finally finds it in a random box. Agent Nivens gets the bright idea to steal the money, even though they're on record just about everywhere dealing with this guy, on camera everywhere. Clearly the FBI only hires millennials who haven't walked into Best Buy in the last twenty years. Just ludicrous.Clearly now, they were setting everything up for a plot twist with Jeffrey Donovan's character as the newly divorced agent who lost almost everything in the divorce. I'm sure we all kept waiting for the big reveal. Maybe it was supposed to happen in the parking lot at the end when he just lets Tom go for everything. For whatever reason, they resisted the urge to do that, which is refreshing, yet, since this obviously isn't an Oscar award winning drama, they might as well have done that for some excitement. Shame.I actually enjoyed this. I probably won't watch it again, but...it's original! It could have been done better. The potential is there. That's the one upside of the pandemic, big blockbuster films are being delayed and B-movie films like this that are somewhat original are getting a chance. I like it."
29,"With Corona, times are hard for movie lovers, especially those who like to visit the cinemas. With honest thief on the playlist I thought to get to see a movie that easily would be better than the average garbage cinemas have to offer in the last few months.
What a turn-off was honest thief. The script was awful, I have noticed so many plot holes and unlikely situations that the writers probably think that viewers don't care for a solid script. The movies that last have something special and give you a reason to overthink the movie afterwards. Not honest thief....
Liam Neeson is always solid and has made quite a few very good movies. This isn't one of them. Agent Niven wants to kill his girlfriend in the hospital but his boss is sitting at her bed? Right.... they didn't see or hear each other? Our honest thief is probably the most wanted man in the city after the murder of an FBI agent. But he can easily drive, phone and walk throughout town. And when there is a car chase or narrow situation he easily escapes and stays in a motel whit out a problem. When he escapes in the beginning he and his girlfriend hide in a car in a parking garage. Of all places in the big city the cops decide to look there, right.... after his house is blown up, agent Niven returns there a little bit later. Just some windows are being blown out but there is no fire damage. That is actually possible because the cgi used in the scene when th house is being blown up is so bad, we just had to laugh.
And the end....... dead cops, car chases through the city, a house blown up and more......, but no further investigation. Liam can life happily ever after with his girlfriend. She is obviously a strong woman. First she was pronounced dead by the agent, then she was alive but needed emergency treatment in the hospital, then she could easily be taken from the hospital and live saving monitory. And within hours she was was fine, up and running!
Go see it, but turn your brain off......"
30,"I saw this movie in the cinema just before we entered another lockdown. I had low expectations and was really surprised that this was actually a fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable movie. The villain is incredibly hatable, liam neeson is always reliable. Great action and unusual storyline. Highly recommended."
31,Best movie Liam has done in a decade. Love they made it PG13. Great simple story well told. Highly recommend!
32,"An action movie, with some slowness. It looks like you're watching any Liam movie. However, one can take advantage of the afternoon to have fun at the cinema, without waiting of course for a work of art."
33,"Another action movie where he uses guns to do business, too bad the hypocrite does not live up to his views and stop using guns in his movies.Otherwise it's more of the same from him, betrayed and seeking revenge."
34,"The director seems to have experience with drama's and now is attempting to crossover into action movies. Unfortunately for him he's brought all of the emotional baggage that a teen drama can handle and has yet to learn what drives a movie like Taken and other Liam Neeson films.That missing element is tension. Nothing of the sort here, so the plot just kinda piddles along from one scene to the next until it reaches a predictable ending you can forecast from the opening credits."
35,"I know Liam Neeson has done this sort of movie a hundred times by this point. But this still looked like it could of have been good. Turns out it's not.Almost everyone involved here looks like they can't be bothered. Theres not enough action for an action movie, the script is often laughable, and just none of it is convincing. Neeson has several ""emotional"" scenes where it feels like he is just going through the motions just to get his pay cheque.Maybe I've just been spoiled by rewatching too many classics during this current crisis, but I really thought this one was a stinker. And I really want to be encouraging people back into watching the latest."
36,"Tom (Liam Neeson) is a long-time bank robber eager to put his past behind him in the new film ""Honest Thief"". A circumstance forced Tom to decide to strike back at the establishment following a career in ordinance in the military and has found he has a real talent for blowing safes and making away with millions of dollars over several years.The Feds have been unable to stop him and regularly field numerous calls from people claiming to be responsible in order to gain attention. So when Tom calls Agent Sam Baker (Robert Patrick) and his partner Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan); his claims are met with skepticism.Tom has fallen in love with an aspiring Psychologist he met while renting a storage facility and he is eager to start a new and honest life with Annie (Kate Walsh). Tom offers to return all nine million dollars that he has stolen in term for a light sentence at a minimum security locale near Boston so Annie can visit him frequently.Unwilling to accept that Tom is who he says he is, the agents dispatch Agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Agent Hall (Anthony Ramos); to interview Tom and check out his story. Tom offers to tell them where the money is in order to prove his claims. When several boxes of cash are discovered in storage; Nivens decides to take the money and pressures Hall into going along with it despite his reservations.Nivens them attempts to eliminate Tom but in doing so kills Agent Baker who has shown up unexpectedly. Tom is now framed for a murder he did not commit and forced to flee in order to try to clear his name and make good on his initial offer to turn himself in.Nivens is not willing to stop there and escalates his level of corruption and danger including threats on Hall and his family to ensure his compliance and silence.As anyone who has ever seen a Liam Neeson film in the last ten years or so can deduce his character is motivated by events that follows and with his expert knowledge of explosives looks to strike back at Nivens and ensure justice is served.While the film may be a bit slower paced in some areas than fans of Neeson may expect; he turns in a satisfying performance as a sort of modern day Robin Hood.Tom is a man who does not make excuses for his actions and is willing to pay the price for them but believes he was justified in what he did and the reasons behind them.The supporting cast is solid and while the film does have some real gaps in logic which must be suspended to make the story work; it does entertain.In the end ""Honest Thief"" provides enough enjoyment to make it worth your time and shows that Neeson still can deliver what fans have come to expect from him.3.5 stars out of 5"
37,The dialogue was horrible and i couldnt handle how cliched it was
38,"Honest Thief
2020
15
Director: Mark Williams
Starring: Liam Neeson, Kate Walsh, Jai Courtney, Jeffrey Donovan, Anthony Ramos,Overall rating 87/100Honest thief is about a former bank robber called Tom (Liam Neeson) who turns himself in to the FBI only for two agents to go rougue and target him for crimes he didn't commit, I really enjoyed and I was entertained from start to finish so let's get started.First of all, the movie had likeable characters, great performances, a charming tone and an interesting concept. The movie had a whole range of likeable easy to connect with characters which was great, they managed to balance the obvious criminal past of the main character but also humanise him and make you connect and understand him which was excellent. The performances were also good, the performances from the villains were slightly campy but they made it work, but Liam Neeson and Kate Walsh were great, they both had instant charm on screen and had good on screen chemistry with each other, the movie also had a very charming tone, the movie despite having it's fun generic action movie moments always at least to me served purpose and the more grounded approach to the character relationships was really charming for me and not usually done with this kind of attention in other movies like this, due to this the whole concept was very interesting especially with the main character and his motivations and actions.My next few positives would be the action, humour and cinematography. The movie had very good and tense action sequences that worked really well in terms of keeping you on the edge of your seat and me genuinely not knowing who was going to make it out alive, the action wasn't constant or overused which for this kind of movie it kept the balance of the heart of the characters but also keeping you entertained, the movie was also surprisingly funny in places. The movie had a lot of running gags that actually worked which is very rare for this kind of movie, but the humour actually added to the story and made it more fun and entertaining to watch instead of bringing the movie down like it does in a lot of action movies similar to this. The movie also had great cinematography and set pieces, the big city landscape was an effective set piece for the scope of the movie as well as the different action sequences and was well explored for a visually pleasing movie as well, with clever shots and great uses of editing.My only few negatives for the movie would be the generic script, how predictable the movie was and it's old fashioned role for the female character. The script was very generic in terms of very similar dialogue to previous action movies like this and there was a lot of corny lines and recycled formulas that bought the movie down just slightly, the movie was also fairly predictable, you could tell what was going to happen most of the time before it happened, despite it still being fun to watch it would have been nice to be more surprised instead of deliberately setting up a characters actions and expecting people to forget about it until it's revealed. I also found that the role for the female character in here was very old fashioned, she was only really a plot device and a character motivation for Liam Neesons character, she never felt like her own character and for me this was very old fashioned and a backwards way of thinking for female roles.My final few positives would be the villains, character depth and ending. I thought they did a very good job with the villains, they actually felt like threats to the characters and their actions made you despise them even more Jai Courtney despite a slightly campy and over the top performance did a good job and I like that they contrasted with Anthony Ramose's character. There was also a good amount of character depth to the main character, I liked how in depth the movie went into explaining the reasoning behind the main character actions, learning why he did the things he did made you connect to his character more and understand why he did the things he did. I also thought the ending was great, the character arcs were satisfying and I loved that we always knew that the main character was going to jail and that wasn't going to change which was more realistic and more of a satisfying ending for the character.Overall despite needing better roles for women and being slightly formulaic, Honest Thief is an entertaining movie from start to finish with a surprising amount of heart and characters to connect with rarely seen in a movie like this."
39,"Not sure what the ones who gave a bad rating were expecting. Perhaps an Academy award winning movie?
If they had half a brain, they would realise it's an action movie which is what Liam Neeson does best. Yes there are some flaws but which movie doesn't have them?
If you liked the Taken movies, you will love this because I sure did."
40,"We all know what to expect from a Liam Neeson movie and this is one of them.
He's a ex-military with special skills and someone he loves is in danger of being hurt and he will go to fight the and guys to protect the loved one. Is predictable but enjoyable. He doesn't look as though in this one as previous movies. Easy watching for a mid week movie night."
41,"Liam Neeson is a great actor, nobody would argue with that...but I think his days of starring in action films is over. He really shows his age in this movie with his body language and posture. I also notice some clever editing where shots are cut to show him just landing on the ground to give the impression that he just 'climbed a 10ft fence'. It reminds me of the day I watched 'Skiptrace' and realised that Jackie Chan's action days were over too.Even though it was nice to see a new Liam Neeson film that wasn't just a copy and paste of 'Taken', this film was very underwhelming. Nothing new, or original. Overused storyline of 'man tries to clear his name/crooked cops'.Acting was good though.One thing I didn't understand was what kind of neighbourhoods don't bat an eyelid when a bomb goes off in one house...and there's a 2 minute gunfight in another? Absolutely NOBODY came out, or even looked outside to see what all the noise was. Bear in mind, these are nice neighbourhoods...the kind of neighbourhoods that would call the cops if a 'strange' man was spotted simply walking down the road. Surely an explosion and a gunfight would draw attention.Summary - underwhelming, but certainly watchable."
42,"We've seen this same movie about six times not from Liam, and this one is one of the weakest. Good acting, fine pace but just not enough of a story to get excited about. Might have been better if there were more about his bank robberies and maybe a connection to the good FBI agent from the beginning instead of just a cold phone call turning himself in. Not horrible , just average."
43,Liam's movies are always good fun and this was as well. The movie had plenty of action and twists which kept me interested for the entire 2 hours.
44,"Just come back from a screening of this & to be fair it was a good film, interesting story-line & enough action to keep you interested.The film follows a man named Tom Carter who after robbing banks for years decides he wants to turn himself after meeting the love of his life one day at a storage center. Not wanting to live a life with a guilty conscience with his fiance he calls the police & says he'll return the 9 Million Dollars in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. However 2 corrupt police officers are assigned to the case & steal the money from the storage & frame Tom for the murder of another agent they killed themselves. Tom goes on the run while trying to find a way to clear his name & make sure the money doesn't end up in the wrong hands.I found the film to be pretty good, not amazing but pretty good. The story & film moves at a fast pace & there's a couple of fight scenes, car chases & shoot outs. However I felt the film could've more beefed up & had a little more too it, that's my only critiques of this flick. That & the characters could've had more depth to them as their backgrounds etc felt thin to non existent.Overall it's a decent action film. 8/10"
45,"Decent film better than I expected can't beat Neeson on a warpath, good interesting plot to follow as well- when the 6 mill showed up kind of wanted the higher FBI agent to do the same as the other 2 cops- reyt good film"
46,Everyone & everything in this movie was half-arsed ad made no sense at all. The only suspense is seeing characters make the dumbest possible decision every single time.
47,"Honest Thief is a new action thriller directed, written and produced in part by Mark Williams, the director of A Family Man.In the film, bank robber Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) wants to end his crime career. He does this because he has encountered Annie (Kate Walsh) the love of his life. He doesn't want to risk his relationship with her with lies and dangers from his criminal life. Because of this, he turns himself in to the FBI and promises to return the stolen nine million in exchange for a lesser sentence. Unfortunately for Tom, two corrupt cops are put on his case. They try to cheat Tom and run off with all the stolen money themselves. For example, Tom himself must ensure that the money ends up in the right hands and he must clear his name.The fact that director Mark Williams and his co-script writer Steve Allrich are on the starting side of their film career is reflected in the simple and sometimes somewhat stupid far-fetched actions in their film. Thus the film quickly becomes predictable and somewhat unbelievable. If they had written some events in their film a bit smarter and worked it out better, the film could have been a lot better. There are a few entertaining action scenes in the movie, but these scenes lack real tension.Thanks to the simple script, the cast of the movie doesn't really have much to work with either. Liam Neeson puts the best acting as the lead, because his character is also the most fleshed out in the film. The other characters are not really worked out in the film, so you as a viewer care less about them. Sometimes some of their storylines also end a little messy."
48,First other than Liam no one could act. The director cared more about the filming that he took away from the action. In short when you think of liam neeson in Taken and then see him in this youll see what i mean. Please Mark go back to dramas.Stay out of action films
49,". . . the Deep State (aka, the Shadow Government) has been choking our USA Homeland to death, and the Frenzied Billionaire Inquisitors (that is, the FBI) have been at the forefront of this massive Witch Hunt. HONEST THIEF tells the inspiring story of U.S. Marine Hero Tom Carter, who was never foolish enough to let himself be taken alive during his overseas deployments. When Tom is rotated back to the Home Front, two typical FBI crooks--John and Mario--hatch a scheme to filch Tom's profits from his decade as an independent bank examiner. John is so amoral that he even murders his FBI boss and his FBI partner during his crazed crusade to steal Tom's stuff. But Tom stands Boston Strong, behaving like a steadfast, stalwart Core Supporter of the Loyal Base while blowing the whistle upon John's deadly shenanigans. HOORAH!"
50,The action of honest thief is pretty nice. I really liked the scene when tom was counting to blow up the house of nivens. The end of honest thief was a expected happy end.
51,"Well, what to say about this one. Liam Neeson normally putts down a strong caracter with a heart, like for his daughter in Taken. But in this movie we see his behaviour on steroids in the wrong way. Love, caring and understanding was all over the place, taking the movie to a stop more than once. I know this is a big issue for the movie plot, but we understood this at the first scene, so be done with it. ;-)Also some plotholes where things all happen within the same 5 minutes and people end up in a specific situation, like the hotel room mixup at the beginning and the camera images retrieval which would normally take a few minutes to complete. And also the scene with the police car at the junction, he should have known better to stop in front of the red light.Agent Nivens seem to get from a rookie to a kind of corrupt agent within a matter of minutes. And why would the partner of agent Nivens putt himself into danger at the end. He could have turned himself in, testifying to his partner and all would be done. In both versions he would have received a penalty, but he surely made the wrong choice there.All in total not a bad movie during these harsh movie times, but a little more action and way less romance in your next movie please Mr. Neeson. Thx!"
52,"I saw ""Honest Thief"", starring Liam Neeson-Mem In Black:International, Batman Begins; Kate Walsh-The Umbrella Academy_tv, Girls Trip; Jai Courtney-Suicide Squad, A Good Day to Die Hard and Jeffrey Donovan-Sicario:Day of the Soldado, Burn Notice_tv.
This is a Liam Neeson action movie that is not quite as good as the Taken movies but it will do in a pinch-given the cinematic choices we have at the moment. Liam plays a former Marine turned experienced bank robber-he has never been caught-that has acquired $9 million and the nick name, 'The In_And_Out_Bandit'. But for some reason, he is just not happy-I think I would find a way to make myself happy for $9 million. That is, until he meets Kate. Liam decides that it is time to make a clean slate of his life and calls the FBI to make a deal for a reduced sentence in exchange for returning the money-he hasn't spent a penny of it. He just wants to settle down with Kate and forget about his past. Jeffrey & Jai are 2 of the FBI agents involved in the money return and one of them decides to double cross Liam and just take the money. And, as you know, Liam does not like it when you take something from him.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
53,"I like Liam Neeson but I wasn't excited for Honest Thief. Oddly enough Honest Thief was released here in Canada last week but the Americans had to wait an extra week. I seen the film today since I had another free pass. Honest Thief was okay as expected.The acting was good including Jai Courtney whom plays the villain. Neeson was good but some people may feel he phoned it in. The characterization was fine, you know enough to be invested.The plot is generic, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There's nothing surprising or clever. It's like the writers are rookies. The film is briskly paced, it's not slow like the Ryan Gosling movie Drive although it's better.Keep in mind Honest Thief isn't a straight up action movie like the Taken movies. The action scenes are fine, they're not boring. They were shot and edited normally. The director is a rookie for action so he could improve.Honest Thief was okay, it's another generic thriller. It's one of those movies you watch only once or twice. If you like Liam Neeson, see it."
54,"In a strange departure for Liam Neeson of recent, he finds himself apologetic for his kleptomania. Through out the movie, he continues to discover objects that do not belong to him, and he spends the entire movie attempting to return them to their rightful owners.
Neeson comic timing is phenomenal, with an almost vaudevillian feel to it. With twists and turns throughout, comedy truly ensuesreally enjoyed it, a fun filled family movie."
55,Good story and I really enjoyed movie with Nachos and salsa . I didn't even feel bored and beyond my expectationsWorth watching ...
56,"As always Liam Neeson does amazing. All the performances, characters, and character interactions are fantastic. The problem with the movie lies in the plot. We don't get a ""consistent"" plot until about half way through the movie. Once this plot is introduced it is not developed at all. It is a very weak and boring plot that does not have an opportunity to thicken which is very important, giving this movie a 6 as opposed to a 7 or 8."
57,"Liam Neeson plays his typical role of former military/law/operative/combat veteran in the way of a former marine that eventually turned to robbing banks. Thanks to his explosive training in the Marines, he was able to get in and out of banks to blow the vault and steal money. Over the course of nearly a decade he was able to steal 9 million dollars.In the beginning of the movie he runs into a woman who owns a storage unit business and ends up falling in love with her. He loves her so much he turns away from robbing banks and wants to wipe his slate clean and turn himself into the police, return the money, but on his terms and his agreement of a reduced sentence, minimum security, and special visitations within an hour of where he is.The FBI sends a couple agents named Nivens and Hall to speak with Neeson's character Tom to see if he is telling the truth. They do not suspect he is the real ""In and Out Bandit"" (which Tom hates the name by the way) because there is always people calling in claiming to be the bandit. Once they get to the hotel Tom is staying in they talk with him and he tells them a story only the real bandit would now. The agents still don't believe him and Tom offers to take them to where the money is housed. The storage units owned by Tom's love interest Annie. The agents tell him to stay put and they would look and be back. This then turns to the agents going to the storage unit and find boxes upon boxes of money. Hall wants to turn in the money and do his job. Nivens wants to take the money and write Tom off as another ""In and Out Bandit"" imposter and split the money with Hall. Nivens feeds on the fact that Hall is a family man with a wife and kids and tells him how much that money could help him and his family. Hall eventually goes along with it and they go back to the hotel to kill Tom so they can escape with the money.Without giving away too much, this turns into a cat and mouse chase between Tom and the agents. The agents, led by Nivens plans, tries their best to get Tom off their trail and kill him but Tom, being a former marine and explosive expert, is smarter and tougher than they think. They find out their theft of his money doesn't go anything like they planned. You don't steal from a man who wants to be an Honest Thief and start over life with the woman he loves."
58,Of couse it s not masterpiece but it s definitely watchable!
59,"I'm super hyped to talk about this movie. I just got out of the theatre, and this is one of those movies that I think will be reverberating through my mind for a little while. It's not profoundly poetic or anything like that, nor is it anything like a mindless Liam Neeson action flick with a big conspiracy and a big reveal that doesn't do much for the plot or the audience. I'll admit, I only went to see this cuz Liam is my boy and I wanted to go see a movie in theatres and there was nothing else that interested me. I've been on a sci fi kick lately, and I was not really feeling this movie before I went. But from the first scene, my fears of the needlessly overcomplicated conspiracy and cheapness of Liam Neeson's other movies (which I love about them, I just wasn't feeling them today) slowly disappeared as the film went on. There is no mystery here; you're with every character the entire way through. It's so awesome to see them each in their own little zone and hear their backstories that are sprinkled throughout the movie, and we also get to see them grow and change. It's all so subtle, and it's a shame that people probably won't give this movie the time of day. Great characters, compelling motives, awesome performances, and gnarly action make for one dynamite movie!!!!"
60,"Obviously the subject line means as I'm writing this as the movie is currently in theaters during this awful pandemic. So many awful movies out right now due to the anticipated ones being pushed out to 2021, but this one was good & worth the watch!Not super realistic, but it's more about the entertainment of action and good vs bad guy that makes it unique and fun to watch.Great acting of courseI admit I'm used to seeing Liam Neeson with these gentle, tender hearted cheesy ladies who typically play his girlfriend or wife. So, seeing him with Kate Welsh was awesome. I naturally thought they didn't have chemistry because of his past actress counterparts, but I truly enjoyed seeming him with someone who wasn't so dolled up, speaks her mind and is more realistic. Loved seeing her in here.Why is Jai Courtney such a good bad guy???One thing to change is I wish there was more of a climax to the climax. It did seem like it was a great build and decent climax, but I'm used to seeing much more these days. Great action throughout. Just wish I could have seen the bad guy really really really get what was coming to him."
61,Such a great film with Liam once again. I enjoyed it
62,"The ONLY reason this movie is getting 7,8 or 9 star reviews from people stems from the fact it's the ONLY action movie out in theatre's right now because of this Zombie Apocalypse.
Otherwise this would be a straight to video flick.
The plot and story line to this movie is brutal.
So many plot holes.
Who tries to turn themselves in to the law with $9 million WITHOUT A LAWYER to make a deal LOL...This is another 'Taken' suffering from dementia....
Wait for the video"
63,"Very entertaining action moving which keeps you interested througout its entire runtime. Neeson plays the role he plays best. Strong acting overall, especially the blonde cop who genuinly scared me a little. Too bad it was a bit short, but simple fun to just put on and watch."
64,"I liked it. It's an unpretentious action-thriller, nothing more, but it's perfectly fine entertainment for a rainy afternoon. Maybe it starts up a bit slow, and in between the action-scenes there may be a bit too much talking, especially of the saccharine sweet kind between the honest thief (Liam Neeson) and his love-interest (Kate Walsh). And maybe the premise of a noteworthy and uncatchable bank-robber who doesn't use one single dollar of the 9 millions that he so far has laid his hands on is a bit far-fetched and unrealistic. As is his motivation for robbing banks anyway, which almost makes him look angelic. But it at least does make for an original story and when the action kicks in, with lots of car-chasing and explosions, it's pretty exciting.Liam Neeson does his usual fine job, and they've adjusted the physical exertions of the fighting-scenes to his age (meanwhile over 65), so it stays believable. I only became a bit weary of his raspy grunting voice, I kept wondering if he deliberately creates this for the supposed effect or if there's something wrong in his throat. Kate Walsh's part is small, she mainly has to act sweet and loving, or wise, amazed or understanding, according to the specific scenes, which she does adequately."
65,"Liam Neeson movies tend to follow a consistent formula for story/style. This movie was that with a lazy plot, no climax and an ending which sort of just happened. The acting was convincing enough to make the movie worth watching, but the story was not enough for me. I guess this is expectable but still disappointing."
66,"Makes love going to the Cinemas again.
The plot isn't new, but the execution great.
Worth every penny."
67,What a badly written full of holes movie. Is hollyweird that desperate for scripts don't waste your money or time on this one.
68,"When I watch a Liam's Neeson movie I know what to expect. Unfortunately on this one the script is pretty bland and unbelievable. Are you trying to sell Liam's as a Robin Hood in 2020?... C'mon. Embarrassed by the dialogues several times.
On the other hand action is Ok and acting too.
So, overall just an OK thriller. No substance and forgettable easily."
69,Very enjoyable well worth watching .Solid all round. Liam is cool as usual Love these Irish boys
70,Beautiful act from Liam Neeson. He played once again in the movie that he should always cast.
71,Also unbelievable among other details the easiness with which anyone could enter a hospital and go close to a patient's bed wjthout seeing anyone to ask permission for it. But the story is psychologically moving. A bank robber who had robbed more than a dozen banks in small towns without being ever caught or identified falls in love with a woman he eventually met and turned out to be the his life's love who corresponded fully to his love. He decides then to abandon his illegal behaviour and proposes to the police to give back all thr robbed mony which means several millions of dollars against a deal leading to a no more than a penalty of two prison years. It happened however that he was double crossed by two corrupt police agents who wanted to keep the money for themselves. All the rest of the movie shows the scenes of this plot and the attempts of the ex-robber (Liam Neeson) to fight these corrupt agents and lead a happy love relationship with the woman he loved which he manages in succeding in the end after a lot of intricated episodes good to follow and much entertaining.
72,A Liam-Neeson-plays-Liam-Neeson movie though not as bad as a Nicolas-Cage-plays-Nicolas-Cage movie (not that could be considered possible).
73,"Honest Thief (2020) has a few redeeming qualities, but numerous flaws, some of which are merely distracting, while others are fundamental and compounded by other flaws.On the positive side, Liam Neeson seems incapable of delivering a poor performance. Robert Patrick is credible in a minor role and Jeffrey Donovan brings dimension to a role that is underdeveloped in the script. The ""la vengeance est un met que l'on doit manger froid"" twist is well conceived, although indifferently executed.The script is egregious, to put it mildly. The basic concept lacks appeal: A master thief falls in love and decides to come clean and return his ill-gotten lucre, but things go sideways. We all need banks and recognize their importance, but people don't like banks. Bonnie and Clyde, and John Dillinger were celebrated folk heroes. We applaud when the Joker burns pallets of cash stolen from banks. Action movie fans don't want Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) to give the money back or to be incarcerated for committing perfect crimes. It might be better if he were to repay his debt to society in some creative way of his own design or use the money to expose unethical bank practices; but it's not dramatically satisfying to watch a heroic figure declare himself a scoundrel. Beyond that, the film needs an inciting incident. We need to see that Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) is a transformative force in Tom's life, and somebody worth the consequences. And we need to see something happen that convinces Tom that honesty is essential in the relationship he envisions with Annie. Instead, we see him brooding in an empty hotel room and making a life-changing decision without consulting Annie.Liam Neeson brings stature and gravitas to every role, from Love, Actually to Ted 2, to the Taken franchise. But most of the characters in Honest Thief, Tom included, struggle to seem even two-dimensional. Annie needs to be somebody truly extraordinary. We're told repeatedly that she is, but we don't see her doing volunteer work at a pediatric oncology ward, or pursuing an intriguing hobby, like restoring antique clocks. She doesn't teach Tom a strategy in Go that he realizes could be used to defeat his current adversaries, or engage in profound discussions. She looks and behaves like a soccer mom. She smiles a lot, recovers from injuries quickly, and is unwaveringly supportive, but she's no Bond girl. Her waist seems fuller than an average girl's bustline. Corrupt cop Nivens (Jai Courtney) seems more doofus than amoral corrupt cop. Compared with Michael Shannon's performance in Premium Rush (2012), the character is a pussycat, albeit
remorseless.The often perfunctory settings give the film a direct-to-video feel. The FBI offices don't seem real. A stock image of a safe with a rectangular door leaves the viewer wondering how the bank managed to get insurance. Police procedures are risible. Characters are given idiosyncrasies but obscure motivations and flat arcs.The creative freedom can result in brilliant works that would never survive the compromises of a committee, as with Citizen Kane, Blazing Saddles, and Inception. But in this case, the writer/director/producer might have benefited from additional creative energies."
74,"Wow, Liam Neesam what happened to you?! The success of Taken had had a negative effect on his career. You can only make Taken once and the films that offered to you thereafter are subpar.A ""honest thief"" wants to return the money he stole from unsolved bank heists & face a more lenient sentence in order to have a clean slate with his girlfriend. That's the premise but if that happened smoothly then you would not get much of a film. They throw in some corrupt cops/FBI agents & they frame him for a murder he did not commit.There is a lot of chasing in this cat and mouse game but the ending is so predictable that nullifies any suspense. I would guess, most people can guess the ending without much trouble. This is far from a thinking person's film as they come."
75,"Liam neeson is cool action actor, the movie was slow at some scenes but it had fun action by Liam neeson.About the third act it becomes like the movie""taken"" also starring Liam neeson which was cool."
76,"The cast is great, the story is good and Liam Neeson knows how to deliver with his style an entertaining action movie."
77,It's a very good Liam Neeson Movie. Don't hesitate to watch. You'll enjoy it!!!
78,"So yes, there is the familiar ""I'm coming for you!"" aspect to Honest Thief, but for all that it still entertains. The script is a bit dodgy, some odd decisions made here and there that undermine Neeson's character's professionalism, but it is still a solid B-grade romp with nice touches of humor from a solid cast who do their job well.It does take a while to get going though."
79,An ok movie for a Liam Neeson fan. Still a couple of things could have been better. Like the CGI is terrible. Also the plot is a little weird. Onedoes not call the FBI asking for a deal. Any other person would have a lawyer make the deal with the FBI or Police.... Still.. The action is good and its very entertaining
80,"Some of the reviews on here are a bit harsh - yes it is exactly what you expect from Liam Neeson but it was still enjoyable to watch. If your not too picky and generally enjoy his films, this one will be no different!! Kate Walsh was also really great in this."
81,"Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) is an ex-marine who work in demolition. He is also the ""in and out"" bandit who has stolen millions of dollars and has never been caught. He meets a girl (Kate Wals) and wants to go straight, but does so in an awkward fashion. Two FBI agents assigned to the case decide to keep the money for themselves. They end up shooting their boss. Tom and his girlfriend are on the run as 2 agents are out to kill them.The plot was predictable. Liam calling the agent and saying, ""I'm coming for you"" has become his signature line, him and most vigilante heroes. Run of the mill production.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. No Albanian sex traffickers."
82,"I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson. I think he's a fine actor, and a kick-ass action hero. Unfortunately, with titles such as ""Taken 3"" and ""Cold Pursuit"" lining his resume, he has been in a slew of mediocre thrillers lately. And you can add ""Honest Thief"" to that list.""Honest Thief"" is not a good film. Perhaps you may enjoy it, and I hope you do. However, I found this movie extremely boring, and relentlessly mediocre, in every aspect. Let's talk about the action. Practically nonexistent. There are maybe two or three action scenes in this film - what I mean by that is, there are only two or three scenes where fists are thrown, or guns are fired. But when the action hits, it hits like a pillow fight. It isn't necessarily poorly filmed, but the violence lacks momentum. At points Liam Neeson seems to move in slow motion, and it's a wonder that his enemies aren't able to quickly overpower him. At some points, people will just stand in place as he runs toward them, not putting up any semblance of a fight; whether this is due to bad choreography, bad direction, or both, only God knows. As a whole, the action just feels extremely sanitized, and unfortunately, it seems that Liam's age is catching up to him. At one point he yells at someone to run from the inevitable danger, while he himself is running at the pace of a slow jog.While all of the actors in this movie are good, you would not be able to know if this was the first film you've seen with them in it. In between the action you'll find extremely bland drama that is filled to the brim with wooden dialogue and stilted acting; actors sound like they're reading lines directly off the script. Jai Courtney, who I've loved in ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" was out of his element here, but I don't blame him; the horrendous writing and awkward dialogue he was forced to speak are to blame. And every actor suffers from the lackluster script writing.Ultimately, ""Honest Thief"" is forgettable. It feels like a movie you'd find by scrolling through TV channels late at night. There is some mildly entertaining action scattered throughout, but in the end, this movie is definitely not a theatre experience, and is one you can skip and not feel bad about missing."
83,"Review from Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About The Movies:Liam Neeson is back again following the same formula movie he is constantly cast in. ""Piss me off.. I WILL hunt you down.. and I WILL make your life miserable in some way"".The premise is a ""not-so-bad"" thief who robs banks meets a girl and decides to come clean to the FBI in exchange for a lite sentence. Unfortunately the FBI agents that see the $9M decide they'd rather take the money and be crooked cops. That's when Neeson falls into his routine movie.This isn't a bad movie at all.. but it's pretty ""cookie cutter"" for Neeson. It was worth seeing because (honestly) there isn't a LOT out there to see at the moment. His ""Taken"" movies were better.I'd give it about a 5.5 out of 10. Good mindless fun... but nothing new or even ""creative"" (as it comes to story lines). Neeson is doing a role he's done a dozen times before. Since there is a serious movie lull at the theaters, it's better than many out there, but nothing new or creative."
84,"Sorry to say, this was just an ok movie, nothing more. Liam Neeson is going at half speed and that is not a good thing. We pay to see him take that special set of skills, to hunt them down and kill them one by one in a fun and violent way. Too bad this is a PG-13 version of Taken and other movies of his. He is a good actor, he has a lot of good and fun movies, I'm just not sure this deserves to be in that group of movies.It wasn't all that bad, just to predictable in a boring kind of way and with less bodies than you might hope for. He is still an ex-marine and all that, but with a conscience. It's a nice Sunday movie when you are tired after a long week. But nothing more.I paid $14 to watch it in the theatre, that was too much, if you ask me. It should have been half that price, if they want people back in the theatre I mean.6/10"
85,"""Honest Thief"" (aka ""Taken 17"") feels small and cheap. Liam Neeson has been kicking and punching his way through action movies for over a decade now. This is one of the more forgettable versions of the same schtick. Kate Walsh is aggressively bad. Jai Courtney is the cliché bad cop. Everyone is mailing it in and collecting a check."
86,"Liam Neeson has a voice that could melt chocolate - but that really isn't enough to overcome the fairly fundamental plot holes in this Swiss cheese of a film. Having successfully robbed provincial American banks of some $9m, he goes to a storage facility to rent some space to store his ill-gotten gains whereupon he falls for the rather feisty Kate Walsh (""Annie"") who runs the establishment. Skip forward a year and he determines to buy a home and settle down with her. To ensure a clean start, he calls the FBI to own up to his criminal past, return the money and to do a deal. When he eventually manages to convince them he isn't a crank, he discovers that the calibre of the agents sent to treat with him are less than J. Edgar might have required, and soon he and his girlfriend are on the run from agents Jai Courtney and Anthony Ramos who have other plans for his loot. It's a fairly bog-standard action adventure with little in the way of jeopardy - of course Neeson is an ex-Marine with loads of ninja skills that actually make you wonder just how many ordinary American citizens have a better military training than those who actually wear an uniform! Courtney always seems to appear to have been poured into his clothes, and whilst easy enough on the eye he is a terrible actor and his conscious-troubled sidekick Ramos adds little to this either. I still quite enjoyed it - just don't ask me what it was all about next month."
87,"Although Liam Neeson is a great actor overall, he seems to take roles like this quite often, regardless of how good or bad the script may be. From Taken to Non-Stop, his string of passable action flicks has actually gotten to be a little much for me. Sure, he's a likeable actor and if a decent director is on board, the movie itself can be fun, but I just want to see him do more films like Widows or Silence. He has incredible range but doesn't choose to show it in films like this. Now playing in theatres, Honest Thief is his latest outing in this genre and just like many of his other films, it's a fun, passable drama/action flick. Here's why it may be worth a watch, but easily skippable in theatres.After spending many years bank robbing and stealing millions of dollars, Tom (Liam Neeson) has decided to live a normal life with his newfound love in Annie (Kate Walsh). Being double-crossed by two officers as he is about to confess and do his time, he is sprung back into action. Needing to both protect himself, his girlfriend, and anyone else who may be in the line of fire, he will stop at nothing to turn himself in, while also taking down who needs to be stopped. Sadly, that description sounds more exciting than the actual film ended up being. There are a few moments of excitement, but Honest Thief is much more of a drama than an action film.I appreciated the fact that director Mark Williams had a very gentle hand in making some emotional scenes, but there were a little too many of them, making the movie as a whole feel slightly too sentimental. The mannerisms of the character of Tom felt like Neeson's performance in Taken, but he is a much calmer character here, which didn't really fit the movie. What I will commend is the fact that I actually bought into the chemistry between Neeson and Walsh, which at least had me caring whether or not they lived or died. Other than these few positives, this movie does drag on its very thin premise. There were many times where I found the movie losing sight of the direction it was going in.I normally don't like to put suggestions for how a film could've been improved in a review, but Tom is a character who had served in the army and never once was there a flashback to those days. Flashbacks are absolutely not necessary to a film by any means, but I found myself wishing I could've appreciated how he was able to accomplish certain things, presently. It's possible that Steve Allrich and Mark Williams' screenplay meant to keep audiences in the dark on certain things, but I feel that the excessive amount of explanatory dialogue in certain scenes was much weaker than if they had shown what he was saying about his past. That's a personal suggestion and nitpick, so many viewers probably won't feel that way, but it's how I was seeing each and every one of the expository scenes.In the end, Honest Thief cares about the core characters and the performances by Neeson and Walsh are both fun to watch. I haven't seen Jeffrey Donovan on the big screen in a while and I particularly liked his portrayal as one of the officers. His character added a needed layer of depth to the film. There's absolutely nothing memorable about this film in terms of praise or recommendation, but I have to admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre. It's a fun little drama with a few spurts of action. If that sounds like something you can sit back and enjoy, I say check it out. Just know that it's nothing that's worth writing home about."
88,"What could possibly push you to do such a low job, are you broke? or you don't care about your legacy any more?it's just a typical mish mash of a slow paced action movie."
89,I must say the movie had me wanting it to end not but 10 minutes in . What a waste of my money .
90,Among the worst things that have happened to cinema for the past 30 years. Only the second time I've left the theatre before the end
91,"We went to this movie because there was simply nothing else in the cinema... it was a MISTAKE, don't go."
92,I was expecting a decent Liam Neeson movie but it turned out to be the opposite. The movie was too predictable.
93,But this was ridiculous! I love Liam and have been waiting for something he plays a bad ass in again but... Well you have to really suspend belief on this one. No chemistry at all between him and Annie( felt more like a daughter). The FBI is full of idiots. They don't want to look into his confession even tho he has names of banks dates and tells them exactly how. The movie would have been over in 15 minutes had he sent the FBI to the body and told them about the corrupt officers but no he instead runs. Just the same mindless stuff Hollywood's been churning out forever( hence why I mostly watch UK stuff). Liam did his best( why liam did you take this role?) But he could not save it. I guess your supposed to believe he wants to turn himself in for a woman we see like 12 min of character build of their relationship and all the drivel that comes after. Sorry Liam I hate to give anything you do a poor review but I just have to..
94,"The contemporary Liam Neeson crime thriller ""Honest Thief"" lives up to its oxymoronic title. As the protagonist, Neeson plays Tom Dolan, a resourceful but sympathetic bank robber who pulled a hitch in the Marine Corps as a demolition expert. One day, quite by accident, Dolan discovers the lady of this dreams and later decides to turn himself in for his crimes. He cannot marry Annie (Kate Walsh of ""Legion"") with a guilty conscience and lie to her about his past, so he contacts the FBI. Nicknamed the ""In and Out Bandit,"" Dolan has amassed $9 million in currency from twelve banks that he knocked over in seven states. Mind you, Dolan expects to draw jail time. Nevertheless, he hopes he can cut a deal with federal prosecutors for a reduced sentence. Furthermore, he prefers to do his time in a facility near his future wife, so she can pay him regular visits.Clearly, Dolan approaches the proposition of negotiating such a saccharine deal with outlandish optimism. Indeed, this makes Neeson's morally compromised hero seem commendably honorable in an era when honor gets little respect. Dolan wants to do the right thing. Meanwhile, Annie believes and supports him 100 percent. She knows what Dolan has done but stands by him, even when her own life hangs in jeopardy. Incidentally, no spring chicken herself, Annie has weathered her own stormy divorce. Dolan has seen a lot of tragedy in his life and witnessed first-hand some illegal monetary skullduggery. His father lost a pension through no fault of his own when an unscrupulous CEO looted the company fund and prompted his dad to commit suicide. This skullduggery induced Dolan to utilize his special set of skills to loot the CEO's bank account where he had stashed the stolen money.
Essentially, ""Honest Thief"" is a tolerable but pedestrian character-driven drama about an amiable crook, and Liam Neeson radiates charisma galore. Incidentally, Dolan abhors the ""In and Out Bandit"" moniker. After offering to return the loot and face prosecution, Dolan tangles with two young, unethical FBI agents. They plan to discredit his story and then secretly confiscate his millions for their personal use. Happily, Dolan has prepared himself for just such a contingency, and it takes him about 75 minutes in terms of movie time to turn the tables on these greedy FBI agents, keep himself and Annie alive, and arrange a legitimate deal with the Bureau. ""Suicide Squad"" actor Jai Courtney is cast as rapacious FBI agent John Nivens, while Anthony Ramos of ""Hamilton"" plays Agent Hall. Comparatively, Nivens is single, while Hall has a wife and two newborn sons. Their FBI superior has ordered them to verify Dolan's claim about being the ""In and Out Bandit.""Meantime, several crackpots have tried to confess to Dolan's crimes, but the Bureau never found sufficient evidence to verify those claims. When Nivens and Hall ask him for incriminating evidence to confirm his identity, Dolan explains his bank robbery methods. First, he robs banks only during holiday weekends when everybody has Monday off. Second, the building next door to the bank must be vacant. Entering through this empty building, Dolan breaks into the bank, deploys his equipment to drill into the safe. Sometimes, he has to use small amounts of explosives to open stubborn safes. After he cleans out the vault, Dolan tidies up after himself and leaves the fewest clues about his presence. Ultimately, he hands Agent Nivens his storage unit key and assures them, they will find $3 million in banknotes. Unfortunately, Dolan's best-laid plans go awry. Nivens plans to steal the $3 million. Initially, Hall refuses to act as an accomplice. Nevertheless, Nivens convinces his partner he would be throwing away the opportunity of a lifetime to provide for the future of his family.Best known for writing Ben Affleck's provocative bullet-riddled thriller ""The Accountant"" (2016) and executive producing Netflix's cartel series ""Ozark,"" ""Family Man"" director Mark Williams sticks to procedural basics. He doesn't clutter up the largely straightforward action with frivolous subplots and characters. Everybody comes with some form of motivation that puts them either on the right or the wrong side of the law. Williams doesn't let the romance between Tom and Annie interfere with the action, except when the villains recognize Annie as a bargaining chip in their negotiations. Characterization is kept to a bare minimum. The only extraneous element that isn't developed either for comic relief or dramatic revelations is the adorable dog that good guy FBI agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan of ""Shot Caller"") carries around with him. No, this cute, little pooch neither urinates in Meyer's agency car nor latches onto Dolan's ankle during a sudden plot twist.
Meantime, Williams relies on every cliché you can imagine to keep the characters vaulting over obstacles. Literally, you can guess everything that unfolds in ""Honest Thief"" before either co-scenarist Steve Allrich of ""The Timber"" or Williams set it up and pull it off. Just as there are two corrupt FBI agents, two incorruptible FBI agents have their eyes on their devious colleagues. ""Terminator 2"" star Robert Patrick plays Agent Sam Baker who assigned Nivens and Hall to Dolan's case. The other straight-arrow agent is Meyers. He has survived his own divorce and wound up with his ex-wife's dog instead of his house. He investigates Nivens and Hall after Baker's murder. The suspicious Meyers doesn't understand why Nivens and Hall have implicated Dolan for Baker's murder when Dolan had contacted Baker initially to give himself up. Inevitably, Meyers and Dolan run afoul of each other, and Dolan delivers irrefutable proof that Nivens and Hall have framed him for Baker's murder.The gritty on-location lensing in Massachusetts creates a palatable sense of atmosphere and urgency, and the strong cast gives this formulaic fodder a modicum of credibility. ""Honest Thief"" amounts to a polished looking potboiler. Compared with Neeson's previous outing, the exciting and suspenseful ""Cold Pursuit,"" ""Honest Thief"" qualifies as a low stakes crime thriller with nominal surprises."
95,"If this film dont have Liam, i will not come to see the movie. The script is too simple!!! And let me have a bad feeling about FBI special force!! No highlight, no thrilling as all film that Liam join before (ex Taken 123)."
96,"I am big fan of Liam neeson since movie taken but his latest offering is disaster, Just watch movie in cinema,it was total disappointment and i was shocked as to why Liam choose such script, predictable story, slow pace, no thrill, no twists,few actions scenes and rubbish climax.
Wasted my time.
I would advise you to avoid and save your money and time"
97,"Wow, this movie was so non-special ,I did not even give it a low grade.
I gave it 4 stars because to give it 1 star or 2 would mean I hated it and its hard
to have strong emotions over a movie so banal.So, this is basically a generic ""bad boy turns nice and wants to redeem himself"" story.It's not set in reality though, its set in a fantasy world.Here's how this conversation would go down in reality:""Hi, i've been lying to you ever since I met you. I'm a wanted criminal who has stolen millions from the banks. I have given up all the money, so I am broke now.""
""I'm an old man, who will soon have a criminal record, and no assets or money, and also who has been lying to you the whole time. Will you will stay with me?""""Of course not. Have fun in prison, you lying sack of ----. I already have other guys lined up as I suspected there was something fishy about the 20 or 30 cardboard boxes of hard cash.""And then the guy would realise he just gave up 9 million dollars and years of his freedom on a bunch of Hollywood romance bs that doesn't exist in real life.Also, in this movie's universe, the FBI only has 4 agents in it, and the police only have two cruisers."
98,"And that set of skill is to play this type of character in these movies. He does it competently and it makes for simple and easily digestible mindless entertainment, which in and of itself is not a bad thing (As long as it does not take itself to seriously).All-round good script and acting with all the easily understood tropes one needs for a harmless piece of weekend escapism.Neeson obviously enjoys these types of characters otherwise he would refuse being typecast and his enjoyment can be seen in the end result. He is what makes this more than just another B movie. It becomes believable."
99,"Tom Carter is a bank robber who wants to turn himself in. Meeting the girl of his dreams compels the successful thief to mend his ways and he contacts local law enforcement to make a deal. Matters go out of hand though when events take a turn for the worst and Carter is off to a mad rush to save his life and the one closest to him. Featuring well-paced action and good acting ""Honest Thief"" is one of the notable Action flicks of recent times. Although age has taken its hold Liam Neeson proves he's one of the big screen's foremost actors of the field as he displays the authority and countenance that made films like the ""Taken"" series blockbusters. It's nice to see Jeffrey Donovan in action again too. Simple and to the point ""Honest Thief"" delivers smoothly like a heist made in heaven."
100,"If you like Jack Reacher type cinema, and Liam Neeson in Taken, then you'll like him in his latest offering as a former bank robber (with a particular set of skills) who was never caught, but who wants to make amens and turn himself in. He calls the FBI to turn himself in and then everything goes wrong. The film has some glaring assumptions that allow the plot to work, but it moves along enjoyably."
101,"It was cheesy in a few places but for the most part, kept me on my toes. A little slow at The first hotel screen and The beginning sort of zoomed their relationship a little fast without a Back story included.But it was good action....."
102,"This film is nothing we haven't seen before. The action sequences are done better in other films too. Basic story: a thief loves a woman so much, he wants to give up all his money and turn himself in as opposed to live a lie (she doesn't know he used to rob banks). When he tries to turn himself in, things go wrong and he needs to sort it out. That's it. That's your storyline.Even Liam looked tired and bored in this one. Was okay to watch in the background whilst working but you wouldn't want to invest serious time into this."
103,"Totally stupid plot. A love story that just goes on and on and keeps you wishing that someone would shoot her. A man who's ethics is so from another world that it makes him nothing but stupidly unbelievable. Great actors trying to keep their focus, fully knowing that what they are creating is utter crap."
104,I don't know why Liam Neeson pick this movie to play but I do know is this terrible movie to watch! The women those two FBI agent didn't have acting talent at all! It's just sad that they put to much money into this movie!
105,"Nothing new here, you'll wake up the next day and forget about this movie . The plot is ridiculous and the love lines were poorly written. The movie kept at a good pace so was never boring and the action sequences good. After the first 10 minutes you will predict how the film will run and end. Worth a watch to kill some time."
106,"Predictable, linear and improbable. Stale in the shadow of Taken. Hardly a space where actors could demonstrate their abilities. Honestly? This seems like a film that cashes in on Liam Neeson's reputations which, if he makes any more films like this, is going to dwindle quite quickly."
107,"Liam is wasting his talent on movies like these. It's been a while since I had seen a good ""Liam Neeson action thriller"". He is becoming more like Nic Cage. Acting out just for some quick cash. He should not do that. He is more talented than any."
108,"Sure, it's got nice Dodge Chargers, Glocks and ""9 mils""... It's got your run-of-the-mill crooked law enforcement officers... but it's also a bust. From the completely out.of.character and outlandish U-turn the love interest makes from the onset, to the simply idiotic main premise that puts things in motion (like... this highly thoughtful guy wouldn't even think of mediating his turning-himself-in with a lawyer????? Seriously???? WTF!!!)
Anyway, it gets 2 stars because it's watchable and mildly entertaining. Completely predictable and depressingly underwhelming, but 2020 has lowered all our standards, so... there you go. Best bet is to skip it altogether. There are better things to do with your time, like watching grass grow or moisture evaporate.."
109,"It's poor, if you have 90 mins spare then watch it. You'll learn, nor gain anything from it. Tassy the dog is the star, that's it."
110,"This is the latest in a long line of predictable, rehashed plot, Liam Neeson movies. Basically a B type film, poor writing, average acting and has been done dozens of times before. Not sure if Hollywood is totally out of ideas but this was painful to watch. A total waste of 90 minutes !"
111,"Liam Neeson does another Taken film but this time the a pair of FBI agents are the bad guys. He blows up safes and has accumulated millions from his heists. He meets a woman right at the start of the movie and he falls in love with her and decides to turn himself in to prove his love for her. Temptation takes over as the lawmen decide to pad their retirement plans with a few million of the stolen loot. As expected, we get the car chases, fights and very little romance here. The script is nothing new but Liam is so good that it can be forgiven."
112,"Entertaining movie, a typical Liam Neeson part but enjoyable."
113,"""Honest Thief"" (2020 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Tom. As the movie opens, Tom is seen robbing a Boston bank by blowing up the bank's massive vault. Afterwards Tom goes to a self-storage outfit to rent a unit, where he meets Annie and the chemistry is immediate and obvious. We then swith to ""One Year Later"", as Tom and Annie are eyeing a house to movie into in suburban Boston. In a parallel story line, we get to know a couple of FBI Special Agents. In a bold move, Tom decides to turn himself in to come clean with his past as the ""In-and-Out Bandit"" once and for all... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second film from director and co-writer Mark Williams. Here he brings the all too familiar tale of a bank robber wanting to make amends for his past actions. The opening scene of the film immediately reminded me of Michael Mann's excellent 1981 film ""Thief"" (starrning James Caan), and I thought we might be in for a similar experience. Alas, it was not the case. Instead, we get latter-day action movie superstar Liam Neeson doing his umpteenth ""I must prove my innocence"" routine. And yet, per the usual, Neeson has a certain charm about him. Neeson, who is now a crisp 68 yrs. young, could do this role in his sleep, but he still manages to put some vigor into it. The same cannot be said about some of the other supporting cast. ""Dirty"" FBI agent Nivens, played by Jai Courney, is about as subtle and sophisticated as a bull in a China shop. Tom's romantic interest Annie is played aptly by Kate Walsh. The biggest problem is that everything we see and experience in this film has been done before, and done better. Apart from Michael Mann's ""Thief"", the otehr film that came to mind is Benn Affleck's directing debut ""This Town"" (and not just because it is also set in Boston). ""Honest Thief"" is just nowhere near as good. The action scenes are, like eveything else in this fim, okay but just okay. Nothing that will have you at the egde of your seat. Does this make it a 'bad' fim? No, it doesn't. It entertains, bit it does it in a predictable and familiar way, and the film benefits generously from Liam Neeson's always chariming performance.The release of ""Honest Thief"" was repeatedtly delayed resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It finally started playing in theaters in mid-October. Since then, the coronavirus has gotten worse, much worse, and all ""big"" studio releases (including the new James Bond and other such blockbusters) have been pushed back indefinitely. In this dearth of new studio releases, ""Honest Thief"" continues to play in theaters, now almost 2 months later. The Monday evening screening where I saw this at this week was attended by exactly 5 people, including myself, which sadly is better than average in my experience of seeing movies in the theater the last 3 months or so. If you are in the mood for a mindless action-thriller that is okay ut just okay or are simply a fan of Liam Neeson the action movie superstar, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
114,"I would give it a solid 7 until how the story ended, not much Neeson climax action at the finish. One thing I liked is how the story flowed, and the writers seem to cover as many plot holes as possible along the way, which was enjoyable comparing to the common ""stupidy"" we have to endure with the characters."
115,"Had low expectations coming into Honest Thief, but it was still a disappointment.It's ludicrous, unnecessary and unconvincing, with one of the stupidest premises of all time. I don't even buy Liam Neeson being a bank thief at this point, not unless he's doing it to help someone. Tom says he did it because his father got screwed over and it provided a thrill, but he didn't even spend any. I also don't buy this romance or how they got together. The FBI agent and his new companion are more compelling. Why does Jai Courtney keep getting roles, he's awful."
116,"This is not Taken.
In Taken, Liam is a smart guy with a particular set of skills.This is a really dumb person making dumb choices. His only skill is, that he can blow things up.The movie is boring with long dialogues between the protagonist and his girlfriend. Luckily, the antagonists are even dumber.The success of a plot shouldn't be reverse proportional with the intelligence of the protagonists."
117,"It's sweet to know someone back to the right path because of his lovely one, it's cool that someone robs banks but doesn't use a penny, but this story for me impossible. i watched it only just because Liam Neeson was the main actor no more than that."
118,"For starters, I liked that meeting Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) and Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) only lasted a few minutes and then skipping a year where Tom wants to atone for his past sins.
It's a little silly for me why he didn't immediately secure himself with a camera or dictaphone ... But hell, then they would watch a half-hour movie."
119,"Another good old action movie from Liam. It is straightforward simple and entailing movie. More lime Liam's other action movies, more like run all night. You'll love it."
120,"Neeson is doing what he knows to do best, and this is what we want - to see him kick ass, as he does in almost all his films. Some better, some less, I assume his age is taking its tole, he can't eliminate dozens of bad guys anymore, only few, so the films become more slow and the action is minimized. I would like to see him kick as at any age as he did in Taken, and hope to see him punish many many bad guys."
121,I was eager to see new Neeson's action flick . He is one of my favourite actors and most of his movies are excellent but this one is way off the mark . Drawn out conversations and less action . The only redeeming quality is Jay Courtney's outstanding performance . i hope his next movies will be more entertaining like his old flicks (Taken trilogy - Non Stop - Unknown - Run all night)
122,"Greed corrupts absolutely. That is the main theme that emerges in this average sort of adventure. Liam Neeson and Kate Walsh carry the film. If you watch the trailer you get the whole gist of the film with no twists. Some good action scenes but our main villain proves to be very one dimensional. No backstory and stupid greed leads them to their betrayal of the badge. Overall it was good easy to understand fun and action, don't expect too much."
123,"I never expect a masterpiece when looking for american actions films, you know what you go in for: big explosions, some romance, suspense, and predictable but entertaining scenes.Liam's Taken made me take a shot at this one, but oh boy was I disappointed. Beyond the poor character development, terrible visual effects, predictable ""Plot twists"" (If you can even call them that) and an implausible story, this movie made me uncomfortable. The action scenes are nothing like what you are used to, they're slow, and awkward, there is never any real tension, they just breeze through what could be decent fights like they are two old men wrestling for some old highschool beef.The characters who should evoke some sort of respect or appeal are presented tired and spineless, outside from the villain, who is just a knucklehead unable to really bring Intelligence into the FBI, they are all old and slow. In my opinion, this was a director's mistake, since the quality of the cast is good, they are just not led to show a proper work."
124,"Please, don't bring your disbelief to the cinema, so you don't have to suspend it from the ceiling. Leave it at home. But you can bring needle and thread to sew up some dozens holes on the script.There are so many non credible situations that I can't count them. I don't know in what universe corrupted FBI agents can kill another cop and go to work the next day like nothing happened, being interrogated by their boss and continue working after 2 minutes. The same with a guy who robbed 12 banks and is around those agents, fighting and playing with bombs.But, yes, the popcorn and the coke will make you have a good time. And next time you want to blow up somebody's house call Liam Neeson. He will do it in 5 minutes and the neighbors won't even notice it."
125,"This movie was seriously dissapointing. The motive for the honest theif is very cheesy. The plot is not particularly original. The script doesnt allow any of the known actors to shine. Really this movie should have never been made, it's just a money grab during the pandemic. I do not recommend that you waste your time with this, better to watch in an airplane or barbershop, or any place where your waiting."
126,THis is the most moronic movie I've seen in 6 months.The script is idiotic and completely unbelievable. It's also not very well directed.The plot insults your intelligence with every frame.How anone gave this a good review is beyond me.
127,"Listen to be honest I had very low expectations for this indie flick and it slightly excedded them. Good action decent acting prediciable plot what more can I say.. But for a guy who hasnt gone to the theaters in almost half a year this will do fine
Stay safe!"
128,"3 out of 5 stars.Honest Thief is a fair action thriller film about a professional thief Tom (Liam Neeson) who robbed several banks and has several million dollars stored. Until he falls in love and wants to give up his criminal past. By turning himself in. Only for two detectives played by Jai Courtney and Anthony Ramos to set him up by murdering another detective and walking with the stolen money. Tom will have to do whatever it takes to prove his innocence.The plot is nothing special and decent. Kind of feels like almost all Liam Neeson movies with him needing to prove his innocence. It is nonetheless entertaining.The action sequences is okay. Nothing top notch or dull. The script did lacked in story. Besides giving Jeffrey Donovan playing a detective who is left with his ex wifes dog.The acting is tedious with the cast. Jai Courtney playing the bad guy. Liam Neeson giving the same performance as always.Overall, it is a fair action movie with some action. Boring story. And just a cheap action escapism."
129,"How many time is Neeson going to make this movie?Neeson is in the same time period, haircut and clothing as every other middle class father of grown children who then has to shoot some bad guys, as every other movie he's been in for the past decade.I saw this in theaters October 16, 2020 and there was even a trailer for Neeson playing yet again the same character, but this time, he's saving a kid at a border crossing. Seriously, Neeson's agent needs to find him some projects with more diverse characters for him to play.Story lacked character development and we didn't understand why two cops (1 cop) went bad. No idea for their motivation.Neeson's character of a bank robber who robs 12 banks but doesn't spend any of the money, doesn't make sense. Even his reasoning for robbing the banks doesn't make sense.It's getting to the point where it seems studios want to make a quick buck by remaking ever decreasing in quality versions of Taken, with Neeson as a drunk in the snow, Neeson who lives in the desert, Neeson as a kind criminal. Neeson as a kind criminal again. It's not even worth a watch.Parts of the movie - I could not suspend my disbelief. Neeson is able to just waltz out of a hospital with a patient and rather than try to untangle that mess, it just cuts to Neeson tucking her in at home, still in her hospital gown.Seriously, expand the characters you play or retire. I'm tired of watching low quality knockoffs of Taken."
130,"This is a very good movie...especially if you already like Liam Neeson. I don't understand the bad reviews but I believe that the overall personality of America has changed to where particular movies are not well received now like they used to be.
I blame politics and Hollywood itself...which is another proxy for politics."
131,"I think we all know by now that if Liam neeson makes a film it'll be about him being a good guy with a secret history involving him being double hard with special skills. So it's now just about who close to him is going to be hurt or taken or effected in whatever way. While we then wait for the action to start and some cool lines hopefully as cool as the phone call line from the first taken.It's watchable, enjoyable. But not the best neeson one by far."
132,"In the past I've had issues with Neesons characterization, but this film is all together different, it actually kept me glued to his character."
133,"Honest Thief is the standard Liam Neeson actioner with no major takeaways, but easy to sit through. With more than half the film featuring phone calls between Neeson's protagonist and the rest of the cast, the script is threadbare and built on a one-line plot that's predictable from start to finish. Honest Thief never really kicks into the high gear that one might expect it to. And for an action flick, that's something of a bother. While it's difficult to hate Neeson, he has, at this point, turned into this generic action movie character who tracks people down, gets into unimaginative fistfights, and mouths ""you have it coming, my friend"" kinda lines. Kate Walsh is thankfully not a mere afterthought in the film."
134,"Good ol' Liam comes back to our screens as a burglar with a heart big like that and solid knuckles in a movie that starts incredibly cheesy, where everything has to be moral, with a moral hero thief and a very very bad and very very mean villain, and a peppy girlfriend who makes terribly bad jokes.Then at some point our favourite sweet & sour brute starts distributing fists and bullets so you could tell yourself, ""well, at least Liam Neeson will entertain us during the next hour by killing everyone who crosses his path, like he has done with unflinching regularity for the last 15 years"", but in a world where nothing is certain for very long, you can apparently not even count on Liam Neeson to kill people at an industrial pace anymore as the unbelievably heavy cheesiness resumes as soon as the dust settle from that very short action scene.So you give up."
135,....hard to believe the character's honesty. Expected action keeps you interested though the end is foreseeable.
136,"This is a basic Liam Neeson movie, and i love that, he plays always the same, but for some reason it gets never old, just like all the older Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, he as always play a good guy who have a very particular set of skills, skills he have acquired over a very long career, and yeah you know the rest.If you have seen the trailer and have read the description, then read on....
So it's about a bank robber, who finds the love of his life, and because of her he stops robbing banks, but he feels guilty so he calls the FBI, and then everything goes sideways very fast, great simple action movie with some great fast action car scenes, the only thing that was not so great was the shooting scenes, they are very bad shooters.I would recommend everyone this movie who also liked the other Liam Neeson action movies, it's sometimes slow, but when the action begins it's great."
137,"Brought my two children ( one 8, one 13 ) over to watch this as there were no other movies and this one was PG-13. Went in there a little worried that they may get nightmares but nope. Plot was meaningful and there is a good amount of suspense of what happens next. The violence is average and not really much blood shots to scare children. Kids came out enthusiastic and this was one of the first action movies they fell in love with. Not much kissing too which makes it bearable for them. For me i found it enjoyable and loved it. Only tiny flaw is the ending is abit adrupt and not much wow factor. overall would recommend!!"
138,"First Thing, if Liam Neeson didn't make that phone call, the Best Friend of the Other Agent wouldn't have died in the first place.To be fair I was actually Interested throughout the Movie although the last quarter was a bit abrupt, it could of been built up a bit better for that last quarter.There were some funny moments with Neeson and Also the two best friend agents had fun Chemistry. It was a shame that one of them is only in the Movie for a little while.Overall, It felt like a Love Story with a little bit of Action but i guess it was Ok."
139,"A apparent lack of action. A lot of focus on the romance plot but they mistakenly messed this up by wrapping up the film much too quickly. leaving out a ton of desired scenes other films definitely would have. The acting is decent overall but nothing fantastic. It was great to see Donovan and he gives a good performance but his role was very underutilized. There are a few odd plot holes, especially it having FBI they miss some marks. If anything I wouldn't have rated this movie as low if they didn't wrap up the finale as fast as they did, this was a major letdown and others I was with also kinda gasped the moment the camera panned out and the credits rolled in. They really messed up there. Also there is a scene with a odd cut, that felt very rushed, you will definitely notice it (people in front of me certainly did). The VFX were also lackluster, and imo in 2020 you can't have stuff like fire/explosions look so ''greenscreen-y'' anymore. Just some really poor fire fx as well, cheap looking, not well color corrected. The action scenes were decent, not heavy on cuts or shaky cam, a little but not annoyingly.All in all it's just about alright, just not worth a ticked imo. 5/10"
140,"Liam Neeson, comes back to the cinema with another action movie. The plot is pretty generic and straightforward, perfect if you want to enjoy it and just have one hour and a half of pure pure fun. There are some good action scenes, especially car chases, and also fighting scenes are good, but they feel generic, nothing really stand out. Don't get me wrong: I was not expecting a masterpiece, but I was hoping a little bit of effort regarding action scenes. Well, at least it was not packed of nonsense explosions.Liam Neeson does his best, but he's also almost 70 years old and his movements are slow and not credible at all. How he manages to always prevail against people that are way younger and stronger than him is a mistery. Some fights are too slow and they have tried to avoid physical violence as much as possible, prioritizing car chases or simple uninspired and impossible shootouts. In this movie guns have 30+ bullets in their mag, you almost never see characters reload the pistol. I mean guys we are in 2020, these details shouldn't be overlooked.The romantic storyline perfectly fit in the contest of the movie and is not too invasive. Cast did overall a nice job, really appreciated Liam Neeson, Jai Courtney and Jeffrey Donovan performances, they were able to keep the movie afloat. This is one of those movies that you can watch with your family or friends, without paying too much attention, so if you just want to chill this can be a nice choice, but there are for sure better action movies, with better stunts scenes. I don't think that I will watch it again, and it will be soon forgotten."
141,Stupid story line and stupid acting.. you most turn all of your brain cells down so toy can enjoy this movie.. at least Liam movies before were acceptable but this one.. big NO !
142,"Good movie to watch when you got bored.
Nice characters, but little bit action parts to be add"
143,"How many times are they just going to remake ""taken""
can this clown even do another role?!"
144,Very good film with a nice story but the film lets some open questions at the end!
145,"Neither good nor bad. I liked it at least for it's honesty, showing us how people are in real life, thier jobs, relationships, behaviors. Although nothing special, it looks like honest real life events. But bad is that the movie is too amateur, meaning amateur graphics and events. Nothing special or extreme to see, so much that it is boring. I expected, not more unreal or extreme stuff, but more mystery, details, science. The science and intro part are not deep or detailed enough. Emotions are too shallow too. Movie can't be compared to some of Liam's best movies like Taken or Non-Stop. Neutral rating."
146,"Well, Liam Neeson does what Liam Neeson does, for better or worse. The good part is that you know what kind of entertainment you are in for when you sit down to watch the 2020 movie ""Honest Thief"". The bad part is it is something you've seen Liam Neeson do countless times already.Now, don't get me wrong here, because ""Honest Thief"" from writers Steve Allrich and Mark Williams is entertaining and enjoyable. However, it just suffers from being a generic crime drama; one that follows the how-to-make-a-crime-drama blueprint to the letter. So on that point, the movie is somewhat generic and predictable.While ""Honest Thief"" turned out to be yet another generic archetypical Liam Neeson crime drama, then it was actually an enjoyable one. It was partly because of the storyline, but most certainly also because of the cast and the performances they individually put on.If you enjoy crime dramas, then you definitely should also watch the 2020 ""Honest Thief"" from director Mark Williams.I found it to be entertaining enough for what it was, and my rating of ""Honest Thief"" lands on a six out of ten stars. This is a good enough movie for what it was, but it is hardly ranking among the best of Liam Neeson movies, nor is it hardly a movie that you will come to think of whenever someone mention his name."
147,"This movie is drass. When I'm in my 50,s hope I get the same luck as Liam Neeson."
148,"Honest Thief was somewhat better film from the rest of recent Liam Neeson films but it still had that same vibe through its runtime and it also had predictable plot and only fine action.Honestly i dont know why this guy makes this kind of films,he proved in Schindlers list that he has a great range as a actor and he proved that he can play a dramatic roles very easily,so why in the hell he continues to pick weak and predictable action and thriller films that feel all the same and that offered nothing new its genre or something revolutionary to Liams carrere,Honest Thief was a little better film then recent his his but still it is one them same"
149,"Honest Thief is the ""average Joe"" of current film releases. It's a movie with very few characteristics that make it stand out from other action/drama. In the film, Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) tries to give up $9 million in stolen money to live an honest life with the woman he loves. But as he attempts to turn himself in, two corrupt Feds, Ramon (Anthony Ramos) and John (Jai Courtney) take advantage of the stolen money. Now he must clear his name for a murder he never committed all in the name of love.I feel like I have watched Honest Thief many times before. Many action/drama films have the same feel to the plot, action and dialogue - and the writing here feels a bit lazy. It is as if Honest Thief cut and pasted elements from cliché lines from classic action films and put them into scenes that were supposed to be suspenseful and dramatic. I have heard the lines ""I am coming for you"" in too many films to count, and the effect of using these lines too much is disappointing.I like that Honest Thief is fast-paced and scenes don't drag out. There are ""good old"" car chases, people being knocked out and being swung around like ragdolls. The use of comedy is sparse and feels thrown in the movie for the sake of comedic relief. Honest Thief is serious in tone so the comedy feels awkward and out of place, especially since there is so little of it.I can usually enjoy any kind of film for what it is, but something rubbed me the wrong way about the character of Annie (Kate Walsh), Tom's wife. Her role, even her designation as a grad student, feels instrumental only for the progression of Tom's character. Tom believes he can turn himself in, delete his past, and that Annie will stay with him even after finding he's a professional bank robber. I am disappointed in the stereotypical and outdated use of women as the motivation for everything a man does -as well as not happy with the lack of female representation here. If we use the Bechdel test for female representation and ask, ""Does the film have two named female characters that talk to each other about something other than men?"" Unfortunately Honest Thief fails this test.This film has action, violence and some strong language. I am able to empathize with Ramon as he struggles about whether to go along with John and steal the money for the future or do what is morally right. Even in Tom's case, as we learn about his motivation for robbing banks, we realize that not everyone is what they seem at surface level and good people can do bad things.I give Honest Thief 2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 12 to 18. Reviewed by Anokhi L., KIDS FIRST!"
150,There was nothing to watch. Thought it would be amazing with Liam Neeson but it isn't. The performance of other actors was weak.
151,"This is an ""ok"" action movie, but since I've seen the ""Taken"" series, it's hard to not see Liam Neeson as anything other than a rogue going after some bad guys. There's lulls that offer the opportunity to understand the story, and background, of the characters. There's also a good amount of action that has you wanting more, but at the end of the day, 90 minutes doesn't give you the full meal. As cheesy as this movie is compared to ""Taken"" it would've been nice to have a little more oomph added. The one good quality I liked about the film is the relationship between Tom and Annie. It was a true, and through hardship, trusted relationship.The overall to this film, for me, is if you've seen ""Taken"", ""Non-Stop"", or ""The Commuter"". Than you've pretty much seen this film. If you really want to see this movie, wait for cheap night, or if you have little, to no interest to see it, just wait for it to come out on a streaming service."
152,"This film start with a man ""Tom"" blow up a vault, and he flirting with a front desk woman ""Annie"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Tom need to clear his name by take down two corrupted cops(Nivens, and Hall), who accuse him killing a cop ""Baker"", and illegally possess the money turn in by Tom! Entire film quite slow, full of boring conversation and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the aerial city view scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, and overuse of the calling names scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have things broken at certain point, but overall not intense, and occur too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! Barely intense scene is, Nivens runaway from his exploded house! At the end, Nivens arrested with the money in his car! Tom back with Annie at the very end! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
153,"Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) is the In-and-Out-Bandit. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million from banks while they are closed on long weekend holidays. He has fallen in love with Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) and wants to confess for a reduced sentence. He calls FBI agent Samuel Baker (Robert Patrick) who is not convinced. Baker sends subordinates John Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Ramon Hall (Anthony Ramos) to interview him. He tells them the location of the money and they end up stealing it. It goes badly and FBI agent Sean Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) struggles to put the pieces together.Liam Neeson keeps doing this character and he's good at it. He makes this unlikely story somewhat reasonable. It's still unreasonable. Dolan is a smart man and he would never surrender in such a haphazard way. He would get the insurance companies to put some pressure on a deal. He could contact the FBI without revealing his identity. He could authenticate his work by listing some of the more questionable sequential bills. All of this is predicated on Dolan being a smart man.Even if one accepts the premise as a cost of doing the movie business, the characters continue to do dumb things. That's all the characters. I thought Annie was asking all those questions to catch the guys on a lie. Instead, she's just talking. Dumb and why add it to the movie? It doesn't change the movie one bit if she never talks to them at that time. Nivens doesn't need to kill anyone if he simply talks to Dolan like a reasonable thief. Dolan is absolved of his crimes without having to do any time. In fact, it would be a great premise if Nivens isn't a clueless evil agent. I won't even get into all the bombs in the last act. This Neeson Taken requires the audience to turn off their brains and if that's possible, this is a good popcorn flick."
154,I never imagined an old codger like liem neeson could still do an action movie lol
155,"This is a disaster of a movie ...They paid for Neesen ,probably had no funds left to pay for decent story)"
156,Movie was as cheesy and boring as the Title suggests. The plot is so one dimensional that you already know the ending 10 minutes into the movie. Liam Neeson as the goody two shoes bank thief just made you want to throw up. There was no twist or thrills of any kind. I have seen handycam movies more interesting. So yes please go ahead and safely avoid this drivel.
157,"The motivation for him is not acceptable. Why when no one knows about you and the money is for bank, you made this miss and a man killed cause of a stupid idia."
158,"I didn't expect much but I was a little disappointed.The story is very weak. While there are movies that are able to build a convicing story around this kafkaesk battle ""man against corruption"" this movie clearly didn't think it through. The corrupt agents ""big plan"" was so amateurish that the viewer never has any doubts that the truth will come out. The writers couldnt even come up with a reason why the FBI should still think that Neeson is the bad guy. So, for most of the movie its just Neeson (ex marine and IQ 300 bankrobber) against one single corrupt dimwhit FBI agent. I wonder who is going to win this...In good ""man against governement"" movies you often times have this single piece of evidence that the main character produces in the last moment and completely turns the ending aorund - thats exciting. This movie couldn't be bothered. In general there was no sense of urgency, Neeson is always ten steps ahead - how does he know where to show up, only the writers know.I can't say the movie is a disaster. Its watchable but its hard to enjoy this combination of bland actors and lazy script. This movie will be forgotten quickly."
159,"Although I usually enjoy Neeson films without fail (you always know what you're getting) I didn't enjoy this one and actually barely hung in for it. The action scenes are stating to show his age with fast cameras turns and angles that accommodate Neeson not really having to do much physically, understandable at 68. The story feels like the writers weren't really up to doing anything more than they really needed to to build out a skeletal story at best. The romantic lines in the movie are cringy and really made you roll your eyes a lot. Had I know how bad it was really going to be I wouldn't have bothered to begin with. Seen it, done it been there in much better action films."
160,"Typical Liam Neeson movie with a very slow start and horrible storyline, give up all the money he stole and not a trace back to him, all for a woman also two FBI agents get greedy and kill people for the money not realistic . It's getting old already. He is getting away from hand combat, not even a single punch in this movie to just bullets and missing targets LoL"
161,"Really not very good. It seems that Liam Neeson is in danger of joining the Bruce Willis and Nicholas Cage Career Twilight Cash Club. Don't get me wrong, Neeson is as dependable as ever in terms of his performance but really, what possible reason other than his bank balance would encourage him to get out of bed in the morning to shoot this drivel?2020 has been an annus horribilis for movie output. Honest Thief does nothing to make it any better!"
162,"Almost watchable if you don't think too hard about the hundred easier, more intelligent and lower risk ways to return 9 million dollars and send yourself to jail."
163,"You couldn't possibly write a spoiler for this because you see everything in the trailer. Bank robber wants to turn himself in because he's in love. How nauseating. Good cop/bad cops, and I'm guessing there is a big shootout at the end. I'm guessing the Liam makes it out OK so that he can go on to make more 1-star movies.Yet another revenge movie. Isn't revenge a dish better served cold? Then why does Liam plate up about four of these miserable dishes every year?"
164,"I like many of the actors in this, Liam Neeson, Jai Courtney and Jeffrey Donovan, so this was a must see for me. At times suspenseful, the story line is a bit preposterous in an ""only in a Hollywood movie"" type way, but the cast does there best to make it believable. Do they succeed, well not quite. Still it has it's moments, is exciting at times, just never rises to the level of being great or even memorable. The action sequences seem to be separated by a little too much drama and a love story that was at best lukewarm. It's Jeffrey Donovan and Anthony Ramos who really shine in their smaller roles while Neeson and Courtney could probably play these roles in their sleep. With a little more excitement or maybe a few twists this would have been better but as it is, it's just your generic thriller that takes a little too long to get going."
165,Predictable from the beginning to the end. I think I need to start writing scripts to give Liam new ideas.
166,"Stupid Thief would be a better title.
Aside from that Liam Neeson showed again what great actor he is.
Action packed movie from start to finish.
Great stunts and filming."
167,Lovely movie that gets straight to the point without wasting any time. Good action sequences with lovely sounds from explosions. Liam Neeson is getting a bit older for these kinda movies but still does his best to perform. Was a bit short but fun to watch.
168,"Not epic, but really enjoyable if you are a fan of this genre. And just so you know what genre I'm talking about, it's 'Liam Neeson', under 'Action'.Movie's kinda sweet or naive I would say, but still has that action that makes me love this guy's movies.There are a couple of minor plot twists, but nothing major. That's why it's a solid 7 for me, i. e. if you are a fan of his movies.Really enjoyed it :)."
169,"One hell of a joy ride and Liam Neeson as usual, his very best! This is action packed with great background music and thank goodness it wasn't any shaky camera production. Thoroughly enjoyed this! Goes without saying that when Liam says ""I'm coming for you!"", you're watching the right Liam movie!Certainly recommend this for those who love action thrillers!"
170,"I've to say, I like Jeffrey Donovan to be an agent again in the screen, you know ""Michael Westen""."
171,"If this movie was trying to be serious, a comedy, or both.There were times I was enjoying the action and the interesting angle of a bank robber doing the right thing for love. Liam is Liam, and I enjoyed Jai Courtney a lot, too. I believe he has the makings and presence of a great villain in future movies.Then I would laugh at the cliche, amateur dialogue and the multiple, inane dog scenes peppered throughout the movie. Then I laughed even more at the multiple plot holes committed by the keystone cops, I mean, FBI agents as they improvised their ""plan"" to steal the $9 mill from a bank robber. I short, it just wasn't believable in any way.Again, is it a serious movie or a comedy? I suppose it's both, because it had me somewhat entertained in a very perplexed sort of way."
172,"I was out with my friends and saw this in the theater and at first thought ""ohh not another cliche boring and repeated action"" but I was pleased to find out it had a decent love interest, objective and twist to the story.The acting is decent and liam is a good guy to root for. All other supporting roles are also good but not Oscar winning. although there are quite a few cheesy lines and really questionable choices at times that make you shake your head.The story was the best part imo. It has good twists in it is interesting enough to follow. I love the relationship between the main duo and the cat and mouse chase it has. I will say that him giving away 9m, the woman not getting the tape in time and the fact that he had to give himself up even though there was no evidence of who did the crime is extremely poor writing and is what is holding back this film.Overall I would suggest this as it was a fun watch that has a nice love story and villains. It's not perfect but worth a watch. 6.6/10 for me"
173,"Okay, he is another film where Liam Neeson doesn't kill anybody, but then again that is probably something to do with his character, namely that he has met this really nice woman so he has decided that he will give up his life of crime and go straight. Yeah, he's a bank robber, but one that sneaks in, blows the safe, takes all the money, and then leaves without anybody knowing that he was there. However, because he has met this really nice woman, he realises that it is time to go straight and decides to hand himself in.Well, that's actually the problem because it seems like he isn't the only person who is trying to claim to be this particular bandit, and the FBI really doesn't seem to be all that interested in following this lead up, so the guys in charge of the case send it to a couple of underlings to deal with. What ends up happening, when they discover that he's telling the truth, and that he actually has all of the money, they decide to keep it for themselves, and when it looks like they are going to get busted, they basically shoot the agent in charge.This movie was okay, but it really wasn't anything that stood out. Then again, it probably had more to do with it dealing with this FBI agent that decided that he would take some money and run, and then started realising that he had got way over his head, and pretty much had to keep on covering his tracks, and the more he tries to cover his tracks, the deeper the hole he ends up digging for himself.Look, if it was anybody other than Liam Neeson's character, he would have probably gotten away with it, but then again he probably wouldn't have gotten that much money either. However, it sort of does touch on the idea that it is difficult to commit a crime and get away with it, though I guess that is sort of wishful thinking considering that there are a lot of people out there that do seem to get away with some pretty dodgy stuff (the protagonist included, who has pretty much got away with all of his bank robberies, until he decides to turn himself in).There is also a suggestion here about the adrenaline rush that comes about through war, which is one of the reasons why he is a bank robber - it gives him a rush. This is why he also hasn't actually spent any of the money. In fact, he simply leaves it sitting in crates in a storage facility (though where he got all of his other money from is a bit of a mystery, though he does say that he saved up some money from his time in the military).Look, it isn't too bad, and it is something of a touchy feely film as well, but on the other hand, it is sort of average. Still, I liked it though."
174,Outrageous plot and story but watchable due to Liam playing his action man role again. He must have the greatest voice in acting currently. Just a decent action movie vehicle for Liam and shouldnt be taken to seriously. Popcorn movie watch it for what it is. Just nice to get out to the cinema again.
