0,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."
1,"I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you."
2,"The first 23 minutes of this film is rated at a 12.My good friend and I took our sons, 17 at the time, to see this in a theater. I am a senior military officer who experienced combat in 1967 - 68 - 69. We wanted the boys to see the horror of war, the slaughter.I have had to pack up the personal effects of my comrade to send back to his mother after he was killed in the Viet Nam war. Those of you who have not done this cannot even comprehend.After the opening combat scenes the film was an 8. Well done.War is hell and to those of us who have been there ... well I don't know what to say.Neither of our sons joined the military ... thank God."
3,"Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it."
4,"I'd heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it. I'd heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down. I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What ""Saving Private Ryan"" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience."
5,"I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me.  That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain.  Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else.  Simply amazing.  An all time great."
6,"To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in."
7,"It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine."
8,"It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way."
9,21 years ago this movie was released and I finally watched it in 2019. I really struggled to watch and I cried and I wept through most of the movie. I did two tours in Nam. This movie was like being back in country. I will never watch it again. It's just eats my guts out.
10,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.
11,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."
12,"The opening beach assault sequences were the most violent, realistic, and upsetting filming I've ever seen; looked as though the thing was actual combat footage. The shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all. Perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises. A must see."
13,"Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach No one was prepared for how horrific it really was No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosionsYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go through Within that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it doneThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer It's one of the most intimate It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatlyToward the middle, a German soldier called ""Steamboat Willie"" is introduced By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant"
14,"During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed.  In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie  when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film  why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc.  Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be."
15,"This movie is so powerful. I couldn't watch it without crying, jumping, gasping, screaming, laughing, and cringing. It brought you through a whole array of emotion.I couldn't help but give my entire being over to each character as a stunning performance was drawn by each actor. Simply amazing. I can't describe it any other way.Easily the best war film I've seen. None was more realistic... Amazing amazing amazing.Recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.LOVED IT!"
16,".............................................,..............from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLNumbing shockon a cellular levelmotivated me to return to the theater a week later, to experience it again. I was not in the least disappointed. Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions! In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2½ hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence. RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#33-IMDb Top 250 today), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only ""shades of gray"" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of on screen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie""Just watch, eventually you will understand! Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise ChamianIf the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel badshe did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian!(Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of Americabut RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion) The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever! To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre labelThis is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see! To those of you who have seen it once or twice, but who haven't in years.Please give it another lookYou won't be disappointed in the leastRYAN only gets better with each viewing! 10*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!"
17,"An amazing and compelling insight to warfare. Umbelievable camera shots/angles bring World War 2 to life especially for the US troops on D-Day. The use of flash bullets, and color saturation just add to the effect of a killing ground that not many people survive to come back from."
18,"I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold. This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war. And whenever I go to visit Washington D.C., I have more American pride then ever. I am more than proud to give this movie a10/10"
19,"Together with ""Schindler's List (1993) and ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like ""Platoon"" it gives the viewer an ""in the trenches"" experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom."
20,"Saving Private Ryan is a military movie based during World War II. The movie starts with the invasion of Normandy at what is now known as D Day. Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks, leads his troops onto the beaches of Normandy against the Germans. Once they are able to take the beach, they learn of story of Private James Ryan. James and his other four brothers are scattered throughout Europe battling in World War II. The United States Headquarters learns that all of James's brothers have been killed in action, leaving James the only sibling to survive. The United States Military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action. In a plot to give his mother some type of comfort, the Military sends Captain Miller and his troops on a hunt to find Private Ryan and tell him what had happened and to get him back home.The theme of the film is courage. Throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end. The soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from World War II and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach. After they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find Private Ryan. They had to search throughout Europe to find Ryan while going through several battles and their own battles with each other. They lost many men including Corporal Caparzo. All of those men lost, just so that they could get Private Ryan and send him home to his mother.Lighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer, and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life. When Caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark, it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog. The surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there. The sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in. It makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if that's how it really was.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best military movies of all time. The courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic. They made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in World War II. This movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom."
21,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, you see an elderly man (Whose identity is not revealed until the end), standing at a headstone, in tears. Why? You soon understand the story as we go back in time.It is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach. And it is INCREDIBLY bloody. Soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).This is not an easy mission. Every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns)believes that Pvt. Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. It is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film: will their sacrifice make a difference? By taking a stand to defend the bridge, the answer is obvious: yes.The performances of the actors are powerful; Including Hanks, Burns and Damon, you have Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies. John Williams, who always works well with Spielberg, provides a powerful score. The battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history (And is not for the squeamish). It is a very moving film, and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it."
22,"I guess I just do not like war movies.
I understand Spielberg did this to show a Jewish character and Jewish headstone, but regardless it dragged out."
23,"Saving Private Ryan is a top WWII film and I've seen it a dozen times. As the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. Suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the D-Day Assualt. In the assualt, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his platoon up and around the German lines for a flank attack. Across the ocean, a mother receives three KIA letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) will be found in France and sent home. On the Normandy beach, Captain Miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across France to find Private Ryan and battle across the German lines. Through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.Steven Spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. Tom Hanks is strong, smart and above all good as Captain Miller. There is also a surprise with one of Vin Diesel's first roles as Private Caparzo. The violence is brutal, bloody, and well crafted. Each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.Saving Private Ryan. Starring: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edwards Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, and Matt Damon.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars"
24,"Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like ""proud to be an American"" or ""part of American History"" or ""every American should see this movie"".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  ""The Bridge"" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be ""good"" or ""best""? ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with ""Schindler's List"", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality."
25,Should have cut it off after 90 minutes. Too many scenes about how we are good and they are bad. OK got it. Watch Saving Ryan's Privates instead.
26,"D-Day. Operation Overlord. What we say here cannot do justice to what they did on that day. Tom Hanks and his patrol must recover Private James Ryan before his mother gets her fourth flag delivered by an Army chaplain. It all makes perfect, illogical sense to kill many to save one. After surviving the Normandy landing, Hanks is volunteered to put his men in the line of fire again and again. Just to save one man. Or is it?A bridge is saved, a town is secured, a bigger battle is won..All because Hanks saved one shoe for one horse...Beautifully realistic to make the atrocities of war invade, assault, and overpower all five senses. You feel the bullets whizzing past your head. You see the man looking for his arm after it was blown off is shoulder. You smell the burning hatred for the Nazis as one US soldier yells to his comrades ""Don't shoot them..let them burn."" It is too much to watch..but you have to see it."
27,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else."
28,"This is truly the best war movie i've ever seen!!! Eerytime I watch it I cannot stop crying, I get goosebumps only by thinking of it; what makes it so special is that ""Private Ryan"" seems to have learned the lesson: ""EARN THIS!"", it seems that he truly respected a dying man's wish. About the scenes in the movie, I played the computer game ""Medal of Honor - Allied Assault"" and I was surprised to see a lot of the movie scenes in the game (Normandy, Sniper city - Caparzo, The bridge) or vice versa. I don't have to tell you that MOHAA is my favorite Computer game ever. All the respect to the genius of Steven Spielberg (I mean it's like he was there)Bottom line: if you haven't seen it yet, YOUR GREAT LOSS"
29,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed."
30,"War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is ""Saving Private Ryan"". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (""Paths of Glory"") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (""The Enemy Below""). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (""The Longest Day""). This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Among the most obvious:A sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns, which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry, driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of anti-tank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older second-tier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.So just what is ""Saving Private Ryan""? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the ""Longest Day"" whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistake-ridden, choppy, and contrived remake of ""The Big Red One"". Ultimately, this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than ""Kelly's Heroes""- a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. Then there is the finale, a total rip-off of Arthur Pohl's ""The Bridge"" (1949), which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan, most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost (that is not particularly unusual), but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting post-war portrayals (such as ""Das Boot"" and ""Cross of Iron"") of the German soldier as something more than the sub- human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series. The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim, this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized (and unexamined) by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema, where McCarthy-paralyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements, away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releaseAlthough ""Saving Private Ryan was popular, remember that the ""Rat Patrol"" ran for 58 episodes, watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
31,"i first saw this movie on T.V. one night with my father, but only saw bits and pieces. I decided to rent it one night and watched the whole thing in my basement. From the start to the finish i thoroughly enjoyed the movie.i had seen a couple other world war two movies, but none of them compared to this. it was interesting how Spielberg made everything look like it was back then, with the costumes, weapons and scenery!!! overall, this movie seemed like one of the best out there, and i personally think it's spielbergs best. If you haven't seen it yet, then i HIGHLY recommend you go out and rent it some time. It's a great movie and definitely worth watching!"
32,"I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many Hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done."
33,"Up until this day, there had never been a time where I was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie. Never. Then, I saw Saving Private Ryan. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen.Saving Private Ryan is a very accurate presentation of World War 2. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Spielburg's camera-work, which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier. I felt like I was running along the beaches of Normandy. I felt like I was with them in the final battle (won't reveal specifics). That's how good it was! Now, even though this movie is really good, it is not for the faint of heart. The first scene of this movie (D-Day) contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. They do not hold back on the violence. So, unless you think you can handle it, I would not recommend seeing this movie, because it does have some very disturbing moments. Another thing they do not hold back on is swearing. If soldiers shouting out the f-word constantly doesn't appeal to you, then you might want to skip this movie.Besides all of that, this is a great film! I can't think of anything wrong with it at all. I would definitely recommend this movie (if you can handle the gore and language)."
34,"I really liked this movie ! the realism was extreme, what is, I think a good thing. I do not like Spielberg (since i was 14-15 yrs old anyway). I think this guy would be better in doing commercials for TV than making movie - just my humble opinion. But if we forget some flaws the movie is pretty good ! T. Hanks was also very good in it ! he got my respect.now, some stuff was bothering :near the beginning, why spielberg was making the little french girl say "" i don't like those american soldiers ! -sob- "" Are those US dudes will stop one day to think that the french are genetically antiamerican ? that's ridiculous ! I hate set ideas !The german soldiers look dumb and wanting very eagerly take some US slug in the map ! Come on, guys ! The germans are just there to be shooted, they act stupidly what cost them their life, they have no survivng instinct ... i don't buy it !The landing scene seemed ended a little too fast and easily to match the reality i think (IMHO)Of course, there may be a little too much US patriotism for the average european viewer, we are not used to it anymore in our countries (self-glorification, i mean) but after all it's an american movie and they did change the fate of Europe and the world, so ... let them do it.anyway good movie, i give it a 8/10.= you should at least see it once ! >"
35,"I remember when I first went to see this movie. I was 14 and when I was going to turn 17 I was determined to join the army - u know, spend the summer with friends, learn new things, meet new people, and most importantly be a soldier for my country.All that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie. I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: ""So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans"" or ""Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys."" You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies. Still one of my top 5 movies."
36,"...if Spielberg had resisted the urge to tack a big set piece on to the last 30 minutes.Imagine watching the same movie except this time it ends at the point that they catch up with Private Ryan.Up to that point Spielberg had shown such restraint and subtlety it was disappointing to see it had been thrown away for a silly crowd pleaser. The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of war as well as the lives that are wasted in a way that no previous movie had even attempted.The last 30 minutes on the other hand seem to follow the usual approach, glamorising the whole experience with all the usual heroics and bittersweet sentimentality that we have seen in a thousand war movies before.Still having said that, this is still an excellent movie and is well worth watching."
37,"Very good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The acting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film a bit for me.The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war ended.Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of the German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and for a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the Americans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representations.With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of the Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before America even entered the war!The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American POW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end."
38,"Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.""Saving Private Ryan"" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile ""characters"" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD. The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List). The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF pussy - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda."
39,"Visually, the best WW2 movie. In other ways, far from the best. The movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the German soldier and praising the American. A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -""Macgyver/Rambo scene""-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated."
40,"In a historic and artistic context, here's a question that would bother Spielberg if he thought about it for a second: what if there was no such thing as special effects? If we take the special effects from his movies, would they still be great? What, you're waiting for an answer? Just like every Spielberg movie, we find Steve desperately clinging to special effects like a fish to water. Like Bush to oil. Like Uwe Boll to a video game-to-movie conversion (last one is not necessarily bad, by the way).Just like everybody else, I was amazed by the ""realism"" of the first 5 minutes. Once you get past the battle scenes, there's not much to work with. I'm glad people (as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here) are starting to realize this.Let's set aside the absurdity of the ""plot"" (I use 'plot' very loosely). That's just a vehicle; a pretext; an excuse to use special effects (Spielberg's one and only leverage). The main plot is that a mother lost a number of her sons, so the general (or whatever his rank was) thinks she shouldn't lose her last remaining son, Ryan. He reads a letter Abraham Lincoln sent to a mother who went through a similar experience during the civil war. Using musical cues and closeups, Spielberg is not trying to tell us how to feel; he's practically *begging* us to do so. After all, he knows better than anybody that people will - during the course of the movie - realize that the battle scenes aren't that numerous or long, so there better be some story to back the movie up.Since he knows that he's addressing a crowd that made movies like Armageddon and Independence Day box office hits, he (correctly) realized that the script needs to be comprised of one element only: text. So long as the script contained text, it was good enough. And he was right. With enough flash and special effects, he was able to appeal to the idiocy of the average American, a tactic mastered by Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay and their likes.Now, back to the 'plot': once you set it aside, you'll realize that this movie is trying to instill many ideas into the minds of the movie goers. When he shows German soldiers, he shows them from a distance, so by not giving them a face, a human side, he teaches us that it's totally OK to thrill at killing them. Bad German bad! After our heroes free a German, Spielberg makes is very clear that he came back later to kill Tom Hanks. Spielberg is saying: they should've killed him the first time. The only good German is a dead one, apparently. Astonishing dishonesty and malice on the part of Spielberg. Not a trick was a spared to demonize every single one of them.Unlike masters of movie making (a title Spielberg will never come close to) like Scorsese and Coppola, he desperately needs musical cues to tell when to feel sad, fearful, excited, etc. His approach to emotion is so utterly sappy, shallow and downright laughable that it's virtually impossible for him to let the scenes and the story speak for themselves. He must have very clear cues to give the viewers signals. The music is like a slap in the face. Spielberg manifests in moments like ""tell me I lived a good life"", grabs you by the throat and ORDERS you to shed a few tears. Insulting. Pathetic.The only good part in the movie is the whole scene of the mistaken identity, where they realize this whining little weakling crying his eyes out is not the Ryan they wanted. Other than that, and looking at the chutzpah of the musical cues, the absurdity of the plot, the dehumanization of the Germans and the hilarious warfare errors, the movie is only good for another laugh, albeit not one Spielberg was aiming for."
41,"(1/1/2017 Update edited for corrections; written as is.)Of course the first combat sequence was great. But unfortunately, I was considered a sociopath for snickering at a man wandering around to pick up his dismembered arm, while the camera is still shaking on the ground -- it became obvious that Spielberg tries too hard to elicit the emotions from a cynical person like me. I eventually became sick and nauseated at having been forced to watch the ultimately annoying and repetitive guerrilla cinematography, while the violence and mayhem prevails. Is it supposed to depict the reality of war? Maybe yes, but all it does is always impact, impact, impact, and I felt little or no emotion. After the first sequence, SPR stooped for the lowest level -- and I tried to keep awake during some tedious parts, but I ended up snickering and laughing at a few utterly lame and manipulative scenes (Remember Edward Burns' arrogantly stoic character and Tom Hanks' Capt. Miller's speech?). One of the biggest problems with the film is that the audience at first showed disdain for the translator because he's a ""coward"" (why the critics say this in their reviews is beyond me), and then cheered when he shot one of the German soldiers to death just to show his courage -- I found this disturbing. After the final battle, the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax I've ever seen -- from the slowly progressing (and clichéd) morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the U.S. flag waving for another 25 seconds. After I left the theater quietly, I let out intense rib-aching laughter all the way driving home. This is what Mr. Goldman observes as ""phony and manipulative, to serve our Country."" I'm sorry if I sound crude, but I debunk SPR for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with Patch Adams, another worse movie that year.This is my honest opinion -- to observe, dissect and criticize -- and I don't trust the critics anymore, because they went overboard just for the realistic depiction of war violence, calling the movie ""the greatest war movie ever made!"" In truth, older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting (Paths of Glory and The Longest Day) -- despite the fact that they're tame for not being profane and gory.And most importantly, SPR shouldn't be shown in English classes in high schools just as another critically overrated The Clockwork Orange shouldn't. It only serves to desensitize the kids because of the ""war is bad"" propaganda coupled with the U.S.-saluting totalitarianism. The epitome of a double-wham hypocrisy just like the propagandizing Nazi films."
42,"I went to see this film back in 1998 with my father, who is a WWII veteran who happened to serve in the Pacific Theatre, on Iwo Jima. While on line, he struck up a conversation with another veteran who did happen to serve in the European Theatre, and they discussed old times. But near the end of the conversation, my dad said, ""For what? For what?"" Something that still resonates with many WWII vets who are still alive, and saw that war was not the prettified heroics pumped out of the Hollywood studios, but a very real, bloody and bewildering hell, fought by the young and vital, male and female alike.The premise of the film being a young man who has already lost several brothers in the service, being saved by a platoon unknown to him has its basis in fact. During the Second World War, many families had several sons who either enlisted, or were drafted, and went into different military units. The five Sullivan brothers, all of whom were lost during the sinking of the USS Juneau, were the most famously representative of this tragedy, and after the war, the practice of multiple draft recipients from one family was eliminated. Does anyone remember the scene where Private Ryan's mother sees an Army car pulling up to her porch? The serviceman and her local clergyman approach her, and she sinks down, struck by the horrible reality they are about to convey. The terrible simplicity of this is deeply moving.There is also a brief scene in the beginning showing a secretarial pool for the Armed Services, where letters for medals, both posthumous and for the living, were typed and sent to families around the country. My mother worked in one of those pools, and it was not an easy job to deal with day by day.Some have asked - why no British soldiers here? This is an American platoon on the Omaha beachhead, not one of Montgomery's units. The daily dangers and horrors of war are vividly portrayed. The deaths aren't pretty, and some of the characters aren't pretty, but that's the way war is (and was). You were in a unit with all types, from different states, and your common goal was to survive - kill, or be killed. There were gloryboys and cowards, and some are shown here.The only maudlin note (and Spielberg can't seem to resist injecting some sentimentality here) is when the mature Ryan, visiting the military cemetery with his family, stops at the grave of his commanding officer John Miller, and asks in tears, ""Am I a good man?"" In other words - why them, and not me? Why am I here, outliving everyone? It doesn't seem justified to him.There are some terrific performances to take in : Tom Hanks as John Miller, Matt Damon as Pvt. Ryan, Tom Sizemore, and Vin Diesel, to name just a few.The sacrifices of our fathers, uncles, and grandfathers' generation were exemplary. They were the lucky ones who came back to lend their voices to history, and without them, many of us, including myself, would not be here. At the end of the film, I sat there, next to my dad, who was also in tears. I would say, ""God bless them, one and all."""
43,"Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park) deservedly won the Oscar for directing Schindler's List, and he did it again with another World War II film, this time in the battle itself, he was also won the Golden Globe, and was nominated the BAFTA. Basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on Ohama beach with Captain John H. Miller (Oscar BAFTA nominated, and medal for Distinguished Public Service Award (highest US Navy Civilian honour) winning Tom Hanks) and his troops struggling for survival against the Nazi Germans. After surviving this, they are given a special mission that they don't understand the significance of, to find one man and bring him home. They are now on the search for Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), and when they eventually find him, he doesn't know why he is needed to get home. This film may have its annoying chats and breakaways from battle, probably why it's four out of five stars, but this still sticks closer to the truth than fiction. Also starring Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Pvt. Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Pvt. Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Pvt. Stanley Mellish, Vin Diesel as Private Adrian Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as T-4 Medic Irwin Wade, Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Timothy P. Upham, Ted Danson as Captain Fred Hamill and Paul Giamatti as Sergeant Hill. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Makeup, Best Music for John Williams, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!"
44,"Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the ""glorious, morally superior American armed forces"", who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all ""good guys"". This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the ""communist threat"" and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the ""Red Hunt"", which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.It is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the ""best wars film ever"" as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen. Perhaps, instead of giving Spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre, they should go out and rent ""Come and See"" (Russian), The Burmese Harp (1967), Fires on the Plain (1959) or Paths of Glory (1957), truly far superior films to this Hollywood-bastardization and candy treatment of war. There is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at D-Day, according to Spielberg, was in some way just a side show to saving ""Private Ryan"". With such a simplistic statement, it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that 'action, action, action' is equated with 'greatness'. I only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth. While most viewers, who are safely tucked away in their houses, waving American flags and discharging a few tears, saying, ""You German scum! You German scum!"" can truly appreciate blood and guts as ""cinema"" then there is a market for it. After you get through the puerile premise, then you can sit back, have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most cliché-driven rubbish that has ever been produced. The scenes themselves are overdrawn, stolen from previous war films from the 1950's, namely the Longest Day (1962) which was a great film in itself. The beach landing is too long, and it shows only the Americans as ""heroic"" while the Germans are seen as ""evil Hun scum"". Tom Hanks, in his most idiotic and candid self, seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save Private Ryan and in one completely absurd scene, the remaining 15 Americans defeat a battle hardened, superiorly trained SS special unit group with just a few guns. Now, if you know anything about history, then you would know that the SS were not an ""easy group"" to defeat, they were some of the most fanatical and well-trained soldiers of the German Reich but since Spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots, he'll continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines. This is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else, I would suggest watching ""Hell Is for Heroes"" (1962) with Steve McQueen, because it is a lot better and we don't have to be forced to carry an American flag at the end."
45,"The story happened in the Second World War. Private Ryan's three elder brothers were killed in battles. The US army decided to send Ryan back to home to alleviate his mother's pain. Captain Miller accepted the task, though he was not satisfied with it including other members. It was said that Ryan was in German-dominated-France-area. Every team member knew its hardship.The opening battle that happened in Omaha beach was fierce and unforgettable. The similar scenes also occurred in wonderful TV series Band Brothers. When Miller led seven people to execute the mission, that reminded me of The lord of the rings. Of cause the task in TLOTR was more difficult.Life is precious. However a war can easily kill many people. The war is ruthless so that you must be cold-blooded or get killed in battlefield. Peace is really what we should cherish.An excellent thought-provoking war drama. 9/10"
46,"The greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of Normandy, and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.Out there in that beach, Dog Green Sector, Omaha beach, hundreds if not thousands of courageous American soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent. Their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victory.Too many young Americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free. This source of American pride moves me in so many ways. We love the American heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors: the American soldiers.This movie, starring a great American actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of Captain Miller, 2nd Ranger, shows the American attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest American victories in world history. It is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for America and world freedom to win the most important war in history. I will always love America for that.Other fantastic American actors like Vin Diesel and Giovani Ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kind-hearted soldiers in the face of evil, showing all the heroism we can expect from an Army Ranger.All in all this movie is a must-see and it is worth to buy the DVD. The fantastic soundtrack and the emotional flag-waving at the end of the movie make your eyes to water-up. You will never forget this excellent Hollywood production and the wonderful story told will get you speechless for a while."
47,"I will just start off with saying that this is an excellent movie. Tom Hanks' character is superb as he again proves that he is one of the best actors still going today.The direction is magnificent, bravo Steven Spielberg who shows that war is absolutely not glamorous. Spielberg can enthrall audiences like no other.The battle on Omaha beach was powerful ,extraordinary stuff.We start this movie with the attack on Omaha beach, D-day 1944.Captain John.H.Miller(Tom Hanks)leads his regiment up on to the sands meanwhile being bombarded by Nazi gunmen.When Omaha Beach is seized by the American and British forces John is asked to embark on a mission to save a soldier who's three brothers had just died and who now has a ticket home to his grieving mother.John agrees and begins the task of saving Private Ryan all the while his regiment wonder why they must risk their lives to save one man.This is a great movie but very intense and powerful.The battle scenes are superb.A definite must see for any lover of great movies.Go watch this movie one of the best in its genre. 10/10 - Unmissable"
48,"Anyone who disagrees can run their car into a wall at a fatal 150mph. This is the greatest war movie ever made. 10 Reasons why. 1. Great Cast 2. Great Story 3. Great Set Design 4. Great Introduction 5. Great Closing Scene 6. Great Sound Effects 7. Great Realism (People die in war, not everyone lives in this one) 8. Great Score (by John Williams) 9. Great Purpose 10. Because I said so. This movie is so good that I bought the DVD. I don't buy many movies for three reasons. 1. Most movies get boring after you see them twice or more. 2. Rarely is a movie worth the 20 dollars. 3. Only a moron would waste money on a movie he or she would only watch once then throw it in a cabinet for the rest of his or her life. Anyway...this movie rocks, end of story."
49,"Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar. It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his ""real"" film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup). And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all  how could it not?  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil. You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but that setup was disjointed. So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
50,"Even thinking about this film gives me the chills , well,like practically everything Mr. Spielberg has done in his career , lifting the American movie into the cinematic heaven . Hopefully , many movies are still ahead of him , the greatest artist ever, no doubt !There is nothing new to say about Saving Private Ryan , after so many years , except that perhaps it ought to become the must study subject for anyone interested in military history or history as such , because ,friend,it cannot go any gorier than this , that is, any more realistic than this ( watch Rambo 4 , When Trumpets Fade , Windtalkers ). Saving P.R. has somehow created a new genre of films , that is ultra-realistic war movie that transcends anything solely written, in fact , as has always been the case with Mr. Spielberg, literature gets its visual manifestation, where even Shakespeare would pipe down and bow in reverence ! Even 10 is not enough , simply no numerical quality, unit , exists to describe the sheer power of this cinematic experience , not even the designation 'film 'itself can do this ! Angelic, stratospheric , out of this dimension , Mona Lisa in cinema !"
51,"Especially that Joe guy below. There is a big difference between an ordinary German soldier and a Nazi. Ordinary soldiers fought for their country, just like the Americans. They thought it and their lives were in danger, just like the Americans. Many Americans found out their enemy was just like them.Now, people the belonged to the Nazi party, and their own personal military, the SS, were the ones who killed the countless number of Jews.Anyway, this movie was much overrated. It really does demonize the Germans. I mean, my father was one of those men and they suffered as well. All he wanted was for Hitler to die and for the war to end."
52,"I was hoping for an accurate war film for a change (take a look at the Battle of the Bulge for a really bad example). What Spielberg shows us in his Omaha Beach scenes makes me wonderwhich Omaha Beach assault he is trying to portray. Those who know little about the battle (that's almost everyone who's in the theater) probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.Believe me, the 1st and 29th Divisions would have been annihilated if itwere as bad as it's portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon, which they did. I wonder, for example, how wide most viewers think Omaha beach actually was. In the film it looks about a couple hundred yards. It was, in actuality, almost ten miles wide. The timing was also inaccurate - Hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8AM. Nobody made it before 11AM. Another historical error is the implication that the events at Omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches (Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah). That's totally incorrect. Utah Beach, for example, the other US assault beach, took about a dozen casualties - many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action. But the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script. Here we have the US Army sending a squad(a squad!!!) to march straight thru the entire German 7th Army (something two Divisions, with total air superiority couldn't do for weeks), waltz around an area of 300 square miles, and expect to find a guy named Ryan. If they wanted to do any of this nonsense, the Army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning. ""Gliders, what gliders""?  said Spielberg. That's what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesn't know very much about his subject.  A stupid, stupid film. What a waste of $100M or so."
53,"The problem with Saving Pvt Ryan is that is is basically afraudulent portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Every single detail may, for all I know, be authentic for the group portrayed, which I assume was Goranson's Company C, 2nd Rangers. But that company, with one notable exception, experienced the worst that Omaha Beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 0630-0800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (Col Schneider) (6 companies) landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded.  It all depended on where your landing craft touched down (or allowed it to touch down - Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was , Dog Green, but had the sense to order the craft eastward), and Capt Hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes, they didn't crawl up, inch by inch, etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes - very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14,000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves (0630-0800)was not much over 10%, far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disasters,etc. Beside, Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of non-existent eyewitnesses.( It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to ""authenticate"" the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers). Anyone who sees Pvt  Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenes,the rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase : ""Call the 101st on the radio, and tell them to pull Ryan from the line."" That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan, while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then, that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be (I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together - they would never have done that ) the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story, although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait, as is obvious from the casualties taken (approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces ""O"" and ""B"" (60,000 troops))."
54,"The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from ""Come and See"". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it."
55,"Wow I loved this movie. My favorite part was when they stormed the beach on D-Day. Oh also when they hid out in the church that was good and when it was raining and the dude sniped the guy through the scope. Great sound effects and realistic warfare. I felt like I was right there seeing all of it before my very eyes. I also loved the final battle when they needed to protect the bridge. And then they found the German soldier they didn't kill and in the end, they shot him with a pistol. Ahhhh...what a great movie. I recommend this to all people who love to watch an exciting movie.It shows that no man if left behind if they still have the will to live."
56,"So many people loved this film, that I actually rented the DVD to re-watch it. I had originally seen it in a movie theater, during its initial release, and I hated it. The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended."
57,"I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: "" Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man"" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director"
58,"This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with ""Schindler's List."" That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of ""Armageddon"": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.
The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all. So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as ""All quiet on the Western Front"" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a ""real"" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an ""Oscar"" until ""Schindler's List."" That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch ""All quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot."""
59,"when i first saw this saving private ryan, it inspired me so much that i actually wanted to go back in time and invade omaha beach. my point is is that this is without question the best war film ever created. it is also Steven Spielberg's finest work of cinema he has ever created in his career. he does a great job in honoring the veterans of the war. and they deserve it because without them, we wouldn't be here right now. we would have Hitler jr. telling us to turn off the computer and go work and be a slave and whatnot. and its not just that, but the suspense when you can hear the faint sound of the tanks coming to ramelle, and private jackson popping a hot one through the snipers scope (my favorite part). the sorrow and grief you feel when wade slowly stops living. and the feel and sense of pride when the p-51s bust the nazi tanks open and the Germans retreating. upham finally gathers the balls to pull the trigger. this is a movie that i can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. i will never forget about this movie in my life. and if you haven't seen it yet, go see it because it will have a great impact to you no matter who you are."
60,"This movie is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. This movie is hard to look at if you can't stand gory scenes. Tom Hanks plays his role extremely well in this movie. Along with other actors in here such as Matt Damon and Vin Diesel. Spielberg really got the costumes down pretty good. As well as the graphic explosions of the tanks. This is an adventure of Capt. Miller and his crew to save this one pvt., Pvt. Ryan. This movie was made on the 60th Anniverrsery of the invasion of Normandy. So this is the movie to see if you need to see a good WW II movie. Another movie that might be enjoyed if you liked this movie is Schindler's List."
61,"This movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come. Why? Because it helps shows war with real decency. No one would want to watch a movie with only killing, blood and gore. No one really does. This movie manages to let us, the viewers, watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went through.The acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks was at his best yet, with superb realism which he displayed. Good job to others: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burn, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and of course Vin Diessel.The Director: Steven Spielberg directed the best movie he ever made. This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude."
62,"War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed. Instead, he wants to keep on fighting.Apart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses, ""saving private Ryan"" is a thrilling war movie."
63,"""  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN   ""I thought that this Movie was going to be a masterpiece. Topping those great Anti-War films of ""Apocalypse Now"" ""The Boat"" and ""All quiet on the Western Front""But alas!  What am I to expect from America?  The Truth? NEVER!Yet another great, expensive war film, where the Germans fight like Italians,  TOTALLY arrogant to anyone else.  I mean HONESTLY an American flag at the start and at the end.  Showing the American and French flags.  The ENGLISH and CANADIANS DID land on Normandy too.  The only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about Monty.The Germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the Americans in France, but that doesn't matter because they were on the wicked side.This is the kind of film simply made to win another Oscar for Speilbergs already crowded shelf.  Not a ground breacker, not a truthful film. NOT even historically correct!!1.  Radar was a TOTAL secret.  No American privates or captains would have ANY idea of what Radar was.2.  Germans, especially those of the SS, would NEVER be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with Tanks first. It was common military knowledge for both sides.3. The P-51 D mustang, which blows up the Tiger Tanks on the bridge,  were NEVER tank destroyers, they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion.  The only Tank destroyers being employed at that time were BRITISH.  NOT AMERICAN. So of course the Americans would take out this imperfect feature.Frankly, if you're American, you can go get your gun an' feel patriotic once again, as you have done with ""The dirty Dozen"" ""Where Eagles Dare"". If you're not American, avoid this, and stick to ""The Boat"" for your WWII viewing."
64,"This is one of the single worst films I have ever seen.  Spielberg was, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour. The first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it.  I was in the theater and began to ask myself, ""How could Ryan remember the D-Day invasion when in fact he was never there?""Now, honestly, how did Spielberg expect to get away with that one? It was never explained or followed up in any way. Secondly, how did he expect to get away with portraying the Germans as mindless, blood-thirsty grunts?  ""Well they were, weren't they?"" says the blindly patriotic american.  This aspect of the film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the brain-washed americans. Finally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line. This film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting it.  The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence, which sadly enough drew many people to the film. Two thumbs down!"
65,"When I saw this movie in 1998 (in England), it was a big disappointment for me in many ways. As not mentioned here for the first time, the first 20 min of the film are technically impressive. What follows then, is just stupid, one-sided and is - at least from the viewpoint of a German - invidious. I cannot understand that a man with over 50 years of life experience (Steven Spielberg) can make such a stupid film about second world war in 1998, or my explanation is that this man has no character. The second disappointment, perhaps the bigger one, were the reports that in the United States this movie was received with overwhelming applause and ecstatic feelings of patriotism. This is only a film, but it also tells you something about what people really think. Before that, I had thought the Americans were (at least since 50 years) our friends. After this film and especially the reception of the film by the broader audience in the USA (as I had read about it in newspapers and magazines), I thought: they may be our collaborators in many ways, but they are not our friends."
66,"Winning 5 Academy Awards Saving Private Ryan is without doubt one of the greatest war movies of all time. Director Steven Spielberg does an excellent job with this film. The choreography,  film editing, sound, and directing are superb. Specially the D-Day scene, which veterans called a precise re-creation of the real landing on Normandy. Along is the powerful cast of Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and Vin Diesel which makes the movie even better. The greatest war film of all time and one of the best films over all."
67,"I finally made time to see this film, expecting a visceral, emotional experience.  Instead I was (in order) bored, angry, sleepy, and bewildered. Is this the groundbreaking film that everyone was gushing over last year? From all the talk I expected a head-on assault at the beginning of the movie.  What I did see was a heavy-handed and frankly uninteresting battle scene.  From there the movie only got worse.  I didn't care a bit for any of the characters, least of all the Tom Hanks lead and the obnoxious Matt Damon.  While the film looked spectacular, that's all it was: surface. There was no depth whatsoever to any of the characters or situations.  I feel like maybe there is something wrong with me that I don't see what all the orgasmic gushing over this film is about.  Plain old boring."
68,"Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Tom Hanks most magnificent performance. Winner of 5 Oscars and more than 70 other prizes worldwide. Unprecedented true to life combat photography. Dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those American soldiers who died fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. This is THE ultimate depiction of D-Day when the Americans freed western Europe. What a tragic and bleak, yet glorious epic war classic!The story is literally about the rescuing behind enemy lines of an American soldier called Ryan, played by Matt Damon in a small supporting role. Tom Hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers, among which are Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Their journey to find and rescue private Ryan is a long, bleak and bloody one, in which soldiers are normal people with nervous breakdowns who go mental when confronted with so much cruel violence. This is not a gung ho funny action movie, this is how it really could have happened, with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally, when they are in combat.The photography is stunning. Like I have never seen it before. Seen this movie many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography. Even if you might not like the story, which I would find hard to believe, the action photography on itself is worthy of an Oscar, which it deservedly got.The soundtrack is dark and glorious. The sound effects were sonically blasting my ears when the tanks started rolling and the mortar shells were exploding all around. Editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen. I can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made, but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at it's core. This movie touches me profoundly. Only a few times during the last 40 years, have I ever been this fascinated by a war movie. Incredibly impressive!"
69,"The movie is nothing but a dummy package. Under the guise of a feigned authenticity - the construction of unreflecting patriotism, tear-jerking worship of heroes, a naive black-and-white portrayal and a pathetic ""good against evil"" mentality - it does not leave a doubt that only a dead German is a good German. Tom Hanks and the folks gathering around him may do a good job, but still cannot avoid the old cliché: Captain Miller's colorful troop is not much more than the regular bunch of war movie stereotypes who mutate to heroes. Where the Vietnam movies of a Oliver Stone (Platoon) or of a Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket) mercilessly condemn, do Spielberg's shocking pictures justify all committed atrocities in retrospect. Therefore this movie is rather a tribute to the US World War Veterans, than an anti-war movie. An absolution, which illustrates the horrors of war but not its senselessness. All in all, this is a movie we did not need and we could have done very well without it."
70,"It's the World War II era ... and nobody smokes.There's only one person in this movie who opposes war .... his ""cowardice"" winds up costing lives.For a moment, it seems there's ONE nice person in the nation of Germany. The merciful American soldiers let him go.  This turns out to be a huge mistake, as he returns, days later, with a group of his friends to kill them all.  Lesson learned - there is not even ONE reasonably nice German.The movie ends with a salute to the American flag and blasting, inspiring music.Was this movie made for two-year-olds?When it comes to subject matter as complex as war, I think simple-minded movies like this do more harm than good.  I'd recommend a movie written at a more grown-up level."
71,"Saving Private Ryan is an example of a genre of film making that should have died out long ago. Far from being anti war, it is a glorification of war. While the Americans are righteous, the Germans are evil, and Spielberg invites us to enjoy the spectacle of their death. German prisoners should be murdered, (or else they will come back and kill you, so do it to them first)."
72,"I wish I could view this movie like the average moviegoer. In that case, I would probably have given it higher marks. However, I was in the Army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely, no, impossible, to have been said in real life.The hierarchy in the service is very clear: privates do not contradict, interrupt, defy, or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film. I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy. The scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he is searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with Matt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believe.The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against shooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some of the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45 caliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate. The scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his .45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle. The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also didn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome weapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short volley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest of the GIs after that.The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs curse up a storm. These guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome. Platoon gave a much more accurate account of how GIs actually behave.These criticisms aside, the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer."
73,"Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off  his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st  and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision."
74,"I was looking forward to seeing Saving Private Ryan.  I had heard many reviews that called it one of the greatest war movies ever made.  I was not expecting to see something as poorly put together as this movie was.  From the begining I found myself wanting to scream at the screen.  I must admit the acting was good, but they had little to work with.
Just about every other aspect of the film fails.  It manages to portray D-Day as the smallest battle I've ever seen.  Basically, the goal was two machine gun posts.  Sorry, but that battle was not realistic at all and was intentionally bloodwashed worst than the Friday the 13th movies.  The film is loaded with mistakes including the rediculous helmet rank insignia. They knew better because they told someone not to salute Hanks because it might give away his rank.  Then they put bars on his helmet!  Structurally, the movie was a disaster.  It was supposed to be about the irony of many men dying for one man.  In the end, though it turns into the defense of a bridge and the main plot is almost totally forgotten.  The soldiers are stupid. They have to defend or destroy a bridge, but don't leave the detonator wired up and someone (who should have been Ryan) to blow it as a last resort? Every war cliche in the book gets dropped into this film.  ""Save my child"", the wounded soldier just out of reach, the sharpshooter who never misses, ""I'm not leaving my buddies"", etc.  They are all there.  Did they have to end the the waiving of the flag?The movie does not feel like WWII, but rather feels like Vietnam.  Lots of mud and rain, ""what are we doing here"", a bungling military command.  One of the most successful engagements in military history is portrayed as a confused, poorly planned mess.The movie is absolutely loaded with red herrings.  Hank's hand problem has no bearing on the plot and is not present when it might cause a problem. They fight a machine-gun nest for no real reason other than it provided a fight scene.  Was I the only one to notice that all of the towns were destroyed before we even got to them?  Didn't France surrender?  The climactic battle is sure to be lost, but is won when air support arrives. Of course, they did not call for the air support.  Can you say ""Deus ex machina""?  Did we have precision guided tank bombs in WWII?  Did our protagonists really have anything to do with the outcome?I was shocked that this movie was not ripped apart in reviews.  It has everything possible wrong with it.  Is it now unpatriotic to indicate divel when you see it wrapped with an American flag?"
75,"You have to love a war movie, which just like 'Goonies' is based around a serious of characters, all of which have one defining characteristic, and go on a quest, finding out who they are along the way.As 'Goonies' had the fat kid, the Asian genius, the smart-arse; 'Ryan' has the religious guy, the cowardly guy, and smart-arse, among others. As the 'Goonies' fought impossible odds, so too do the American soldiers of the 'Ryan' cast.And WWII is seen as it really happened, with the Heroic American's fighting for the cause of good single-handedly, against those crazy Germans! Canadian's, British, French, and even Commonwealth soldiers don't feature on this Western front. And nor would they, with this being an American film starring Tom Hanks, they should be neglected from such ""history"". There's only room for the central character's and there quest for flag waving glory!When this film was first released it was sold as being so accurate it was a history lesson within a piece of entertainment. But blood and guts don't make for accuracy. And American's, for whom this was meant only saw war as a glorious celebration of the stars-n-stripes. To this day, America has used WWII not as a warning, but as a starting point. Lost in this film was the supposed anti-war message, with nationalism the resounding lesson that this filth passed onto it's American viewers. George W. Bush must surely love this piece of violent film making at it's worst.Forget about this Goonies rip, and just check out the original, it's far less offensive, and a lot more entertaining."
76,"What a piece of trash, if you want to see a war movie that is good see Thin Red Line.  SPR is poorly acted, the cinematography is below average and the entire movie is flawed with inaccurate and misleading information.  This movie is an example of what is wrong with Hollywood and the way big studio movies are made, thier #1 objective is to make money off the movie at any cost even if that means turning out a piece of garbage that leads the public to believe this is the best out there, when in fact the opposite is true."
77,"The genius of Steven Spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience, and then takes them there. If he wants to tug at our heartstrings, he'll make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque. If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White. And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close."
78,"Lame, revisionist crap. What the hell kind of squad does no recon, talks out loud, and stays bunched together? Also, many of the weapons (esp. the German M 60)are improperly, and fantastically used. How can you use a sniper scope out of the box, with no sighting in? Idiotic. Spielbergs enthusiastic portrayal of the murder of German prisoners is disturbing in the extreme."
79,"One of the most crucial things to get right is war movies or documentaries, if you get it wrong and forget soldiers that died in that war then that's what people will interpret when they see the movie if they don't know any better and that erase the memories of the soldiers that died in that war.Saving Private Ryan did exactly that and sadly it's not an accident either, they meant to replace those british waterduck operators with american ones and it isn't exactly the first time they try to reap all the glory through movies.After such a tragic and selfish decision i can not give the movie more than a 8, it's not a realistic war movie if it thinks its acceptable to forget soldiers that died for their country, it's criminal.I'm not british but had i been i probably would have sued for twisting the truth to their own favour. You can not take any liberties whatsoever with wars, you must get it right or refrain from making them entirely."
80,"This is for those, who think SPR is realistic.DDay happened on 20m-s and under 15 minutes! Oh yeah! The US government is so kind that they risk 8 guys for only one. This 8 breaks trough German defense lines. Every German soldier, who fought in the war were an evil Nazi, who couldn't aim, and ran into every single American bullet! The only one, they let to go is a bad Nazi SS Soldat who is hungry for revenge! Medics are used in frontal attacks against an MG! Americans are able to shoot into Tiger Tanks and throw grenades into them. SS surrenders to a small little guy who couldn't even hold his weapon properly! This movie is truly over-hyped made for the Americans as a propaganda! If I would be an American i would rate this movie 10/10! But i'm not... Beautiful photographics though, but this won't save the movie.10/1"
81,"It may not be the MOST overrated, but it's certainly up there along with Scream and Fargo and There's Something About Mary.Oh what a battle scene - the fantastic motion sickness inducing cinematography, the masterfully overhyper editing, the gore, oh the wonderful gore.  And so forth.The Omaha beach landing was quite intense.  It was brutal and affecting. But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes: reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah. Also painfully stereotypical are the characters: we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life, we've got the hardnut sergeant, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the New Yorker, and so forth.  And all the Germans are skinheaded bastards - and by the way, where the hell were the other allied troops?  Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring.  Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome.  The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.Then there's the final battle.  Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator).  Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.5 Oscars?  Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved.  Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world.  Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line.  I suppose the two sound awards are justified.For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now.  This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is.  This can't even be described as the best D-Day/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**.   To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film.  Schindler's List is superior.To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked.  If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave/press stop.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour."
82,"Before I start let me say that this movie was extremely well crafted, pushing the envelope in the technical aspect of filmmaking.This movie was really good if looked at in parts. The opening D-DAY sequence was beautiful. The final battle was also great. There were moments that really grabbed you (the Giovanni Ribisi monologue especially) but the film as a whole makes no sense.It said nothing. It simply contradicted itself over and over agian. The great D-DAY sequence tells us about the insanity of war, and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is. But after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing, the movie goes full circle right into hollywood. The ending attempts to justify all the madness, by saying that it's all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country (as we fade out on the american flag). Mr. Speilberg and company, What exactly are you trying to tell us?NOTE: This movie pales in comparison to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.Although I must say, if it came down to this movie and Shakespeare in love (perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar... oh wait thats titanic), I would have to go with this one."
83,"I think this film is terrible.  The war scenes are gimmicky, especially the flanging, shakey camera work.  Some scenes are outrageously unrealistic, such as when those American soldiers shot the Germans using the mirror. Also, studies have been done showing that only about 1/3 of American troops landing during D-Day fired their rifles.  Not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be.  It's laughable that people call this film ""realistic.""The audience is given very little credit.  The dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission.  It's as though Spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail.It also overused action sequences.  Those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty, excessive scenes of violence.  All in all, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen."
84,"Spielberg just about had it here, at least for the first half hour or so. He looked at the bone-crunching, grisly history of D-day and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality. Then, with his Hollywood sellout lack of vision, Spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy. The 'true' story the film may be based on has some chaplain in France discovering Ryan after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to America so his mother still has one child to work the farm. Or, the story could be straight out of the writer's head but it hardly matters. The premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a half-hour of complete slaughter, the seas red with human blood and gore. We are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over Private Ryan and his family while the assault on Normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives, while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and Hitler's machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass. What romantic rubbish and so typical of Hollywood. And the portrayal of the German prisoner is morally offensive. The German people have never been less human than Americans, even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war.  To portray them as Spielberg does the prisoner, a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake, hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an American chest, is low-brow, hateful stuff. But nobody is going to notice. Believe me. In fact, we love to see the world in black and white, simplistic terms.  Here come the Oscars for Spielberg. Americans (and my own Canadians too) are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves. Capital 'D' Denial reigns supreme, especially at the box-office. Spielberg's big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth. If he'd stayed on the beach at Omaha, he'd have a nine out of ten. Instead, he rates several points less for this updated version of that old T.V. series called Combat. Please see Amy Taubin's review at the following URL. It's much more articulate and generous than mine. http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/film/30taubin.shtml"
85,"Here we have another in the series of Spielberg formula drek.  Mr. S. has stumbled on a great gimmick...  he makes films that may not be disliked because of some taboo or other.  To dislike Schindler's List is to not be sympathetic with the Jews who were killed by Nazis.  To dislike Forrest Gump is to not be properly respectful of retarded people.  Give me a break.  Now we're all supposed to like Saving Private Ryan because if we don't it means we don't understand that war is bad or appreciate the sacrifice made by all the people who died during WW II?  Spare me.Without all the emotional baggage, SPR is an awful movie.  The plot is trite.  The writing labored and formulaic and it in no way justifies the emotional bludgeoning delivered by the opening sequence.I will admit that the opening sequences is probably the most powerful half hour of film ever to be projected on a movie screen.  Spielberg know all the emotional buttons we have and how to push them.  He was a brilliantly manipulative filmmaker 25 years ago and he's only gotten better.  That being said, did Mr. Spielberg forget to actually add a story?  Lots of movies deal with the ugly side of humanity.  The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect example of how to show these things in the context of a riveting story.  I guess the most disappointing aspect of this is that we all know that Spielberg can do better.  He has done better.  He has made some of the greatest American films of all time.  He, of all people, should remember that and remember that every time he makes one of these ponderous abominations he is desecrating the memory of films like Duel and Jaws... and even The Lost World.  It was a far better movie than this.On a scale of 1 to 10.  I gave it a 1 only because there was no zero which was what it really deserved."
86,"After 'Schindler's List' and 'Amistad', Spielberg once again takes us to a dark path in one of his best works, 'Saving Private Ryan' (set during WWII, D-Day). He went through great lengths to make the film historically accurate. Though the movie is fiction, much of it is based on real history. At the same time, he manages to give the film a soul.It is not just historical events, blood, gore, massacre, bomb blasts and firearms, but the viewer genuinely cares about the characters and roots for the platoon section to make it and feels sadness by the horrible death of each soldier. Alongside the director and writer, credit goes to the actors for displaying a brotherhood where these ordinary men, strangers to each other, are brought together by a very unusual circumstance. War can have a dehumanizing effect where people tend to get carried away and conflicts arise between the soldiers. We see the men get more frustrated as their hope slips away every time they think they are near to finding Ryan when reality says otherwise. But, these men cope with it and move on further.In a particular scene when Private Reiben is about to walk away, Miller for the first time reveals his identity. His 'unknown' identity had given rise to a lot of curiosity among his soldiers but upon hearing that he was an ordinary school teacher, Reiben is able to relate to that and he stays. From then on, he sees Miller differently. Likewise with Ryan and Miller and Reiben and Ryan (in one small subtle scene).There are two beautiful scenes: one takes place during a night, when the soldiers are chatting and they end up talking about their mothers. In this scene Wade tells his story as he slowly reveals how he wished he had spent more time with his mother. The next day his brutal death devastates the soldiers fueling their frustration while they are forced to stay in control. Another wonderful scene is when an Edith Piaf song plays on the radio. Upham translates the lyrics and this amuses the soldiers and they are drawn into the song allowing themselves a moment of calmness. It is such scenes that reveal the depth of these strong characters.Tom Hanks arguably leads the cast as Captain Miller who is like the elder brother of the band. This is one of his most restrained performances and he is great. But, his supporting cast members that include: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and especially Giovanni Ribisi are at least equally excellent. Paul Giamatti makes a strong appearance. Even Vin Diesel, whom I normally do not like, shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small role.Spielberg makes remarkable use of Kaminski's cinematography, whether it is long shots, jump cuts or various angles. Kahn's editing is smooth. Williams's soundtrack fits the film. The washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceral.For me it was an overwhelming experience because I was so drawn into it. Many have criticized Spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewer's emotion. Well, I prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a magnificent film. It's one of the best and my favourite of its genre."
87,"""Best war movie of all time"", ""one of my favorites"" and so on...please!The beginning is awesome with amazing action scenes but then what..? It's the usual ""USA saves the world"" with who-would-have-guessed-it heroes and nauseating flag waving and other clichés. I just can't believe that this movie is considered to be the 14th best (or 12th or whatever it is right now...) of all time!?!What's most surprising about Saving Private Ryan is that all the Americans who watched it could get out from the theaters with their big heads. They can't honestly say that this is how they thought WWII was, can they?? All Americans and not a Brit, Frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight.This movie was made for an American crowd and to make money at the box office. Not to make a believable story about D-day.It's supposed to be really emotional when an American gets killed or injured but the Germans are shot down indiscriminately. This is sickening to me! Is an American life worth more than a German? Spielberg seems to think it is..."
88,"I am not as enraptured by this film as so many others seem to be.  I sensed a disturbing hollowness at its center, and I left the theater feeling as if my emotions had been manipulated.  I found it ugly and shabby. Beautifully photographed, though."
89,"OOOOH! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks!  It has to be good! And that is why so many fools actually think this movie is worth something; they were told it was before they ever saw it.  Tom Hanks playing the same character he has in every movie since ""Philidelphia"" sans ""Forrest Gump."" Spielberg trying to make us think this movie is as realistic as they get. Lots of bullets, blood, and heads blowing apart does not mean it qualifies as real.  It can't be real.  We've seen all of these characters in a hundred other movies.  Tough, tobacco chewing sergeant.  Cynical, mouthy private. Even the sniper getting shot through the scope.  Spielberg is ripping of a schlock tom berringer joint.  But look at all the people dying and the young man calling for his mother, this is a good movie.  Yeah right.  Do yourself a favor and rent ""Hell is for Heroes.""  A good movie, although it might be tough for some of you because it is in B&W."
90,"Read dedjim's comments on this movie. His are the best by far. I'm sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie review.This was a great movie about sacrifice, courage, loss, violence, revenge, folly, and most of all the strength of character it took (and takes) to defeat evil. The young people of that time defeated fascism (and later communism). Their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war. This reality explains much about the differences between the generations. Theirs was one of stoicism. The ones that followed were less mature, and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective - I say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bents.This movie is a more accurate ""experience"" of WW2 than most movies made on the subject. My next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humor-filled men I have ever known. He never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated WW2 bomber pilot. But he was. He came from a humble background; was wounded in the war; lost many friends in the war; and met his future wife (Army nurse) during the war. Then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country, he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world. I came to know him better after his death by talking to his family about the experiences he went thru during the turning point in history known as WW2.This movie is a masterpiece made by one of the masters in Hollywood."
91,"Whoa, I have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be anti-american.Now dont get me wrong, the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie. You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.I think part of the problem was my expectation. I was expecting a real anti-war film, one that leaves you thinking, you know, that war is bad. This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of ""All quiet on the Western front"". Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of ""shudder"" Germans)."
92,"I can't be the only person who thinks this is Starship Troopers with the Evil Nazi Scourge standing in for the Bugs.For one, the combat scenes are no more war-is-hell realistic and bloody than Starship Troopers.  It's nice to see protagonists who aren't superhuman, but this is only a (moderately) original take for big budget blockbusters, it's hardly ground breaking cinema.Just as in Starship Troopers, the characters barely qualify as one dimensional, and I can't be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that SPR almost qualifies as a parody.A particular point of interest is that Mr Spielberg's Evil Nazi Scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the Bugs in Starship Troopers.  If you get your knowledge of history from Hollywood (which a lot of people do), then you'd be forgiven for thinking that every single German was a soulless Nazi who deserved to die, and that WWII was just USA vs Japan and Germany.  I do have a fair amount of sympathy for Spielberg's stance, but it's interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930's Nazi anti-Jewish, anti-Romany propaganda.  It's sad but not really surprising that Spielberg's audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the German moviegoers did in the 1930's.The idea for SPR is actually sound, but the implementation is just so overdone that I really can't bring myself to care about any of it, other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history.  If I'm going to watch good-vs-bad fantasy, I'd prefer to stick with Starship Troopers which at least doesn't try to pass itself off as something significant and profound."
93,"The action scenes in this film are superb - gritty, realistic and plain nasty. However, it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flag-waving patriotism. What is the message of this film? That occasionally you find SOMETHING worth fighting and dying for or that it's glorious to die for your country (read Owen for further comments on this)Something else it has led to is a number of American reviewers giving the ""We died to save your a$$es"" speach. This itself is both stupid and untrue - the people who wrote those messages did nothing. America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.
The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end."
94,"Spielberg has once again lost the plot. This was a terrible war movie covering no new ground, but instead recycling the same old war issues in a dull manner. The opening scene was spectacular for five minutes and boring for the next twenty minutes. Enough is enough. In typical Spielster fashion the movie was too long, and the Spielster had way too much money in his budget. I would love to see him use some creative material like his 70's movies such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". How humiliated the Spielster must have felt after comparing the superb ""The Thin Red Line"" next to his babbling mess.Sorry Spielster, 2 out of 10."
95,"I give this movie a four out of ten because the cinematography was good. Other then that it was crap. The acting is terrible especially by Vin Diesel, how the heck did he get that role anyway? The plot was ridiculous and boring, the script was very poorly written and over all I am disappointed in both Tom Hanks and Mr. Spielberg. Now I know Spielberg loves to make movies about that era, of course he was too young for that war and too old for the next one, but hey, he's richer then god, he can exploit anything he wants. The movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy. (best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to rescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat. So almost every man from Hanks' squad dies but eventually Ryan gets saved. The Germans, of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men. In reality the war was fought by a bunch of twenty-somethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into. But the Hanks-Spielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers. So do yourself a favor, skip renting this, pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of B of B. It's a true story based on real heroes of WWII, and the acting is not bad. Thats all. Save your money if you want to see saving private ryan, wait for it to come on ABC."
96,"Director Steven Spielberg's usual homey touch (which infiltrated even ""Schlinder's List"" in its final act) is thankfully in slight evidence here, as WWII soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat. The set-up for the plot is a bit formulaic (and layered with Spielberg's need for romanticism), but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable. Vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won Oscars, as did Spielberg (who deserved it). I was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is, given the feel-good reputations by many of the principals involved. I'm not a lover of this particular movie genre, but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle. *** from ****"
97,"I'm afraid that I hated every moment of this film. Spielburg overused emotional hokum to try to give his film wieght when we actually didn't care whether Private Ryan lived or died. The first twenty minutes, I accept are excellent, but they are just a rip off of someone else's hard work - and frankly I would rather see the original footage from the Second World War rather than the director's interpretation of it. Although it tried to be realistic and historical, it was neither. The history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic. (I imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummie's boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base.) I'd rather watch the notoriously bad, Objective Burma anyday. At least it doesn't pretend to be true."
98,"AMAZING MOVIE EVER!!The first time that I watched this movie was in school and I knew that I HAD to get it for myself! I love the way they had the affects of guns and grenades. I can't wait for my son to be old enough to sit and watch it with me :) I don't think any other movie about war would even come close to Saving Private Ryan. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were a good pair, and would be good to pair up again! I recommend this movie to A LOT of my friends. They come back and tell me that it was remarkable, then they tell other people to watch it. I wish that I could shake Spielberg's hand to say Thank You for making an AWESOME movie and that I'm going to wear out my disc very soon."
99,"I was born 9 years after WW2 finished and my father was a fireman in the midlands area of England during the war. I do not know anybody who was directly involved in any fighting so therefore the only way somebody like me can be educated in what has taken place during any war is with documentaries, books or a realistic portrayal of events in a war film. I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically. I personally thank the director and the entire cast and crew for the result of all their hard work. For anybody out there who has not seen this film please watch it and if possible stop reading this stuff I have written and lob the DVD into the machine and make your own mind up."
100,"I first watched this movie when I was a young'un. It had an impact on me, more than I could have imagined. At that time (I was still a kid then) I wanted to join the Army, because I assumed that I could simply pull out a machine-gun and blast everyone to oblivion. This movie made me see the light. Now that I'm older, and can understand films better, I can fully appreciate the beauty of this film. It's gritty without being gruesome, it's brutally honest without overwhelming you, it's funny while it focuses on the drama; it's just plain brilliant. It deserved every Oscar it got, and more in my opinion. The cinematography alone is to die for.All in all, 11/10."
101,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can watch it over and over again. It also has one of my favorite actors of all time, Tom Hanks. This movie should have been Tom Hanks 5th Oscar but for some reason the 'academy' has some bias against him.Many people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense, realistic capture of the invasion of Normandy beach. In addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets, bombs and screams all around you.Does not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie. It shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides US forces, German forces and by standing citizens.This movie to me was the best film of 1998. Unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive Oscar runs in history. Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Elizabeth and Life is beautiful all competed that year. And as always the Lovey-dovey movies mostly win the Oscar races.Still this movie was so great that it spawned a HBO miniseries that was equally great ""Band of Brothers"".This is my favorite movie from Spielberg."
102,"The first 20 minutes of this film is a brutal glimpse into the violence and complete uselessness of war. We see people getting gunned down, limbs getting blown off, people blown in half, guts everywhere, it is not a pretty sight. It's this, and many other things, that make this one of the greatest war films I've ever seen.Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are sent on a mission to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). Along the way many hardships are faced and overcome between these men.That is pretty much the plot, but the movie is more than plot. It is a journey through World War II's harshness and a journey with these men. We come to care for these men. They aren't given huge amounts of development, but they don't need it. The actors really make us care for these people, as does Steven Spielberg's skillful directing. This is definitely one of his best movies.It is also a lot different. If any of his movies contain violence, there is very little of it. This, however, contains some of the most graphic violence I've ever seen. It truly shows the violence, dirtyness and uselessness of war. It doesn't offer anything but pain and misery. John William's score also creates a very suitable mood.The only reasons I have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end. The American flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and I found it unnecessary.4½/5."
103,"This movie is the greatest war movie ever! Tom Hanks was a perfect captain and Matt Damon was such a great Private Ryan. The beach scene was such a great scene, although it was pretty intense the way that Steven Speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic. Another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didn't know where her forth son was. It made me feel like crying and I'm sure that all the other fans out there felt the same way.The ending is very dramatic, but Steven didn't go overboard. When the old James Ryan almost starts to cry I felt the same way. When Tom Hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie. It was awesomely brilliant, but very sad. That's my basic overview and opinion on ""Saving Private Ryan."" -Ashley"
104,"Saving Private Ryan will probably be remembered as a true classic, the best war movie ever made that presented World War II as good as possible... For those who haven't seen the movie - Run, Run and don't look back, go rent it, and enjoy every minute of it. The movie begins with the well known American invasion to Europe in operation Overlord at the problematic Omaha Beach. Never in filming industry had there been a better war scene, so true, so real, making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion... Spielberg didn't censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood, less dead and less wounded. In fact, this scene, showing zero regards to Human life isn't just to make the viewers feel excited, its true purpose will be understood only later, after watching the film...Following the invasion, Cpt Miller (Tom Hanks) gets another mission - ""straight from the top"" - Rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war. Eight men, rescuing one. After the bloodsheded scene in Omaha, this mission looks rather stupid, one life? is it really worth endangering the lives of eight? Omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes... How is one life that important? Without a doubt, Spielberg didn't randomly choose a mission to base a movie about. This movie isn't just an action film... It has an hidden message, It shows that on the side of war, with so much dead, zero regards for human life we are all still human- those who die at war aren't just soldiers, they're men, with lives, desires, needs - they have names, brothers, sisters - and each and every one of them counts... Omaha is war, it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie - well, thats humanity... Suddenly, one life does count, and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right. Don't get me wrong, the movie is all action. true hardcore action... The rest of the movie, following the invasion, escorts the small squad led by Cpt. Miller as they search for one soldier, Private James Ryan, in occupied France... Endless battle-scenes, action, suspense - actual war... I will stop here without spoiling any part of the film - This movie cant be described in words... Abseloutly amazing... best movie i have ever seen - A MUST SEE! although i doubt any true movie-fan would skip watching this movie..."
105,"Breathtaking. Spectacular. Incredible. Whatever words used to describe this film do no justice to what Spielberg so masterfully created. This movie is the only movie to have left me in awe, in shock, in sadness. On all levels this film was perfect. I do not know how historically accurate it may have been, but I know one thing. This is one of the most memorable films ever made, and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date. I am a proud Canadian citizen, but this film gave me a greater respect for what the Americans were trying to do in Europe. I used to protest the fact that they joined the war late, however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that war.The film truly was an epic, an epic that will leave me to think for some time."
106,"Thank you for taking the time to read this... Spoilers may be with-in.I thought this movie was very, very good. One of the reasons this movie is so incredible is that it has the perfect combination of drama, action, graphic violence, and (my favorite) no sex. The omaha beach seen was so amazing and well shoot i almost cried because i felt like i was there and seeing my friends guts spill onto the sand.I thought it was cool that they used the knife and a mirror to see what was going on. those are just some of the reasons why this movie kicks serious ass. Negitave side: It was too long and some scenes where a little pointless. Like how they got the wrong ryan. But it was still very funny.Favorite scene: Was the scene where the sniper shot the other sniper through the scope and his brains blew out the other side (genius)...Cinematography review: Helped the movie seem much more realistic and helped you feel like you where there. in other words the cinematography Kick major Ass you un-educated morons Who are sick and wrong.the 2 words kick and ass should penitrate your thick skulls.Over all an amazing 4 over 4 or ten over ten."
107,"This film is absolutely the most realistic war movie ever made.  Some people have panned it because it doesn't show enough of the efforts of the other Allied Forces.  It wasn't about the Allied effort, it was about Saving Private Ryan.  Some people even called the Allies the Axis.  How can you take their comments seriously, when they don't know the good guys from the bad guys.  Tom Hanks was remarkable as the Ranger Captain, although it is hard to picture a forty something Captain leading an assault team on D-Day. 10 out of 10."
108,"Yes, I know lots of people regard this film one of the greatest war movies ever made blah, blah, blah, but I personally found it one of the most grotesquely overrated pieces of crap I have suffered through in a long time (as far as World War 2 movies go, only the recent version of ""The Thin Red Line"" was more torturous).  While its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking, I found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself, and during the initial scenes where the Allies were landing at Normandy and getting massacred, I found myself inflamed with feelings of BESTIAL WARLUST and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent and/or gory moments (eg where that troop carrier opens up, only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by German machine gunners).  Once this part of the movie had ended, however, I found the whole thing rapidly getting boring: so much so that, during the violent scene right at the end, I found myself squirming and fidgeting in my seat, wondering when it would all be over.One of this film's main faults is that it doesn't have much of a storyline to speak of and its whole premise (while admittedly based on a real-life incident) seemed rather ridiculous to me.  Stupidly going for the bad guys (as is a habit of mine when watching movies) also didn't help, and I particularly detested all of the overt religiosity in the movie (such as all those highly offensive scenes of cross-kissing, and all those equally nauseating comments by the Americans about how God was on their side in the war (quite frankly, if God exists, I don't think he cares about stuff like this)).  In addition to all of these other faults, the final scene is VILE (last long enough to get to it and you'll hopefully see what I mean).In summary, therefore, A HUNDRED MEGATON THERMONUCLEAR BOMB!"
109,"When I first heard of Saving Private Ryan I was very exited since all my friends said it was an awesome and realistic war film. The truth was far from that. The first 5 minutes of the movie were excellent but it was all downfall after that, since the ""storyline"" doesn't make any sense at all why in god's name would the U.S Army send a small group of Soldiers after a single soldier who is lost possibly behind enemy lines possibly KIA or Captured. The whole operation would be a total waste of men and equipment. Also the Rangers did not operate in such small groups on special missions and the lack of any intelligence of Ryan's whereabouts would make the operation a waste of time, also the Germans don't seem to have any sort of intellgence this kissed good bye to realism alongside the ""10 Dead Germans to 1Dead American"" rule. When an American is hit he dies usually slowly and dramaticly saying something like ""Take this letter to my mother "" etc etc, when the enemy dies quick and is rarely or never injured. The portrayal of the enemy is ridiculous. The enemy doesen't have a face, a personality or any feelings the enemy is just a sadistic and evil killing machine. Saving Private Ryan does not differ from old propaganda films made during and slightly after the war. The reason I gave it a 5 was that it had some decent action in it but movie is overwhelmed with Spielberg's/Americans propaganda. I would not call this movie realistic under any circumstances. In short: Good : -First 5 minutes on the Beach -Some good action scenes Bad: -Propaganda -Pointless Storyline"
110,"When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older)."
111,"I would have given ""Saving Private Ryan"" a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during WWII (they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war). But don't get me wrong: watching the movie, you can literally feel the bullets hitting you. Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters themselves. Aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all Americans out to be good and all Germans out to be bad, the Americans are basically clichés. They're all wholesome, hard-working guys out to make something of themselves. Moreover, there's the wise-guy New Yorker and the cowpoke Southerner, and Pvt. Ryan comes from Iowa (read: America's heartland).But otherwise, it's a very good movie, and it goes to show what an incredible director Steven Spielberg is (although I still wouldn't have given the movie Best Picture; I would have given that to ""Life is Beautiful""). Also starring Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti and Dennis Farina."
112,"**** out of ****
Five years can really put a lot in perspective. At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.The question is: how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre. It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective. Whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably won't reach any satisfying conclusion. Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic. Viewers should at least be open-minded enough to absorb the film's moral quandaries, they're partially the glue that holds the film together.The camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film. There's an equal mix of humor, tension, respect, and pathos between these men. Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler: oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous.  Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality. SPR is no different, there's a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments, but to say it didn't affect me would be a complete lie. I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be."
113,"While this movie has amazing cinematography, acting and costumes and is an immensely heart breaking film, this movie doesn't achieve what it was clearly trying to. The Omaha beach scene will go down as one of the best scenes in cinema (and the part of the film which saved my review from giving it a 2), Saving Private Ryan has countless flaws; it tries to be an anti-war film, and while it does show the suffering of the characters, which gets us to sympathise with them, the impact and focus is taken aways by the patriotism and demonisation of the enemy. I'm not saying that Nazis were good, but that an anti-war film should not have a hero-villain narrative. In the end, the film tells you that war is worth all the lives that are lost in it, therefore putting it straight into the pile of American propaganda films."
114,"I'm A huge War film buff, especially WW2 and this in my opinion is the best of them all.The thing that made this movie great for me was the realism and feelings for the characters. You actually feel for them, which IMO only a few war films seem to bring.The opening scene(Omaha Beach) I would rate up there as one of the greatest scenes in movie history!. The realism, the camera swaying all over the place going in and out of the water, the bullets whizzing past and the screaming. Its just bloody amazing and so full on that it can't be topped!.I have watched this movie countless times and it still never gets old to me.10/10 a memorable movie that is a must see"
115,"From the invasions on Omaha Beach (D-Day), to the final battle in Ramelle, this movie was as action packed and graphic as possible. Anytime Spielberg and Hanks team up, it's pure gold. Especially this time. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire duration of this movie. If you're a war movie fan, I guarantee you that this will make the top of your list. This is as real as war can get on a TV screen. War movies completely changed after this film was released in 1998. It has influenced the film industry as much as any other movie out there. In my opinion, this is Spielberg's best work ever, as well as Hanks. There are so many realistic parts of this movie, it's insane. After all, it is based on a true story. People said that the D-Day scene was so accurate, it might as well had been real. When it comes down to it, this film is one of the most iconic films ever, and arguably the best war movie ever created."
116,"Great movie was made by real Actors and Very Professionals . It Very wealthy Icon that express courage, war , and Sacrifice for good purposes . Each actor in this movie did a good job acting with all their Possibilities . Tom hanks as always did perfect dramatic performance , he succeeded to have our attention throw the war. The motion picture was new to our eyes and graphics was made with great effort , it was quite well .This whole movie was great in writing,Acting and Directing ."
117,"The fact that it didn't win Best Picture is outrageous. It was great from start to finish. The opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional. The music score by John Williams is amazing. That image became the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story of a mission following the D-day invasion. The movie starts Tom Hanks as Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. His mission to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him back to the United States so that it can save the family's bloodline and help softly the mother's grief. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore starts as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. I understand the everyman quality of the average soldier. There were also a lot of actors that you wouldn't have thought for once, playing soldiers as supporting characters such as Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and Paul Giamatti. Who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever. I like how the characters were written with everyday blue-collar Joes. It gives the movie realistic. They are brave while scare. Good, but also bit morally reprehensible. A great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a German Soldier. All of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free. It's toward the middle of the film, that the violence of the film dies down enough, to get a few character development. It was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here. Some people thinks that the movie glorified war or it's over patriotism. I think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war. In movies that glorify war, there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply don't represent the soldiers who fought in war. In Saving Private Ryan, the characters are down-to-earth-ordinary. This movie also shows that in war, there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive. It portrays war as what it is: violent and ugly. As pure hell. As for patriotism, I don't believe that the film is patriotism. There are scenes of American soldiers being as crude, cowardly, or just mean-spirited as some of the German's soldiers. I don't think the Germans are portray unfairly. About the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an American film presented to an American audience. Would it had been nice to see a British soldier in the film? Yes, but it wasn't needed in the film. The film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war, while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got. The film was balance between pro war and anti-war themes. Yes, there were a few historic accurates that wasn't corrected, but overall, many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever. The first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the Normandy Invasion. The visuals are grainy, de-colorized, and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then, and since after Saving Private Ryan, many directors have used for their war films. The audio is astounding, and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film. Exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional, positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings. After this movie came out, I saw an interview with several D-Day survivors. They all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen. It was like they were there again. That is strong praise from someone who would know. Every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film. Show them how it really was. It's not what it is. Overall: It is a must-watch. It's a story of normal, average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it."
118,"From Stephen E. Ambrose's book, 'Band of Brothers,' written in 1992. In Chapter Six, 'Move Out,' Fritz Niland -- a member of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army, lost his brother Bob Niland, who was killed on D-Day. A second brother had been killed on Utah Beach on D-Day. And a third brother was killed, a pilot in the China-Burma-India theater that same week. His mother received all three telegrams on the same day. However, in ""real life"" Fritz was never lost, was immediately located by a Father Sampson, escorted to Utah Beach, and was flown to London, and then back to the States."
119,"There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like ""Patton,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Midway,"" and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience."
120,"To be clear; I like the Normandy beach scene they're actually quite brilliant. But the first and last scenes are those on the cemetery with the old man and his family. Why are those scenes there? They are totally obsolete. I don't need to hear the old man ask his wife if his life was worth it. If the movie itself didn't make this clear then the movie failed and the movie didn't fail.I saw the movie ""A thin red line"" a week earlier, and at first I was disgusted by Saving Private Ryan. It just doesn't have the same weight. But then again, you shouldn't compare these two movies as they are totally different. And when I saw this one a few times at later stages this became clear to me.The story itself is quite simple, and rightfully so. A bunch of soldiers are send to save a last of four brothers. It needs to be simple; it's the little things that make the soldiers so unique. The little stories of Matt Damons, Tom Hanks and other characters make this movie. And the comradery between the men is portrait very good as well. It's not poetic, but men which are fighting (and trying to survive) in an unforgiving war.I don't know, maybe it's just me. I just got a bit of a beef against Steven Spielberg lately. When the plot has been clear he seem to insert several more scenes that explain the plot again and again. He just needs to stop this. It makes the movie unnecessary long and dull. He does this with most of his movies in the last decade. And don't get me wrong, I got nothing against long movies, but the length needs to fit the movie.Just cut the first and last scene and all will be fine."
121,"You both are dim bulbs to say the least. The film is a fictional story and purports to be just that, why people keep holding it to a documentary standard is beyond me. But it's stupid to do that and displays the limited intellect of those like twistedfieldofvision who do just that.Carmad, you are not a writer. And nobody who works in your ward on the psych wing believes your ""I am Shakespeare"" proclamations. I'm sure your equally impotent teen pal who thinks he is Napoleon and occupies the bunk above yours believes you, but consider the source on that one.This film is brilliant and is one of the top 3 movies S.S. ever made. The speech where the General reads Lincoln's letter is touching and very appropriate. WW2 was the moral equivalent of the war to free the slaves. Tom Brokaw labels the fighting allied men of WW2 the GREATEST GENERATION. He is correct. And their humility regarding what they did for mankind's future is part of the reason that label is accurate."
122,To begin I have to admit that this is one of the best war movies ever made. No doubt Tom Hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country. The war scenes are excellent. One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked. Shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because The US has begun other wars in Asia and other sites. So FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THOSE PATRIOT BOYS AND ALL CAPTIAN MILLERS DO NOT RAGE ANOTHER WAR TO KILL AMERICA'S SONS
123,"I was inspired to write this poem after watching ""Saving Private Ryan"".""FREEDOM""They'll make a shrine of this battleground with silent rifles and tilted crowns, and who we were with names and dates and posthumous medals commending our fates.Those who live will be the first to tell in stirring words of our lives in hell, of who we were and how we fought, dying for friends we never forgot.A bugle calls and Taps will sound for those we've laid to rest; heads will bow and hands salute as those we mourn are blessed.Small white crosses are all that's left to show why we were here; we struggled and died for a cause we'll hold forever dear.(c) 2004 by Richard L. Miller"
124,"Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film ""this movie is based on a true story."" It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that."
125,"To ""bob the moo"", this film won many awards and not only did it win them it deserved them too. The reason it focuses on the ""yanks"" (We do not like to be called this) is because that is where and when the script was written. Introducing British characters would have probably interrupted the story line. It isn't fair to the characters that are making there way threw France.Important Thing! I have NOTHING against the British. I thank God for the British. But just know this, if it weren't for the ""YANKS"" steppin in Europe, you guys would have been wiped out! So there you go. Don't hate us because we have a bigger film industry than you guys.Maybe this is an American Film but it has every right to be. It's directed by Steven Spielberg for God's sake! He was ""sir'd"" by your Queen. I suggest Band of Brothers for you. They got lots of ""Brities"" in there.To make PERFECTLY clear, I respect England for its long-term fight in WW1 and WW2. If it weren't for you guys, Hitler would have made his way across the Atlantic. My Great grandfather fought in WW1 and he was British.Sincerely, ""Arbiter89"""
126,War is Hell! This movie rocked. The opening scene of the movie was the best on the Omaha Beach. The action kicked ass and the battles of the entire film was phenomenal but not only that the plot was as great as can be. About Capt. John Miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home. The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!10/10!!!Highly Recommend
127,"Between hobnobbing in Martha's Vinyard, Spielberg has, as we know, been trying to claim the holocaust, slavery, war, and other ethical properties as his (American) own. Now there is an ambition.The message for this film can well be construed as Do What the General Says, Because It's the Right Thing to Do. Feel Good About Agonizing Over This Question, But Do What The General Says (AKA ""shoot and weep""). It's an old (my apologies) Fascist trick. Raise a genuinely important, painful issue, then sooth the pain with a quick, unambiguous appeal to both duty and moral recognition, the split between moral recognition and action here acts as the ethical seal of approval. Would we not all like life to be so simple...Sadly there have been other cases in more recent history where a similarly confident recommendation, Bear the Pain of Pulling that Trigger with Loyal Pride, seem to have landed everyone in serious trouble. History may never repeat itself, but Spielberg is out to prove us wrong.Rating should, perhaps, be, not quite ""1"" for ""awful,"" but rather ""10"" for inducing shock and awe."
128,"This movie is similar to the other Stephen Speilburg productions like ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers."" These productions focus too closely on the individual soldiers sentimental personal problems. Combat strategy and the historical accuracy of wartime is significantly diminished with the ""slice of life"" theme adopted here. Consequently, the poor screen writing matches the ""sentimental"" theme which is out of place for a wartime historical combat production. Saving Private Ryan was made using ideas from ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970)and an episode from ""Amazing Stories"" about D Day (Charlie Sean) and were put together to make a silly war fiction aka Saving Private Ryan. There is a scene in the movie where the squad of soldiers are seen casually walking in farmland of the French countryside near Carentan behind enemy lines (taken from Kelly's Heroes). The casual walk is grossly inaccurate to history. It would have been impossible to stroll in the open French farmland near Carentan as featured in private Ryan because the Germans had sophisticated defense lines or ""belts"" constructed everywhere and where machine gun nests and large caliber guns were often placed at several locations to intercept the same targets which proved very deadly for the allies. The Saving Private Ryan squad would have been spotted and dealt with very quickly. The allies had to use combined operations with tanks, aircraft and artillery to destroy the sophisticated bunkers and dugouts the Germans constructed everywhere. The allies used high explosive shells to destroy enemy bunkers, cluster bombs, and special shells that would burst in the open air to kill soldiers caught in the open.Operation ""Cobra"" scheduled for 24 July 1944 was delayed because of deteriorating weather for 25 July 1944. However, one squadron of US bombers which took off wasn't recalled. General McNair the most senior American General in Normandy and hundreds of US personnel were killed when the squadron bombed too close to the operation Cobra ""start lines."" Saving Private Ryan is a silly wartime fiction movie similar to ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" where there is too much emphasis with the soldiers sentimental personal problems. The combat scenes recreated by Stephen Speilburg are devoid of combat strategy and historical accuracy. The combat scenes in Saving Private Ryan are just slugging matches. I would prefer to have seen Jerry Bruckheimers productions of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brother"" and ""The Pacific."""
129,"Easily the worst movie ever made about World War II and the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, Spielberg has taken the heroic story of the 5 Sullivan Brothers who lost their lives in the Pacific, renamed them Ryan, moved them to Europe, and turned them into cry-babies. Spielberg has said on TV that he never understood why America had to fight World War II to begin with, and this movie proves it. The infamous ""first 20 minutes"" -- was touted as a super-realistic hardline look at the horrors of combat. Hint: Look elsewhere, such as in Mel Gibson's outstandingly raw combat scenes in ""We Were Soldiers."" Spielberg's opening combat scenes are a dreadful special effects show, and any viewer involvement falls flat for lack of either character development or contact with Earth. When fighting a war, it's better to not send cowards or airheads to do a man's job. The same can be said for making movies about war. Spielberg ought to have evolved into a grown-up at his age, but so far he's just devoid of character and backbone. This is sadly reflected in this dreadful unpatriotic movie."
130,"I try to understand why people like this movie besides the realistic gore. I can't figure it out the story was not good at all in any way. also it makes the enemies seem heartless and idolizes america. What also makes me mad is the people who say it is the best war movie ever. I could name so many more that are better like the thin red line, paths to glory, glory, ran, Dr. Strangelove, lawrence of Arabia, the deer hunter, das boot, the killing fields, brave heart, stalag 17, and in my opinion the greatest apocalypse now. Those are just a few I don't want to name them all because it would take to long."
131,"Considered by many to be a fantastic film, I feel I must have missed something. This film is certainly a good film by any standards. (The camera work is well done, backdrops are excellent and the opening scene on the beaches of Normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema history) But the film does suffer from a couple of failings.Firstly, it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic. The film beings and ends with the American flag, and the in fact, the Americans appear to be the only people in the film. The only appearances from other nationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a back-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough diamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a tear-jerking moment of sadness.Secondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat silly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks. I really don't understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousness.In conclusion, I'd say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the movie was switched off. None the less, I would recommend viewing this film, as its qualities do outshine the flaws."
132,"Saving Private Ryan has to be one of the greatest films of all time and is personally my favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg has captured war as it really is. All detail is considered to make this movie one of the most, if not the most accurate war film ever created. The actors performances are brilliant especially that of Tom Hanks. This movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture. After watching this film I have now gained a greater knowledge of what war really consists of and therefore gained a greater respect for those veterans who served during D-Day especially and in general WWII. I would very much recommend it to anyone. One of Spielbergs best."
133,"No movie will ever stand up to the ranks over Saving Private Ryan. Just wow. Thats really all I can say. Flawless special affects, definitely look real. No other war movie goes into this much detail to a battle scene. I can feel for the souls of those lost, and sorrow for that poor guy with intestines hanging out screaming, ''Momma!'' You think thats so typical, but what would you scream when you were in his position? ''Crayola Crayons! Ahhhhhh!'' But seriously I sat on my couch staring at the screen 5 minutes after the credits were over. Shocked that the main character was killed. But I liked it. Mostly everyone died trying to save PVT. Ryan except wimpy clumsy Umpham (sp?) and Reiben which was a little surprising but made sense. The only flaw is that if you were a Captain in the US Army you would NOT blindfold the enemy and have him walk to somebody finds him. 1) He could slip the blindfold off and run in the direction of a German platoon. 2) He may come back to haunt you.And if you just go out there and buy the movie (worth every penny, simply a classic!) and watch it you'll know what I mean. Thats the only flaw I know of, but it does'nt hurt the way I feel about the movie. I just get this vibe that everything that happened in the movie just feels right, and is perfect the way it unfolded. Saving Private Ryan will remain in my heart forever. As well as millions of other. This is Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks at their best. (and everyone else who had to do with the slightest bit of this movie."
134,"This was one of the first war movies that i've seen, and it has to be one of the best. Steven Spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece. The movie is accurate,although there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is. From the beginning of the film, Spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on Omaha beach, a view of the whole allied advance on Normandy, once the Axis trenches and bunkers have been taken. The way Spielberg captivates each character within one another, and yet be different from one another is superb. I think Steve Spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship, which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers. The cinematography has to be credited, and the background music is fitting for such a film, thats why i gave it 10."
135,"Any movie that opens with a lengthy shot of the American flag has got problems.In general, I thought it superficial, poorly written and poorly directed. Spielberg has a penchant for thrusting his movies upon his viewers, spoon -feeding them morality in doses of banal righteousness. I personally don't go to the movies to be treated like a schoolkid and taught a lesson so elementary, vague, and though ultimately true, trite.Those who see Saving Private Ryan as a revelatory view of war obviously slept through High School History. War is gruesome, war isn't fun, war sucks. Glad to see the truth Spielberg, but dizzying freehand camera shots, pointless music (the music sucked throughout), and timed successions of loud booms gave me more of a headache than visceral enlightenment. About 5 minutes into the D-Day scene, when the cacophony of camera shots and dead bodies reached its apogee, I asked myself:  ""Why did Spielberg put this in? Did he have any real reason except to embellish the gruesomeness of war? Does this really contribute to the movie?"" I found the answer to be no.Then there's the plot and characters ... wait, what plot and characters? Here are 8(?) men meandering through French territory wondering why they are all such damn stereotypical and superficial characters. There's the bookworm, the Italian, the Southerner, the Jew, etc. In the end I can't feel very much for any of these characters  cause they're not even human to me; they're typecasts. Even Tom Hanks (who does a worthy job), remains distant and emotionally inaccessible (due to poor writing). (So we know that his hand shakes and he teaches English. BFD) Spielberg could take a lesson from, say, John Sayles, about character development.Then there's the plot. From the title, I expected there to be more focus on Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the group wanders through Normandy and the hunt for Ryan becomes unimportant and adventitious. The movie's impetus is seriously lacking, and I accredit this to poor directorial focus. Spielberg had problems finding a point to direct the energy of the war to, and instead directed it towards some vague moral standard. Unlike, say, Apocalypse Now, where the search for Brando has a singular focus on him, the soldiers wander aimlessly and haphazardly stumble upon Ryan in the most obtuse and anticlimatic fashion possible. On their way they go through a perfectly crafted sine curve of battles and traumas, discoveries and enlighenments. And as soon as I saw Ted Danson I couldn't help but drift to place where everybody knows your name and guys in pasty blue uniforms named Cliff down Heneiekens. Now THAT'S poor focus.In the end I could predict flatly what would happen. Yes, it's a true story, so Spielberg was limited, but the presentation was just too flat. The ending  is so utterly pitiful and righteous I wanted to puke. ""So, this is what the movie came down to?"" I thought as the American flag waved me goodbye. ""War is bad. America is good. Death is bad. Life is good. "" Drink Bud."
136,"I absolutly love this movie. Sure its a little gory, but it's a very well played war movie. It mixes a little humour in with a very dramatic and tragic story. It really captivates me every time I watch it. I's recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and can handle some blood."
137,Watch for first 20 minutes. after that just a casual money spilled storytelling.
138,Some of the best war scenes ever filmed. It gets overly sentimental at the end which keeps it from being a 10/10.
139,"I've just seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time and, as occurs when I first see a film, I quickly check IMDb to see what the Haters and Lovers of the movie say in their reviews. First, the Haters.Any time any movie portrays America as savior of Europe in World War II, the result gets panned by these groups (and if they're not yet organized, they should be as they deserve each other): (1) America haters from any country, notably (a) Germany (""we weren't ALL bad"") or (b) the UK (""we carried the burden until the tardy self-interested Yanks decided to enter war, which by the way was almost won when the US came in""), and (2) hard leftists everywhere (how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me). Hey Germany! You WERE bad! Hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the German electorate, only too happy to see the Jew (and the occasional Bolshevik) blamed for everything afflicting Weimar Germany. Hey UK! We love you, but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach. Pssst! You, our British cousins, had LOST the war by 1941. It was over, ended, caput, stick-a-fork-in-em done. Winston well knew how critical it was that America enter the war - which it did, and which it won. We are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the English-speaking world, but it was the English-speaking world's largest country that led the way, turned the tide and won the war. Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't. Britain was sunk and defeated, with precious little industrial capacity left - industrial might had to come from the US and Canada, but mostly the US. Saving Private Ryan isn't ""propaganda"" - it contains critical truths, and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda."
140,"In reading through the comments made on this page, I realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be (as people often do).  However, here's how I feel the movie was intended, and why I say that this is by far the greatest war movie, and one of the greatest movies of any genre. The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable. That's exactly what Spielberg wanted. First, the characters.  They were _intended_ to be stereotypical.  How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical?  Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people.  The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.Second, the plot.  The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man.  He wasn't.  He was everyone.  Every person that was sitting in that theater.  Every person that has ever been a part of this country.   When he tells Ryan to ""Earn this"", he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident.  It took normal men (a school-teacher, for instance) to make sure that we could someday go on IMDB after seeing a movie and spout our opinions. He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given. So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not.  And they fought so that I could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion. Thank God."
141,By far the most captivating war time movie to date. With a great cast that really help put into perspective the effect war has on everyone and the amount of losses that could happen at any moment. It shows Spielberg at his prime and all the effort everyone put into the movie to make it as realistic and atmospheric as it is.
142,"I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank a soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps ""Patton"", but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as ""Apocalypse Now"" is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war."
143,After scrolling through alot of the reviews I see you guys giving. 1/10 HERE ..1/10 THERE..I asked myself how the hell can you be so ignorant..Or maybe the doctor dropped you on the floor when you came out your mommas womb. Saving Private Ryan was not only a well casted work of art. It is one of the only movies to existence that visual provides the horrible anguish of war. DRIVEN by an outstanding performance from Tom Hanks. Its Brutal...Violent...and undoubtedly the most realistic demonstration of war we have ever seen on the big screen. Though this story in the war may be fictional. The war in this story is not. 9/10
144,"The 1998 movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the all-time great war movies. While much of the movie is a fictional account, the premise behind Capt. Miller's mission is based on a true story. That is the story of the Niland brothers - Edward, Preston, Robert, and Frederick - from Tonawanda, New York.The two middle brothers, Preston and Robert, had enlisted prior to the beginning of the War. After America entered the war the oldest, Edward, and youngest, Frederick, known as Fritz to his friends, joined up in November 1942. Because of the tragedy of the Sullivan brothers aboard the USS Juneau earlier that year, the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the Army. Edward became an enlisted pilot, with the rank of Technical Sergeant, of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying in the Burma-India-China theatre. Preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to Company C, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. Robert and Fritz both became paratroopers. Robert served with Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Fritz joined Company H, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. U.S. Army paratroopers are dropped near Grave, Netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier. This was the beginning of Operation Market Garden during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied losses. As fate would have it, three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland Europe.However, before the brothers could start their ""Great Crusade"" to liberate Europe, Edward was shot down somewhere over Burma. He was listed as Missing in Action, but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time, especially if he had fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Then, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Robert and Fritz joined over 23,000 Allied paratroopers in cracking Fortress Europe. Although Fritz's unit, 3rd Battalion, 501st PIR, was supposed to be the division reserve, the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups. These forces were able to secure vital causeways, bridges, and locks allowing the 4th Infantry Division, and Niland brother Preston, to exit Utah beach later that day. U.S. Soldiers of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, move out over the seawall on Utah Beach after coming ashore. Other troops are resting behind the concrete wall. Elsewhere, Robert Niland had landed outside of Ste. Mere-Eglise with the rest of the 505th as part of Mission Boston. After the 3rd Battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning, the 2ndBattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter. When a strong German counter-attack came from the south, Robert Niland and the rest of D Company's 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called Neuville. When two companies of Germans came at their position, they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south. When the position became untenable, Robert Niland, along with two other paratroopers, volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoon's retreat toward Ste. Mere-Eglise.While manning a machine gun in the face of the German onslaught, Robert Niland was killed in action. That very same morning, Lt. Preston Niland led his men onto the shores of Utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th Infantry Division on Utah beach, the battles beyond would be much tougher. Despite having made if off the beaches, the men of the 4th Infantry Division still had numerous gun batteries of Hitler's Atlantic Wall to clear. The task of capturing the Crisbecq battery, which had already sunk the destroyer USS Corry, fell to Lt. Niland and his men. On June 7, Niland led his men against the German position. During the heavy fighting Niland fell mortally wounded. The rest of his unit was repulsed. The battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th Infantry Division. The Niland brothers' parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time. Their only condolence was a letter from Fritz informing them that ""Dad's Spanish-American War stories are going to have to take a backseat when I get home. ""Fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers. When the War Department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return Fritz Niland to the United States. That task fell to the regimental Chaplin, Father Francis Sampson. Sampson located Fritz, who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home. Returning to the United States in 1944, Fritz served for the remainder of the war as an MP in New York.This article was written by James Elphick and originally appeared on WeAreTheMighty.com"
145,"The movie is awsome. I love telling friends about World War II because most og them just joke about the war, And the story of Normandie is the battle I am most interested in. And when I saw Saving Private Ryan it was a special movment. I loved the movie in the first 5 mins. The movie gave me a picture of how the war was. It gave me a picture of what Omaha Beach mite have been like but it also gave me a picture of real brotherhood. I have said to all of my friends to see it because it really good. I love the movie and I hope the people that watch the movie is gonna love it just as much as I did and do."
146,"It'd be implausible to think that anyone who wasn't involved in World War 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time. Over the years we've had countless documentaries, novels, movies, games and TV series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the World War that claimed millions upon millions of lives, and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is Steven Spielberg's incredible Saving Private Ryan.A film unlike anything Spielberg had made before or has made since, Ryan, with it's as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of Normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of Ramelle, is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt power.Spielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of film-making wizards. Employing the services of now famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the screen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at its disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.All around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was led by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man Captain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's religiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's gruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's jittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt Damon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of Bryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and even a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.Filled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.A deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the greatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.5 greased up socks out of 5"
147,"This film contains one of the best war scenes i have ever seen. I am talking about the D-Day (the landing and the effort of the Americans to break Germans defenses). It is so realistic. Plenty of shooting, bombing, killing. Really breathtaking. I have read many history books and articles and i think the recreation of this battle is epic. I can admit that since i first saw this movie when i read a new article regarding this battle, the scenes of this movie come in mind. Only a few movies or serials have so intense battle depictions.One that comes in mind is the serial Band of Brothers. Of course not only this part of the movie, but the whole movie is worth to be seen. Enjoy it, surely recommend it."
148,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Saving Private Ryan is about a captain in the US army during World War II, who must risk him and his men's lives to rescue a soldier who has lost his three brothers. Growing up I was so fascinated with WW2. I read about all aspects of it, so I had a pretty good idea of the horrors of combat. But I got a very clear look at war with this movie. The 20 minute opening of US soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy, is outstanding. Steven Spielberg captures every bit of gore and and violence, with young boys crying for there mother, soldiers losing their limbs, men having to muster every ounce of courage to survive the hell that is war. With amazing cinematography and sound that puts the audience right in the battlefield, we are shown how war can make even the manliest man weep like a child and what each soldier believes in and what they fight for. For me there are a few scenes that make the movie great. Obliviously the beach scene is one of them. After Wade dies from the machine gun nest, there is one German soldier who survives, and the men let out there hate and rage on him. Forgetting what is the right thing to do, the men have been so damaged by combat they then fight with one another whether letting the German go or not. The other scene is in the last battle, Upham is responsible for bringing ammo to Mellish, but Upham is so frozen with fear. And when Mellish is fighting hand to hand with a German, Upham is outside and able to save Mellish, but stays on the staircase crying, and when Mellish is dead, the German wouldn't even kill Upham. This movie does a flawless in showing the terrible effects war has on humans. This movie is so realistic, that when it was released in theaters, the army had to create a hotline for war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder.......convinced?10/10"
149,"Growing up, I knew that my family had a lot of history in the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. My grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the Pacific, and my grandmother's brothers were Marines alongside them. My grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there, and he always just bowed his head, swallowed hard, and told half truths and ""beside-the-point"" stories to appease whoever asked- never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow Americans were- heroes.I had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldn't talk about WWII, but one day in my U.S. History class in high school I got my answer. This film opened my eyes to the horrors of war. I sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me, wondering how soldiers and Marines like those in my family lived- or whats more, were able to cope with the events that made them heroes.My point with all of this is that in this day and age, we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we don't really realize what fighting men go through in times of war. We see ""10 soldiers killed in Iraq"" on the news, but it doesn't really register to us as civilians. This was Spielburg's goal in making this film. He wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us- you and me. Every American Citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safe.As far as the film itself goes, it is absolutely amazing. No film is perfect, but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles. The emotion is there, the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt, the best war movie ever made.One thing to note is that this is NOT a film for your kids or a film to watch casually. It is intense and should be treated as such.10/10"
150,"I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time."
151,"Yes, the opening sequence is breathtaking.  Once it's over with though, the movie is a tired rehash of every WW II movie cliche.  It also features perhaps the most dreadful score of John Williams' career."
152,"I was impressed by the brutal battlefield depiction which started the movie, and I'm sorry to say it's all downhill from there. There was even a very appropriate moment of black comedy when the soldiers shoot the surrendering Germans, but not five minutes later they introduce clumsy Private Comic Relief and for me the movie was over. Everything from then on seemed a pale cliché of every other war movie I've ever seen, and I haven't seen all that many. Ooh the stars went through boot camp! Was I the only one who noticed how loud (obnoxious) and unorganized the troops searching for Private Ryan were? They would have all been dead in seconds. Oh yeah, very realistic!"
153,"Having read 'All Quite on the Western Front' just before seeing this movie, I found a sour taste in my mouth while watching.  To tell a story that so clearly dehumanizes the enemy in this day and age is shameful.  It is, to me, propaganda.  Despite fighting for the side of the Nazis, most German soldiers were just people.  We proud Americans were just as evil and just as exploited during Vietnam.  Until people stop believing that 'we' are justified the holocausts will continue.  To see a much more interesting film about WWII try 'Midnight Clear' with Ethan Hawke."
154,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which, if you know anything about The 'Berg's intention for the film, was not the point. This movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as ""one of the best war movies ever made"". Imagine my disgust when I saw it...The opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the action/horror, but it relies solely on Spielberg's ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewing.Personally, I knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on. To be precise, I knew it when, in the midst of this mind-blowing battle sequence, Spielberg thought it'd be fun to throw in a joke about Sizemore being Hanks' mother.WHY?!? He had everyone on the edge of their seat (literally, I remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped) and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking JOKE?!?From here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage, as we are dragged through a war-is-hell-by-numbers affair. Never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate, Spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising, Ted Danson trying to be serious (yes, Ted Danson), a token ""death of the youngest soldier"" tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue I have ever suffered, which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of two-dimensional characters ever assembled for a movie.Then there's the premise; a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol' compassionate Uncle Sam thinks the titular soldier's poor Ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons. Is this a joke?!?""But it's a true story"" I hear you cry. Wrongo! It may have been inspired by a true story, but that doesn't mean that anything beyond the name James Ryan actually existed. The words ""inspired by a true story"" don't mean a thing these days and, let us not forget, this is Spielberg.Let us not forget indeed, as Stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces, even if they are overlong, predictable, and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it. The final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious, A-Team style montage that precedes it, in which we see our apple-pie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village, before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty Germans.Perhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against Terrence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line', and subsequently taking the two Oscars which by right belonged to the latter (Best Director and Best Cinematography).'Ryan's Privates' pales in comparison not just to Mallick's film (as well as to Spielberg's other ""classic"" manipulative-therapy session, 'ET') but to almost every war movie I have seen ('Cross of Iron', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'All Quite on the Wetsern Front'), even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously ('Mash', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Eagle Has Landed'). One great battle scene does not a great war movie make, but try telling the Academy that.Bottom line? Don't expect more than a sub-par Spielberg offering and you won't be disappointed. Expect a profoundly moving war classic, and you'll be choking on your rage like I was when I left the cinema nine years ago."
155,"Again, yes again, our friend Mr Spielberg does it.  He takes a subject matter that needs clever acting and clever direction, but rams it home like a 2 hour pop video.Why do people like these films, THE ACTING WAS AWFUL, the story was boring, the script was something out of a 1950's 'B' movie and people, not just one, but many, are saying that was a great film.Go and see a movie that is cleverly made, not just a five minute script that, uses every cliché in the book to ram home emotions and depth that aren't there.  I suppose this film appeals to the masses that don't have to think about a movie, just accept it as arty as it had couple of drawn out sad scene's, so it must be a masterpiece.I won't bother to go into the racism in the movie, the Germans played as mindless morons that just walk into bullets and of course, us stumbling Europeans, Australians, Russians, etc that actually fought through the entirety of the war.0/10 - Awful."
156,"A WWII movie for people who have never seen a real WW 11 movie. Gross oversimplification of the facts, highly unrealistic portrayal of the D Day landing, graphic violence to the nines{all in excruciating close-up shots} and the most stereotyped Nazis since Mel Brooks ""The Producers"". Film is good looking, but like Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of our Fathers"", it just doesn't ring true. But unlike FOOF which does have some truth behind it, this one looks like it was made up as they went along. Tom Hanks is OK in what basically is a no-name actors movie. Spielberg spoon feeds everything to us like we have no brains of our own. Many WW11 vets criticized the events as portrayed. While I was not there, I tend to believe them. Saving Pvt Ryan? Save your money instead!Zero Stars."
157,"To borrow from one of the more absurd lines in the movie, 'maybe getting the dishes out of the way would be the one decent thing we managed to pull out of this whole god-awful mess.' I'd have expected the producer of 'Schindler's List' to know better than to allow the actual line I reference to remain in a story about WWII.By the way, having failed to have the good sense at the first one, I certainly should have walked out at the second portrayal of a soldier on death's door crying out loud for his mother as battle raged around him. ""Best war movie"" indeed. In my opinion, even if 'Saving Private Ryan' hadn't been irritatingly implausible, it still would have been plain silly."
158,"The greatest war movie ever?  Come on, folks, who are you trying to kid. While SPR is certainly a technical tour de force, in emotional, spiritual, historical and narrative terms it stinks, for the same reason most of Spielberg's films (with the exception of Schindler's List, marvellous) stink:  the man has no vision, and little or no artistic integrity.  (Why else does he churn out rubbish like Jurassic Park II? I'll tell you why - money.)SPR is dishonest, silly and trite, an insult to the men who died in the real D-Day landings.  The story premise, as others here have pointed out, is risible, the framing device unnecessary and stupidly sentimental.  How anybody over the age of 9 can rate this film higher than genuine masterpieces such as Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front or Cross of Iron is beyond me.  Still, a lot of people who visit this site think Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are the greatest films ever made, which probably explains something.Watch the first 20 minutes, and then switch off.  Pants."
159,"What a poor film, it just consists of two very long battles with a weak plot linking them together.  I didn't relate to the characters and didn't care that Tom Hanks was a teacher.  So the battles were graphic and show the horrors of war in detail, but this doesn't make a film.May be my history lessons were wrong, but I thought that there were more countries on the allied side than just America."
160,"All in all this isn't a bad war flick, its got a good story that flows well and i enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few moments that were dull and slow moving but on the whole it moved well and kept me interested. However the dialogue is not up to scratch in some areas particularly when the band of soldiers first set out to find Ryan, its very banal. A major problem i had with the film (and it is a fairly big one) is the nauseating patriotism that emanates from it. This seems to be a problem with others here as well, it's just irritating and spoils the whole movie for me, it's hard to ignore it because it is felt throughout the movie, in some parts more than in others, especially at the end there where the American planes bomb the German positions and the viewer once again has America to thank for saving the day. I just can't stomach that really."
161,"Overall this movie was well made. I am not going to sit here and act like I know what happened over there, because I don't. This movie shows what the war was like through the eyes of the soldiers who fought in it. It is a vivid and graphic portrayal of war during World War 2. The movie is intense, but is important to watch. The cast does a great job. They put this feeling on you that is hard to describe. In my opinion this is one Spielberg's best films. He does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men, the struggle for survival. He also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter. This is one of my favorite movies because of the action, plot, and acting. At the end of this film you might feel sad, but not disturbed. This film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country I live in. It also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace. If you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies, I highly recommend this masterpiece."
162,"I have to agree, this is really good historical fiction, one note however... there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a Yen-yang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet, which would be the 29th Infantry Division (a National Guard Unit), instead of either a diamond with a #2 (2nd Rangers, which we saw) or a #5 (which we didn't see).  As far as I can find, only the 2nd and 5th Rangers were in the first wave of the assault, led by then LTC James Earl Rudder, and thus there should have been no 29th Inf, at least not in the first wave.  A couple of really good books on the subject is ""Rudder's Rangers : The True Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion D-Day Combat Action"" and ""The Liberation of Pointe Du Hoc : The 2nd Rangers at Normandy, June 6-8, 1944""  One thing that would probably suprise most people is that LTC Rudder came onshore with his men, and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach, and that he lived through it.  Of course, he was a Texas Aggie, that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed.  Read the books, you'll never watch SPR the same way again."
163,"Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department.  The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998.  Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture.  Tom Hanks is also excellent.  He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better).  In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever.  All in all ""Saving Private Ryan"" is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s.  It's a film that will be remembered for decades to come.  5 stars out of 5."
164,"If realism is no important point for you in WW2 movies, if you like cliches of other nations and like to support directors, who stress them in their own way, if you never saw ""Full Metal Jacket"" or first trials of your fathers shots of his V8Camcorder at a beach, if you believe that Tom H. could present a character who is introduced like Eastwood, and finally think that if someone has a big name in Hollywood he is always great what ever he does,-then you will love this movie"
165,"Why was this loved by all critics? Why was this loved by the academy? Why was this loved by anyone? I think that this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Steven Spielburg remains to be the sappiest director of all time. There was absolutely no point in showing the D-day invasion at the beginning of this film. There was no point to a lot of things in this film. Sure this film was realistic, but I could care less about realism as long as the rest makes sense. There were scenes in this movie that came out of nowhere for no reason. Besides a bunch of nonsense scenes, this movie has a plot that drove me insane. The U.S. government risks the lives of 8 men to save one so that his mother won't be too depressed. The worst part of the entire film however was the showing of Private Ryan as an old man in the cemetery. People were expected to weep through this entire movie, I just wanted to leave, but I stayed thinking it'd get better. Boy was I wrong!"
166,"There was a time when Spielberg felt the film-making fraternity had overlooked him. Those days may be over, but the reasons why it happened, sadly, are not. The lesson seems to be, make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweight.The sad fact is that Schindler's List is (in my opinion) a very good film, but not a great one  it is too heavy handed. I am in a minority. Likewise, bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography (which was not part of the original Spielberg grand plan) and transform a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal war-is-naughty-but-devilishly-exciting flick into a major cinematic event.Can someone who loves this film as Art (I choose capitals for its ironic effect) explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games? Were Spielberg's motives so noble, so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his ""war-is-naughty"" message to the fans of first person shoot-em-ups? Now you may argue that it is hardly Spielberg's job to worry about such things. This may be true  but you have to wonder why it was that Saving Private Ryan is so eminently suited to such a transfer. It is difficult, for example, to anticipate a Thin Red Line or Apocalypse now video game. It would also difficult to paste scenes from Thin Red Line onto, say, Star Wars (the Millennium Falcon coming out of the sun, for example) and not be able to spot the difference.At best Saving Private Ryan is a lukewarm, melodramatic, overly sentimental paean to good ole America, good ole family and the importance of killing nasty Germans before they kill you. The beach landing is extraordinary  I'm not denying it. But pardon me if I'm holding out for something more subtle. 5½ /10"
167,"The technical aspects of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (effects, scenery,... ) have been done in a really good way. But unfortunately, that's the only good thing to say about the movie.*spoilers ahead*The movie can be divided into two parts: The landing at Omaha Beach, and the mission to save Private Ryan.The landing is by far the better part. And yet it fails: The watcher doesn't get involved into the (technically perfect) action on the screen. Men are mowed down by machine gun fire, and you couldn't care less. And a war movie that doesn't make the watcher feel the cruelty of war is a failure...After the landing, things become worse:The entire premise of the second part (saving a Private who's three brothers died) is pathetic - and it's even presented in a even more pathetic way.The main characters are faceless (only Tom Hanks' and Jeremy Davies' roles got some profile), and you don't really care about them.The 'enemy' is not only faceless, too. He's also dumb. His only purpose in the film is to mindlessly rush forward to be gunned down by G.I.s. (making all the fighting feel fake)Too many 'coincidences' that pull the movie along (Ryan is just where he's most needed, the bridge get's blown away 'at the last moment possible',...)The film is predictable, making a lot of the 'search' for Private Ryan pointless and the discussions about the mission pointless (Private Ryan is not dead, as anybody expects anyway. No, he did not return to base. Yes, he's fighting the Germans. No, he won't leave his comrades. Yes, the rescue team stays to man the defense.)It has all elements of a Hollywood movie (except the love scene): a main character that proves worthy, a main character that dies for what he believes in, a man that proves manhood by killing for the first time, the American flag at the end (and everywhere else), the treacherous bad guy...*end of spoilers*Conclusion: It's your 08/15 American feel good war movie. Don't expect anything more... (If you want something more 'real' watch ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now"")"
168,"""Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage,"" according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called ""The Greatest Generation""; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's ""Ryan"" (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the ""war mother"" dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' ""Miller"" in his final words to student Damon's ""Ryan""; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual ""Upham"" character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an ""ensemble acting"" film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor ""Wade"" to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to ""Mama"". Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's ""Horvath"" serves as the ""voice"" of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line (""Except this time, the mission is a man"").Spielberg's use of ""flashback"" is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term ""gut-wrenching decision."" ********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi"
169,"This was a decent movie but still was highly overrated by everybody. The Plot was some what weak, and although i like Tom Hanks I believe he is overrated in Hollywood's eyes and thought that all of his movies get over hyped. I think the same thing With Green Mile which was a decent movie but still overrated and Forrest Gump, I personally thought Billy Bob Thorton made a better movie in Sling Blade. However Hanks did make good scores in Big and Apollo 13. I also think Spielberg is overrated. How can people say that this is better than Apocalpsye Now and Platoon the 2 greatest war movies of all time. The Thin Red Line was better than Saving Private Ryan by a hair they were both overrated. Platoon is the best war movie ever!"
170,"I don't think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is  just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed  I found the chaos comparable to the scene in `Platoon' where they assault the V.C. bunkerhowever, it does not (any part of the movie, in my mind) match up the finale of Platoon, in which one is so confused, your heart pounds, and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in Private Ryan.What really got to me about this film, were several things thoughfirst and foremost, is the `dumb German' syndrome, which leaves me with a bias feeling.  Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with almost twenty German's firing at them?Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mineor hit by a grenadeso on, so on.  I won't pretend to be a war-vet, or someone who's witnessed this, but it seems unlikely to me.  However, I'll stress my own ignorance, and say `don't take my word for it.'All in all, I found it to be a worthy action flick  comparable, in my mind, to `The Big Red one.'  It has sad moments, and moments of brutality, but in the end, just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequences.As a sidenote, I think that the best ww2 films ever made are ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" two films that don't deal heaviliy with combat (TTRL more so).  Saving Private Ryan tried just a little to hard to force feed it.  I recomend all of these films, but for your knowledge, those are to me, the best."
171,"Unbelievably hyped-up, this pathetic attempt to make THE (unbias) War Movie, in my opinion, FAILED.Steven SPEILBERG: Mission FAILED.After 2 hours of irrelevant, continous, meaningless fighting, bloodshed and gore, one finds Saving Private Ryan BORING. The first scene of battle is effective, but when this is followed by another 2 hours of similar material, well, you're not left with much.With the first and last scene being an American Flag waving in the wind, one realises that indeed, ""this is another load of American patriotic RUBBISH"".Lacking a story-line, this is a hollow tree.2/10 for Saving Private Ryan."
172,"I have read most of the comments about SPR and I must say I agree with those who resent and loathe the film. I went to see it last week, and I was terribly disappointed. I was disappointed mainly because of the: 1. The sentimental awkward frame 2. The vomit-inducing score 3.Rotten dialog 4. Moral hypocrisy But most of all I was disappointed by the predictability of the plot. We all know from the beginning who will die and how. It is no surprise that Tom Sizemore.. dies last followed by Hanks..maybe this is the love-story of the film? When the best buddy dies Hanks literally throws himself at the bullets. American films don't really need women basically it's all about bonding in the forceful wilderness.. if it isn't Indians it's Germans and the rest of the world doesn't exist not even in Europe.I know these comments may be a trifle vengeful or sarcastic but I love movies I am not one of those freaks who only watch French films and thinks everything else is crap.But I HATE to be disappointed when I've had such great expectations. I totally agree with the comment on the motivations of the geek character shooting the runaway German. What was that all about? Wasn't the point of his release to show that the geek was more humane than the rest of them? The knife scene seems rather erotized to me two men so close to death(and not the little one I may add)and penetration, whispering ..slowly, slowly in German. I find this extremely disturbing where does this fit in? I don't have much else to say but I have lost my faith in Spielberg's abilities(What's the point of having a sniper citing from the bible?)As far as I am concerned he hasn't made a thrilling scene since Dreyfuss built that mountain in his living room in close encounter, and that moment is far more realistic than any scene in SPR !!!! What is the difference between this film and other violent films that earn money? The plot structure is exactly the same, the characters are the same, the music is the same. (The moral is the same pasted nicely to a waving American flag) The only difference is that something similar (so realistic...)happened in the past. If people can become wealthy this way I have given my support to Spielberg's bank account for the very last time. The best war film ever made is still STALINGRAD!!!!!!!!!!! But I guess no American will know this before someone makes an American version all I can say is : I hope it wont be Spielberg.."
173,"call me cynical, or perhaps heartless, but on second viewing of this overrated film I saw straight through it. When I first saw it I was 13 years old. I was angry and angst ridden, and utterly impressionable. The film affected me. It made me rant for weeks about what evil ""ba*****s"" the French must have been during the war, and resent my French and German lessons. I didn't question it because before then I hadn't even seen a movie that reached the standards of The Shawshank Redemption, not that this is a bad film, on the contrary, it is beautiful and fantastic, but the point remains that I was decidedly naive when I saw it. Fortunately, I have seen the light. I am now a film studies student and I have fallen in love with movies that make this one look, well, empty. It's nothing, really, to be honest, that Stanley Kubrick didn't do better in Full Metal Jacket. Ok, I admit that the first scene is well choreographed, well photographed, well conceived and genuinely moving. However, it seems to me that there might have been better ways to go about it, really. Someone else would have made a hugely better job of this. And well done Spielburg for Jurassic Park but I can never forgive him for inventing the Blockbuster movie with Jaws, paving the way for big family-fun action-adventure-explosion-fests. Grrrrrrrrrr. The film was sickeningly sentimental to the point of being really ""corny"", in every American sense of the world. This is accelerated by the string score, which, like in most big films that want to pull the heart strings, it tells you, TELLS YOU(!), exactly when you should be feeling sad. EUGH! And what exactly is with the American flag filling the screen whilst blowing in the breeze and fading to the D-Day landings? This is such a blatant and screaming use of patriotic symbolism, it doesn't make me proud, it doesn't make me relate to the story, it doesn't do anything but make me puke. Seriously. Don't eat me. I love you really."
174,"Spielberg is a highly competent director, who has a brilliant knack for making the right film at the right time. This has resulted in a number of his works being over-hyped to the point of the ridiculous.Saving Private Ryan is most certainly one of those films. Here we have a thin and totally implausible story, shallow characters, lack of historical authenticity... yet a reputation (confirmed on this board) of being ""the best war movie of all time.""Let me refute that view on just a couple of points.First, we should be clear that, while the opening D-Day sequence is certainly Spielberg at his best, it is by no means the best -- nor the first -- big-screen depiction of the realities of war. In fact, it's largely a rip-off of the equally good, and much earlier, beach-landing sequence in Cornel Wilde's 1967 tour-de-force, Beach Red. Spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively, but does not improve on that earlier work, and in fact, echoes many specific sequences within it. (Wilde's film is also far more powerful in the rest of its story.)Second, aside from Private Ryan's many other weaknesses, I find most glaring it's unintentional irony. What country in WW II - other than the USA - could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died??? I can only imagine the jeers that must greet this idea when the film is shown in, say, Russia -- where tens of millions died, with no such convenient reprieves and nowhere to flee in any case. Or in England, where whole families had no choice but to soldier their way through the Blitz. The fact is, the soldiers of the USA were relatively unique in having a safe haven to return *to.* Saving Private Ryan not only manages to forget that fact, it somehow tries to make American troops seem the more heroic for it!I say the irony is unintentional... In fact, I long wondered if Spielberg had *meant* the story-line of Private Ryan ironically. But a recent interview on TCM convinces me that he did not. That's a shame. Done deliberately, this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powers-that-be manipulate fighting men in the field. Instead, it's more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor. I have no idea how prevalent the ""Private Ryan"" reprieve really was; but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire force.On the positive side, there's no denying the production is well-mounted. I give the film 3 stars, chiefly for the technical brilliance of the opening sequence - and for the presence of the always-watchable Tom Hanks."
175,"Spielberg mines a sullied gem with this bloody classic. A family film, I say, a demonstration of brotherhood and integrity. For me the decision to seek Private Ryan based on the mother's loss simultaneously undermines and glorifies the honour of war. And it is in this background that Hanks delivers a compelling performance worthy of many rewatches.The violence in this film is stark. So many examples you can think of - from the escaped German prisoner's revenge, to the sockbomb victim - show the arbitrary nature of violence. But the quieter moments between are tender and contemplative - Fubar anyone? Not a realist film, like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, but art to provoke, like Jar Head and Apocalypse Now."
176,"As a younger man (22) I've grown up in a society was molded to fit baby-boomer self-centeredness.  So perhaps I shouldn't find this film surprising.  But I can't stomach the idea of another generation of people following their twisted view, so here goes...No matter how much you want to stoke your own ego, there is no way that you can realistically equate the men who fought and died in WW2 to yourselves. Give up.  This film is a terrible blow to our veterans.Spielberg tries to make the soldiers seem like they're the same as you and me, but they weren't.  All of the introspective musings in this film would make you think that these guys returned home after the war and started discussing Sartres in their local coffeehouse.  These are 40's people who are portrayed thinking like 90's people.  At least in ""Thin Red Line"", the film made no effort to portray itself as a true-to-life salute to those soldiers.  ""Thin Red Line"" was a juxtaposition of a WW2 backdrop with Vietnam-era sentiments, and it made to portent of being anything else.The WW2 generation didn't feel this ridiculous desire to explore their feelings and share them to the point of fault.  They didn't have to connect to their fellows on some mystical, spiritual level.  The entire war did not revolve around them as individuals, nor did they feel the need to ponder some existential connection to the war around them.This film is simply another attempt by the baby-boomer generation to ""prove"" that they are as good as any other generation before them.  This is their self-centered mythos.  If a film actually showed the superior qualities of these American soldiers, it would destroy that myth.  In truth, the American people felt a duty to their country back then.  And they did not feel the need to wax philosophic at every turn in some attempt to justify the world's existence in the face of how ""inconvenient"" it may have been to their own selves.  This contemporary psycho-babble had no place in their lives, and Spielberg had no right to put it there.As for the characters who don't partake of this attitude, they are so paper thin that they add nothing to the film except to exacerbate the problem by making the mystics and coffeehouse types seem the more realistic.If you have any respect for America, pass this film by."
177,"Overrated and Sentimental. Doesn't have anything new to add to the genre. Re-treads the WWII films of the 1950s and early 1960s. Films like TO HELL AND BACK, PATHS OF GLORY, SANDS OF IWO JIMA, PORKCHOP HILL, THE LONGEST DAY, THE VICTORS, etc. Those films, in my opinion, were fine but I wouldn't want to watch them all over again. That's how I felt sitting in the theater on opening day. Like I was sitting through each and every one of those films. In the overwrought, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg supplies his patented boyish sense of wonder; something, I believe, is out of place in a genre that is often appropriately somber. What I'm saying is, I just want to see a war drama that appeals to the mind rather than the emotions. A film like the brilliant, introspective, THE THIN RED LINE."
178,"When it came out, Saving Private Ryan was lauded for it's ""realistic depiction of war,"" and for its ""attention and sensitivity to the common man caught up in the sway of forces far beyond his control."" It was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the war.Unfortunately, it was none of these things.The message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience, as long as you're an American. Common everyday plain old American Teachers, as shown by Tom Hanks' character, are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men. We are shown, however, that the humanity of that Teacher is still there, even as he is fighting the ""Evil Bloodthirsy Germans.""And this is where my problem lies. How can a movie that uses cookie cutter Nazis, that treats German soldiers as simply ""the enemy,"" even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans in Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently having lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The Thin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a joke.Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so flat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either. Having said that, however, the dehumanizing of the enemy, the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity, is what allowed the Germans to kill so many Jews.
This movie is anything but a realistic depiction of the Second World War."
179,"Im giving this movie 5 stars for its opening battle scene. It loses the other 5 stars for being too stereotypical and cliché. First of all, the actors: All big name Hollywood blow-hards who have egos bigger than the movie's budget. Was Hank's character surviving the film because of Forest Gump's experience in Nam? And, oh my God, that lamoid Matt Damon...what a joke. The characters, well did you know that EVERY German infantry soldier was a cold, heartless animal that held not a single ounce of compassion or humanity? Neither did I, but that's what Mr. Spielberg would like everyone who watches the movie to believe. And what about the young American soldiers fighting this war in 1944? In the film they talked the way young people talk today. This can't get any more UNREALISTIC.The thin, poorly written plot was just lucky that it was incorporated into film with spectacular special effects and incredible cinematography or else people would of noticed how thin and poorly written it was.5/10"
180,"This was a piece of fictional propoganda showing how only the Americans (and, I think, the Germans) were involved in WWII.Utter Baloney!The series Band of Brothers put together by Spielberg and Hanks was tremendously real and honest. Their consciences must have been guilty over the movie. They more than made up for it with the series."
181,"The movie had incredible special effects and entertaining scenes, however the movie is full of half-truths, lies and propaganda.Truths: There was a US, British and Canadian led invasion of Normandy France in June, 1944.Lies: There was no Private called Ryan who lost his two brothers, however there was a Airbourne soldier lost for 18 days behind German lines, however he rescued himself after walking into US lines, no one set out to rescue him and there was no giant battle in the fictional town of Ramelle.Propaganda: In this movie (besides the opening scene in which hundreds of US soldiers were slaughtered on Omaha Beach) the average US soldiers kills 50 German soldiers, gets shot (falls over dramatically in slow motion with stupid opera music playing), then pulls out his pistol and kills another 50 Germans and then dies dramatically saying something stupid like ""Tell my wife I love her"". In this movie a platoon of 20 US soldiers, takes out 100 German soldiers, 2 Marder IIIs and 2 Tiger tanks with improvised weapons like wet-sock bombs and Molotov cocktails. Real history accounts SHOW that this never happened! If your into entertaining and action packed War movies THEN THIS IS TOTALLY YOUR THING! A great movie! However 98% inaccurate when it comes to history."
182,"How could such a movie get any Academy Award? On the one hand Spielberg did a great job with this movie, but on the other: The story is pure sh.. It is even not an anti-war movie, because at the end the American soldiers are represented as heroes. It is simply not true that an army (especially the US army) cares about a mother, who loses their sons in the war. They just don't care about it in the reality."
183,"In the late 1980's, there was the Vietnam War backlash (""Platoon,"" ""Hamburger Hill,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" etcetera, those of which were quite good). And now in the late 1990's/2000-2002, there is the World War II backlash (""Thin Red Line,"" ""Band Of Brothers,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" etcetera)...only what it produces is not near as high quality as the Vietnam backlash. The 'epic' ""Saving Private Ryan"" is no exception; the usually great Tom Hanks gives a sour performance, as does just about everyone else. Yet another bitter installment in the WWII backlash fad. --Bud Sturguess, Texas"
184,"I've been put off writing this review for many years because I feared it would turn out to be a negative pile of invective directed against a man whose work I have largely admired for many years. Now though I've mellowed and with the film coming up to 20 years old and there being already more than 2000 reviews already on this website I'm confident nobody is going to waste time reading this review anyway.So, what can you say about the first 25 minutes? Probably the finest piece of action film making ever. This opening ruined every war film I saw before and every war film I've seen since; nothing comes close (apart from BoB of course). Exceptional! And for me that is the strange thing about this film – part of it fills me with rapture, while other parts make me cringe and irritated.But let's get onto the story. Well I'm no military expert but sending a handful of men, some of them high value experienced soldiers, out into the French countryside to find a Unit with a certain individual in it – well I'm not sure I buy it. No, the story is weak and disappoints, as do the over familiar characterisations.Alright then we move onto the inevitable, and the source of all the carping from all the other non-US reviewers of this film - the lack of representatives from other allied nations. Well the answer the great man gave is very much the same as many defenders of this film provide on this website – that this is a war film concentrating on the US sectors and their German adversaries. Sounds reasonable enough – doesn't it? It's also sound film making as well as keeping it simple ensures audiences don't get confused with all those different uniforms and dodgy accents.The only problem, well only if historical accuracy of real events bothers you, is that Historians tell us the demarcation between the sectors wasn't that clear cut. As James Holland of CNN states by quoting the actual resources provided respectively by the US and the British, if you were a GI there was a very good chance you would leave the English coast in a British Royal Naval vessel. You would more than likely transfer into a British Royal Naval Landing craft. If you needed air support it would be almost definitely provided by the British Royal Air Force or Royal Canadian Air Force. While the night time air drops apparently deposited paratroopers all over the place and not necessarily where they should be. (Remember, this was the reason given for not knowing where Ryan was.) The statistics tell us this, these are facts. So, although it is possible a 'Yank' could fail to encounter a 'Limey', 'Canook', or 'Free French' on June 6th 1944, it would be very unlikely.I'm reminded of an interview the great man did to promote the film in the UK for the BBC. When he was challenged about this point he gave the example of 'The Dambusters' as a British war film that just concentrated on the double header of Brits versus Germans. Sorry 'Steve' not a great example. Unfortunately the young interviewer either didn't know his war films or didn't fancy irritating his esteemed interviewee.The Dambusters features Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, and Rhodesians along with the English/Welsh/Scots/Irish. There's a scene where they are selecting crews for the mission when Colin Todd, as Guy Gibson, exclaims: ""Hang on, don't forget the English!"" Even the jingoistic extravaganza that was the 1969 film 'The Battle of Britain' included a Polish fighter squadron in recognition of the brave and resolute contribution they made to the defence of the UK.There is also a plot problem with omitting allies from the story in that you have nobody to portray as inferior, incompetent, and cowardly (tick as appropriate) to compare with your own brave square jawed heroes (Think: The Hurt Locker and those useless Brit mercenaries). You don't want your enemy appearing pathetic, evil yes, but they have to be a worthwhile foe to legitimise the struggle towards victory. So this film tries to get around this restriction by including a dig at the British General Montgomery, the overall planner of Operation Overlord (D-Day), but not a man universally popular even within his own nation.While it is entirely realistic that troops from one Army criticise the performance of another the way it is done here – out of the blue exposition and with no supporting evidence, exposes this line for what it actually is: a cheap shot.So perhaps these facts explain why many reviewers have been disappointed about others nations' exclusion. In order to allow US audiences to identify with the film, and others around the world (Some French and Germans both have their own reasons for depreciating the role of the British, but that's another contentious point!), history has been bent for commercial purposes to produce what looks to some (including me), a mean spirited and self-centred production.This film gets so many things right, and gets them excellently 'right' so the areas where they get things wrong stand out as really, really wrong; and that is the chief problem with this film. It goes to great trouble and expense to present realistic events and situations for certain parts of the film, but in other parts it is lazy and dismissive.I wonder if Mr Spielberg was ever the slightest bit bothered by this international hoo-hah? I wonder on cold winter evenings when he's at home polishing his 'Knight of the British Empire Medal' for taking advantage of the lower production costs in the UK, erm I mean services to the British film industry, he feels the slightest bit guilty. Of course not, that is a ridiculous image; cast it from your minds immediately. He will have a professional come in and polish all of his awards!"
185,"For people who say this is the best war movie, I can't help but wonder if any of those people have some of Stanley Kubrick's war films. Dr. Strangelove and The Paths of Glory IMO are so much better than Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan visually and technically is far superior to the other films. But the story isn't a gripping story which feels like it has an very powerful message. Largely because it's centered around WW2 which was a war which was necessary for the allies to fight in. The more compelling films IMO are the ones centered around wars and encounters which represent the costs of wars for little if any benefit. I'd say that Warhorse is a better film than Saving Private Ryan too.Saving Private Ryan does display the real bravery and horrors of WW2. But that is nothing particularly new. Just about every WW2 film does that. The main story-line of rescuing Ryan is what is the biggest turnoff to me. The film even addresses the issue of their order to rescue Ryan. It's not smart to put an entire team of many people in danger in order to try to rescue one soldier in the middle of a battlefield. Many other soldiers die, and Ryan, even when found doesn't feel he deserves to be rescued. He even insists that they keep fight off their enemy rather than leave right away. My inquiry is that if our Nation objects to too many family members dying in battle, why allow so many of one family to fight? Probably my favorite parts of the film were the side stories not directly related to Saving Ryan at all. I like the story of the translator going from a coward to a killer. I like the part of the film where they discuss whether it's right or wrong to escape a Nazi Trap or put themselves and their mission at risk in order to spring the trap. And of course the D-day invasion sequence is incredibly powerful.The film is certainly worth watching, and many people it's great, but I just find it OK, and certainly not one of the best War films. I don't know if it would even crack my top 10."
186,"I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliché, but every main character is fully fleshed out.This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a hand-held style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, ""Tu es partout"" before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone."
187,"This film is a fantastic production with a quality cast. You sure will not be disappointed watching this gripping film that is based on a true story. Many war films have been made but this is by far the best I have watched in a long time. Such a emotional film in which Tom Hanks could not be replaced by any actor. If you like well made war films which are based on a true story and made to give viewers a lasting impression and something to think about than this Film should be your choice. Also if you are a emotional person, tears will fall. The cast for this film has been well selected and suit their characters.You will experience a authentic view into the life of soldiers who have fought during the D-Day landing in the Normandy France."
188,"""Saving Private Ryan"", is one of the most pivotal moments in both Steven Spielberg's career, and the War genre in motion picture history.It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.Most notably to be said about the movie, is the depiction of the Omaha landings. Basically, it was a war re-enactment consisting of 1500 extras and 30 or so amputees. Spielberg did not plan ahead in terms of storyboarding, but instead decided to place the camera where it was best suited for spontaneous reactions. Admist all the amazing locations and bombed out villages, every soldier is relying on one solid emotion to get through the war, hope, which comes in the form of the missing Private Ryan. Unfortunately, that hope is tested as inevitable casualties will demoralise and divide the squadron.This film covers pretty much all aspects of war. The tension, nature and sadness of it all gets stripped bare, as all stones are turned and the end result is one of poetic beauty. However, I never really found myself caring whether they found Ryan or not. Though the ending can't help but feel forced, it's certainly touching and has a lot of patriotism in mind.Final Verdict: Definitely one of Spielberg's finest. I look forward to watching ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), and seeing what this man can do with more running time. 9/10."
189,"As the name suggests this a war-movie in which an agent named Capt. Miller(Tom Hanks) is sent on a mission to save a soldier named Pvt. James Ryan. Ryan's mother has already lost her three children in the same war against the Germans. Movie starts with an approx. 25 minutes of a thriller action sequence where the American forces are fighting against German forces at Omaha Beach. Director Steven Spielberg has made this scene one of the most epic real war sequence I have ever seen in a movie. Thousands of soldiers died in this horrifying, dreadful sequence. Special effects by cinematographer(Janusz Kaminski, also in Schindler's list) has made this a perfect sequence. Protagonist Capt Miller survived this war, assembles a group of soldiers to invade German troops and find Ryan. Movie depicts the struggle of Miller and his team to complete their mission. Movie becomes a little bit slow during the mission but still must be able to hold the audience together.Intense emotion scenes, like when Ryan's mother is informed about the tragic death of her three sons might make viewers cry and arouse patriotic feeling in them. Movie showcase some good strategies, teamwork, breakdowns and courage. All these things together complete this movie and makes it much more interesting than any other fiction movie.Tom Hanks's acting has raised the bar of expectations further high. Steven Spielberg has done one of the greatest job you will ever see. Realism in this movie makes it a must watch."
190,"Steven Spielberg was the only director's name I knew for a long portion of my life.Mainly because I was a narcissistic young lad and due to his first name, I presumed he must be brilliant.But he spells it incorrectly.'Stephen' is spelled with a 'ph' not a 'v'.Anybody worth their salt knows that.Saving Private Ryan is a lot like it's director's first name - it's a near perfect film.The only blemish on this entire movie is the opening and ending ten minutes, the two scenes featuring the old man revisiting the tombstones at Normandy. They are totally unnecessary to the plot of the film and hokey as all get out.Otherwise all of the narrative which takes place during World War II is sensational.Sure the scene where they storm the beaches on D-Day is a marvelous sight to behold, but don't let that detract from the scenes that follow. It's all good stuff.Tom Hanks leads a cast of fantastic characters including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Brian Cranston and Paul Giamatti.All deliver exceptional performances throughout.If you've been keeping SPR in the back pocket like me, let it out anytime.You'll enjoy this film.But stop reading here, I'm going to spoil a few things.Vin Diesel is very good in this movie, and it gets a little dusty when his character dies, but it seems like there is some ADR (additional dialogue recording) shoved into the scene directly preceding.The only portion of the movie that may ruin the suspension of disbelief is here, when Vin takes the daughter. The scene is a bit unbelievable, it only lasts a second, but something is lost to the viewer. I think the ADR might be part of the reason.Speaking of, when he's laying there and takes out the note for his father, I'm almost certain there is ADR because his lines do not match up with his lips or body language.Anyway, if I were to criticize that scene, I'd be nitpicking. It still gets dusty no matter what he's saying.To address my earlier criticism, you might argue that the 'bookends' (the scenes in which we see Matt Damon all grown up, having fathered at least two generations) are necessary to provide redemption to the deceased characters.This is a fair point, but I don't think we need this kind of handholding. I don't believe anyone would have wondered whether or not he went on to father children. Almost all of the characters are heroic (especially Private Ryan) and we know that he's alive at the end of their mission.They are required to give him another chance, and that's made apparent by his survival during the film's climax. The viewer can presume he will make the best of the life they've sacrificed for.But this is all semantics. Leave the scenes in, for all I care.Saving Private Ryan is a fantastic movie."
191,"Saving Private Ryan is a great film. The film's second scene, which is based on Omaha Beach on D-Day really makes the whole film 10/10, as if it wasn't for that scene, I would have probably given it an 8/10. This is because of the action in the scene, as Steven Spielberg shows a good example of what happened to the soldiers that day, and what a struggle it was. Other than the D-Day scene, the film is still amazing, as it provides lots of drama, such as the scene with the tense sniper game, and the parents daughter being taken. Also the part in the destroyed town, which is a big part of the story. Altogether Saving Private Ryan is a spectacular film, and I would recommend it to anyone."
192,"A true classic. And honestly my favorite Spielberg and movie of all time.STORYLINE: The storyline starts during Omaha Beach. Were we somewhat meet are hero's. Around 30 minutes in the actual story comes into play. Private James Ryan's (Matt Damon) 3 brothers are all killed in the line of duty. So Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and all of his crew are set to find him and bring him back home.CHARACTERS AND ACTING: The movie itself is powerful. The characters are smartly written. Because they question the mission. Why would 8 guys go over and save 1 man? Tom Hanks is as powerful as he ever is. He portrays his character of a man who has suffered during times of war. And his ""That's my mission"" speech always moved me. In short everyone does a great job.OTHER: This movie is powerful. And after watching it you want to take a shower and sing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" Because it is patriotic and it makes you feel proud. And of course the first 25 minutes of the movie is so incredibly well done that it makes shaky-cam look like a masterpiece! And this film is a masterpiece!"
193,"After the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach, Ranger Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st Airbourne named Private James Ryan. With the platoon of his choosing (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jeremy Davies) sets off in treachorous wartime France to find Private Ryan amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st Airbourne.World War I is often considering ""The Great War"" or ""The War to End All Wars,"" but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has. For the first time during a war, films were made about the war as early as 1939. Some of the greatest war films and TV series have been based on World War 2 from The Sands of Iwo Jima to Flags of Fathers to Band of Brothers. At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.Saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made. The opening thirty minutes of the D-Day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid. But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat. This movie truly depicts why World War 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in US history.One of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller. Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson. Even Jeremy Davies as the green Cpl. Upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldier.The one thing that drags this movie down though is Spielberg's slavish devotion to sentimentality. The bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie. Don't get me wrong, a former soldier's sentimentality for the one's who died to save him has it's place, I just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie. Rather, the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the war.Overall, though, in the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw that I have with this movie, it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country. I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu-Ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.4.5/5"
194,"It's been more than ten years since I convinced my mom to take me to see Saving Private Ryan at the World premiere in '97. I was 16, and the movie had an R rating.Needless to say I had quite a surprise coming my way.Since I was a kid I've always been fond of War history and I have read countless books, seen documentaries and so on. Nothing however, have ever opened my eyes like Saving Private Ryan.In this masterpiece, Spielberg puts you right there on the beach. The excellent photography by Janusz Kaminski (for which he won an Oscar) and amazing sound effects in the breathtaking opening scenes is probably the best sequences in a movie ever. It really makes you feel like you're actually there in person.Where other war movies often glamorizes the soldier, gives war that romantic ""Hero"" touch, Saving Private Ryan hacks into your mind like no other movie. It is rough, chillingly brutal, and beautiful at the same time. It tries in no way to give you an illusion, it simply tries to give the audience the feeling of how it was like to be there.This is where Saving Private Ryan succeeds.I dare say that no other movie has managed to put a given scenario into such a breathtakingly good movie.As for the acting, Hanks does a fine job as Cpt. Miller. Even Vin Diesel - Mr. Testosterone - pulls of a convincing role as Caparzo. Giovanni Ribisi was for me maybe the biggest surprise of them all; I dare say his acting style was perfect for the role of Wade.All in all, I can't find any war movie better, and hardly any movie at all to compete from any category. As for war movies, Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece in itself but not even that comes close to SPR in describing the brutality of war.I used to love the idea of being a soldier. After seeing this movie more than ten years ago I never dreamed of being one again."
195,"Saving Private Ryan is probably on of the greatest war films ever made, along with Paths of Glory and Appocalypse Now.The way that Spielberg develops the characters throughout the film is very good. My Grand-Father along with many other people who fought in WW2 would say it is very very very realistic. Especially in the opening scene at the beaches and the final battle at the end.Tom hanks is brilliant in it as well as the rest of the cast, It's brilliantly shot and very very well made.It shows what the life was like for a WW2 soldier.And it shows the Absolute Hell of war and what is what like to be there.Many people would say they cried at the end, even men because it is just so moving to think how or why we do this and how could we have done this to each other, and Tom Hank's last words made it even more moving. It has Beautiful music and is a Gem of a film.I would definitely recommend it for 12 years and above, and it should be shown to every child out there to teach them the reality of war.If you haven't seen this already go and buy the DVD now! If there was a higher rating than 10 I would it a 100.Brilliant"
196,"Words cannot describe the greatness of this film. Hell, if I type a long review of this film, it might take away the film's credibility. So I'm gonna keep this review short, sweet and simple.ACTING: Superb. Likable characters and they put you, the audience, smack dab in the middle of the war. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Notable mention is Jeremy Davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier, Upham.DIRECTION: Excellent. Frenetic camera movement, thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences. Spielberg is masterful, as always. He manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really is.STORY/SCREENPLAY: Storywise, it is uplifting and inspiring. And during historical moments, it is accurate and realistic. Screenplay slips into sentimental state during times, but we'd look over that.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Mesmerizing. At times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish (there goes that word again) display of a blood-drenched beach and war-torn cities. The color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematography.MUSIC: Is put into places where it should be. John Williams does a fantastic job once again.OVERALL: In short, definitely in my favorite movies list, and on the critical side, one of the greatest movies ever made. This film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers.9.966/10Delton"
197,"OK first off let me be clear on a few points: I rarely, if ever, write reviews. Second, I am not American, I'm a proud Canadian. I'm not enlisted in our military, nor am I a veteran.Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be, in my opinion, one of the most moving films in the last 40 years. So realistic that Veterans of the War and in particular Operation Overlord (or Operation Atlantic for the Canadians participation on June 6, 1944) have a hard time watching the movie.Now, the events that the 8 soldiers in the movie participate in are an amalgamation of several different events that happened to different people throughout the real war: While Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers Battalion did participate in Overlord, they were at Pointe du Hoc, not Omaha Beach as depicted here. The rescue of Sgt Fredrick Niland was not done by a group of rangers, but rather by a French chaplain. Bridges were a common point of contention and it was not unheard of to see a small group of soldiers defending such an important transportation artery.Saving Private Ryan takes these events and more and weaves them into an incredible story of the courage and honor that has left me stunned time and time again. Unlike so many movie characters these days, I see a depth to these characters. Mellish is a Jew. Miller is a schoolteacher. Jackson is a Christian. And of course the somewhat nerdy Corporal Upham.On the other side we have Steamboat Willie, unfortunately the only German (being German does NOT make him Nazi) soldier we see a whole lot of. It is likely that, like the Americans, he is only following orders, as the Nazi Regime in those days ""recruited"" as many able bodied soldiers as they could - including POWs, like the Czechs.In addition if you think that the blood and gore is an attempt to provide ""entertainment value"" to this film, then maybe you need to look up the real WWII. In contrast SPR is much more sterile in that respect than the war really was. War is a bloody, horrible, terrible thing, and SPR comes very close to that reality. Blown off limbs, spilled guts, and blood are unfortunate realities.If your looking for a film to watch for entertainment value, don't bother with this one. If, on the other hand, you want to watch a movie that is a worthy tribute to our Veterans - American, Canadian, British - this one is well worth your while. Start to finish, this film gives me a sense of pride to think of all those people in our military who fight so hard and put their lives on the line just so ordinary people like myself can stay free and live our lives the way we were meant to. My hat's off to those people, with a heartfelt thanks and prayer.One last note, I have heard of this film (and even the real Operation) being paralleled and compared with the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (or MOHAA for short). Let me be crystal clear on this point: It was a good game (I played it) but it was just that - a game. If you die, you can start over until you win. The same was not true for all the people that gave their lives during this bloody campaign. None of them had a health bar of 100 and a start button for another chance at the battle.My hats off to Steven Spielberg and the Cast for such a superb effort!"
198,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is very rare to see a movie and truly be moved by it. From start to finish, you are so immersed in this film that you are feeling every emotion of every character as if you were them. The true underlying message is often hard for most people to pick out, but if you truly grasp what this movie is about, you will realize just how beautiful a movie can be.The audio in this movie and the gritty, unflinching realism grabs you and pulls you into the war that Spielberg has so incredibly painted on the screen. The opening scene of D-Day is perhaps the single most dramatic and immersive movie experience I have ever come across in my entire life.Unlike most films, every death you witness in this film stabs at your conscience. You truly feel the adrenaline of the killer, the pain of the soldier, and the sorrow of the soldier's friends every time someone dies.This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made, even beyond the war genre. Every piece of this masterpiece is a work of art. The terrifying and realistic sound effects, the emotional and beautiful soundtrack, and the flawless performance by the actors makes this movie unforgettable."
199,"Most of us will never know what it was like on Omaha Beach June 6, 1944. Saving Private Ryan has without a doubt been the most realistic war films ever made. This is as close as most of us will come to know what it was like that day on the beach. Every character in this movie is perfectly cast. Spielbeg shows us once again that he is one of the best directors of his generation. The way he makes every character in the movie seem like an everyman, is so realistic because after all these guys aren't superheroes. There normal blue collar guys who work for a living. This movie might just be the best war movie ever made, it is right up there with Patton, The Longest Day, and Stalag 17. Even if your not a war buff, watch it for the history. And as we all know ""If we do not know history we are doomed to repeat it."""
