0,"Movie that got my complete attention. The story is surprising. Genuine and progressive performance. However, the scene after the credits is illogical and affected the plot. The present antagonist would have no way of making the call. And would have no way of knowing that her version of the past has died. After all, if she from the past died ... She from the present would not exist to do anything. I wouldn't mind having a sad ending, but that ending doesn't make sense. If it had ended up in the cemetery, it would have been consistent and still sad because of the people who died and the traumatic situation of the mother and daughter."
1,"WTF was that ending???
I guess some people don't know when to stop... It made absolutely no sense whatsoever."
2,"Should have stopped at the cemetery scene. But they added a few more scenes in the credits that changed the timeline again. Didn't even make sense since throughout the film, past was calling the present. The present never called the past. Then all of a sudden she warned her past self about dying? If she died, she wouldn't have been able to warn herself. If she didn't die, she shouldn't have disappeared in the present when attacking the other girl. It's as if the writers forgot their own time travel rule. I wish Netflix will edit the credit scenes out. Even as an alternate ending, it wouldn't be plausible."
3,Good scenario with twisted story. You can't really tell who is the real evil one. And for the last months this movie was one the best among those mediocre and boring movies.
4,"The Call is complicated but not in the way it wants to be.
With a story like this one, original and very difficult to properly develop, you can have a great movie or and entertaining one but you need a really capable writer in both the cases. Unfortunately Chung-Hyun Lee is a decent director that knows how to entertain the audience but it's not a writer that knows how to handle a story this particular, even if he was the one that came up with it.
This idea, because this is what we really see here: a great idea, needed more effort into the script to be transposed into something that made sense, instead the screenplay appears shallow, messy and ignorant, with logic too often sacrificed for entertainment purposes leading to plot holes and inconsistent plot twists that make you enjoy the movie less and less until it becomes more disappointing than engaging and more nonsensical than smart."
5,"Good plot (althogh feels little bit similar to Frequency), great action and everything done almost perfectly. I was about to be amazed by how this movie ended until the last scene ruins the movie."
6,"Diabolical. Wicked. Incredible.
This movie is insane in every way. I could not take my eyes off the screen while watching."
7,"There's a few added scenes during the credits which SHOULD NOT be there, please trust me and switch off when they roll.If you do, you will have a cracking movie that will have you glued to the set til the end."
8,"... because without it you can't make Call 2, 3 and 4 - and if you've accepted the events leading up to the close out you pretty much have to accept anything can happen, at any time, with little or no rhyme or reason, evidence or justification. If you can take it for what it is and don't try to examine its flaws too deeply, can wallow in its shallows recognising that certain genres that have been milked close to extinction can still give rise to originality - you'll be thoroughly entertained, albeit feeling a little short changed when the credits begin to roll at the end."
9,"The movie was clearly very written, every scene was not boring which is honestly very rare for movies nowadays. I'm sure the writers knew how to keep people on the edge of their seats; even those with the shortest span of attention. Almost every plot twist made sense and were well-thought of. However, note that I said 'almost'. The 'real' ending of this movie is simply not counted for me. The plot twist is not even understandable. The writers should have left the initial ending as it is, since it was very emotional and I definitely shed some tears, but the ending just left almost everyone with a giant question mark. Very unsatisfying."
10,"One of the best thrillers I've watched as of late. The plot was interesting, and unlike some other time slip stories I've seen. And Park Shin Hye and Jeon Jong Seo are outstanding! Park Shin Hye's acting went from one emotion to the other with much ease. While Jeon Jong Seo was brutal, tormenting you to bits. Overall, this movie was outstanding."
11,"This is one of the best movie have ever watched. I love the story, good acting. I feel the tension really much. That was really different one. Highly recommend to watch."
12,Lee Chung hyeon made a great start in his film career. the storyline not too complicated to understand. the cast played they role perfectly especially Jeon Jong-seo as Young sook. Her acting make me scared to see her. Overall this movie are superb to watch with your family and friends.
13,"You have to buy into the absurd concept of a phone call traveling through time... and there are literally dozens of logical leaps your sane mind will have to make... but if you accept the premise, this Korean thriller generates serious chills. Park Shin-hye is fantastic and pulls together all the loose ends with a superb central performance."
14,The scenes after the credits roll completely ruined the ending of what would have been a really great movie!
15,"Excellent acting of all the casts, brilliant direction and best time lapse. It's unpredictable and mind blowing. No dull moments. The main actresses really nailed it."
16,"Definitely an interesting storyline to it and indeed overall a good movie. The highlights here are the lead characters. If it wasn't for the lack of logical or illogical explanation to things... at whatever level, this would be a much higher rating. But still if the intention is to let your imagination create realities of its own, then we'll done. Good one."
17,"The Call movie was so good... worth to watch...
Park Shin Hye is a great actress in any genre...
They're acting was so amazing...
I'll watched it again and again...
Congratulations to all..."
18,"Spoilers
Well, the plot is really gripping. I cannot stop watching until it ends. But I am a little confused about the ending. Well, I think the heroine is taken captive by the other woman. It is not a happy ending. I feel sad."
19,"What a movie!!!üòÆüòÆüòÆKorean thriller movies are always good and beyond expectation. Park shin hye(seo yeon) and Jeon Jong seo( young sook) both were spectacular. The movie was exceptional from the start to end. The storyline was gripping and engaging which made me watch the movie without boredom. The movie theme is pretty similar to the Korean drama series 'Signal' where communication through different time dimension is done. This movie has used the same theme to justify the different plot. Well, the director has really succeeded to showcase the thriller element in this movie pretty well. The audience who are fan of korean thriller are gonna love this movie!!üëå‚úå"
20,I really appreciate the efforts of the whole cast and crew..I enjoyed watching it.. Parkshinhye and jungseo nailed it.
21,You know it's a good movies when Park Shin Hye is starring.
22,"Park shin hye is really a great actress..""Action Horror Queen"". A hallyu star Goddess congratulations, a very good movie. Great actress.. Congratulations‚ù§ loving it.. I will watch again and again. Recommended Movie 2020."
23,"Even the cemitery ending was not good enough. The movie lost sense in the middle of too many plot twists. An ending with a paradox would be better: After Seo-yeon 'forgiving' her mother during the call with Young-sook, she would let Sook kill her younger version and go to jail forever. This would create a paradox. She doesn't exist in the future, so she never pick up the phone. Sook never saves her dad and is not saved by Seo-yeon as well. The movie starts all over again. The phone rings and Seo-yeon knows exactly what to do: Never pick up the phone (and then let the audience create a theory that she repeated all process until her dad is saved and then she let Sook die LOL)"
24,"It was slow but the acting was suburb on all accounts and Hye showed she can do more then rom coms, she was excellent, the filming was also done well its not a cheap made horror movie.So at the end its not really over when the credits come up if you care to see it all, set up for a sequel i think"
25,"The main actresses, the supporting actors and actresses are amazing!
The writing, the directing, everything!"
26,"WATCH IT AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. (Also, PART 2?!)"
27,"I'm not sure how to fully comprehend the ending timeline here. There are more questions than answers of course to the entirety of the call to begin with. But I guess the main two are:1. How does the phone call connect from 1999 to present day? The viewers are suppose to take it as is I guess, no actual scientific nor paranormal explanation here, just happens as is.2. So the timeline of the two characters continue to progress as is, there's no indication of the present Young-sook alerting herself in the past until the very end and that in itself is a whole conundrum because we see the mom throwing Young-sook over the balcony and then surviving so that Seo-yeon is able to find her mom alive at the cemetery, but then as they both leave the cemetery her mom flickers and disappears because Young-sook survives the fall also. Now if the mom survives with Seo-yeon, wouldn't they call the police or at least find out at some point that Young-sook didn't die so that she would remain a threat? We only have the past calling the present until the very end, where the one instance is Young-sook is calling herself in the past which is a reversal of this mysterious phone communication. How does this happen? Lets say she figured it out and can call herself in the past, how does she find the exact moment to call herself before the mom and the police arrives at the house? Because if both timeline are continually progressing in the past and the present, won't that moment in the past also have passed? And my conundrum here is how this ending is a miss because it doesn't validate the space time continuum sequence of events here. Either leave the ending as is with the mom being alive and Young-sook dead or mom dead because Young-sook never died.Things need to add up even if we're left with a cliff hanger but unfortunately this cliff hanger ended up making no sense."
28,"Such a unique story, wonderful acting, so many twists that you are kept guessing till the end. CGI was pretty nice as well.If you want a happy ending, DO NOT watch those end credits..."
29,"Spent such a good time watching this movie. The actresses did such an Amazing job. BUT, if you are a witness of something in your past, you should be able to remember it in your present and not ask the person in the past what she did. Also the first change made me feel like i was about to watch a princess movie, i lost my immersion to the movie, for a moment. They didn't need to put all that purple and pink. Also, they should've stopped the movie in the cemetery. I still do not understand the ending. But even with those flaws i'll recommend people to watch it, because everything else was sooo good."
30,"Korea Movie is getting better & better. Park Shin Hye & Jun Jong Seo's acting really deserve an award. It's another masterpiece after ""Parasite"""
31,"The film is definitely well made and the director has done an excellent job building up the tension. Jeon Jong Seo continues to impress me and I'm looking forward to see the kind of roles she'll take on in the future. She is the strongest aspect of this movie. I did not enjoy the ending. For me personally, when i'm engaging with a story as terrifying and as devastatingly tragic as this I need there to be some sort of catharsis for the hero and for me along with them. I do not enjoy being left hanging like that."
32,I really liked this. I did think it was a bit slow to start at first but when it gets started...wow! Acting is great as well. There are a few plot holes for me but I don't care. I loved it anyway. Great story.
33,"It is a best scary movie I ever watch. Fresh story and so different from others. I have no words to express how perfect story is it. Park Shin Hye acts so excellent. Good job for the director, actors, and crews"
34,I rated the movie 1 star just because the ending that doesn't make any sense. If the serial killer came back to life and killed the protagonist's mom in the past then the serial killer will proceed to chop the protagonist with the machete anyway instead of vanishing in the air first. The ending doesn't flow with the entire story. Seeming like it is forced upon the whole picture.
35,"This movie made no sense. Yes, I understood exactly what was going on but as it pertains to the story line, it didn't add up. If her past was constantly being changed, her future self should already have experienced everything from her passed meaning she would already have those memories. I also don't like how she's the only one who gets to experience the many alternative futures but no one else. You'd think everyone who's experienced them would experience it but they don't. And her having to figure out how the future changed I think was dumb. Like I get it but that's not how time works, she's already know what was happening.If you knew someone was a serial killer and you knew they were gonna get a life sentence, post already killing two people, would you tell them? No. That not only risks your future life, which was exactly what happened, but you're letting a killer get away with murders.I kept seeing very high reviews but I didn't like this movie at all. The story line was cool but poorly executed. I don't think this movie even could be properly executed because then it wouldn't have that suspenseful thriller you're going for. I guess if you can look passed the awful timeline, you might actually enjoy this movie."
36,"A movie with a really interesting plot and overall nice development. It was really good at making the viewer feel anxious, and it did a really good job with its triller. Also, the acting was amazing.The ending, however, ruined it. Aside from leaving a bad taste in the mouth, it didn't make sense. The future called the past? That's going against the rules the movie set up from the beginning...Furthermore, the cemetery scene left a huge impression, and it gave the movie a meaning: Sometimes you take for granted the people around you and how much they love you. It was perfect. It would've been a great movie if it had stopped there. But then there had to be a credits scene just ignoring the rules the movie set up for the sake of being edgy.I was extremely frustrated and mad at myself for sticking up to see the credits. Leaves a real bad taste in the mouth."
37,This is a very interesting movie that'll keep your mind busy thinking what's gonna happen next until the very end. It has successfully made time travelling and multiverse concept more interesting. However.... The story of the movie creates too many possible timeline that is at some point confusing and the cliffhanger ending is a mess which will leave you more confused if you're looking for a logical conclusion.
38,"The trailer for The Call looked really interesting in the first 10 seconds or so and it went up on my list of movies to watch, real fast. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the rest of the trailer. Little did I know that I was in for a surprise.Sharing information through time, changing the past/present/future, all that sounded familiar to me from movies like Back To The Future, expected very similar things to happen here. But this movie, no-no-no, this turned out to be VERY DIFFERENT. Slightly mind-bending, even.AMAZING acting, GREAT background music that keeps your attention, builds the intensity. Some really good visuals that make you go ""okay, I wasn't expecting that!"" Some really good suspense and thrill as well. Stick around for the credits!Park Shin Hye is a brilliant actress. She, needless to say, did an amazing job conveying all sorts of emotions - happy, sad, angry, scared, etc. But so did Jeon Jong-seo. Tough to say who was better in the movie. In movies like these, the villains seldom get the range of emotions to work with, and given that limitation, I'd say Jong-seo takes the cake, 51-49.I am also glad that the negative role in the movie was played by a female lead, not sure if it was a conscious decision. It would have been nothing new to have a male play that role, not sure if much would have changed in the movie either. But I'm glad that Jong-seo was picked to do this, it was refreshing to see a female killer for a change.Getting back to the movie, I have never wanted find answers as badly as I did after this movie in a long time. I watched the movie as soon as it released on Netflix so the wait for people online to watch it and share their thoughts was painstaking. 2 days of discussion later, I found some answers. Countless Youtube videos later, I still need some answers. Most videos online only discuss the obvious. And I think that adds to the effect that movie has on the audience. 10 years since Inception released, people still discuss the ending. Not that I am comparing The Call to Inception, but for those who watch Korean movies, and watch global thrillers, the ending of this movie will be talked about and discussed for a looong time.Totally worth your time!"
39,"The Call is a story about two people living in different periods of time who can communicate and are linked through a residence they share in common. This movie not only brings an original concept, but also good acting and suspense. It has some plot holes and mediocre CGI; however, it is a worthwhile 2 hour experience overall. Just make sure you keep watching past the first 30 mins or so as it gets more interesting.Rating: 7/10"
40,"A really entertaining thriller with alot of twists
It kept me entertained and it made me question each minute what would happen next, it was unpredictable and the performance of the actors was sublime.But please don't watch the scene after the credits because it'll ruin the whole story.
I suspect they want to make a sequel but that ending just doesn't make any sense at all"
41,"The first half is definitely interesting and keeps the viewers engaged. Then slowly dips into a b level horror film when a thinking thriller would have been much better suited. Several plot holes and average acting prevent this from becoming popular.And yes there are two endings, one before the credits and one after, which is added as a kinda gotcha punch but actually makes zero sense as others have accurately pointed out and just further exposes the poor story line."
42,"I thought I had this one in the bag (i.e. I thought I knew what this film would be about), but half way in I realised what I thought I knew would be the other way round.The good and the bad:
The acting is excellent and the setting is idealTo my knowledge, the story hasn't been done beforeThe film pulls no punches. There is no easing up on any of the characters (no matter how cute or sweet they are)The film will keep you guessing. Just as you think you know what will happen, it all changesIt's not a horror but it gets increasingly creepyI wasn't a fan of the final twist at the end. With so many scare films having a twist at the end, it seems reasonable to assume the writers added the final twist as a way to keep it fresh, but it didn't work for me, and the film would have been better without it.Unpredictable, unsettling and a reasonable story, this film is for people who want a new type of scare film.Highly recommended."
43,"Seems this movie is either inspired or a remake of Hollywood movie ""Frequency"" released twenty years ago. Both movies have similar plots in which two persons from past and future communicate using phone/radio transceiver. However this Korean movie have totally different story from Hollywood movie ""Frequency"". Still this movie is interesting to be watched from the beginning till the end, but there are some flaws towards the ending."
44,"The Call: South Korean film which mixes genres, Horror, Time Travel (sort of), Serial Killer. Two women are in communication via telephone but one lives in 1999, the other in 2019. The past is changed as is the future through their actions and sharing of information. Deaths are undone or delayed, more deaths occur, the protagonists' material circumstances change in front of our eyes, people vanish as the changes wrought means they died years ago. Their contact also results in the creation of a serial killer. We also get a shaman thrown in for good measure. Some really disturbing and violent scenes with a growing atmosphere of dread as the narratives. develop. The differing and changig times periods and the resulting paradoxes are well handled. Written and Directed by Lee Chung-hyun. On Netflix. 8/10."
45,"The Call was a fine Korean thriller that had some very good concept and idea but i felt also like that idea could be explored and used in a little better ways then it was.Characters were little uninteresting to and i wasnt able to connect with them but they had some fine conversations over phone in beginning when they were more friendly and towards middle when staff started to change a bit and film turned into a horror.Story was like i said very unique and cool and im not sure if we ever seen something similiar on paper ,but execution was to messy to make it work"
46,Not bad acting but how did the serial killer know her parents when she was young? Plus the ending when she died but came back to life just because the future self told her to keep her on the phone when the mother and cop came it's a film you only watch once plus it could of been better with a little more planning it's as if they couldn't be bothered to figure out the floors in the movie
47,"This movie didn't make sense at all. They didn't explain enough in the beginning, leaving so many questions unanswered. And the ending was just as puzzling. I would have rather spent my time sleeping, then spend time watching this. So many things that happened just had me lost! I would give this movie a negative rating if I could."
48,It's a very intelligent and well made film. Great concept n good direction. It's a must watch
49,Coming from Korea I expected at least some good suspense and twists. It turned out a B class film with no story line at all. Just pure stupidity. K indly s Kip
50,Worst movie ever. Poor direction. I think even the director didn't understand what the story is all about.
51,Love movies with plot twists! Definitely check this movie out yall. Listen to it in English DUB or Hindi DUB for any of you Indian ppl out there that wanna show their parents this film
52,"The story is like the caller (2011), this set of rationalization has many loopholes, the story is reversed, the traitor has excellent performance, the CG is powerful, netfilx is a rare good movie"
53,The movie is 2 hours of gripping fun. Worth your time. But don't go looking for logic.
54,"Horror, plot twist and everything was awesome, two ending at the end of the video that cause curiosity to viewers, I hope to release part 2"
55,"Great idea, perfect acting and I must say very creative. The plot is not easy to understand in the beginning but eventually it will grab you till the end without leaving your couch for a single second. A Must watch for all the suspense and thrill movie lovers...."
56,"Masterpiece! One of the best movies I'v ever seen!,the Twist was nicely done, the cinematography was just perfect!... All the movie is just wow!"
57,Love the performance and small settings of the film. Very cool twists and grips you from the start. Must watch of 2020
58,"Watch it! You will love the genius and original storyline. But wait until the ending breaks the whole film. I mean, come on ...! The ending is an important element in the storyline of the entire film where the film is finally finished, before the screen turns off. It is not permissible for an ending to be forced in such a way as to fool and override logic. The audience is not as stupid as they think. Oh yeah, also the concept of timeline is so linear."
59,"I have watched thousand movies , but none of them moved me like The Call , such a burst of emotions ranging from Happiness , sadness , thriller , What an amazing movies , well directed , well acted , with an awful ending I know but this is life doesnt have to gave a great ending
must watch , simply amazing"
60,"The Call is a Korean sci-fi thriller/horror film. In this case, the emphasis should definitely be on 'thriller'. Although it starts off very creepy and eventually finds that same creepiness towards the end, the rest of the movie is quite a basic mystery thriller. The thriller elements work great and make this film surprisingly tense.I, like I'm sure many others, went in expecting this to be a horror film. And the film certainly made me think that it's going to be exactly that. The first 20 or so minutes are very creepy and capture the essence of the haunted house genre quite well. However, as soon as the main character figures out what's happening around her, the movie quickly transitions into a fast-paced cat & mouse thriller. I didn't mind this change, but it did catch me a little off guard. The horror elements in the beginning very so convincing that I was sure that the rest of the movie would follow in suit. But it didn't. And truth be told, I'm glad it didn't. I'm not a huge fan of the haunted house genre, and as such, the change of style probably ended up making me like this movie more.The Call tries to stand apart from the rest of the genre through its concept. And fortunately, it succeeds. We find ourselves thrown into the life of Seo-yeon, who receives a mysterious call from an old phone. What we, and her, quickly realize, is that these calls are coming from the same house, but 20 years earlier. Both women, the one living in the past and the one in the present, quickly realize that they are dependent on one another. Both pursue personal interests, and a game of cat and mouse promptly begins. This premise, and idea, add their own twist. Trying to outsmart the other person isn't quite as simple anymore, as they are living two decades apart. Accordingly, both come up with some rather creative ways to try and beat the other. While this concept is great for the most part, it, unfortunately, became quite predictable, which certainly lessened the intensity of the film.One of the best parts about The Call was how it represented loss and gain. There are certain time-line and life-altering moments that have a drastic impact on Seo-yeon's life. Rather than just rely on practical changes, the film goes to great lengths to depict them visually as well. One example might be how her hair changes depending on the state that her life is in. Or how the colours of the film adjust with her. While these types of visual displays wouldn't have been necessary, they added more weight to what was happening.
And while there are a lot of great things in this movie, the aforementioned visuals included, the ending nearly ruins the whole thing. Right before the credits start rolling, I thought that the movie had ended, and I quite liked that ending. However, right after the first credit, another scene happens. And more quickly follow. In total there are four or five scenes that take place in between the actor credits. While they add a certain sense of horror and dread, they were completely unnecessary, and took away what was a very satisfying and appropriate conclusion. So, if you do watch this movie, I would recommend that you stop watching as soon as you feel like you have arrived at the end and as soon as you see the first actor's name credited. The alternative ending simply isn't worth it, and in my opinion, made the movie worse.As a whole, though, there is a lot to like in The Call. It's a very well made film with an interesting and quite engaging concept. While it might not be as much of a horror film as it promises, I, for one, enjoyed the thriller style and thought that it worked very well. If it weren't for the ending and the sometimes too easily predicted story, this could've definitely been one of the better films of the year."
61,"BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD It has such a very good concept, the style and the flow is very nice and the actors and actresses were extremely good BUT and a big one, they blew it by making the main character act dumb and weird. I wanted to shout at her when she litterally didnt care about how she could save her from all that torture and how she didnt read her diary till the end. She litterally acted like everything was normal and ignored her calls when she had already read that her mother was trying to set her on fire. A normal person would definitly not act like she did and it felt like an obvious dumbness added to make the movie go smoother.Btw that ending makes no sense at all, throughout the whole movie they had paralel timelines and time flowed the same for them both and then you take the time back on the other girls timeline? Wtf if she was going to be able to talk to herself from the past it had to be her from after the fall not before the cop came CONCLUSION NO SPOILS If you dont mind those few scenes of dumbness that blew the whole movie its a 9/10, would definitly recommend for a person that doesnt watch films too frequently. If you do mind, dont even watch it you will want to punch the walls for all that lost potential."
62,I just wanna say wtffff.....I don't what happened but woowowo that was amazing I was not expecting it to be this good I definitely recommend watching this.
63,Amazing concept....their acting was superb.....and of course the direction was fabulous....mysterious....like parasite also this movie should get an oscar.....not only me my friends are also loving this movie....and hats of to park shin hye acting....
64,"Overall very good movie I love cinematography, story is very interesting, little bit let down by ending."
65,"Impressive cinematography, sound editing and plot - keeps you hooked until the very end. I would have rated it a 10 if not for the post-credit sequence. That shouldn't have been there. I know the makers planned for a sequel but a story like this doesn't need one."
66,"I thought I knew what was going to happen, but just when I did, another twist got me. Watch until the very end.
I hadn't seen any previews, just good reviews on Twitter, so I went for it and wasn't disappointed.
This one was a long one, but definitely had me with the first shock happening only 30 mins in. This dark sci-fi thriller has you on the edge of your seat almost right away, trying to solve the puzzle even before the pieces are given to you. Would definitely recommend to someone who loves dark thrillers."
67,"This movie is a mind-blowing take on time travel thrillers. It keeps you hooked to the screen with only five major characters throughout the runtime. There are multiple moments where you root for the protagonist - such was the villainy of the other character. One must definitely watch it - one of the best Korean movies I have seen so far!! Though there may be some logic loopholes at the end, it certainly didn't bother me while watching. The narration was gripping and emotional. Best one from Netflix!!"
68,Great movie to keep you on the edge of your seat! I love international or forien films and this one doesn't disappoint.
69,"This was unpredictable and i liked it a lot! The ending-ending was a little unnecesary but other than that i was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time. The characters were interesting and likeable, quite a nice movie!"
70,Which one do you prefer? Your terrible past or your saddest present? This movie will take you in those moments you will be confused to choose between this two. No spoiler just get a experience of this phenomenal movie. I highly recommend to you all.
71,"Interesting movie, the storyline was good but they could've done better. It was okay. Not the greatest, but because the storyline was cool, it made it just okay"
72,"It started off good then just spiraled into a convoluted mess that seem to emphasize serial killing/CGI over story/logic. Great acting/cinematography, but again like what was the point of this movie. Double twist ending, being nice will get you and your family murdered, shamanism is real..."
73,"The beginning starts out boring, but the action picks up. Don't stop the movie at the ending credits because it has a surprise ending shortly after the end credits begin to roll."
74,"Tried so hard to watch it till the end, super non sense one"
75,"This is very atmospheric, very dark, thriller/horror movie, with great actors and nice overall job, directing, script, scenography... hence, I will give it 5. However, something quite similar has already been done, in movie The Caller, from year 2011. Creators of Call either accidentally had similar idea for movie plot or it they were ""inspired"" by ""The Caller"", very similar very dark movie that has exact the same plot. However it was, the message is always don't mess with trying to change the past, don't give away your identity to someone who is in your past as that person obviously has hold on your life and future. So, whatever it is, you can chose between these two movies, western version with similar title or Korean newer movie. But, sorry, this movie is still not original, had been done before."
76,"Ok I guess Korea deserves another Oscar for this original story. I guess this is the rise age for Korean movies, they proved to be 100% better than Hollywood that just keep repeating themselves these days. We need more of these brilliant movies now days."
77,"I'm a big fan of the concept behind 'The Call'. It is similar to the 2000 film 'Frequency', only with a much darker plot. And don't underestimate me calling it dark, this film is seriously dark. Every Korean film I watch seems to have no fear whatsoever of taking risks. While so many American films, even horror ones, play it by the book and keep it safe, the Koreans seem to have no book - and I love it.When you involve any sort of time travel or intersecting time periods in a movie things are going to get complicated. For the most part things play out pretty simply in 'The Call'. It is easy to follow and everything seems to follow similar logic. Then the end comes around and everything blows up in that regard. I've done some thinking about it and watched an explanation video and my conclusion is that it doesn't all quite add up. I absolutely love the ending they went for, but it doesn't make 100% sense when you go back and think about the steps it took to get there. Be your own judge though when you watch it I suggest.We don't see a lot of female villains or serial killers in film. I absolutely love that 'The Call' chooses to go that route, and it does it so well. The villainous character in this film is extremely menacing and captivating to watch. There is no reason more films couldn't take on this challenge. I had a really good time with 'The Call' and would absolutely recommend it as one to check out."
78,"I enjoyed the movie and did not feel bored, but in my opinion the most important element in movies is the story.
The story of the movie is not new, I think it's repeated and I've seen it in a few movies like Mirage (2018) frequency (2000). the movie didn't give me anything new on the story level ."
79,"It is common to have loopholes especially in a movie that deals with time-space. The plot is good, as well as the transition of the events and characters. The characters portrayal are amazing, both actresses nailed it. The ending left me baffled but satisfied. Overall, it is a great movie you wouldn't want to miss. I highly recommend this. Great job to the production and actors."
80,"I must say this is a great piece from Netflix. It's well paced and unpredictable. The acting is good as well.I was gonna rate it 10 until the ending, I was hoping for a happy one."
81,"I love these sort of plots, that messes about with your mind. It was like Pandora's Box, once opened, no going back. Lovely performances from the two female leads and liked the atmospheric setting. Well done to cast, crew and scriptwriter"
82,"The two female leads were amazing in this film. Fantastic and engaging pace, brilliant from start to finish. One of the best in 2020."
83,"Accidently fell on this trailer.. and boy, it was very very well done.. like parasite, if you ever watch that movie..
mindtwist movie!"
84,I'm still trying to figure out the ending and I read all the reviews nobody else got it either. The movie is great until the end everything makes sense and then they confused me with the ending. The movie is soooooo good until then it's a solid 8.
85,"A decent film. I give it 6.5 to 7/10. Atmospheric and a bit of a slow burner, which I enjoy. The version I watched on Canadian Netflix was dubbed. I usually prefer Foreign Films to be subtitled instead of dubbed to get the emotions of the actors in the film, but even the voice-over actors seem to be connected to the scenes and enjoyed that it was dubbed. The story is interesting and kept me enthralled throughout the film. It's nicely shot and the music/sound works. I wouldn't call this a brilliant film but it is definitely worth a watch."
86,"Really really brilliant idea this movie is so crazy! I really love it.
Most of all in my opinion everything is perfect in this movie, where i should start! Brilliant acting and really spectacular directing and screenplay.
If its a mini-series its will be better i think, 2hours really not enough!"
87,"Worst Movie -- Don't waste your time.W - Two Worlds, Kdrama was a good series better than this movie"
88,"Would have liked to give it 9‚≠ê but unfortunately the CONCEPT AND SCREENPLAY was stolen from the movie ""THE CALLER 2011"". Well, to say that the Storyline was different from the 2011s movie and also was way better then thisNice PLOT TWIST, (not for ne as I have already watched the caller 2011)In short a must watch movie if you are searching for variation in storyline"
89,Didnt want or bothered to make an account but had to. The show doesn't make sense in so many ways. Too much plot twists that doesn't work hand in hand.
90,"At some point this movie was good. But how the director flip the ending with illogical thinking was disapointed. The present never calls the past. That's the loggical thinking you brought to this movie. But in the end, how come the present did it to save the past?"
91,"What a great interpretation between the and the future.
As many reviewers said it reminded me of DARK.Story, acting, thrill, suspense.Why The last minute though. It was uncalled for.Overall though. Great movie"
92,"I started to think that ""get out"" is the best psychological horror of this decade since it's nearly end of 2020, but I am glad that I'm wrong. Splendid story telling and cinematography, beautiful character development. above all a compact (felt slow at times, but that's nitpicking,ignore it ) strong and thoughtfully curated plot. Anyone who loves to read good stories will find it intriguing."
93,"Call is a South Korean thriller which revolves around Yeon Seo (portrayed by Park Shin-hye)
who stumbles upon a doorway into the past through receiving a telephone call from Young Sook (portrayed by Jeong Jong-seo) whom is the sole reason why I believe audiences should view this film due to providing an astounding performance as a troubled individual. Forced to endure verbal and physical abuse from her mother. The two characters are separated twenty years apart from each other. Living in
different timelines, they eventually form a relationship based on their similarities and Young Sook reluctantly agrees to help weave a brighter future for her companion. Unfortunately, genuine intentions lead to sinister consequences as the decision to alter events will affect past and present forever.The plot is reminiscent to films such as
The Butterfly Effect (2005) and Looper (2012).
The main theme deals with the concept
of free will and how the choices of the leading characters can affect the lives of those
around them. Although, Call (2020) is slightly less engaging than those films. Initially intrigued with the premise. I personally do not believe this film was executed well. It begins as
a slow burn that becomes tedious to a degree
and it gradually evolves into a film that is
by-the-numbers. I found this to be predictable, the run-time was longer than it should
have been and I stopped caring during the second act due to the lack of emotional attachment I had for the characters. I was exhausted by the time the end credits
started rolling. This film even leaves
an unsatisfactory open-ending for a
sequel that I have no desire toward viewing.I would recommend this film if you have an available schedule this weekend. The cinematography from Jo Young-jik is absolutely gorgeous and the narrative is easy to follow and cohesive but I would certainly not go into this film expecting originality.Follow me on instagram: @joshuarenealvarez"
94,"I like the story, not boring and unpredictable. But i dont like the credit scene. Why the director put that scene?. Its make the whole story fall Apart, and make disappointed"
95,"I already had rated the movie 10 stars then the credits started rolling. Apparently, the movie was not yet done and the writer decided to throw in a twist in the end credit scene that just ruined the movie. Twist was irrational based on the logic of the story and totally spoiled what was a great experience until that point. If you want a ten star movie just make sure to stop watching as soon as the first end credit appears."
96,"This is a masterpiece movie and Movie of the year of 2020 üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
Park Shin Hye's acting is outstandingly amazing. All of thr movie is just WOW üëèüëèüëè"
97,"The best horror movie I've seen in recent years.
I heard it was released on Netflix because of the whole pandemic situation not getting any better. Anyways, I feel lucky watching it at home, though. It would've been a big hit in the cinemas, too."
98,"Great original story, plot, characters! I don't think there was one thing I didn't like about this movie. It was so well put together. Definitely worth watching."
99,"I really love how the events changes in this movie !
I guess a lot of things in in this movie are unpredictable, that's what makes it really entertaining !
I guess Jeon Jong-seo (the crazy actress xD) deserves a prize for that role !
I give it 8 stars not 9 or 10 because there is some logic errors !You should not miss that movie at all ! Deserves your time !"
100,Slowburn but sure dragging audience to hopeless fate.
101,"This movie very good, plot twist very interesting and all cast good acting üëç"
102,"I enjoyed this movie, good acting and production, I had to recogn I didn't understand the ending quite well, then after a couple of times watching it I then realised what happened.
Just a tip, once you have finished watching the movie watch again the first 10 or 15 minutes to understand it much better. The movie goes from low to high and gets higher and higher, I'm the guy that watches a movie in 2 or 3 parts, even in different days, I did watch the whole movie non stopping, so that's good news. :D"
103,I fell for these awesome reviews and wasted 2 hours of my life... amazing acting performances by the lead characters though
104,"Boring i dont recommend, the time is really slow while watching this movie, the idea was great but the execution is a big disappointment ."
105,"I love the way technically, direction, and performance wise this movie has been made, but NO EXPLANATION OF HOW A PHONE CALL CAN CONNECT PAST AND PRESENT TIMELINE INTO EACH OTHER makes this Could Be Fantastic Movie totally Dull for me, except JONG-SEO JUN excellent performance and her fabulous wonderful Beautiful presence."
106,"Basically a remake of the caller 2011
But was an ok film."
107,"Like (almost) everyone in here is saying (a few people gave this a 1, which boggles the mind...), the acting, directing, and plot in this one is all superb. Music too. However, I'm very bothered by the grimdark ending after the initial ending. The movie is already depressing and grimdark as it is with the villainess killing almost everyone (the father dying got me...), then when you finally get some relief at the end when the heroine and her mother survive, they throw in that nonsense post credit scene with the villainess somehow surviving after all (what was up with that, it made no sense?), and killing the mother of the heroine, and keeping the heroine captive...Seriously not cool...Oh well...Really good, but the ending kind of ruined it for me...P.S: I notice some people didn't understand certain things in the movie. It does have a lot of details, after all. I recommend rewatching the movie a second time if there's something you don't get, as that might help, since pretty much everything is actually explained in the movie, you just need to be vigilant while watching. That said, the post credits scene doesn't make any sense to me either..."
108,"Huge and great move , the beast thing you can watch it with friends and family"
109,"This is an absolutely good film, cant believed the director is just 30 years old, so many twists and so little bugs for this kind of genre, both actresses are just great great great, so many good things about this film, cant list them all. Korean movies are always good for a long time, especially horror films are just doing better and better, obvisouly better than hollywood now.( i am not korean =) )"
110,"It's an amazing movie, absolutely amazing. Great suspense and a great story, okay there are some few weak points about the acting but the story is amazing.
Some people didn't understand the ending, well if you watch the movie again and you focus, you will realize that the movie gives you 2 opposite endings, one that pleases you and another one that pisses you off (but it was like a possibility), isn't that just fabulous??!!!"
111,"In this time and age, where only superhero movies are being made somewhat good...This movie is absolutely worth your time. Loved every single bit of it. The story, direction, sound effects, acting, everything."
112,"This is a solid movie, good pacing, great acting from Park Shin Hye. Of course Korean know how to make thrillers. It's definitely worth watching. By the way, I liked the ending, it's perfect."
113,Loved it! The twist was great and the story on the spot. One of the best korean movies to me. If u into mind binding movies then u ll enjoy it for sure.
114,"A refreshing thriller with an airtight script and so many plot twists that you need to keep rewiring your brain to what's happening. Both lead actresses nailed their roles perfectly. Combine that with some amazing cinematography and brilliant direction. Even if all this was not true, I would have given this one a 10/10 just for that ending alone! Definitely a must watch."
115,"Good concept wherein a conversation from a person from the past changes your future. It was nice and all, except for some parts.The plot went crazy when Seo-yeon confronted Young-sook with the death of her neighbor / friend. The way she reacted was a bit illogical in my opinion. He went to the police to confirm the death, then she spoke to someone to describe what Young-sook is like. From here on, she should have realized what kind of person Young-sook is. And from here, she could have gathered herself and know what the consequence would be if they end up not being in good terms.There are some other flawed scenes like the strawberry guy where his instinct told him to use the phone to brag that he's going to get killed instead of running or fighting for his life, the fighting scene where Seo-yeon wanted the possession of the phone instead of fighting for her life, also how the mom acted after seeing her leashed daughter and lastly, the horrible ending that everyone is talking about.Nonetheless it is still watchable despite being more and more disappointing towards the end."
116,"As the first experience for the director, it looks very good starting.The visual effects and cinematography are great
I think the director will have a great future in cinma."
117,"THE CALL is an intriguing Korean thriller with a time travel based premise. It appears to be based on another movie and it has stylistic similarities to other movies such as FREQUENCY, but where this film excels is in the style, with lots of good acting, direction and choreography that continually impresses. It's the kind of film that has a straightforward plot with a big twist you can see coming a mile off, but the journey is so gripping that it doesn't matter. The two actresses, from #ALIVE and BURNING, are both very good in their roles and the film never lets its grip of suspense let up until the very end. It's not always convincing, but it does always remain watchable."
118,"Okay full review here. I won't give away any spoilers.
This is a taught and marvelously inventive little horror film. In what seems to me to be an lift from from the Dennis Quaid/ Jim Cavievel film of 2000, ""Frequency"", we have a young woman who finds an old wireless landline phone in her parents old house. She receives a call one night from a young girl who is about to be murdered by her mother. The hitch here is that the young girl calling had died 10 years earlier.That's all your going to get from me as far as plot. But let me say that this film was a good surprise! It kept breaking my second guesses and what I thought was going to transpire at every turn.Writer/ Director Chung-Hyun Lee has built a marvelous thriller and has gotten two absolutely rock solid performances by actresses Jong-seo Jun and Park Shin-Hye. The film is a must see for all horror fans, but anyone who enjoys a good thriller will be riveted.As with most (if not all) time travel plot lines, there are parallels that shouldn't be possible, but the script is so well written that these conundrums are almost always addressed, and creatively so.It is a roller coaster ride, and as tight as a new catcher's mitt.
Sit back, turn on Netflix. and watch this little beauty. And stay through the end credits as a bit more terror awaits."
119,"Absolutely loved it! I have such an imagination and can usually guess how a film will play out but this one had me guessing till the very end!
Love to watch a movie that will make my jaw drop."
120,"Better than #alive. haha! (since both are park shin hye netflix movie) well this one her acting really stood out, the plot really thickens as the story progress. It was intense and thrilling, the antagonist is also good, she portrayed her role really well. Overall I really love this movie and it looks like were getting a sequel!!! PS: I'm a sucker of time travel movies/series."
121,"It was the best thriller I've seen recently. The script, shooting techniques, acting were very successful."
122,"11/29/2020 Crazy Good!!! Exactly what we look for in scary/tense movies that keep you guessing as the twists evolve. Well conceived, innovative storyline played out with superb actresses. I loved it! Do ""NOT"" pass this movie by, it's excellent. Bon Appetit"
123,"..a brilliant idea made into a brilliant film - tension, twists and edge of your seat stuff! Highly recommended for thriller / suspense fans as it has only a smattering of horror.."
124,"As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10"
