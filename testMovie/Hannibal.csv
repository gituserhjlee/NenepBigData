0,"Having seen the films based on Thomas Harris' novels, I couldn't for the life of me imagine an actor other than Anthony Hopkins for the role of Hannibal Lecter (although I had seen - and liked - Brian Cox' take on the character in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter' which was released before 'The Silence of the Lambs'). Apart from that, I didn't see the point in retelling a story that had already been told very well on film – and with outstanding actors. For those reasons, I deprived myself of the pleasure of watching 'Hannibal' until the second season of the show started - but boy: am I glad I finally got over myself and did start! To those who haven't watched it for the same reasons I didn't I can only say: knowing the storyline from the films (or the books) doesn't spoil this in the least; the writers cleverly play with your expectations and they have taken enough liberties that you can never tell what is going to happen. And Mads Mikkelsen makes for a terrific Hannibal. The cat and mouse play between him and Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is a thrilling joy to watch; the conversations between the two are an example of surgically precise writing where every word counts and could - literally – be a concealed weapon (the writing in general is top notch, especially the dialogues).Visually, this series is unlike anything I've ever seen; the opulence of the images seems to be directly inspired by the aesthetic of oil paintings; whenever food is served or you see the interior of Hannibal's mansion you're reminded of still lives from the Dutch Baroque; certain dreams, visions and hallucinations even recall the works of Hieronymus Bosch. Don't get me wrong: first and foremost this is a gory crime show about an exceptionally well educated and highly intelligent serial killer (and not some ""art show"") – albeit one with a very unique look.My verdict: 'Hannibal' offers gory thrills along with amazing images, fascinating characters and an outstanding cast. Perhaps the most visual – and visually daring – crime show ever. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
1,"I've been a fan of the franchise long before the show came into being, and it did not disappoint! I love how beautiful everything is shot despite all of the horror and gore. The motives and emotions are intricate and the acting is a thing to behold.
Yeah, the third season could use a bit more plot to buff out the poetry but really, I can't fault it much. This is also one of the very few shows that has had a satisfactory ending!"
2,"Anthony Hopkins can be proud of having created one of the first original horror characters of the postwar era. His Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter has rightfully earned a place in the pantheon of legendary monsters. Hopkins was only the second actor to have won an Academy Award for playing a villain, the first being Fredric March for his remarkable performance in the rarely-seen ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931). The American Film Institute lists Hopkins' Lecter as the #1 screen villain in movie history.When I first heard about ""Hannibal"" the TV series, I cringed. Each installment in the film franchise had been exponentially worse than the one before. After Ridley Scott, Brett Ratner, Peter Webber--and even Thomas Harris himself--had tortured Hannibal near to death with their increasingly idiotic sequels to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" a TV series seemed like the sad, humiliating final nail in the doctor's coffin. Would this be ""Dexter"" redux, or another numbingly unoriginal CSI ripoff? Or worse, a tedious 5-season story arc following the personal trials of a young, idealistic, ruggedly handsome, perfectly stubbled Lecter as he spends 65 television hours' worth of time that I will never get back transitioning from noble psychiatrist to vengeful but justified killer? (Note to self: cock hammer, place barrel against temple, pull trigger.) Thankfully, ""Hannibal"" is everything I expected it not to be.I wasn't sure Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen--or any actor, for that matter--could play such an iconic character without being overshadowed by its grand progenitor (i.e., Hopkins), however ""Hannibal"" is so beautifully written, acted and directed that it transcends the inevitable comparisons. Hopkins played Lecter with hellish glee. He was the serial killer as prankster, a thinking man's Joker without the facial scars. Mikkelsen's Lecter is quieter and deadlier. He's almost like an alien predator, or a velociraptor in human form. When he smiles, you're probably about to die. Mikkelsen is chilling, funny, and blazingly brilliant. He totally makes the role his own, but that's not to take anything away from Anthony Hopkins. Asking who makes the better Lecter is like asking who's the best Dracula, Lugosi or Lee. They're both great, they're just different.I dislike police procedurals. They bore me. But ""Hannibal"" is different. There's something special about it. Bryan Fuller respects the characters and he understands the fans. He's given Lecter his first legitimate resurrection since ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and I am completely hooked. (And to think that we still have Eddie Izzard and Gillian Anderson to look forward to!)Fantastic show. High kudos to NBC for having the courage to air it."
3,"First of all, this has the BEST script EVER! a script worth to be learned by heart, the delivery, the word choice are so aesthetic.Then, the story is compelling, the BRUTALITY is tempting, the Music is fascinating, the elegance is inspiring, the cooking is appetizing ...Hannibal characterizes the natural perfection, his facial expression is so cold and lifeless yet shines with an unearthly abnormal confidence. He's a multiskilled person who has an encyclopedic knowledge, He honors his carcasses by displaying them in an artful piece and also by not wasting their organs.This series will make you have several EYEGASMS and EARGASMS ! This is not for the simple minded half wits of course !!!"
4,"This show is exactly what I have been waiting for. It's unique, beautifully dark, and incredibly artistic and every sense of the word. The entire cast are amazing incredible actors! Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter, who knew someone could portray him better than Anthony Hopkins. I've seen all three seasons over and over again and I am not bored! All I could ever ask for is a season foue and hopefully many more!"
5,"This is more than a TV show, it is a work of art. The cinematography is amazing, it is filmed beautifully and every image is a well-thought-out picture. The dialogues are deep and full of subtle meaning, as the characters mostly try to understand each other's way of thinking or try to manipulate one another. Throughout the series Hannibal and Will get to know and understand each other and as a viewer you get to experience the same thought processes, as empathy is a major theme in the show.The images with dead people are so horrific but gorgeous at the same time that you find yourself mesmerized by the beauty of death. Also, the series finale is in my opinion one of the best ever. It is truly an amazing show."
6,"Hannibal Review
I will not talk long, it is an exceptional series that requires some episodes until you get it strong and if you get it it will be one of your favorites.
The first season's rating is 9.0 / 10
Second season 9.9 / 10
Third season 9.0"
7,"I don't know how many time I've watched it, it's just a master piece. The visual is incredible and the casting and character are sooooo great. Bryan Fuller is such an artist I love him for giving us this show."
8,"If you're wondering, this drama does not follow the story line of the previous Hannibal film franchise. However, it does not mean that the series doesn't pack its own punch in terms of tension and suspense. (I'm in such awe, I feel inadequate trying to leave a review for this show. I won't reveal any more than what is available on the wikipedia page.)Following protagonist Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) into his mind and peering into the distorted lives and actions of serial killers, he comes across as a highly intelligent but often conflicted man, tormented by his own imagination and yet has to live it each day for the greater good. This sense of vulnerability and instability caused by his personality (largely introverted and antisocial) is preyed upon by his psychiatrist, famed Hannibal Lecter, excellently portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, and as all this is played out, the audience, privy to this knowledge will be gripped by suspense, and the never ending tension, even on scenes where nothing appears to be happening, the mood takes on a somber and tense tone. For those who are concerned with the relative 'low level of gore', be patient. It takes its time to build and slowly escalate, bringing Graham deeper into the shadows and mental torment.I can't emphasize how good the acting is, how vivid and artistic the abstract dream and killing sequences are. the fact that the soundtracks are well selected and not obnoxious all plays a part in creating one of the best viewing experiences ever. As a fan of psychological horror, I feel privileged to be able to take a small peek at this show ahead of broadcast."
9,"Truly superb writing, casting, acting, direction and editing. This show is a work of art. If you can, please watch in a quiet, intimate setting to truly appreciate the elegant horror being served. I have never been as impressed with a series as I am with this one. It's very surprising that a show this dark was on network television, I can't see the NBC viewer appreciating such darkness. I'm preparing for a second viewing of all the seasons. It was perfection to the very end."
10,Ummm how did season 3 get so poorly done? After the masterpiece assembled in season 1-2. Am I missing something?
11,"Based on the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham, this masterpiece watches Hannibal twist his way into the lives and minds of everyone he comes across."
12,"Starts off as a disturbingly beautiful crime-gore series several cuts better than the usual TV/Movie stuff but ends up very much a character drama featuring a co-dependent relationship even weirder than that Walt & Jesse on BraBa. The show never abandons crime completely but it becomes less of a ""law enforcement"" show and more...well, romantic. But romantic, the likes of which I had never seen depicted before on TV. Unforgettable story, definitely"
13,"If you thought Anthony Hopkins was creepy in the Hannibal movie series, Mads Mikkelsen will astound you as the iconic characters of Hannibal Lecter. This series is worth watching just for his unsettling and enthralling portrayal, but everything about Hannibal is incredible. The cinematography is so far above the standard of any show, you'll get chills. Throw in the incredible chemistry between Mads and Will Dancy (who portrays the main protagonist Will Graham), this will (hopefully) be a measure of prestige police procedurals for decades to come"
14,"I remember watching this show while my friend and i used to commute. What started as a casual timepass soon turned out addict, and we couldn't wait watching a couple of episodes everyday.Good acting by primary and side casts. But its the antagonist who stole the show. Mads Mikkelson had surpassed everyone with his quirky acting and frantic skills. I mean we used to feel pity on his victims but that never changed our mind to hate him.A must watch."
15,"We have come through the last couple of years with some excellent TV programming. dialog, writing, directing, acting some of the episodes if not entire seasons trashing anything that was showing at the local megaplex. Just like most here I was highly skeptical at the idea of a made for TV Hannibal, as Robert Downey is to Iron Man and Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine.......for me Anthony Hopkins was to Hannibal Lecter. Well no more. When telling people about this show, that's what I use as an approach. When you think of Hannibal Lecter you tend to think of Anthony Hopkins. Well not anymore, what a tribute to Mads Mikkelsen that he could take this amazing pop culture character and and so firmly attach his name to it. If you have been skeptical or just not ""seeing"" you're doing yourself a great disservice in not checking this out. I absolutely LOATHE that comcast now charges for past seasons of network shows, but this is the only one that I would ever say is worth purchasing and viewing before season 3 gets here. Hannibal is excellent television."
16,"If you are a bit skeptical about this show like me, do not worry. With all the sequels and prequels we've seen regarding Hannibal Lecter, it's an understatement to say there are lots of areas where the creators, directors and actors to over play the gore and story arcs. However, they've managed to balance all these superbly. The title may be Hannibal, right from the start this show is very much a vehicle for Hugh Dancy. Who as Will Graham gives an excellent perspective on his character and i dare say he does a better job than Edward Norton. Mads Mikkelsen with his subtle approach on Dr.Hannibal Lecter is a revelation. His sophisticated and stylish portrayal is captivating and very unpredictable. The show delivers on every front- the writing, editing etc is as good as it gets. Can't wait to see the next episode. Highly recommended it you're looking for a clever and engaging physiological thriller."
17,"If one can put away all the movies aside, store you're memories of them some far off vast empty place in your mind, and watch Hannibal without any recollection of the previous films, Hannibal will blow your mind! This show goes where no one has ever gone before...deep into the mind of Thomas Harris. Deep into the minds of all his characters from Red Dragon.Will Graham is a memorable character, as well as Hannibal Lector. However, I am most in awe of the Francis Dollarhyde character (which was beautifully depicted in Red Dragon novel) and can't to see the show when he comes into play. I'm curious to see who is going to play Dollarhyde.My only fear is that I hope the show doesn't get pulled. I hope NBC can continue the show and keep it afresh for each endless season. I know, it's asking a lot. I don't normally what any a lot of shows, but this one's got my undivided attention. Kudos to it's creators and cast. Brilliant work!"
18,"My favorite three shows right now are Mad Men, Game of Thrones and Hannibal, and while they are vastly different in subject and style, they share several traits that make them a cut above the rest. The writing is excellent, the acting well played and the actors perfectly cast, and all three have a production value and aesthetic that elevates them above your average show. There is a sense of perfectionism and obsessive dedication to quality by their creators, which I think is what makes their fan bases as loyal as they are. There is a sense that the authors are writing to an audience they respect. There is no spoon feeding of plot or dumbing down of dialog. Intelligent characters are consistent in their decision making; things play out in a manner that makes sense, allowing one to relax into the suspension of disbelief that is so addictive about good storytelling. Every detail is delicately handled and placed just so.Hannibal beings long before the events already so well known in pop culture due to the popularity of the films and books, so there is no rehashing of material (so far). It is delightful to watch as the characters unfold, giving tiny, succulent tastes of what is to come. The chemistry in the cast is electric, yet you can feel the camaraderie as well. The acting is of a caliber rarely seen on television, where nothing is exaggerated unnecessarily, and words are not used when a twitch of a lip or an eye flicker will do. The writing supports this, trusting the players to transmit their layered characterization and inner workings without too-obvious statements and unnecessary melodrama. While the subject matter is gruesome and intense in nature, it is surprising how beautiful everything is. In contrast to the turmoil and savagery of the proceedings, there are long shots of stunning locations and meticulously crafted sets gorgeously, perfectly lit, masterfully composed to speak as loudly as any dialog. It is the silences in Hannibal that are the most powerful to me, the long stretches of music and sounds which emote so strongly. It is a sign of great writing that I am not disappointed that when they are broken by speaking, it is to add to the tension, not break it. It is clear that this show is a labor of love produced by talents enamored of the material. With the first season half way through, there is no sign of the quality dropping and the show is seeming to hit its stride. If the ratings can keep up (it's recent acquisition by Amazon will no doubt help things along) I look forward to the show having many (7 or more, by the producer's plans) more seasons to flesh itself out. After all, the best dishes take their time to prepare, and these people take their palates deadly seriously. Even if serial killer horror shows aren't your thing, it's worth trying everything at least once. ;)"
19,"Before watching this series I wondered ""Why in the world would they try to recreate the Hannibal movie series? It's been done! It's over! No one can replace Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal!!"" Boy was I wrong. Mads Mikkelsen shows off some seriously unique acting chops throughout this entire series! I absolutely hated him in the Bond film Casino Royale(In a good way!) I hated him because he was so twisted, evil, smart and cunning as the villain and all those traits are magnified throughout the 39 episodes of this series. It's gruesome and horrifically violent and even though I was cringing because it seems so realistic I was simultaneously wildly-entertained all the while! There simply isn't enough time to tell the full Hannibal story over 3 movies and appreciate all the details so I realize now this 3 season series is entirely justified. As someone who's suffered with ADHD for most of my life I also appreciate the mental health aspect behind this series. with the time of a TV series you get a chance to go under the hood of Hannibal the psychiatrist and in a 2-hour hollywood movie there just isn't enough time to dig deep into mental health in what separates Special FBI agents, serial killers or average ordinary people. I found the whole series thought provoking and very interesting."
20,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this, and the preview/promo that I had seen didn't make me much excited about it. But honestly, I kinda loved the pilot and see a lot of potential here. Hugh Dancy is superb as Special Agent Will Graham and Mads Mikkelsen does justice to the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Exceptional acting all around...I've read a few people complaining of the series moving a bit too fast, but I found that not to be the case. The pace so far has been perfect and I certainly hope that it doesn't slow it down much.For a moment, the first dream/killing sequence reminded me of another series (unforgettable) but Hannibal does these scenes in an extremely vivid and artistic manner that you just can't not love. The score is well selected and goes well with all the scenes.Looking forward to seeing how the story pans out with time. And judging by the preview that they gave at the end of the first episode, I'm expecting I'll love it a lot more!A must-watch for anyone who likes psychological thrillers."
21,"The story is so packed with different things happening. It is forty minutes long, yet it feels closer to an entire film. It is quite fascinating and highly entertaining. It is not filled with eye candy, but with deeper dialog with some special effects. It gives the viewer a deeper insight into the borderline delusions of the main character.The dialog is fantastically written. It is a combination of imagination and horror. This blend creates a psychological horror that grips you to you very soul. The only possible bad thing that I could say about it is Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) accent. It should be a higher class a more aristocratic richness instead of the thick coarse German accent, but that is merely semantics.The series has a strong mentor-ship like connection between Graham and Hannibal Lecter that is improved by the clear mental instability of both. It makes you wonder what Hannibal Lecter sees for the future.The Graham character is not much like the one of red dragon, yet it is a great improvement with the modernization of him. This is a rather exceptional series and I hope to see plenty of it in the future."
22,"Every thing about this show is great (acting\ direction \ story line ) i cant understand how can a show make me hooked to the screen as much as hannibal did , i did finish the show in 4 days , if you are a fan of horror or not this show is for you just watch ."
23,"One of my all-time favorite shows. It's a miracle NBC allowed Bryan Fuller to really go for the gold with Hannibal, which features HBO level violence (how did they get away with some of this stuff on broadcast?!), a serialized story after most of the first season, intense and intelligent character focus, surreal and psychedelic visuals, and a central character who is not only a brutal psychopath who eats his victims, but is also incredible charming and likable despite it (he's essentially the devil among us, charming us into temptation).Mads Mikklesen truly knocks it out of the park as Hannibal Lecter, creating a nuanced character and avoiding attempting to emulate Anthony Hopkins' iconic performance. To me, Hopkins' iconic performance in Silence of the Lambs is incredible and very worthy of his oscar win, but his follow-up appearances cranked his level of crazy into sometimes cartoonish levels. Sure, he was still a lot of fun to watch, but he had become a slasher villain. Just my opinion, of course, and I still enjoy those movies. But Mads created a sophisticated beast, one who we all know is a monster but is so damn good at convincing the world around him that he is the ultimate friend and confidante. His incredible charm and his knowing, tiny little smile he makes whenever someone says something to which only he (and the audience) know the truth about is both funny and disturbing. He loves being a snake in the grass, and loves seeing how the world shapes itself as he continually disturbs it. As the show goes on, the devil inside gets plenty of chances to unleash too, and Mads' background as both a dancer and in prior action roles allow him to be absolutely ferocious when he strikes.And his relationship with Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is an amazing story of friendship and murder. Dancy plays Graham as an emotional disturbed FBI profiler with a monkey paw gift: an incredible depth of empathy and knack for detail that allows him to think exactly like a killer and recreate crime scenes, but at the cost of his mental state. Will is possibly on the spectrum already and is constantly battling his deteriorating sanity, with Hannibal both helping him (as his therapist and friend) and hurting him (as an intelligent psychopath) depending on the situation. Dancy is great, creating will as a both a wounded dog and rabid wolf who must navigate awful circumstances. The journey he goes on through three seasons is very unique, and he and Mads have great chemistry together.I could go on and on about the rest: the visual style is incredibly unique, the music is surreal and haunting, the supporting cast (including Laurence Fishbourne, Gillian Anderson, Gina Torres, Eddie Izzard, etc.) is great, and despite the series cancellation berfore Fuller's original six-year plan it ends on a satisfying note. It's a relatively quick watch as well, with only the first half of season 3 feeling a little slow thanks to some indulgence in the individual characters and a breathtaking visual and location shift (I loved it, but I know some people felt those episodes are a little slow).Last words: Can't recommend enough if you like dark stories and humor or are overall fans of the Hannibal Lecter character or series. It's a great remix of Thomas Harris' creation and is only missing the Silence of the Lambs bits (those characters are owned by MGM who wouldn't allow them to be used in the show unfortunately.). Bon Appetit *raises wine glass*"
24,"I have seen the films and prequel, yet did not realize how Anthony Hopkins hams the role until I saw the series. Mads Mikkleson as Lecter is superb, carrying the caché and sophistication of an educated serial killer which can not be touched. The script aides the story of Hannibal sufficiently to create the most superlative of series. It may seem too artistic to some, yet the character is exemplified within this series and it is a pity that the same could not have been done to a prequel, which if made in the same style, would certainly explore the origins of such a person as Hannibal in a similar way.
Gillian Anderson is well cast as the therapist and wife of the anti-hero, as is Lawrence Fishburne as his FIB opposite. Hugh Dancy is excellent as savant Will, somewhat autistic yet able to empathise and attain the mind of Hannibal. And the production is also amazing, rich in culture and location.
The first two series are amazing and well paced. The third is a little slow until they were told the fourth would not happen, then accelerates to create an excellent finish. So wait until episode 4 in series 3 for it to switch up a gear.
The cast, photography and story is beyond words, bringing the true Hannibal Lecter to life. The films, save Hannibal Rising, are nothing compared to the series which has the time to explore his nature and magnificent mind. Will's role is equally explored and brings justice to the character created by Thomas Harris in a way that is brilliantly explored by the script writer.
Some of the scripting is identical to the films and sometimes seems a little arty, but is matched by the quality of acting and necessity to the storytelling.
In the 3 series, Mads Mikkelson owns the character of Hannibal and you cannot watch the films in the same light afterwards, as he carries the character well and so much better than Hopkins ever could, except maybe in the Silence of the Lambs.
I urge you to watch the series and observe the brilliant marriage of art and story. Mads owns the role which was borrowed, momentarily, by Hopkins."
25,"Boy am I glad that I stumbled onto this series. I was pretty bored with all of the current TV shows which I've been watching (well, that's really only Dexter and True Blood at the moment) or they've been on break. Hannibal hooked me right from the first episode and after seeing the whole season I'd say it's right up there among my favorite TV shows. Mads Mikkelsen is a fantastic and charismatic screen presence and his portrayal of the understated and calm Hannibal is very unsettling and mesmerizing. I've loved his diverse roles in Casino Royale, After the Wedding, The Hunt and The Royal Affair and he doesn't disappoint in this show either. Hugh Dancy is also great as the tormented FBI profiler Will who can get inside the mind of a psychopath and imagine the crime occurring again. As time goes on this weighs on his psyche more and more. I loved his portrayal of a man with Asperger's Syndrome in Adam, he really seems to have a knack for portraying these kind of roles. The relationship between Will and Hannibal in the show is very interesting and filled with suspense as Hannibal subtly manipulates Will. The supporting cast is extremely solid as well. The visuals of the show are very arresting, some of the murder scenes are especially striking. I also really liked the scenes where Hannibal is preparing food and presenting it to his guests. Those scenes are really beautiful in a twisted way. One of the most critical parts about the show however is the sound design. The sound effects are tremendously creepy as is the music. They're used very effectively to create a creepy and disturbing atmosphere. There's an almost hypnotic feeling to the show's mood and tone. The killers Will faces in the show are very interesting and imaginative. I also liked that they weren't just ""killer of the week"" variety but that the killers are actually tied into the story in meaningful ways. Season 1 of Hannibal was really gripping and it's definitely my favorite of the newer TV shows. After such an intense season I'm really eager and excited to find out how they continue the story in season 2. However, I'm kind of hoping that the show won't go on for too many seasons because I have a feeling that it would get way too implausible. But so far so good."
26,"The first season feels more like a prelude of what's to come. A introduction to the characters of sort. Regardless, it's some of the best tv I've seen (season 2 & 3 far exceed it.), what a show."
27,"This show is quite good and very intense. It's one of most disturbing stories I ever watched. It shows how far a disturbed but genious mind can go. Weak people cannot watch it, I think."
28,"Absolutely loved this series, never a dull moment, every episode was thoroughly enjoyable, fantastic acting and packed with realistic gore, quite sad that it was cancelled and there won't be a season 4."
29,"Two episodes in and I'm admiring this curiously crafted, visually stunning (and very risky) program. I entered into this show as a fan of the novels and films (with the exception of 'Hannibal' 2001). Last week's pilot was considerably rushed (I felt an extra 30 mins to flesh out the crime would have evened the pacing) however this 2nd episode really nailed me with the tone, and development of the characters. Hannibal and Will Graham, predator and prey (one character unwittingly). Sure there are some cheap moves for shock value and and certainly the investigations are rushed to make room for the greater psychological thriller, yet the time and craft spent on creating haunting atmosphere and imagery really help to dispel the smaller annoyances. This show is as sophisticated as the sauce being served with Hannibal's loin of pork. Even though this show seems intent on the trappings of a police procedural I am very seduced by the bonding (and manipulation) between Hannibal and Graham. Intellectual peers although one is weak and the other exuding strength. I thought this week was terrific in terms of setting up the trust between patient and doctor. Moreover, Mikkelson, who I found wooded and sterile in the pilot really begins to flex his characters charisma and control. Hannibal is a monster and Mads is perfectly cast. The show expertly sets the tension that he is already 5 plays ahead of everyone. Dancy impressed me as well. Two episodes in and your already experiencing the brilliantly frail and dark mind of Will Graham. The labels of 'finest china', 'broken pony' are perfect labels for his embodied genius who is also a tortured soul. Someone who suppresses the impulse to kill like a recovering alcoholic avoids mouthwash. I know many will knock the casting but after watching a decade of stale, wooden acting of 'Criminal Minds, CSI:Everywhere, NCIS's casting... and so on it's gratifying to see actors with depth and a script that allows them to emote pain and fear. And Larry Fishburne even elevates himself from CSI land (not a bad show, however this is a step up). I'm admittedly a pretty picky viewer. Since HBO's The Sopranos graced the screen there have been very little network TV that I've been inclined to tune into. Aside from LOST, The Good Wife and a few other programs that have been here and gone (cancellation) I've had a steady diet of serial based cable dramas to fill my TV time. BREAKING BAD, THE WIRE, JUSTIFIED, SOA, THE WALKING DEAD, THE KILLING, MAD MEN, DEADWOOD, THE SHIELD, HOMELAND, BOARDWALK EMPIRE... I could go on but the message here is that the networks offer me little to invest in. Kudos NBC and Bryan Fuller here. I could see myself watching this for 13 episodes (the series run). I don't shake my head at the screen and feel my intelligence is being cheated here."
30,"'Hannibal' is one of the most breathtaking, incredible, smart shows I've had the pleasure of encountering. Nothing could be fully compared to its beauty and elegance. Every case is unusual, unique and chilling, and despite knowing who Hannibal Lecter is, he still manages to surprise you at every turn. The intelligence, the sharp mind he possess is frightening, and while what he does is horrific, from some point of view his actions can be understood. Don't people kill animals, hunt animals, make tests on animals, considering them lesser beings? Is it so surprising that one day another monster can appear, one that would target humans instead? Hannibal isn't a supernatural creature, he isn't even very strong physically, but he's cunning, clever and manipulative, and he's always ten steps ahead. Almost always – enter Will Graham.Will is a character who I personally consider even more interesting and complicated than Hannibal. Hannibal doesn't consider human lives important, he's a very dark, yet polite, murderer while Will doesn't understand which side he is on. There are darkness and light in him, fighting for dominance, and you can never be sure which one will win. His gift made him open and vulnerable to dark impulses that have already been developing inside. The meeting with Hannibal forever changed his life.The relationship between Hannibal and William is one of a kind, romantic in a morbid, fascinating way. Love and hatred, resentment and forgiveness keep them apart and then unite them – only to break them again. They can't live without each other, but it's also almost impossible for them to live together, because no matter how much Will understands and 'sees' Hannibal, his moral compass is strong. The constant psychological battle between them is fascinating to watch.The episodes constantly kept me on the edge, surprised and shocked me. I loved every season, every episode, even though they were different. Some were procedural, 'monsters of the week', some were purely psychological, especially in Season 3, some were continuation of the stories told.There is blood, and there are deaths, and cruelty, but the elegance of it all makes you fascinated rather than revolted. It's shown beautifully and 'politely', even the most horrible of things. This is the show that deserves worldwide recognition, though it's not for everyone, considering how lazy to understand and analyze a lot of people have gotten.Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are unforgettable and fantastic. I could watch them, and 'Hannibal', forever."
31,"The number of I-hate-you-then-I-love-you moments I have had during watching NBC's Hannibal since it started in 2013 until it sadly (for us viewers) ended last Saturday is too great to count. However, the disappointment I am feeling right now because I will see no more of Hannibal is a success in and of itself. At first I did not know how to go about this review in the most logical way possible (it is really hard to convince my mind to do so!) so I came up with the 'ingenious' idea of putting my remarks into points as randomly as they jump to my head:-Bryan Fuller is brilliant, there is no doubt. His decisions to carry Thomas Harris's novels to the surreal and metaphysical realm and to focus on the complicated/mind-twisting/homoerotic relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham are very bold. Nonetheless, Fuller delved so deep into surreality it sometimes cost the show its sense of realness. Do not get me wrong, I am and always be pro adaptation of all sorts and kinds, but Harris's Hannibal saga is basically a unique study of the human psyche and its psychological dimensions – something you cannot tackle without having at least one foot in reality. What makes Hannibal Lecter a truly frightening character is that he feels very real and if you drop that, all you have is a mythical character no different than Sisyphus or Medusa. This is my only problem with the show. The result was unmistakable pretentiousness in storyline and dialogue, especially in season 1. It is smart, I admit, but in which universe would a dialogue like that take place? It feels pompous and forced. Same can be said about some turns of events; each of the series primary characters has been stabbed, burned, or shot at least three times over the course of the show, yet they miraculously managed to come back to life! As a result I lost my sense of surprise. By the time I reached season 3, I was like ""Oh, X lost his head. No problem, he'll somehow find his way back to the show."" In Egyptian Arabic there is a saying that describes inexplicable events in films and it goes ""el mokhreg ayez keda"" which roughly translates to ""because the director wants it so!"" Fuller definitely wants it so.-If you get over the above mentioned problem you will find the show utterly phenomenal. The dynamics between Hannibal and Will especially in seasons 2 and 3 are captivating and make up for the sometimes awkward dialogue. In the last two seasons events move faster and become more focused on the Hannibal-Will relationship which gets compellingly more rounded. It is by far the most twisted and gripping romance of the 21st century. Season 3 is remarkable too with the introduction of the Red Dragon which pumps new blood in the aesthetics-invested season.-Want to know more about the aesthetics of voyeurism? Watch Hannibal. The imagery picks on the surreal side of the story and turns it into a feast for the eyes indeed. I will never forget the sinister Wendigo, the dying stag, and the wings of the Red Dragon. In spite of the gory nature of some scenes, the literally breathtaking cinematography transforms them into surreal sensuous/sensual paintings that you would want to see again and again. That effect is greatly aided by the artistic editing and the choice of music – end result is transcendental. The murder scene in season 3 finale ""The Wrath of the Lamb"" is an example. Imagine with me this stomach- churning scene: two men covered in blood trying to kill another man by stabbing, slashing and biting him. Naturally, nothing pleasant or aesthetic can come out of it; however, it turns out to be the most beautiful thing I have seen in a very long time. Surreal. Horrifying. Mesmerizing. Heart- wrenching. Also, Siouxsie Sioux' song ""Love Crime"" makes it hit deeper in the heart.-Everyone on the show did a brilliant job, even though Hugh Dancy (Will Graham) was overdoing it sometimes, but once you get used to his performance you can sit back and enjoy the chemistry between him and Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal Lecter) play out. Richard Armitage was one hell of a pleasant surprise.The only person that was unbearably annoying is Gillian Anderson playing Bedilia Du Maurier. As a character, I couldn't wrap my head around her motives and development – I think Fuller put her there only to serve as a receiver of Hannibal's and Will's mind contents. As an actor, her poker face and slow articulation made me want to slit my wrists every time she was on screen.-Saving the best for last, let's talk some Mads Mikkelsen. I will try my best to put his overwhelming sex appeal and my apparent subjectivity aside.. but heck with objectivity! Objectivity is a delusion, so just let me take a deep breath and start rambling about this Danish talent. Anthony Hopkins' name is forever linked to Hannibal Lecter because of his legendary performance in the cinematic adaptation with no prospects of anyone even coming close. Mikkelsen did it. I am not saying he is better than Hopkins, all I am saying is he was smart enough to decide to play a different tune and show us a new side of Hannibal.. the charmer, the mind player, and the vulnerable as well. Thanks to Bryan Fuller and Mikkelsen, Hannibal Lecter's character becomes alive again with so much vigor and articulate details missing in previous adaptations. His clothes, his movements, his choice of words, his highly controlled facial expressions – everything he does unpretentiously and effortlessly oozes menace.If this show was a living being, Mikkelsen would definitely be the heart of it.Seriously, who would have thought that watching a cannibal kill people and cook them for meals would be that yummy?"
32,"I have to say I am very impressed with how the spin-off series of Hannibal Lector has turned out. While I was a little worried at first after hearing the idea to create a series based on the most famous cannibal in the history of film, the series have placed my fears to rest.The series follows Will Graham, a profiler for the FBI, and his journey into the minds of the darkest criminals. It is his daily job to think like the psychopaths they deal with and this has left a great toll on his mind. To protect what sanity he had left, he decided to leave. However, once he is manipulated into coming back to the FBI, he must learn new ways to protect himself from the dangerous profession he is involved in. So along comes Dr. Hannibal Lector, a psychiatrist who Will becomes close to. While Will confides in Dr. Lector his deepest, darkest secrets, he has no idea that the man he is speaking to is actually one of the greatest serial killers (and cannibals) the FBI has ever searched for.With such a dark story leading the way for this show, the fear would be that NBC just isn't free enough to do the material justice. A show such as ""Hannibal"" would be more suitable for cable TV channels such as AMC or FX, that would be the thought at least. However, NBC proves naysayers otherwise by showing just how fearless they can be when the time calls for it. They truly dive deep into a world that is dark and macabre in ways that even match ""American Horror Story"" by creating an atmosphere that is chilling and disturbing. They especially do this with terrifyingly graphic imagery. Honestly, with how far the show seems to go at times I am amazed they didn't end up having to tone things down or risk getting booted. Happily though, the show is still going strong with its wonderfully macabre world still intact.But it is the chemistry between the two leading actors that really sells the show. Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen do fantastic work in the leads. Dancy shines as the poor Will Graham. You can really see the tragedy behind his eyes as he goes deeper and deeper into a dark world where he might never come back from. And that is what makes him very different from the team on CBS's ""Criminal Minds."" Throughout the series you can see him as a truly broken man and what little of him that's holding together is also crumbling. All the while it almost seems he is entirely alone through this situation. However, he does have someone and that is Dr. Lector. Mikkelsen does some truly fantastic work as Lector. He brings the charisma and cultured intelligence that is Hannibal Lector to new life on screen. Of course he comes into the picture in the shadow of the great Anthony Hopkins who made this character what he is today but Mikkelsen does a great job at making this character his own. Both of these actors do great jobs at giving fresh spins to two very well-known characters. Fantastic work by the both of them.This is a great piece of television here. We find ourselves completely immersed into a world that is haunting on many levels and that is why this show works. The show succeeds by giving audiences an intelligent look into the mind of a man going slowly insane while giving us a look at one who has already gone insane."
33,"I don't normally review TV shows, but after seeing the pilot of Hannibal, I am compelled. As the (arguably) foremost monster of all time, Hannibal Lechter still fascinates and appalls us at the same time. His suave, debonair demeanor and taste, combined with his overwhelming brilliance makes him the most attractive monster since Dexter (or Gary Oldman in Dracula). So it was with great expectations and serious doubts that I approached NBC's Hannibal. After all, besides praising the Obama administration, what does NBC do well? I was very pleasantly surprised.Hugh Dancy (Will Graham) and Mads Mikkelson (Hannibal) are great. As they work together on the current case, they are probing each other's psyche and working to establish control, command, dominance over the other (naturally more on Dr. Lechter's part that Will's). In a take off on Dexter, Dr. Lechter is part of the team the FBI has brought in to help solve the latest serial killer problem. What is always compelling about Hannibal is that he always is in control. He has thought out how he will proceed, how he will step in the water closely with those who would naturally want to stop him in his curious habits, yet while always being able to protect himself. (Another good example of this is Anthony Hopkins in Fracture - if you haven't seen it, you should).MIssing the humor in Dexter, this is mind twisting exercise in control and power. This is so good, AMC could have done it.Not for the squeamish, (there is a lot of blood and grisly images) if you like psychological horror, this one's for you. (and Barry Manilow did not do the soundtrack).Best regards DonB"
34,"This series promises to be incredibly entertaining. Notice the word promises. Here is why:Hannibal sees young Graham as either 1)An apprentice or someone that can follow Hannibal's footsteps or 2)As a companion in his dark path. I don't think he knows which one he wants Graham to be or what he wants. I think he will leave it up to Graham to find out.He feeds Graham human meat(Graham does not know). Graham talked about tasteless but finds the ""sausage"" very exciting. Funny enough Graham eats the same meat of one of the victims in his case. Hannibal is symbolically feeding him into his dark path with each passing victim. Great symbolism. This show promises great symbolism. You must look past the obvious. Graham choices down the path laid by Hannibal. I think this is going to be the greatest plot of them all. Choice VS. Nature. Graham by nature is like Hannibal but by choice he has been able to fight off his demons. For how long? I might add that the camera work is great so far... as well as the camera effects. What's most important about this show is that the director seems to be drawing in the viewer by ironically making him/her empathize with Graham(who empathizes with everyone). By empathizing with Graham the viewer might empathize with Hannibal as well. Choice or Nature?I hope they take their time developing the characters. That is my only fear."
35,"It changed my mind forever.
Dante, Boticcelli, The Iliad, Goethean incredible script that increases its value with rewatches. I would never forget this version of Will and Hannibal. My Achilles and Patroclus."
36,"Blown away; the acting, writing, cinematography, just perfect!! Mads Mikkelsen is a genius."
37,"Just completed my fourth rewatch of the show- still just as good as the first time! It's a real pleasure to watch this show with someone who's never seen it and just take their reactions in... highly recommend watching with your friends and family! I guess with the addition to Netflix it's reached a more mainstream audience because a lot of the recent reviews are ""X female character is annoying/unattractive/a bad actress"" or ""Why did they have to make it gay?!"" If you're new to the show, don't let these scare you off. It's a really great show with lots of depth. It's not realistic and it's not MEANT to be, so if you're looking for a realistic, gritty crime drama just go watch Criminal Minds. I'm not even saying that to be snarky! Really annoyed with people leaving negative reviews just because the show succeeds at its desired tone and mood. It's just not MEANT to be ""realistic!"" He eats people!"
38,"It is art, beautiful art. Only issue with this show is that it lacks a season 4, but other than that it's a 10/10 show, would definitely recommend. Watch Hannibal, now on Netflix for clear skin and a healthy mind 😘"
39,It's one of the best shows ever if it wasn't the best there's no words that can describe how awesome this series is and the ending is the best part of the whole series
40,"I would like to thank Fuller and the rest of the crew and cast for granting us with such a show with such advanced (and beautiful) cinematography, superb acting, and an intriguing relationship with the two main characters especially. So intriguing, that, if not for a fourth season, we are only left to wonder just what happens next. Every character changes (for better or for worse), and seeing how that affects their ultimate fate is makes me want to watch the whole thing again. (On second thought, I will.) Now if you're debating on watching this creation, I only ask that you give this a strong chance. For there was (and still is) much potential to impress audiences; those who like complexity, drama, and a bit of gore, of course. Overall, a worthy successor to the story of Hannibal Lecter...and friends."
41,"What happens when the doctor you trust becomes your nightmare. A psychiatrist with a dark secret manages to enter into mind of a detective and makes the life of the detective and police deptt. miserable when the series of murders take place. You are definitely goingto love the character of Mad Mikkelsen.
This tv series will surely put an long lasting impact on you"
42,"A truly amazing series, my all time favorite, i would watch it a hundred times and never get bored"
43,Great show great acting great main characters charismatic characters
44,"Well, what a show this was. As a little side note it's best to treat this show as an individual piece of media given the modern setting and the vague links and references to the Hopkins trilogy of films that came before, mostly due to licensing rights with MGM. Anyway back to the show. The first season was spectacular TV quite frankly and there's no other way of putting it, artful cinematography, a huge chunk of style and a fantastic cast, particularly the triangle of Fishburne, Dancy and Mikkelsen who are outstanding all way through. The constant symbolism of the black stag representing Will Graham's mental decline which leads to the second series is a constant technique used to make the viewer doubt the character of our protagonist Will as he's accused of various murders and related events. The relationship between Hannibal (Mikkelsen) and Will (Dancy) is immensely strong and interesting too as we know from the first few minutes of episode one who the killer is (though if you've even a layman's knowledge of fiction it's no real surprise). Linking back to that point there's a constant sense of irony, be that the reveal of The Chesapeake Ripper's true identity in the first episode or the beautiful detail of the meticulous cooking scenes which likely consist of Human meat the audience is instantly placed in a certain mindset towards the characters and plot. The action sequences through the second season were truly like nothing else with the major set pieces looking fantastically cinematic and a beautiful chaos on screen with every punch or movement having an effect later on. My issue with the series however arises with season 3, the final outing (to date at least). The opening 6 episodes roughly are still great to be honest yet seem to have swayed too far on the pendulum losing some quality as it seems the influence of David Lynch essentially took full effect with episodes largely consisting of isolated sequences of snails just existing or somewhat pretentious metaphors to show progression. Not only does it become a slight bit full of itself there's little substance, the timeline is a mush and at times parts predictable with and ironically so the pace of a snail finding it hard to keep interest in the early stage I slugged through wanting for an end, longing for it even. And boy did it come, the return to America and the perish of Verger who was a solid villain the quality returns with every episode personally being around 9 or above and the end seeming massively ambiguous, though concluding the Red Dragon storyline the resolution between Hannibal and Will is a bit oxymoronic, heartbreaking yet undecided as the track off the cliff with them personally showed no finale. Sadly the abrupt end and slow start to season 3 was a bit of a sour taste, however it's worth noting that there's a few episodes which were genuinely a perfect 10 given the context of the wider storyline I was left utterly amazed. So to round off the show is amazing, one of the best I've seen and you could easily argue the best material available when concerning the ultimate villain of Hannibal Lecter, a fantastic show well worth your time."
45,"The script is finely crafted. It shocks you, then gives you security, only to rip it away again. This can easily feel cheap, or for shock value- yet with Hannibal it isnt at all. It reminds us that even we can be unreliable narrators of our own story. It challenges our perceptions of characters, and what or how they may be influenced or changed. I could go on for hours, really. There is a substantial amount of gore- some of it is even... theatrical. It is important for the overall story. I found myself being invited to psychoanalyze each character, each scene, each motive.. It keeps you on your toes, always on the cusp of falling over. But it almost never feels tiring.This show desires so much more recognition. It is a work of art. The acting is incredible- especially Hannibal and Will. It is hard to believe the show was cancelled."
46,"This show dives into deep psychological themes exploring the mind of a cannibal and psychopathy, with even newer sciences explored such as mushrooms decomposing corpses and psychedelic therapy. This show is a slow burner that you need to stick with because it just gets better and better and better. Superb throughout and beautifully created and executed. I could not imagine anyone else playing Hannibal other than Anthony Hopkins. I bypassed this show for many years, finally getting around to it by recommendation. Mads Mikkelson (Hannibal) truly took me off guard with an amazing performance that felt very synergistic with the rest of the cast. Everyone feels like a family in this show by the time you reach season 3. I personally cannot fathom why this was ever cancelled it is a real travesty and should be resurrected. I have a feeling that this won't be the last we see of Hannibal though .... You can't end a TV Show just when it gets to the point where the movies started."
47,"Beautiful show, by any mean, Based on a great masterpiece book.
Scripting, Dialogue, Cinematography, Directing, Characters & Acting, Locations, and above all the main idea and concept, and how it was executed.
This is a kind of show that required a very mature, open minded, audiences.
Not just for the severe sexuality & Nudity, the severe profanity, or the severe Violence and Gore, but because of the very sensitive existential and highly debatable Philosophical subjects that the show is all about."
48,"I regret not watching this show when it originally aired!
I remember viewing the trailers, but wasn't impressed with how they made the show look in those trailers. Man, was I wrong!
I never knew Lawrence Fishburn was in it! Love his work! I thought the show was going to be all flash and no real character depth. Again, I was wrong! I didn't think NBC would make it intriguing as Hannibal's character deserves to be portrayed. Wrong! This show is dark and very graphic which I love!
Man, I wish Netflix or Hulu would revive this series!! Please!!!!
All this being said and I'm only 3 episodes deep!
Great show!"
49,"I think the thing that shocks me the most about this show is that it came out of NBC. NBC?!?! The production quality is way ahead of its time. The visuals alone give such an unsettling feeling. The acting is top notch. This show is so good!! Hannibal has some of the most interesting, complex characters on television. While the dialogue is sometimes confusing, it is really well done and thought out. Mads Mikkelsen does a phenomenal job playing Hannibal Lecter. It was mesmerizing watching Hannibal manipulate Will for his own gain. The Hannibal-Will relationship was really cool to watch. All of the characters shined in their own way. I really don't have any complaints except that the beginning of the third season dragged a little bit and was confusing. Other than that, wonderful show! Not for the faint of heart though."
50,"Please Hannibal comeback with season four
We're sooooo exiting"
51,"Many will argue that Hopkins is ""the best and only"" Hannibal, much like folk declare allegiance to Bond actors.
But I like to think of each incarnation as seperate and of its time.
There's no doubting that Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is streets ahead of Ed Norton's earlier portayal.
Hannibal is easily my favourite Lector telling.
It benefits from two things;
The depth of field afforded the story by being a TV series and the ability to tap and reference the rich tapestry of what's went before.
Hannibal the TV series is exceptional, a prequel that feeds directly into a narrative that feels fresh and yet familiar.
Because of the intricacies of the known characters it plays out like a chess game.
Intelligence is sexy, murder is horrifying... Sexy horrifying is so alluring as an entertainment form.
The visual effects of this are mind blowing. I've never seen horror be filmed as artistically as this outside of Penny Dreadful.
For 3 seasons this show thrilled and entertained. Now we are anticipating a 4th season to emerge from the gloom of Covid-19.
Let's hope its writers have learned everything the original 3 seasons took in from the previous incarnations.
Let's hope we remain horrified, mesmerised and even rooting for the biggest and baddest anti hero of Modern Horror."
52,This is one of the best shows I have ever seen the acting and script writing are on point but the best part of the show is the beautiful visual aesthetics its one of the best looking pieces of cinema ever
53,"Don't get me wrong - I kind of want to like the series and most of the time it's okay, but there are things that just can't go unnoticed and drag the rating down. It's like watching a horror movie and wanting to scream ""don't go there!""Apparently all the characters are written in such a way that everyone's an idiot and lack common sense. Everyone except Hannibal. Nobody leaves a note or shares a suspicion before investigating him and/or making a move on him/feeling in danger. What do you do when someone's accusing someone of horrible murders and you start having suspicions of your own? You tell them everything, of course! And then when you break into their home and put yourself in danger what do you leave behind in case something happens? Right - nothing.I really like the idea and overall style of the show, but some things are waaaay too stretched just to make Hannibal artificially 'out of suspicion' and drag the series for as many episodes as possible, milking it like a cow. 
And that drives me nuts."
54,"Let me start by saying that this show has what pretty much every other show and many movies lack; atmosphere, imagination and subtlety.This is a work of art in every way, from the awe inspiring cinematography, to the fantastic directing, the chilling sound design/soundtrack, actors performance, dialogue, editing, brilliant art direction. Everything works in unison and for the same purpose. I can't state enough how much this team did an amazing job. I've seen all the movies based on the books, Silence Of The Lambs being my favorite. This series is in a totally different level from those movies. Even Mads Mikkelsen is a better suited actor to play Hannibal Lecter than Anthony Hopkins and he does deliver a better performance.The story is told in a very subtle way, with lots of metaphors and meaningful visuals that help build tension and keep the suspense. While keeping some parts of it subject to interpretation, many pieces of information form a puzzle in which the viewer has to put together by himself. There are a lot of things that are not shown or told directly, the viewer has to be part of it to understand it fully.All seasons are fantastic, but the last season was a little bit weaker than the previous ones, mainly because they had to wrap the story due to the show being cancelled. And i think this show was cancelled exactly because it is not meant for the average viewer, it demands more and the vast majority of audiences are not prepared for this.Bottom line, this is one of the best shows ever to air on TV and it should serve as reference for movies as well. Most movies nowadays lack imagination and the world is saturated with money making blockbusters that no one will remember a week later. This one is here to stay as a future cult classic."
55,"Only just got round to watching this on Netflix and after sitting through three episodes it seems I haven't missed much. I have never wanted to punch a main character so much as the whining, 'troubled' character Will Graham. The distorted time-lines and nonsensical incidents, stag daydreams, more stag daydreams, a killer shooting a cop in broad daylight and then leaving a witness so he can be traced, walking into a hospital and managing to get an orderly's outfit and moving a patient without any questions being asked... It's awful, just awful."
56,"The primary flaw with this adaptation is the portrayal of Hannibal. The actor plays him overtly creepy, yet none of the other characters seem to notice. Hannibal would need a great deal of charm to pull off the things he does, but this guy is as appealing as a cockroach. For some reason, the autistic genius profiler can figure out everything but the fact that Lechter is a killer. And Lawrence Fishburn is sleeping-walking through this thing. Thomas Harris must be spitting up fava beans watching this. This show is hopelessly bad, a combination of cheap '70s slasher shlock and poorly, poorly miscast actors. They are flat one-dimensional figures who evoke no more sympathy than an inert sofa. I'm sure the creators had great intentions but unfortunately they were not realized in this series. Hazy story lines, strange directing but worst of all, the two main characters, Graham and Dr. Lecter, are extremely unlikable. And not unlikable in a deliciously evil way, unlikable in a I-really-want-this-to-be-over-soon-way. The two main characters, Hannibal and Graham, who are being set up for a frenemy bromance are annoying at best and boring at worst. Being a fan of the books and (most) of the movies, I had high hopes for this show. It's obvious that they didn't intend for it to be a carbon copy of the original which is a good thing but they could have at least tried to create something mildly interesting and watchable. Sad to say it wasn't meant to be."
57,"I checked IMDb for a TV series to watch and to my joy one of my favourite film series of all time had been serialised and received a mega 8.6!I was willing this to be a great TV series. The truth is its not. If you have a brain, you will begin to notice that Hannibal is one of the most ridiculous TV programmes you have ever seen. It is a thriller designed for people who are so stupid they don't actually care how a man cuts open his own chest and then pins his own lungs to his back and then proceeds to crucify himself 30 feet in the air on the rafters of a barn, alone and without the aid of a ladder and for the brightest murder investigators in the FBI to accept this as a plausible suicide.The people this was written for stopped thinking after being told a guy kills people and pins their lungs in a 45 degree angle from their shoulders so they look like angel wings, because somehow this is cool so we don't really care if the writers then proceed to make the rest of the story impossible and verging on being supernatural. The Hannibal Lecter series has nothing to do with the supernatural.Hannibal Lecter is a hard act to follow, so I forgive the casting of some emotionless European guy who can't act, however the Anthony Hopkins version got inside not only the FBI investigators and serial killers he conversed with heads, but he got inside ours, the viewers head. This guy couldn't get into a prostitutes underwear with $100, such is his screen presence and charisma in this show.Think about Lecters iconic scenes in the films, how he escapes from that cage through sheer genius, guts, insanity and a fountain pen. However implausible it seems it was explained and every detail this mastermind escape was delivered to the audience. You could see how the FBI were fooled by a genius psychopath. Even you were fooled, as if you had seen a magic trick! It makes sense once you knew how he did it, sheer magic. The writers in this serialisation make no attempt to be even a tenth as intelligent. They don't explain anything. Like why is a psychologist cannibal almost immediately invited to every crime scene after one meeting where he does nothing? How does said psychologist manage to slip off, murder and then impale teenage girl at the crime scene they are travelling to before they get there? Why is a stupid online journalist considered to be as powerful as the FBI? Why does said journalist not get arrested even though she has literally broken 10 laws per episode (that they know about) and impedes the course of justice constantly. Why do the FBI seem powerless to stop her? Why do apparently worldly and intelligent people not know the difference in taste between human insides and pork? WHY ALL THE IMAGERY OF STAGS AND ANTLERS!!!I could literally go on forever, this TV series is so bad. If anyone else performed this badly in their jobs they would be fired and a note put on their permanent record advising that they never work in their business again, yet the writers of Hannibal got a second series.... I have heard of dumbing down but surely no one would watch this and actually think it's remotely thrilling, psychological or intelligent in anyway. The reviews that call this a 'Psychological thriller at its finest' or 'The thriller you've been waiting for on T.V', are written by people who wouldn't know a thriller if it called them on their mobile and said 'Hello Agent Starling'.It stinks so bad I am literally amazed by the reviews written here, this is half the reason I have decided to offer an alternative critique such is the level of unintelligence I see amongst the user reviews for this TV series.The writing is so bad there are parts I am sure are completely improvised. Like the writers didn't write enough content to fill an entire 50 minutes so they pay Laurence Fishburne extra to improvise scenes with different members of the cast for the last 15-20 minutes. Seriously, there is an episode where they spend 20 minutes of different people reacting to news a completely unimportant unseen to this point character has cancer, and then jump to the killer of the episode having killed himself in the stupidest way possible. Out of no where.I have not even gone over the terrible acting, the awful attempts to build character relationships overusing the phrase 'are you OK?', bad casting, lazy thoughtless writing, total lack of research in every possible area and sheer stupidity at every level. From police, to FBI, to doctors, to forensic scientists, to serial killers.. Everyone in this show is stupid. This show is so unrealistic it is possible that in a future series finale it turns out that the whole show is Jack Shephard from Lost's dream.I am worn out from thinking about this shows flaws so I am gonna stop and I will summarise like this. If you like Lost, or you're being paid five dorrah by the producers of Hannibal to vote this as 10, then this is the TV thriller for you. If you have a brain then I would suggest you re watch the films as this TV show is as stupid as Paris Hilton. In fact Paris Hiltons 'My new BFF' is more realistic and her most recent work 'The world according to Paris' is both more intelligent and more thrilling then Hannibal the TV show.The only reason I haven't given this a 1 is because Laurence Fishburne is in it."
58,"This is not a long review.If you're here, you've probably seen the Hannibal films (starting with the great Silence of the Lambs). Well, if you thought you couldn't get over Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal, think again! Mads Mikkelsen is up to the task and you will love to hate him after the first few episodes.Second season brings Mason Verger (the sadist who feeds people to pigs) into the series, played wonderfully by Michael Pitt (he even sounds like Gary Oldman in ""Hannibal"" - second film of the franchise).I have watch ""a million"" other TV shows. Nothing compares to this. 10/10"
59,"Mads Mikkelsen has been a favourite of mine since I first saw Pusher and it's sequel Pusher II: With Blood On My Hands (directed by Nicolas Winding Refn), so when I originally heard he'd be portraying Hannibal Lecter in this new series, I was absolutely in my glee. He inhabits Hannibal quite easily it seems; even watching him eat dinner with colleagues, drinking wine, you can see a man who is a connoisseur of fine food and drink; when Hannibal perceives rudeness, Mads' charismatic face shows the ever-so-slight murderer beneath the human veil. Lecter comes off with the intelligence Anythony Hopkins brought to the role, but Mikkelsen somehow manages to make the character colder, more distant, yet with the same frightening disposition of his predecessor; perhaps it has much to do with seeing Hannibal long before being incarcerated, as opposed to Hopkins' Lecter who was always either in prison, or on the run for his screen time (except for the brief few scenes at the beginning of Red Dragon with Graham and Lecter discussing theories). Regardless, this portrayal of Hannibal is absolutely amazing, and Mads' little nuances he brings to the character fit perfectly. One particular instance I love is when he is reading Freddie Lounds' report about the Ripper already being in a mental hospital (a guest starring role for the brilliant Eddie Izzard), and Hannibal calmly starts flicking his fingers, showing a slow crack in the outer mask he wears; you can see his anger towards someone else taking credit for his crimes, and you can almost see the coming storm it will induce.Will Graham has been played very well before by both William Petersen and Edward Norton in Manhunter & Red Dragon, respectively. However, I feel that Hugh Dancy really nails what Graham is all about here. Dancy makes Graham awkward, cold, and often quite strange, which fits very well with the character who has a unique, if not disturbing gift. When Graham is whittling away at the seams, Dancy shows it whether he is out sleepwalking, or simply waking to a sweat-soaked bed from having terrible dreams. Graham's inability to properly relate with others around him shows very well, and the weight of his 'gift' becomes very apparent with Dancy playing the role. The writing for this show is great, in my opinion. The relationship between Graham and Lecter develops beautifully; you can often see how Graham is blinded to who Hannibal really might be in many different scenes. One exchange I really enjoyed is when they find a girl impaled in the antler room of the Minnesota Shrike; Will and Hannibal are assessing the crime scene when the former comments something along the lines of ""it wasn't so-and-so who did this"", and the latter replies very quickly, ""I know""- Graham stares at his friend briefly with a strange look, and you can almost see him shove it down deep somewhere, possibly thinking it was foolish to imagine that meant anything.I highly recommend any fan of Hannibal Lecter watches this, and don't be a snob- Anthony Hopkins was amazing, but they picked a very fine actor in Mads Mikkelsen to do this show, and I think anybody who isn't willing to at least give him a chance is missing out. 10 out of 10 stars. Very interested to see where the rest of the season goes from here, and I hope they might be able to continue it awhile without the writing going downhill, or simply becoming stale."
60,"Season 1 hooked me, and I binged on N-flix, which recently ""dropped"" it. Then I started Season 2, which became increasingly annoying as #$%%. But, I held on. Now I am in the Bryan Fuller pablum, that is Season 3. Style over substance. A Fuller Fault. He never knows when to stop.GOD, this show is annoying. And repetitive.And it LOVES the gore. HOW did this air on NBC?SO many pointless scenes. Over and over again. Yes, the critics LOVED it!!!!SO, Fuller is trying to get another season, STILL, on N-flix - rethinking ""Silence of the Lambs,"" now???? In 2020????Again, I am a MAJOR ""binger"" - I watched ALL of ""Breaking Bad"" one weekend in late 2013. And I've binged it two more times.I am having to FORCE myself to get through Season 3, and I won't make it. I just don't @#$#^% care.I am a big fan of ""Manhunter."" Fuller, stop with your pretentious garbage. You're fooling some people, but not everyone."
61,"1. In real life, profiling is basically worthless. It has never, ever led to the apprehension of a serial killer. (Indeed, no sort of police work has ever caught a serial killer. The only way we ever catch them, ever, is when a victim escapes.) All TV shows about successful profilers are thus shows about people with magic powers.2. The Will Graham of this show may be the most magic of all, immediately guessing the amazingly complex (and utterly unfathomable) motives of the craziest imaginable killers. But of course it comes at price: spending so much time in the mind of crazies makes Will a very sad boy. So the lead character is mopey all the time, which gets old.3. The FBI of this show centers its efforts to find serial killers on this seer of questionable sanity. 4. The Hannibal of this show is obviously barking mad, yet the FBI also trusts him to work cases, never questioning why he'd abandon a thriving practice to work basically full-time as an unpaid consultant. (This is nearly as absurd as the idea that the Hannibal of this show could have a thriving practice. People don't really like spending huge amounts of money to talk to creepy guys.)5. The tabloid journalist is almost as magical as the protagonists. She can get into any building, get any bit of police information and generally investigate just as effectively as an entire police force. She repeatedly breaks the law in front of police officers but never gets into trouble.6. Doors, walls, and all other means of keeping people at bay do not work in this show. When it's convenient for a person to magically get into a room, that person magically appears, even if the room would have been surrounded by cops."
62,"If I could rate it 20 stars I would. Mads is astonishingly beautiful and dark. We just ordered the cookbook created from this series, cannot wait to enjoy it too. This series should be brought back. My partner and I have started creating more beautiful meals thanks to the inspiration here: magnificent sets, amazing costuming as well!"
63,"I genuinely was looking forward to watching this series and after watching two seasons worth, I am giving up. I really wanted this to be good. I love Laurence Fishburne and Mads Mikkelsen... but in this, they are terrible.When I heard that Mads was going to play Hannibal I was really excited and thought it would be a brilliant piece of casting.... however, his performance comes off as so wooden you could make Swedish furniture out of it. I don't blame him though, I blame the script and the direction. The dialog tries desperately to come off as some genius level, poetic jousting between characters, where every line is a verbal riposte with deep philosophical implications - but it just sounds banal and pseudo-intellectual. And boring. Oh, so very, very boring.The characterizations are boring too. I can't think of a single character that I actually, really 'like' in this. I almost have no emotional response to them because of the way this has been produced. Or should I say, over-cooked...The whole show is SO stylized that it's distracting. It takes me out of what I am watching constantly. Scenes are beautifully lit, beautifully styled and beautifully filmed. So much so that nothing seems real. Many scenes just keep making me think of Twin Peaks because nothing in it seems real.The scripting is very poor. We are asked to accept things which are far beyond the believable. Example - in series one we are expected to believe that one person managed to construct a totem pole made of human body parts on a beach. It looks impressive - very artistic and well planned out. But a logical load of rubbish. So nobody saw him unloading a truckload of body parts on a beach? Nobody saw him constructing the pole and painstakingly attaching every arm, leg and head in place? The logistics of this would be staggering. And beaches are generally places where people go. A lot. Even if it's just to walk their dog. Imagine getting half way through the project, and someone comes along while you are nailing a torso half way up a wooden pole... The risk is staggering.And the eventual effect is not at all scary. It's fascinating to look at, yes. But scary? Not a bit. None of the killings are. They are interesting, artistic and completely implausible. Imagine entering a Damien Hirst chamber of horrors - not scary, just interesting. You look on with a squinting concentration etched on your face, but feel no tension, no fear, no revulsion, no 'anything' really...And the music. My god, that fake Japanese drum thing they have going whenever Will is looking at a crime scene just does my head in. It literally makes me want to turn the volume down to 0 just so I can get through the scene without switching it off.Overall Hannibal does not do, for me at least, what it promises. It doesn't engage me, it constantly takes me out of what is happening by having me question their production choices, it constantly bores me with inane, never ending dialog and the biggest crime of all, it DOESN'T provide any scares or thrills.The only sense of foreboding comes from the knowledge that the episode or season is not over yet, and you still have so much more to endure. Now THAT is a truly chilling prospect..."
64,"Being that Hannibal is one of my favorite characters of all, I was thrilled to see what they would do in a series and one I saw it, I am not impressed. The GOOD: The cast is superb..Fiahburne is great at any role he takes on so he had my attention. Mads as Hannibal is deliciously brilliant. He gives me the same level of creepiness that Hopkins did...he's perfect. The actor playing Will is also great, he does his parts so well, he has transformed into will however only Edward Norton got Will Graham right...The BAD: the story line is filled with more holes than a south bend Indiana street. I gave this series the chance to pick up and become Hannibal but it hasn't. They put do much emphasis on the production that me as a viewer can't get to know the characters. The crimes are gory and hannibalesque, but the interactions between all the characters lack emotion or interest. Where is that emotion that reels a viewer in? Where is the story line that isn't faulty our simply boring? I see what they tried to do with this show...but when you try to make a show so sophisticated it all seems muddled and forced. I have literally lost interest in this show, it bores me to sleep...the music seems to make a scene far more interesting than it is. Nothing is horror about this show...it's just visually and musically appealing, and casted with great actors with bland across. I will stick to the movies in my collection for my Hannibal dose however...Mads is riveting...if you are to watch this show, watch it to see Mads play an amazing Hannibal"
65,"Best villain ever , mads mikkelsen what a great performance"
66,"I'd never heard of Hannibal before, but I was a huge fan of the books and the movies (well Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter), so I decided to give it a try and I was blown away. This show has a very Kubrickian feel to it, meaning that not only are there a lot of references to his films, but they film the show in such a beautiful way that everything has a deeper meaning. What you see on screen is not always cohesive with what you hear the characters saying. It's a total mind-game, and it requires you to think about everything you see. I do have to admit, it is a little gory at times but if you follow the story as much as I do you realize that the gore is portrayed in a way that makes it art. Hannibal Lecter sees things that us mere mortals consider horrible, as beautiful and gorgeous. The way they film the show, gives credit to that. The blood and the death is romanticized in such a way that allows the audience to question where their sympathy lies. Is it okay to sympathize with Hannibal? Is it okay to feel sorry for him? If you haven't seen the show, the answer may come easy to you. He's a cannibal so yes. He is a terrible person and deserves to be thrown in jail. However, you may think differently after watching the mesmerizing performance of Mads Mikkelsen as he attempts to befriend Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), and discover some friendship in the lonely life of Dr. Hannibal Lecter."
67,"If you're wondering, this drama does not follow the story line of the previous Hannibal film franchise. However, it does not mean that the series doesn't pack its own punch in terms of tension and suspense. (I'm in such awe, I feel inadequate trying to leave a review for this show. I won't reveal any more than what is available on the wikipedia page.)Following protagonist Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) into his mind and peering into the distorted lives and actions of serial killers, he comes across as a highly intelligent but often conflicted man, tormented by his own imagination and yet has to live it each day for the greater good. This sense of vulnerability and instability caused by his personality (largely introverted and antisocial) is preyed upon by his psychiatrist, famed Hannibal Lecter, excellently portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, and as all this is played out, the audience, privy to this knowledge will be gripped by suspense, and the never ending tension, even on scenes where nothing appears to be happening, the mood takes on a somber and tense tone. For those who are concerned with the relative 'low level of gore', be patient. It takes its time to build and slowly escalate, bringing Graham deeper into the shadows and mental torment.I can't emphasize how good the acting is, how vivid and artistic the abstract dream and killing sequences are. the fact that the soundtracks are well selected and not obnoxious all plays a part in creating one of the best viewing experiences ever. As a fan of psychological horror, I feel privileged to be able to take a small peek at this show ahead of broadcast."
68,"Poor acting, lazy writing, uninteresting and unlikable characters, superficial instant psychological mumbo jumbo, self serving psychedelia and shock... and the soundtrack... oh, god, please make it stop!The only redeeming character is Mikkelsen, although I would prefer him to be a bit more of a charming, charismatic jester, to pull of his disguise... but he's just creepy. And where is all the smart cynicism? I guess there was no room for that in this slow, gloomy train wreck.I hate CSI, but at least it's not pretending to be something it's not. And for all the Dexter comparisons, this show starts where the show Dexter went bad, where will it end? ...I hope Lecter has them all for dinner, soon!"
69,"I can write one word, that would make my whole opinion about this show. Brilliant! BUT... I was skeptic at first, 'cause of my experience of the movies, except The Silence of the Lambs, but this show.. WOW. I've never stumble upon a psychological thriller-TV show that I got hooked on, already on the first episode. It has depth, excitement, thriller and psychological ""horror"" and yes.. some gore. But I connected with the main characters by the first-second episode. And that is something that takes me at least a few more episodes. And I cannot forget to mention the actors in this show, they cast the show really, REALLY great!You will like this show, even though you didn't like all (or some) of the movies - or haven't seen them all. =) So, what are you waiting for?!"
70,"This show was a masterpiece in that it was a visual visual art form with quite unexpected writing and plot twists. The acting was superb and the story was extremely disturbing and sophisticated. Opinions are just that, opinions; and if one looks at the content of this series and bases their opinion of the execution of story and production value on the fact that a reviewer hates gruesome violence and serial killers, they're not going to ""get"" this show, at all. Everything about this series should be viewed as an art form and at the same time commentary of our Society. it's quite profound and deep. To understand the genius of this series better one must read the brilliant review of the series by Emily Nussbaum in The New Yorker."
71,"I was hooked from the start of episode 1, no glaring music just haunting sounds and hypnotising images. This is not a TV show it is a piece of art, every episode is very well thought out and expertly acted by everyone involved.I got so involved in the characters it was scary, i'm talking of the violence or the depravity but you really did believe each character was a real person. Season 1 built a solid foundation, season 2 evolved the characters but season was so well formed and so well executed you feel for Will you even feel for Hannibal in the way of forgiveness and wanted to help him.I would say it is one of those shows, watch one episode you will be hooked, otherwise it will not be for you. It is violent and done very skilfully. Although thinking back some scenes did make my stomach churn!I was hooked from start to end and very glad this exists, it is different from the films it is it's own telling, and Mads is Hannibal not better than Hopkins different.Give this show a chance and see the skill and obvious respect for the audience in every single episode. Amazing!"
72,"The cinematography, the acting, the story, the casting, the writing, EVERYTHING is ridiculously on point in this show.The psychology involved unfolds amazingly, adding many layers of intrigue and mystery. Hannibal is charming and intelligent, the epitome of good taste... Minus the obvious flaw in his character of course. Will is a tortured mind, but in an extremely likable way, a mind you want to wander around in to help him find the clues he so desperately needs.A beautiful macabre masterpiece of a show. I truly hope this will get many a season."
73,"The character of Hannibal Lecter has been examined in popular culture for over 30 years now, in literature and cinema especially. People cannot and will not ever get enough of the charisma and exoticisms that one of history's greatest and most intriguing characters exudes. But after a few too many mediocre rehashes, using Hannibal Lecter's métier, ""cannibalism"", as the primary method of creating cheap thrills (see Hannibal 2001, Hannibal Rising 2007), it seemed as if the franchise was sadly drawing to a close. However, with Bryan Fuller's new depiction of ""Hannibal"", this could not be further from the truth. This new television series has been gaining increased attention and with it the momentum and following it so assuredly deserves, Hannibal Lecter is undoubtedly ""back on the menu"" of today's popular culture.Naturally, comparisons to previous portrayals of Thomas Harris's famous characters hinges on some people giving the show a go, or not. I assure you, the Hannibal TV show is absolutely no exception to a line of previously acclaimed works like 1986's Manhunter and 1991's Silence of the Lambs. Brian Cox and Sir Anthony Hopkins both provided incredible visions of the psychologically terrifying Hannibal Lecter, especially the nauseatingly intricate ways in which he dissects the thoughts and minds of people.What Madds Mikkelson offers in his version of Lecter is refreshingly original, and in my opinion, more in line with the original character's exotic and erudite aesthetic. When in the company of others, Mikkelson's Lecter presents a delicious facade of politeness and impeccable style: his worldly sophistication and understanding of art and academia makes him intellectually inferior to no one. That is, except for one person, Hugh Dancy's Will Graham.Dancy's Graham is more akin to William Petersen's ""Manhunter"" portrayal of the Special Investigations agent, than Edward Norton's in the 2002 remake, ""Red Dragon"". But where Petersen's 80s typified dialogue and soliloquized phrases like ""I'm gonna get you, you son of a bitch"", Dancy's differs entirely. Dancy's portrayal is inherently more fragile, more isolated and therefore more susceptible to Lecter's incredible intellect. However, although this Will Graham is mentally fragile, he possesses an uncanny ability to analyze people with nearly unparalleled intuition, which makes him not only a formidable rival of Doctor Lecter's, but also an unsuspecting friend. This allows Bryan Fuller, the show's director to create an intricate and mesmerizing relationship between the shows leading characters, which in turn makes for an even more thrilling story arch.Bryan Fuller's Hannibal is an incredible show. It reinvigorates the Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham saga in a delicious and beautiful fashion, quite dissimilar to any way in which it has previously been served to us. Fuller masterfully captures the dark and pulsating dread we once felt in The Silence of the Lambs, and then immerses us in it for 13 captivating episodes. Season 2 could not have arrived any sooner, and I hope many like me, are fervently anticipating a second helping."
74,"There really is only one way to describe this highly anticipated and controversial series. Pretentious clap trap dressed up as serious Television. Obviously inspired by the work of David Lynch (and one suspects Stanley Kubrick) it falls woefully short on every count. There are plot holes so large you could drive an Airbus through them. The only redeeming element is Mads Mikkelsen who makes the part of Hannibal Lecter, very much his own, even managing to cast off the giant shadow of Anthony Hopkins. To all those acclaiming and applauding this snooze fest as the next best thing in intelligent Television, there is a little voice calling from the throng... ""But, the Emperor is not wearing a new cloak""."
75,"A lot of my friends and the whole web got hooked to Hannibal. I cant seem to know why. I stopped watching it after episode 4. The plot is so random, and they try to solve crimes by mere speculations not by hard evidence and facts. The relationship among the characters are not well established and their roles are not emphasized well. The only thing that i liked about Hannibal is the video production, the drama and art of how the video was shot and edited. Also the actor playing Hannibal is the best for his role just bad script and story. For me, a show with good presentation but with an unclear story is a bad show. A lot will hate me but i couldn't lie to myself. Dexters way lot better than this."
76,"This ""Prequel"" to Silence of The Lambs got off to an okay start, but quickly revealed itself to be nothing but bad, formulaic dialog and excessive gore.The series steals line after line after line of comments made in the movies that supposedly follow years after the series took place.And the show has the police acting like the most horrendous crimes of murder and dismemberment happen every week.If there was a real life Chesapeake Ripper like in the series, on the loose and killing for so long, the entire region would be living in terror just like Atlanta when Wayne Williams was killing all those kids. Yet this is not depicted in the show.Hannibal has deeply disappointed me."
77,"Cinematography is outstanding
Scripts are deep and meaningful
Character building is deep
The storyline flows and covers all corners of the stories
The only thing I question is Dr Blooms character from S2 to S3. Its sporadic and questionable. Too much too soon?Must watch highly binged highly enjoyed"
78,"I love the new interpretation of Hannibal and Will's relationship, which adds complexity to the last one that didn't exist in Red Dragon."
79,"Only thing wrong with Hannibal is that it ended much too soon. Have read that some want to bring the series back. Please do! I have just begun re-watching the series on DVD. To me, Mads Mikkelsen performs Hannibal with a style and charisma never before seen. All of the cast and crew did especially beautiful work."
80,"The show itself visually and cinematically extended the story through unforeseeable circumstances, which successfully shapes character development and consequences that unravel throughout the show. The stunning, devilish imagery also never disappoints."
81,"Nothing keeps you watching this show episode to episode and it just drags on, no huge cliff hangers and it just feels like another watered down second rate cop show. Maybe fans of the book will appreciate it more but a couple of big words and long speeches about psychology from dr. Lecter and a little bit of cooking like he does doesn't mean sophisticated or classy for me.I was expecting some deranged psychopath or something along those lines eating people. Kind of like Dexter x10. The special effects really wow you in the 5 episodes I've seen when it comes to the murders and it's cool seeing Will go into the killers shoes. The first episode had some promise but this is a show I'm not the least bit excited for to finish. The guy they got to play Will I would have got someone else I cannot take him seriously either. I see such a high rating on this show and I'm really scratching my head why. The Following was 100x better than this. The only thing going for this show is you can turn on pretty much any episode like say the simpsons gets the point across easily or some sitcom and you can watch really any episode without having to catch up.great visual effects , great scenery in some of the episodes , acting is good except for Will I guess I just hate his actor and the story I don't care for at all. Just watch Dexter , The Following , The Mentalist or anything along those lines."
82,"I stuck with it as the premise seemed interesting and enjoyed the films.Too much dreaming (lazy) terrible sound quality, awful video with dull uninteresting backgrounds, once again was it saving money or tying to be moody?So much symbolism - maybe it was me but I thought once again that it was lazy, confusing and trying to be too clever and failing miserably.I could never tell what Mads was saying and cared even less. His pretentious mumbling irritated me all through the series - shame David Tennant didn't get the part.Stupid time lapse graphics? Once again maybe it was me who didn't understand what it meant. Maybe I'm too thick but to me it was a lack of imagination.An opportunity missed - by a mile!"
83,"Looking back, I can now understand why this show was basically doomed from its premise onward.Silence of the lambs mostly owes its success to the Hannibal character but Sir Anthony H only had 25 minutes total screen time. He wasn't the film's protagonist or the primary antagonist... more of a Virgilian guide to the viewer's Dantesque tour of the darker side of Humanity. Deciding to focus the show on the Will / Hannibal relationship is quite entertaining ... for a season, but two characters are not enough for a long term plot. Over the second and third seasons, the dialogue shifts from clever high-brow quips and exchanges between the main characters to narrations that are as purple as prose can get. Most of the supporting characters have two dimensional personalities, motivations and no long term plots are really developed around them. The guests (mostly killers) are only notable in how inferior they are to Hannibal before they are killed off. In fact, everyone is inferior to Hannibal. I think it's the show's running joke. He is the Golden Age Super Sociopath. ""A sophisticated intelligence can forecast many things..."" So not just a Shark, but a toothless, predictable Shark to jump.Its clear that a lot of time, money and effort has gone into the production of the show. However, in the scramble to please as wide a demographic as possible, the creative talent behind the show lost its soul in Season 2, and then compensated with heavy handed metaphors, borrowed lines and cyclical plots.Season 1 is really the best and only cohesive part of the show. Perhaps it should have ended there."
84,"FBI agent Jack Crawford enlists the help of a psychiatrist and teams him up with a gifted but rookie criminal profiler and lecturer to solve a series of murders. Without drawing too may comparisons to other incarnations Hannibal this is an interesting rework of the successful Hannibal book and film series. Fans of the novel may feel more comfortable with this series, while fans of the films may need sometime to shine to it mainly due to the lasting impression left by Hopkins portrayal. It's less spoon fed that most dramas, with the viewer having to fill in the off screen gaps based on the dialogue. Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly cast as Dr. Hannibal Lecter and is closer to the book and what we saw in Hannibal Rising (2007) with his substantial European accent. Here he is in prime, more dangerous and elegant with calculating simmering menace. Hugh Dancy while his American accent is occasionally slightly off is perfectly cast as Will Graham, here Dancy delivers an edgier more unstable and immersed Graham. Laurence Fishburne as Jack Crawford is solid as usual and the supporting cast are of a good quality of actors.At first you feel the first episode is a rehash of the Francis Dolarhyde story in Red Dragon/Man Hunter - thankfully it isn't and changes direction as the investigation progresses. Naturally lacking likable characters, there is good chemistry in the uneasy relationships between Lecter and Graham and Graham and Crawford which gives some much needed freshness to the proceedings. 2013's Hannibal is a sharp, flashy and slick production – although reminiscent of CSI/Dexter it is a welcomed we written, very graphic and bloody addition with some uneasy sound design and haunting visuals. A good TV series based on one of the most interesting serial killers put to paper and screen. As it develops it goes beyond simply finding it's feet, if anything Hannibal exceeded all expectations."
85,"This might have worked for a mini-series. But this is a dance between everybody and basically god, it is just stupid. Hannibal is omni sentient and omni potent. He can go everywhere, do everything and knows everything as well. And the FBI makes sure it seems normal. This makes for very boring stuff. No intelligence was put into making Lector a man. No intelligence was put into trying to track him down. Add a prophet that has some divine vision. Aaaaaarghhh forget it, it's just a polished 5 year old cod liver. All visuals, no story. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled. (Hey if they can do it and get a 8 plus rating why shouldn't I?)"
86,"Please do not compare this series with Dexter. The whole uniqueness of Dexter is the elimination of negative characters consequently bringing fairness and pleasure since evil bastards are getting what they deserve. I might be old fashioned but wrongdoers must be always punished. Here however Hannibal is evil himself, killing for no purpose rather than pleasure. Of course he is pretentious, posh mannered and wears vintage or unusual clothing, but that's just modern perception of 'cool' and 'unique' diverting the main point of good fighting bad. There is a potential for him to get punished or bring a sad heartbreaking story explaining that his social life has forced him to eat people alive and he is a really good guy, but I just can't be bothered to wait for that small chance. Every episode is a cliff hanger and new ones randomly recall events which had happened 2 episodes ago. Very disappointed and amount of negativity bring no reward for a viewer. In addition Mads Mikkelsen is just a terrible actor. I hope the show get cancelled."
87,"with great expectation i started to watch hannibal. After 2 episodes i got annoyed, the series is very dull boring unrealistic program i find it a big very big disappointment The character who plays hannibal actor Mads Mikkelsen plays well, no questions asked, the writers of the series however don't do their job well he just cooks and eats. And with every bite he takes we have to think about what kind of meat is laying on the table . OMG then comes Will ""the super FBI agent"" who just is a mental patient i mean come onnnnnnn someone like will would belong in the clinic for mental illnesses but no he is the main FBI agent i don't recommend the series i gave it a 2 because the graphic of the murders was beautiful"
88,"The combination Fishburne/Mikkelsen together with a pre-RedDragon-story sounds really convincing, complex, explanatory. Cast, making and overall picture and effects (if one may say so) seems to put the scores somewhere around the tops of the tops. But in my opinion, it's not. The plot so far (S01-Episode 2) does not only lack on tension, deepness and the thrill of ""the human flesh and the story on canibalism"", it mererly seems as a strange copy of the CSI wherever story. There is simply no story other than: how strange the killings are and how twisted the protagonist feels. The usual suspects are found so fast, that it's killing the whole credibility. It's therefore not the center of the story. But there is no other content, than some strange killings and occasional meetings with Lecter... Fishburne and Mikkelsen are two too big-shots, Hugh Dancy plays the twisted protagonist Special Agnet solving the cases - but falls short in between the other characters. I already feel bored, and my question already is: is that all, folks?So, after S01, fourth Episode of epic history repeating (the same in other colors over and over and over again) i dropped out. Hardly seen something horribly more boring, than this. May you waste your time."
89,I can't even see a story line now! The series has just turned to crap. Taken off my watch list. Won't be watching crap anymore. Can't believe some of my favorite series get canceled and they get to make this nonsense! I am certain this will be last series of Hannibal. I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons but i can't even follow this season. I think they are just relying on the name that Anthony Hopkins built for them now as there is no story. The big name characters do not even appear anymore. I keep playing games on my phone to pass time as it is boring to watch. There has only been two episodes and I am not going to watch the rest.
90,"This show seems to be written by a half-witted, no-talent writer who thinks that because they saw all the Hannibal movies 20 times each, they can regurgitate their memories, rearrange things a little, and POW! we have a show. Wrong. Frighteningly bad writing here, folks!!The backdrop of this show is the long series of wildly elaborate murders by the as yet uncaught ""Chesapeake Ripper.""There is no indication that anyone within 500 miles of Washington, D.C. is aware of the crimes, which, if they were happening in real life, would have the entire region in a grip of terror.But it's as if every single murder is staged purely for about 12 persons at the F.B.I.There is NO WAY anyone could get away with the murders that remain unsolved.Hannibal was a suspect but they never searched his house.Will Graham is arrested as the ripper, then later released, but again, it's like no one in the entire western hemisphere notices.There is no way that 3 of Hannibal's victims: Miriam, Abigail and Beverly, would ever have investigated Hannibal without leaving ANY information about what they were doing. Especially Beverly, who basically broke into Hannibal's home, which would have rendered anything she found there inadmissible as evidence.Can anyone tell me how it works out that this certain small group of F.B.I. agents are invited regularly to eat at Hannibal's home?Mads Mikkelson's acting is one-dimensional, so boring it's almost lethal."
91,"After a marathon of Hannibal, I can't recommend it. Yes I was compelled by the characters and the writing is an emotional roller coaster but the finale was the most unjust thing I have seen on TV. I do not understand how people can be such a fan of this. I am used to plot twists and like shows such as The Walking Dead and Dexter but those shows are nothing like this show. Maybe this is all true to the book and if so it should have been adapted. I have never been so repulsed by a show. It makes me wonder if all the fans of this show are sadomasochists. Much like the main characters, I feel the writers have crossed too many lines."
92,I'm still trying to watch it but has to say that they failed already. The important main character Hannibal is failure. I know that many think of Anthony Hopkins and how good he is - even I - but even without thinking him this Hannibal is the worst. Of course we all already knew that Hannibal is a bad guy but why they have to like throw it out from the screen like we are stupid? Important point of the Hannibal was - and is - that people trusted him and I would not dare to trust him. The character is some what dirty and not charming at all. I can't find anything what make me trust him. If I had to be his patient - even without knowing his human eating side - I would get traumatized just being his patient.
93,"After watching 4 episodes of what seemed like a very promising series, I must say I feel a little bit disappointed... Unfortunately, it's not another Dexter as some commenter had suggested, far from it. In Dexter, the focus is on the main protagonist's inner world, his terrible loneliness (to which we could, to a certain extent, relate to), this painful sadness which he calls his ""dark passenger"" that puts the knife in his hand and drives him to kill his preys. Whereas in Hannibal, we seem to miss the motivation that moves the characters: they seem cold, detached. There is too much emphasis on the depiction of sophisticated tortures and elegant cannibalistic practices, but not enough on human feelings, personal baggage and motivation behind one's actions. What's driving all that? What are they thinking? After four episodes and the preview of a fifth, I seem to have lost the curiosity to finish this show... One great thing about it though is the casting: Laurence Fishburne, well it's Morpheus!! (needless to say more), the main actor is not bad at all, and the greatest of all is the actor that does Hannibal Lecter: I wonder where they found this guy, he's absolutely amazing! Sadly, a good casting is not enough to make a great show. A humble request for the writers of this genre: give us dark emotions, sadness, fear, pain, loneliness... This is what makes a killer more credible, more human, and this is what will hook us to a show (well, hook me at least)."
94,"Visually arresting to watch especially with the soothing music and incredible acting! Hugh Dancy is electrifying, I love the way he solves crime scenes and the fact he seems to have Asperger's which I have too. The nightmares are spellbinding and visual effects are one of my favorite things ever done! Hannibal is written with brilliance throughout; I'm so hooked to this charming elegant show."
95,"As newly converted fannibal (the auto-correct is keeps trying to make it ""cannibal"" but I'm that that far gone, yet) I'm years late to the party. as fangirl, i'm fighting the urge to write a review that consist of incoherent screaming, gasping, shocked faces and cackling laughter. here I'll try to be more articulate.
Hugh Dancy had the most difficult acting task, by far. the expectations on Mads were higher but the true weight laid on Hugh. his understanding of the character is amazing and he is fearless. no, he is enjoying himself. playing a man who is the personification of exposed nerve ending. his mind is wide open, he has no barriers and his psychiatrist is Hannibal freaking Lecter! (I imagine things would have been quite different if Will had support system. no way Hannibal could have messed with Will's head if he had a wife and three kids instead of 7?! dogs).I love Hannibal's character but I can't romanticize him even if my life depended on it. most fannibals (for God's sake auto-correct! stop making us cannibals) do. Hannibal is alien. he sees humans as toys, as food. even Will, who he presumably loves, is raw material for him to sculpt. let me quote Will here ""if you're partial to beef products, it is inconvenient to be compassionate towards a cow"" that line summarized Hannibal's action. one brilliant review states ""Hannibal loves Will the way god loves his creations"" and Hannibal seems to see Will as a rare and unique individual but he doesnt LOVE that individual, rather his potential.Bryan Fuller's imagination is thing of beauty. standing ovation to the man who gave us such darkly poetic show.
I'm torn between wishing for a 4th season and being happy how the show ended. to quote Hugh Dancy, going over the cliff with Hannibal was a final victory for Will who fought his darkness till the end. if there was a fourth season, I don't have much hope for Will's morality. i'd like to see it again. to see Will who thought saving people felt good and was compassionate. if we get season 4 and Will ends up being a mirror image of Hannibal, i will rage."
96,"I can honestly say that I've never seen another show that displays brutality and violence so visually stylish as Hannibal and thankfully, most aspects of the show is presented with an equal surgical precision.The violence is as been said, stunning while at once, not at all gratuitous. It's not violence for the sake of violence; there is good reason for it, and poetry in a fantastical manner. While shows like Dexter turns murder into science, Hannibal turns murder into art and it is fascinating to watch. Much of this is due to Mads Mikkelson excellent interpretation of Hannibal. He has a great screen presence and his portrayal of Hannibal is seductive, self-assured, composed and chilling. And an equal credit must be given to Hugh Dancy's Will Graham. While 2 others have played this character including Edward Norton, Dancy's version is much more interesting, much more nuanced, and even more endearing. Dancy plays Will Graham as teetering on being broken, and his chemistry with Mikkelson is thrilling to watch. Which couldn't have happened if it wasn't for the excellent writing on the show. Hannibal is a cat and mouse thriller similar to Death Note. But while Kira and L's battles of wit was quite fast-paced, Hannibal is a slow game, the long game. The build up in each season is slow in the first half and then accelerates in the latter half. This doesn't mean that the show is badly paced, it merely means that it is of a different pace; there isn't an episode that I felt bored or thought it wasn't necessary. Indeed, the build-up is entirely necessary to establish mystery and motivation that are believable and enticing, as well as to display the subtle nuances of our main characters.My only complaint is that Mikkelson's accent is rather difficult to decipher at times, as he is Scandinavian. But that's just nitpicking. Hannibal the series is definitely the Hannibal Lecter that you would want to watch."
97,"I remember back when the beloved Star Trek: The Next Generation went off the air, and what a huge disappointment that was to me (and the public at large). Ending a popular show at the height of its popularity? It seemed outrageous.But in the years since, I've seen several shows overstay their welcome: formerly interesting story lines nosediving into mediocrity & cultural oblivion because they just didn't know when to quit.And Hannibal is at the top of that heap.The first two seasons were so awesomely & beautifully done that it was a mesmerizing blast to watch, almost regardless of what was actually going on. Aesthetic cannibalism!In addition to the *endless* psychological tension... I once read that while Hopkins was the perfect Hannibal Lecter, Mikkelsen IS Hannibal Lecter. I couldn't agree more. The show was cast around him, and I can't imagine it otherwise. Creepiness made effortless & cool.The show also kept the viewer guessing, as it frequently ""remixed"" the known storyline, and while the first 2/3 of its run was fairly episodic, it was still a great thrill to see what they'd spring on us next....until season 3. The first half steered toward acid trip territory, and while it was still exciting to watch - in a semi-lurid coffee table book sort of way - it was evident that the series had lost its direction. The meandering weirdness was simply destined to be canceled, and that's exactly what happened.(Imagine Middle America trying to sit through bizarre slow-motion shots of artsy stuff intermixed with pseudo-philosophical conversations about the nature of a mass murderer, and there's nothing to see but the proverbial ""writing on the wall"", really)But still, I liked it. A project is somewhat entitled to go off the rails when it was never fully on the rails to begin with, after all.And then there was that second half of the third season. The story arc involving a more/less naked dude grunting about ""red dragon"" hallucinations.To say that the show finally fell on its face with that character would be an understatement. All that subtlety of the long chase between the profiler & the psychopath eventually culminating in... a guy with pantyhose on his head, and a fetish for biting people?Yikes. And not in a good way.I suspect that the show was neglected to the point of simply running into the ground, as it had nowhere else to go. There was talk of eventually introducing Starling, but to what end? Chasing Hannibal some more? Or talking to him behind bars? Been there, done that.But despite 1/6 of the series - frankly - tanking, I'm still giving it a near-perfect rating for proving how exceptional network TV can be. As long as someone cares about the product, anyway."
98,"This show manages to transcend the already rich canon that Thomas Harris wrote, and a handful of great movies brought to the screen. It's dense with symbolism, both obvious and suggestive, aesthetical and subliminal.The cast is pitch perfect in their respective roles - going from minimalistic facial acting, subtly conveying emotions and hidden agendas - to the explosive passion of a Greek drama, all without it ever feeling contrived. Hugh Dancy in particular, shines as he lets the ever-fragile needle on Will Grahams spectrum come through with real sincerity.To sum it up, with great cinematography, technical bravura and a gorgeous color palette, one can achieve something close to television art."
99,"This is the first time I write a review on any cinematographic work, therefore I am not expecting anyone to trust my words. However, I felt the need to express my thoughts about this masterpiece, as I perceive it.After watching Hannibal for the second time after four years, I can only say that it still impressed me and took me be surprise.The way I would define the acting quality present here is in its purest form as I'd sometimes forget that I was looking at people interpreting a script. A personal note however is on Hugh's performance that did not always fooled me into forgeting this is a series. He seemed a bit too theatrical in the first episodes (maybe that's just me); I did enjoy his part from second season on when his character got darker.Mads was truely impressive and I loved every scene he was in. Hannibal's character felt like a glove onto Mikelsen, as I could never suspect him of trying too hard. His presence, confidence, expressiveness portrayed a realistic image of Hannibal such that I could almost forget he was fictional. With all the burtality Hannibal was capable of, I still loved him and I think that was in part due to Mads acting skills (and I feel like mentioning that he reminded me of Kevin Spacey's interpretation of Francis Underwood, which was similar in excellence).The secondary actors that are quite a few to enumerate were a great fit and their acting really convinced me. For a short series, the writers did a good job in offering a high level of detail on the other characters back story that tied really well with the main plot and main characters. All the interactions between characters had meaning and the writers did not waste any dialogue.Colour wise, visually and in terms of sound...just delicious and sublime. So much to say about all the culinary moments, that were different almost in each scene, but also the colourful crime scenes that felt like art...and all accompanied by great music selection. I was in bliss.To conclude, I do not wish to convince anyone to watch Hannibal, but this review was more of a display of my appreciation towards this series. ""Thank you for your kind attention."""
100,"Truly one of the best masterpiece. It was so good i really hope they make Season 4 and so on till the story is complete. Throughout the show we have seen the relationship between Hannibal and Will, i really hope to see Clarice in season 4 to see how there relationship changes ....
The only thing i don't understand that in Hannibal movie clarice was there to catch Hannibal when he was is in Florence but in the Tv show they showed Will and Alana. Also in season 3 The Red Dragon part few things were missing compared to the movie ...But i still liked it
The actors really did a great job after watching the movies nd Antony Hopkins, i wasn't sure about Mads Mikkelsen portraying as Hannibal ...but after watching that subtleness in his acting which is the key and the eye gestures it was amazing ...:) glad i watched it..
please please we need #Hannibalseason4"
101,I watched two times i dont need say someting Just one word it is amazing Just watch it. You dont get any regret
102,"Highly stylized sensationalistic crap.If you want to watch a show on how NOT to make a show, this is a 10/10.I think they were definitely testing out actual psilocybin mushrooms in the production trailer throughout this series.This thing is just rank. Bad scripts. Bad acting. Bad directing. To quote the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off: ""I weep for the future"" if there are actually real people out there giving this mess a 10/10.At least with Dexter there was SOME humor, earlier on anyway, when it didn't take itself so seriously.But THIS? Are you SERIOUS? Do yourself a favor. If you want to experience culinary debauchery, go scarf down a couple Wendy's double bacon cheese burgers. It's actually more lethal than this, but not totally unfun.This...VERY unfun."
103,"The good things about this are:1. Mads Mikkelsen's face 2. Hugh Dancy's face + body(so actually, there is something to see). Otherwise, this is a pretty lazy and cynical attempt to squeeze even more lucra from Lecter. Most things are bad: pace, dialogue, acting, casting, general plot, character development, soundtrack, depiction of violence, etc etc. Don't know why I watched all the way to the end of S1 really. Worst things:1. The ridiculous suspension of disbelief required to accept the police + medical bloopers that abound in every scene. 2. The kid from 'My Girl' at acting. 3. That effing stag. At least we didn't have to hear Clarice's lambs crying in pretty much every other scene. 4. LOOK, WILL IS CRAAAZY EVERYONE!Don't expect to be challenged, intrigued, horrified or entertained. It's just another 'serial killer by numbers' drama, which, if you enjoy, makes this just about watchable."
104,"...not to mention incredibly bad casting. Maybe no one else is old enough to remember the original ""Red Dragon"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" works- or the original ""Silence of the Lambs"" film with Hopkins, but it seems like the writers came to a unanimous decision to recycle as much of the dialogue as possible to avoid wear and tear on their cerebral matter. And casting- hello? Lecter is almost universally considered to be a small, slight wiry man- not physically imposing in the least. His physical strength is entirely hidden, like a Zen Aikido master's. He looks non-threatening, reassuring. The actor, while quite competent in his own right, looks more like he would be at home playing a Viking berserker or a senior NCO in the cold-war era Soviet Army. You wouldn't feel at ease giving him your name, rank and serial number, let alone your life story. Leave this turkey alone, and rent a few early eps of Dexter. Or CSI, NCIS, or perhaps ""Cold Case""."
105,"First of all I have no problem with the acting, or the directing, etc., it is a well produced show. In fact, I really like some of the actors.That being said, I just don't get this show.Okay the gag is that Hannibal is eating people, and disturbingly he feeds them to guests (like the chief detective) . You the audience knows this along, hah hah, okay.And then you see the main detective is some sort of physic. He can experience the almost constant heinous murders as if he was doing them himself. This is a neat vehicle for a show. You sort of see things through the eyes of the killer (yet he's the good guy).And somehow this guy is so sensitive he doesn't see Hannibal the killer right next to him every day?? That makes little sense.And that pretty much sums up the show. Repeats these same elements over and over again. As a series you know Hannibal can't be discovered because then that would be the end of it. Maybe, yea, he could be discovered then it would turn into more of a chase thing.You know there is no real ending to the show, no resolution, etc., just this repeat of the same shallow elements and scenes.I don't get how this show made it past even one season.."
106,"Being a fan of The Silence of the Lambs, I was ecstatic when I learned about the new NBC show that would center around Will Graham, a character whose portrayal I wasn't exactly satisfied with in the Red Dragon series. He had come off a bit too cocky, and a bit too ""magical genius"" for me to handle. I thought that maybe ""Hannibal"" the series would scratch my itch, after getting vague sense from a bunch of online screenshots that this time around, Graham would actually be working, failing, and occasionally succeeding like a real human being. And the promise of tormenting mind games made me salivate.Wow, was I wrong about that. Instead of ""magical genius,"" the writers made Graham simply ""magic"" while throwing in the cringeworthy -bad excuse of ""true empath."" He literally stands at a crime scene, imagines himself in the killer's shoes, and voila! Not only is he correct 99.999999999% of the time, but everyone else just nods obediently to his hypotheses. There's barely any logic, and even though Silence of the Lambs arguably made leaps in certain aspects, at least you could see the line of thinking and pieces of evidence that led to each conclusion and reveal of character detail. This......this is just boring and stupid.The acting is subpar. Sometimes, I couldn't even tell that the characters were talking to each other rather simply making isolated statements; inflections, tones, and timing are really off, especially with the woman who plays Beverly Katz. At first, I thought Mads Mikkelsen as the quietly cultivated and silently sinister Hannibal might be an interesting take on the character, but, about 4 or 5 episodes in, I realized that that was the ONLY dimension to his portrayal. He acts bored and indifferent all season-long, which, in turn, bores me to tears with such a flat affect. It's as if he remains emotionally uninvolved in everything going on, though I would expect him, of all people, to fake concern when Will tells him about sleepwalking or when he sees Abigail with blood spurting out of her neck. Despite everything, I do absolutely LOVE Hugh Dancy as Will Graham, and it's delicious to watch him spiral into mental anguish as he is consumed by the horrors of the murders and of himself as the murderer. There's also something rather lovely in the beginning of the series with his nervous awkwardness and sense of duty.The writing is bad. It's like a fanfiction written by a high school student. The vocabulary of the dialogue probably doesn't exceed 500 words, plus or minus some neurological terms taken from Wikipedia. Sometimes, it feels like a monologue by a single person, except written so that different characters are taking over different sentences. The plot makes no sense.....does Will have no concept of a primary care physician who would at least recognize the symptoms of an infection? What is the deal with Hannibal calling Will his ""friend""? What purpose is that supposed to have in the story?Anyways, I will say that the nice parts include the mood and the creativity of the murders. Those was interesting, though all were highly implausible and some were really just being used awkwardly as a tool to repeatedly bang on our heads that Will is unstable.Watch if you can take a big gulp of suspension of disbelief and if you're interested in looking at a new portrayal of Will Graham. Don't watch if you're interested in the story."
107,"Don't get me wrong, I like Anthony Hopkins. I think he is a fine Actor who has made many valuable contributions to cinema. However, I always felt his depiction of Hannibal Lecter was too hammy for me. ""chianti and fava beans ffu ffu ffu ffu!"" made me burst out laughing when I first saw it! The crazy character he portrayed didn't gel with the cool, calculating predator that Hannibal Lecter is. I always viewed Hannibal as the Megeladon swimming amongst the great whites; the Predator of predators, if you will. Now enter Mads Mikkelsen. His portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is simply exquisite. I find myself completely mesmerised when he is on screen. I actually watch each episode twice (sometimes even more!). The first time for the story and the second time so that I can completely immerse myself in watching Mads. The impeccable way he holds himself, every movement and every look meticulously thought out, the subtle smile that plays upon his lips, the flash of predatory fire that glints in his eyes all of it is absolutely sublime. For me, Mad's play the perfect Hannibal Lecter.There are other outstanding cast members; Lawrence Fishburne plays an excellent Jack Crawford. Gillian Anderson, who plays Hannibal's Psychiatrist is glorious. I particularly love it when Hannibal and her are on screen together; there is definite chemistry between these two. I love Hettienne Park as Beverly and Eddie Izzard is superb as Dr Abel Gideon. Finally, Lara Jean Chorostecki plays an excellent, if unlikable, Freddie Lounds.Most of the remaining cast are strong. Obviously there are many smaller characters that are needed but don't have anything to do with the development of the story so I won't discuss those here. There are however, two main characters that for me don't really work. The first is Caroline Dhavernas as Dr Alana Bloom. I don't know what it is about her but she is just not right for the part at all. I've read that she is an excellent actress (I've never seen her in anything else so I can't be the judge of that) and I know she is adored by many but she just grates me every time she's on screen. This is just a personal opinion and I'm sure many would argue that she does a fine performance so don't let that put you off watching Hannibal. The second is Hugh Dancy as Will Graham. His portrayal of someone with aspergers, while correct in some ways, is all a bit too theatrical for my liking. If I had to sum up Hugh Dancy's Will Graham in one word I would have to pick 'Fragile' which is not really what Will Graham character is about. Sophia Helin did a much better job of playing a detective with aspergers in Broen (The Bridge). Story-wise Hannibal is, in the main, excellent. The pace is good, particularly in the first season. The second season started really well but has suddenly had a lull for about three episodes now and I hope the story picks up soon. Overall though it's very good. There's plenty of tension and horror; prepare for some grisly scenes!So whilst this show isn't perfect, you should be watching it because it is definitely good! If for no other reason, dip in to watch Mads Mikkelsen's performance. Gets a solid 8 / 10 rating from me."
108,"Every so often you get a TV series that makes you sit up and take notice. It stands out for it's innovation, style, edge, plot and design. You go through series after series disappointed that potential was wasted. Why didn't it meet my expectations or hopes? But then, out of the blue, you get a real gem. Hannibal is just that.From the style, with the eerie music, to the acting and characters, this show really hits the very depth of the mind and soul, making you question what's right and wrong, distinguishing between good and bad. The way the show is designed and portrayed. It's all very surreal and unique, which intrigues you into a psychological dream, exploring the state of mind and how it operates during the very darkest of scenarios.The main character, Will Graham, who is expertly portrayed by Hugh Dancy, really hits the spot. His very subtle mannerisms, which many shows would deem immaterial, perfectly summing up his emotions and persona, and he's excellently backed up by Mads Mikkelsen, as Hannibal Lector himself. The addiction grows as you're so desperate to see where this relationship goes and how it develops. The rest of the supporting cast are very strong, Laurence Fishburne in particular, and keep the flow of the story going as well as adding foundation to the series. But the two main leads are at the very top of their games.The entire atmosphere that is generated is what makes this so gripping. As excellent as the acting is, it's this chillingly sinister environment which is created, whereby you feel you are entering and living in a dream. Even the opening credits, which remain very efficient, set you up nicely for the tone of the episodes. Psychological dramas always tap those emotional vibes, feelings that are rarely explored.And it's that very darkness which makes this so good. There's a ruthless efficiency about the whole series. Nothing drags on, everything does what it needs to and moves onto the next chapter. There was always going to be an evil lurking in this show, as all dramas involving killers have, and a lot of the cases are very distressing, but the uniqueness allows the show to flourish over others in this genre. Even the way Graham's character empathises with the killers, and how this is presented, is genius.This series is destined for greatness. Whether they decide to extend it's life with a second or third season isn't clear. But, one thing's for sure, this is a superb psychological drama, that makes you think, worry, question and believe. Things that are few and far between in the entertainment industry in this day and age.Exploring the mind requires a delicate touch. The balance needs to be struck, the attention to detail maintained and the emotions need to run deep. Everything is done to a refreshing level of quality, which allows Hannibal to show it's true unorthodox colours, and maintain that standard to a scarily high level.This is a design, and it's a masterpiece."
109,"I am fine with a show that is dumb and knows its dumb (The Following). And intelligent shows where they know it is intelligent (Person Of Interest, True Detective) but when the show has misconceptions about itself, the result is not pretty. The cast looks stellar and is good enough but is treated badly. I cannot relate to any character nor can I empathize. I hope it gets better for the fans but I may not continue further. I can see why people like this show and have no complains for them but based on my opinion, this show loses its pace early on and gets really boring. I can call Hannibal ""poor man's True Detective"". P.S. big fan of Mads Mikkelson who is stunning at the psychopath."
110,"Dr Lecter was not Graham's psychiatrist!! I don't know where this story is supposed to come from,but someone pulled it out of the air!! Thomas Harris took his one famed character and wrote other books about him to build the character, movies were made afterward. Hannibal (the book) does not end like the movie,that is why Jodie Foster wouldn't act in that one! The character that plays Hannibal is the worst choice for an actor I have ever seen!! Hannibal is supposed to be slight, where is slight in this man? He is supposed to be refined. All I hear is an accent. Whoever decided to make this show is delusional. You cannot make what does not exist. I caught the third episode and there is no way Hannibal would trust a stricken girl to hold his secrets. STUPID!!! He is a genius!! Thats' why he got away with all he did,Graham caught him by chance. Please do not waste your time on this show, unless of course you have time to waste with nothing better to do. Then have at it. But read the books before you decide a show is so awesome."
111,"the first season of this show was great.. and the second season started out... OK.. but 10 episodes into it and you realize the writers aren't smart enough to make this show into the psychological thriller it could be.. all these murders and the show just keeps going.. everyone pointing the fingers at everyone else but nobody does the work to find out.. if this show took place in the 1900's I could see the characters getting away with it, but it takes place in the modern day so it's beyond ridiculous.. so much flip flopping, and doubt and accusation and bullshit. meanwhile all it would take to find out if Hannibal was the killer is to get a search warrant for his house lol.. What ruins this show is that everyone is so smart and yet they are completely oblivious to the people around them?? sorry not buying it.. i expect this show to be cancelled soon"
112,"Graham is a wonderful character, brilliantly seen and read in Red Dragon. This pilot is interesting because it kind of fits more with what we have seen with Manhunter, and that is perfectly fine with me.I won't get into the plot, because we all know it. I will just simply say, this is a great pilot with some great familiar themes. My problem is it feels more like an episode of a miniseries rather than a TV show. I really hope Hannibal himself is pulled more into the background to allow for a network series gain some balance, because there is a lot of room for this to become a unique procedural drama. But I get nervous when an alphabet network gets a hold of a series like this because they inevitably begin to go for the cliché. Graham's visions, for example, I see becoming old if overdone. And if there is too much going on with the Lector story, this will burn out too fast.I give this a six now, it could become a ten, but I see some things to be cautious about. If the show is smart enough to keep Hannibal as the secondary character he is meant to be and focus on Graham and the FBI, it has a good chance. Hannibal is a great antagonist, but the puppet master should not be seen unless need me.This is NBC, there is a lot to worry about. If they want a Lector-heavy storyline then I hope they have an endgame in mind ala Breaking Bad, otherwise this will just burn out.Fingers crossed."
113,"First of, I'm Danish like Mads Mikkelsen who plays Hannibal. I don't know whats worse, his horrible English, which is impossible to understand without subtitles or his wooden acting.Why the Americans love this guy so much is beyond me. He is ugly and clearly, don't get the Hannibal character. But it might be bad directing as everyone on this show sucks, including Hugh Dancy.The show is an insult to every Hannibal movie ever made, including Hannibal Rising, a movie I did'nt like, that still manages to be ten times better than this crap.The show is going nowhere and it's boring and the gore is pointless and disgusting."
114,"TV and movies, is there anything more subjective? I am honestly surprised by the high ratings on IMDb for this TV series. I am a huge fan of the books and the movies so was very much looking forward to watching this show. To say I am disappointed is an understatement.It is definitely a slow burn, perhaps a little too slow for my taste, but the most annoying aspect for me is the choice of actors for the main roles. It's difficult for me to take Hugh Dancy seriously as the case hardened FBI agent Wil Graham when his physical appearance is more akin to that of a garden gnome.As for Mads Mikkelsen, who has the unenviable chore of portraying the deliciously sinister Hannibal Lecter... quite frankly, I can hardly understand a word he mumbles. Note to director: delivering dialogue in a soft mumbling monotone does not equal sinister!! In fact, it detracts hugely from the overall effect.I am probably being more critical than is warranted but, as a die-hard Thomas Harris fan, I am a little annoyed that what is such a fantastic basis for a TV series has been reduced to merely ""average"" per medium of poor casting.Obviously many disagree with my assessment, but that is the nature of the beast."
115,"there is really nothing good about this show, Hannibal played by the Danish actor Mikkelsen is very hard to understand, its like ""sylvester Stallone"" in First blood. I mean honestly this is the best choice after a class actor like Hopkins that make Hannibal the super Movies that they are. And why is the show called Hannibal when the lead character clearly is Will Graham?! I hope that the show stops because its a waste of Viewers time. I am amazed that so many write positive Reviews about Hannibal... guess they are not paid to do so buy i would suspect that hahaha this really is a very bad show even i rate it a 4. Nothing compared to Dexter or the original Hannibal Movies.I just want to warn you :-)"
116,"I've been a fan of Mads Mikkelson for a long time. I remember seeing him in Danish movies years ago. So when I heard he'd done three seasons in a show as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, I figured I was in for a treat.For the most part, I absolutely loved this show. There were a few hangups, but they were easily surpassed by what I was seeing. This show is a visual masterpiece; it's serious eye candy! The main thing I didn't like were in the character of Will Graham, although overall he was good. Additionally, I felt like the storyline of the first season relied too heavily on what was happening at the FBI, gory crime scenes, etc. and not enough emphasis was put on Hannibal -- afterall, they did name the show after him!If you're a fan of 1993's ""Silence of the Lambs"" or 2000's ""Hannibal"", then chances are you are going to love this series. I just would've done a few things differently if I'd written the show, mainly focusing more on Hannibal and less on the supporting characters.Well I really must go now, as I'm having an old friend for dinner."
117,"At first I had little expectations for this show and thought it would just be a cheap Silence of The Lambs cash grab, but after watching the show I was completely hooked and it is now one of my all time favorite tv series. As a medical resident, I was generally surprised by the accuracy of the visuals and medicine depicted in the show.The music is probably one of the best in the horror genre."
118,"Obsessed with the fact that Mads Mikkelsen's Hannibal Lecter is not a character constructed to terrify the audience but show us that someone's evil side can be so subtle and so restrained it is barely perceiveable, and when seen, it is easier to ignore."
119,"What makes this series so good and different from previous interpretations of Hannibal Lecter is that we get to see him for whom he is as a human. The portrayl of Mads Mikkelsen has depth and meaning beyond being an object of horror to shock the public. Somehow, they brilliantly managed to humanize the devil, make him somebody you are scared of but still, feels empathy for. You can see when he cares, when he's heartbroken or regretful and all of these emotions that usually, are discarted by many horror writers. Truly, a masterpiece."
120,"What catches me the most is the fascinating relationship between Graham and Hannibal because they are both equals and still, there is more depth to that than simply mirroring each other's actions and thoughts. This show itself is more than gore and horror, it is a true elevation of the genre."
121,"No other series has ever made me has a change of opinion so strong as this show did. Honestly, thrillers were never of my taste it much less graphic violence on movies and TV shows, however, after watching Hannibal I see it differently. Bryan Fuller somehow managed to make fight scenes look erotic and all the gore very beautiful to watch to."
122,"Mads and Hugh are perfect for the roles they capture in this series. They balance that fine line of love and disgust and adoration for one another - it's so beautifully done
I just wish this would of continued on after season 3
Definitely not for the weak hearted in regards to gore"
123,"It's all been said here.But must add that Hugh Dancy's over acting (Will Graham) brings the show from a solid 8 down to a 7, or 6 if he has too much screen time.He's on the verge of breakdown in every other scene.
Sweats, shakes, etc....ech.Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, cures all ills though.
Fantastic.Love the gay guy from Kids in the Hall, Scott Thompson.
Does a great job with mix of a serious and classic comedic relief character, a crime scene investigator."
124,"One of the most beautiful shows I have ever seen. I was unsure when I heard about Hannibal the TV show. After all, how could any show truly bring the spirit of such a concept to life without sacrificing something for the networks, but I was wrong. This show is captivating. Each episode is a carefully crafted spell that weaves a terrifying tale not just with words, but with sound, cinematography, and emotion. As stated by so many others here, Hannibal had only been one man to me. No other could compare to the mastery of Anthony Hopkins, but once again I was proven otherwise. Mads Mikkelson managed to make Dr. Hannibal Lecter both petrifying and mesmerizing all at once. Coupled with the estranged and neurotic portrayal of Will Graham by Hugh Dancy, I was entranced to the very end. I can count on one hand the number of shows that have left me so enraptured. Everyone who was on this show brought something to it I have not seen in any other program. Visually it was compelling and dangerous. I had not expected to see such gruesome acts portrayed on regular network television, but without them this show would not have had the weight that it does. These aren't just gruesome scenes for shock value, they tell a story. They help the characters within the plot construct a profile. They let the audience know that this isn't just another murderer, but someone who is mortifying beyond words. There is urgency in the characters and that move beyond the lines in the scripts. For example, in the beginning of the series there is a collection of scenes where Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier played by Gillian Anderson and Dr. Hannibal Lecter talk with one another. At first you are unsure of what is going on. She is calm and collected, but the subtle changes in her tone, the slight movements of her body give you the sense that something is off. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is cool as every but the slight inflections make it seem as though he is playing, it isn't till later on in the series that you discover the depth of their relationship and it is a spiral into the depths of hell. I was sad that this series was so short, but at the same time I wouldn't have wanted them to extend it beyond its life. It was perfect. I would give one word of caution however to those watching. If you are someone who has an overactive imagination or is frightened of such concepts, don't watch this series. While I would be saddened that it couldn't be enjoyed by another this show does not pull any punches. It is morbid and dark and that is saying it lightly. It gets into the minds of its characters both the good guys and the bad, and it will not give you a reprieve till the very last episode."
125,"This show starts off interesting. An interesting murder gets solved, a second one in the next episode. But after a while the show gets so twisted it becomes hard to believe and even seems like a joke.The murders are all gruesome and weird as if the murderers want to make a piece of art with the crime scene and body. After the 5th episode, it's a bit funny that they stumble upon wicked and weird crime scene every single day, like regular murders don't happen anymore.The main character (Will) gets these super accurate visions of how the crime occurred just because he is extremely emphatic. At first, it's believable: he's just some kind of genius who can put himself in the mind of the killer and deduce from that. But sometimes, oh man, it's like the facts are pulled out of nowhere. I think Will is actually a spirit medium and goes in contact with the dead to know exactly what happened.Thinking about it, Will is the ONLY investigator the FBI has and his visions are their only resource to catch the killer. Where are the investigations, like finding clues, profiling suspects or interrogating witnesses? FBI doesn't need that. They just need Will's vision and they end up EASILY finding the bad guy. lolWill gets these INSANE hallucinations, blackouts and cannot distinguish between vision or reality -- HE GETS COMPLETELY NUTS-- yet his boss is like, whatever I'll watch over him, he'll be fine and lets him work as an investigator for the FBI. Anyone in their right mind would say ""I think you need some vacation Will"".Lecter is Will's psychiatrist, yet the more time passes the more Will goes insane. Nobody cares? Nobody asks Lecter ""What the **** is going on with Will"" and nobody questions Lecter's competence to treat Will's illness. He's a psychiatrist, he knows what he's doing, but the fact is that will is literally going insane in front of their eyes and nobody cares. lolAt first, this show appears to be clever and interesting, but when really thinking about it, it's actually pretty silly and dumb."
126,"I am an avid movie watcher, and I don't discriminate. I'll watch anything. In the last decade, a new genre of films has arisen, films called torture porn. On youtube, they sometimes call this type of imagery things you cannot unsee. In addition, TV shows have become unbelievably, and thankfully, more graphic. I figured it wasn't a big deal, so I watched it all. And I regret some of it. The level of violence it takes to disturb me isn't healthy. It's like a high water mark was set and is impossible to erase. I noticed this when I saw the Human Caterpillar and thought it was tame and goofy. So I was surprised when I found something unbearable. There was a moment near the end of the film Hannibal with Ray Liotta that crossed a line and made me very upset. And it seems as though the Hannibal TV show has made that moment its theme. And strangely, in every episode, the emotional damage this causes is discussed at length with regard to the character of Will Graham, but not to the viewer. As I hear and see his emotional damaging, I wonder what damage is being inflicted on me. After 3 episodes, I had nightmares. This show is well made for sure, but it goes too far. I don't believe this is healthy, and I worry about the damage this has on society. It's irresponsible and it has become commonplace. There's a saying ""if it's too loud then you're too old."" I can't believe I'm saying this, but Hannibal is too loud. I wish I'd never seen it. I hope they stop making programming like this. It isn't like a Judas Priest song, this is unbelievably graphic and realistic. It has permanently damaged me. I feel like the victim of emotional abuse who stays with their abuser. The creators of this surely recognize what they're doing, but continue to do it in order to make money. And I willingly participated in watching it. It proves that well made doesn't equal good. This show is well written, well cast, well directed, well edited. The music is excellent, so is the lighting, and the set design. It's only flaw is in its content. The content is bad. Truly bad."
127,"The one word that can describe ""Hannibal"" is ""Art"".The actors did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen delivered a stunning performance as Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hugh Dancy, Laurence Fishburne and Gillian Anderson delivered brilliant performances too.Photography is a piece of art. The clothes are so amazing and elegant. The colors are beautiful. All of this made ""Hannibal"" a feast for the eyes.Music is wonderful and well-chosen.Writing, above all, is the milestone here. The show is very well- written. The conversations between Dr.Lecter and Will Graham and those between Dr.Lecter and his patients are brilliant. For me, it is not about horror, cannibalism or bloodshed, it is about how deep this show gets into the human soul with all its complications.""Hannibal"" is a show that satisfies your eyes, your ears and your mind."
128,"I tried watching the premier for this show, but I couldn't finish it. The storytelling is too random and the characters are too bizarre for me. The acting is decent however, with an all-star cast. Lawrence Fishbourne plays an FBI agent and Mads Mikkelsen (of Casino Royale fame) plays Hannibal Lector. Less well known (to me anyway) is Hugh Dancy, who plays a troubled special agent. It does not follow the original Hannibal film series, other than the fact that Hannibal Lector is a cannibal. The plot follows the agents as they search for a serial killer/cannibal. Hannibal Lector assists the FBI in their search. Cutting down on some of the mystery, Hannibal is shown cooking and eating the victims organs. I prefer a little more subtlety in thriller movies/shows. It would probably also have been better if the concept hadn't already been established by the films. I was really hoping that this show would be better."
129,"I was dreading watching this to be honest, I thought the trailer looked rubbish and I was dreading seeing someone mess up a character (Hannibal) who I really like, especially how it is portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. However I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was done, the production quality was great and the acting was captivating. Some of the other reviews mentioned the pace being too fast, I don't find that to be a problem due to the amount of material the writers have at the disposal, I personally find the pace very satisfying as the first episode covered a lot ground and kept me riveted. My only complaint was that it was only 40 minutes.As you can guess I really enjoyed watching the first episode, I just hope that the following episodes will live up to the high standards set by the Pilot! I look forward to watching them."
130,"Godawful writinglaughably bad charactersincoherent dialogue and storylinepathetic, pretentious nonsense from start to finishgore and violence for the sake of gore and violence (just like equally godawful Game of Thrones)etc etc etc etcLiterally anyone who considers this ridiculous, embarrassingly levels of terrible tripe actually ""great"" (as the typical tasteless trolls of IMDb have predictably come out in droves to voice as they never fail to do) well......you're factually wrong. The End X )"
131,"Hugh Dancy in Hannibal reminded me of two characters. David Krumholtz character in ""Numb3rs"" the TV series and Michael C. Halls character in ""Dexter""... mashed up. Only for Mads Mikkelsen going to give this a 5 out of 10. Otherwise both the episodes aired so far showcases some desperation to have that ""Dexter""esque look and feel. Does not do much justice to the world of Hannibal. You get distracted way too often. Right before you try to start understanding the character. Story-wise, it could have been better. Less dialogues and more action was expected. If you do not have any work at hand and can not fall asleep, then this is your drug. But that is just me..."
132,"If you'd have told me that the TV series of Hannibal was going to be this good I'd have simply not believed you. The movies were not even that great, though plenty would probably disagree with me.Yet, the series not only introduces a total new take on Hannibal Lecture (I mean new compared to the films not the novel which I haven't read) but completely erases any memory of the Anthony Hopkins portrayal. I felt I could have watched Hannibal indefinitely, the flow was so hypnotic and the characters so well portrayed and the concepts touched upon with such respect it was a blessing to experience.Every series was enjoyable to the point of re-watching, and the themes and philosophical musings (captured so well by the production and actors) felt not only like high brow entertainment but deeply personal on every level.Loved it"
133,"So I was looking for a new TV show/box set to watch and came across Hannibal. I decided to give it a go based on so many good reviews. It sounded like it would be my type of programme as I love the crime/thriller genre. 11 episodes in and I feel as though I'm on a completely different planet from the avid fans of the show. I've given it 5 as I haven't seen it all so maybe I'm not in the most fair place to judge, however from what I have seen I must say I'm disappointed. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal I find so different from Mad's in this series, maybe that's where some of this disappointment has come from. Hopkins I believed made Hannibal come across as creepy, terrifying, clever and somewhat likable? I think Mad's acting is really something special but that 'likable' quality to Hannibal is non-existent. He does a fantastic job of making him creepy but I feel as though something is lacking. Another criticism of the show is that I'm personally not too keen on the way it's written. It seems to me the script is 'clever' for the sake of being clever, which for me makes it seem less believable and somewhat fake if that makes sense. It just doesn't seem genuine to me. I must however compliment the visual and cinematic effects seen throughout every episode. Technically speaking it is a very modern and well executed series but from an enjoyment point of view I think I've failed to discover or find the love and passion for the show that so many others have. After watching the first episode I was intrigued so I watched another... But now, on episode 11 I'm just lost. I don't find any of the characters to be likable or relatable. Previous TV shows I have watched have kept me at the edge of my seat and with the original intention of only watching a couple of episodes I'd end up flying through a whole season in a day. Hannibal lacks this for me. It's a real shame as I want to like the show, and who knows maybe I will watch episode 12 if I have nothing better to do. I must admit I'm a little envious of the fans who really enjoy it as I wish I could."
134,"I was excited to hear of the further stories of Hannibal Lector. After watching episode I did enjoy the story line except I found it odd that Hannibal is a middle aged man in the series, surround with modern technology. Such as iPads and cellphones.Excuse me but in Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris, young Hannibal was a child during WWII which had the setting of his development into a cannibal.So wouldn't this series have Hannibal being middle aged in the 70s/80s? It lost me.Mads Mikkelsen is okay as Hannibal but I would love to have found out how he transition from Europe to America and forming an American accent?"
135,"I'm a big fan of the Hannibal books. I also enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, but have yet to see any of the other film adaptations.Currently on episode 3 of this series and it is average. HBO have taken the predictable protagonist character of a man who is isolated from the world (even going so far as to give him a mental illness); a man who sees the world 'differently' and therefore this gives him a gift of solving crimes (House, the Mentalist, Gil Grissom in CSI, Criminal Minds). The only thing that makes this differ from the aforementioned programmes is the added 'hook' of a psychiatrist cannibal. Yawn.Overall it's quite beautiful to watch, but the crimes so far are twisted in a way that is not necessarily interesting, just weird. The relationship between the protagonist and Hannibal is not interesting, and has very little to offer the viewer. Also, the soundtrack and music overshadows the dialogue by trying to convince the viewer that each conversation is profound, edgy, and/or twisted and will add something to the almost non-existent plot.If you enjoy CSI, the Mentalist, or any other programme like this, you'll probably enjoy Hannibal. But for me, it's one too many of these clichés, it is too predictable, and I'd want to punch each character in the face for being annoying if I cared enough to dislike them.On a side-note, the actor playing Hannibal is incredibly talented. Unfortunately, his acting is lost within the fray of the average that pervades this television programme. I am incredibly disappointed."
136,"A Masterpiece at it's finest. Aside from all the delicious disturbances, a beast whispering in a delusional chrysalis. Moth or butterfly yet to hatch.""I don't find you that interesting"" ""You will"" - this two lines represents the whole series. A thriller like never before. I always thought no one can match up to Hopkin's Hannibal, until I witness this spectacular show. Not only it beats man-eater but every Hannibal work ever made. Will Graham and Hannibal truly justifies Thomas Harris's franchise. Music were mesmerizing. Dinners were delicious. Make me desire for them, even if it's human flesh. And last but not the least, cinematographies were the gems of this show"
137,"I can't believe how much this series has changed my perspective of visual art form within the television sector, as it just captivates me within literally every minute of watching it!The suspense you feel inside the ensemble of highly creative musical scores, guided by the almost crazy images on screen, completely immerses you as the viewer to a point where you feel so involved in what's going on, you start to vividly question nearly everything as if you were an actual character in the show, but with enormous connection and clarity. This is possibly the one thing I believe I crave within all cinema and TV. The relationships between the central characters (alas not all of them) become sublimely developed, providing you a very intimate journey with these characters in the storyline. With these chances to discover them, their psychopathic personalities and life threatening shift's in trust between them make such an impression on the viewer, you truly are left in awe of its near perfect drama and well executed tension. As well as this, you have so many scenes of clever and intricate pure savagery, it does become significant when compared to some of the conventions you see in other horror adaptations (hannibal based or otherwise). Although I understand most people would find this part too much. For me, I've always been 50/50 when it comes to watching and enjoying horror based productions, as it can be quite disturbing at times in your life. However, in a series filled to the brim with so much of this theme, Hannibal just sets itself apart with it's high thrill factor within the psychological aspect of the show and impacts you so much with it's great cinematography, musical score and insanely good acting, it's a hard to not absolutely love it...Mads Mikkelson, Hugh Dancy and Lawrence Fishurne you have my respect entirely! 10/10 (My first review here :D)"
138,"I'm a HUGE fan of Thomas Harris' novel's ""Red Dragon,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and ""Hannibal."" I'm also a desperate fan of the movies. In ""Silence of the Lambs,"" we follow a young FBI trainee (enter our Miss Marple) as she tries to solve a gruesome series of Serial Killings by a killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" because he ""skins young women's hides."" During the course of this two hour thriller. We are introduced to the character of Hannibal Lecter, a one time surgeon/doctor and trained psychiatrist who ate his patients. Because he decided to make pate a foie gras out of clientele we get to see him behind cold glass. We are introduced to Dr. Lecter through a series of epithets from other characters, characters that tell Clarice Starling, ""You don't wantHannibal in your head,"" and ""He once ate a nurse's face off..."" Through a series of well-played, subtle interactions between Starling and Lecter, including amazing facial acting and intonation from both Hopkins and Foster, we come to see how dark and deep this Dr. really goes--but here's the problem--Hopkin's Lecter goes a leetle bit over the top at being truly ""creepy."" I mean, you have a Serial killer here, who eats people, that's creepy enough--but he hisses, and slurs words and overacts just a ""wee"" bit. To the trained eye, you can pick it up. Hopkins comes off sometimes subtly as more of a ""mad man"" than a psychopath. One could make the argument that Hopkin's version of Lecter is doing a ""mad man"" performance for Clarice Starling- However the real Lecter would consider that beneath him. In the movie ""Hannibal Rising"" we get the same type of Lecter from actor Gaspard Ulliel.Currently-to-date in 2013 enter a new Show on NBC, Thursday nights, 10,9 central, and it's definitely not for children, or the faint of heart. Here, we have Mads Mikkelson, a Danish actor, well known for playing an Antagonist to James Bond, Le Chiffre, in Casino Royale, 2006, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayor. The new show follows the follies, foibles, and amazing abilities of Will Graham in the first novel, ""Red Dragon."" Hugh Dancy's amazing portrayal of natural empath Will Graham, plays a very stark contrast, with Graham's own moral compass aggravated by his ability to completely connect with a killer and their motives, or lack thereof. This creates an amazing dimension between a character with true moral and conscious depth against how Mikkelson is portraying Hannibal Lecter- -as a pure psychopath.Mikkelson has put a slightly different spin on the character of Hannibal Lecter, and I like it a lot, and I think audiences will too. You can see it in the way he is exceptionally subtle with all affect and outward emotion. He is distanced, he is predatory, and he has no affect. It is as if Mr. Mikkelson is portraying the character from the side of someone who has studied psychopathy all their life. We don't see a brutal ""madman"" at all in his character. We see cold, studied, calculated death in human form. And here's the other amazing thing Mikkelson does with the character, he only ""subtly"" reacts with a very slight smile, or upturned lip, when someone complements his abilities as a killer or an artist. Mikkelson also only subtly reacts with a slight grimace when someone is onto him. It is as if this actor has subtle nuances down to a science, and as if he knows, instinctively that a psychopath would not portray himself a ""mad"" man, but rather a complete and total gentleman, complete with suit, tie, cleanliness, and disturbingly amazing culinary artistry. Mads gives audiences what they've been lacking--a true ""Satan"" of a character, in his portrayal of Hannibal. I cannot wait to see where the producers take this series. Thank you for giving us a truly frightening version of the darkest serial killer in modern crime novels."
139,"Why would we waste great photography/theatrical skills/glamorize murdering our own kind? Homicide rates in this country have significantly increased including those that are sociopaths. This show glamorize/sensationalize the killing of others. Why not use those visual/acting/and promoting skills to something useful like the horror of our water supply and how it is wasted by the common man. Or why not have a show on parasites and how they are related to different mental health/physical health and how to do a parasite clean out? Why not have a show that glamorize the problem of food and how it has increased in price to 75% in the last 3 years? Hannibal is stupid it teaches to hate. It teach intolerance and it insult to my intelligence. I will do everything in my power to get the word out that it is a stupid, stupid, stupid SHOW!"
140,"Don't believe the ratings and reviews here, they are obviously shills or written by the tasteless.This show is hot garbage just like everything else you find on NBC. IF you can't get enough of garbage shows like CSI you will love it. If you love to see NBC do Dexter, you will love it.Anyone with a brain watches it and sees right through it and knows the NBC can't do a show like this. A show on NBC will never be dark enough to make it realistic or entertaining.Don't waste your time on this piece of junk and LMAO at how desperate NBC and companies are to create fake reviews, although I shouldn't be surprised consider the millions of fake twitter fans for Gaga and Bieber. Again, this show is garbage"
141,"I confess I've only watched up to nearly the end of the second episode of the 3 available to me, and someone somewhere says it's only after the third that this stuff begins to grip, but I am certain after watching the two last night and then sleeping on it that this is an overwrought, over-kinky, over-violent and just generally overdone piece of parasitizing on the great original, Silence ...., still trying to cash in on the original as the producers have been doing for many a long year. I admit after the simple perfection of Silence that I found the gorgeous Hannibal rather flavoursome, and Red Dragon, even, okay, though the insanity was beginning to be over-weighty, but then Hannibal Rising arrived, a risible and disgusting piece of exploitative nonsense. Still trying to milk the franchise, the production company now comes up with this muck. A massive revision of the characters as we know them, but still they are the same characters and we still know, however it happens, how it will turn out. But now Lecter is the very spooky Mad M., who is a sinister looking gentleman with a rather thick Danish accent, sometimes hard to understand, and who frankly looks like a thug, quite unlike the genius Hopkins we have come to know and love, but like god alone knows what. And then there is Mr Dancy as Will Graham, who has Cruise-like problems with eye contact and a miserable look and 'pure empathy', sheer twaddle the lot of it. You certainly begin to wonder who the story is about, Will, Lecter, or the other ever more baroque and unbelievable murders cropping up on a regular basis. The reason I come here to IMDb to write about it is from upset, and from distress, and from sadness and anger that such exploitation is rife and will no doubt go on to sully the imaginations of generations younger than mine who witnessed the original."
142,"I didn't think I would like Hannibal as I'm not a fan of Silence of the Lambs or Anthony Hopkins, but Mads Mikelsen is incredible as is Hugh Dancy and the rest of the cast. But Mads just makes Hannibal the cannibal alot more sinister and scary, his culinary skills in this is first class.
A visual masterpiece with brilliant dialogue that draws you in and the crescendo always goes beyond expectations. It's deliciously good.
After watching all 3 seasons I need a moment to digest what happened, knowing that this amazing series was cancelled which is a sad loss to TV.
As good or if not better than Dexter and Dexter has always been a firm favourite.
Also hats off to Richard Armitage for his fantastic portrayal of the Red Dragon.
I can sum this series up in 2 words.
BLOODY DELICIOUS 😀 pun intended.So go watch it."
143,I wish they would finally bring this show back! It's perfect for the upcoming new expanded Hulu (just a suggestion). Can't wait!
144,The reason I am so impressed by this show is that it gives its due to one of the most iconic characters in Hannibal Lecter's life - Will Graham. I saw Season 1 and I was petrified of all the serial killers shown in each episode. Maks Middelsen does an excellent job here as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Even though he plays the central character ; Hugh Dancy playing Will Graham takes the cake. He acts brilliantly as the slightly demented FBI Profiler and his shift from little insane to completely maniac is shown perfectly. The direction is brilliant. I love the way it has been shot and the way the story has been twisted and tweaked in every episode to generate thrill..Will Graham impresses me. I wish there was more shown of that character in mainstream cinema apart from just one movie where he is portrayed by Edward Norton. Hugh Dancy is very very impressive in this role.
145,"*Contains spoilers*It is a story about a serial killer and FBI consultant who has been gifted with a talent to see how the crime happened. Due to his talent he is given the most bloody and complicated cases because of which he start to suffer mentally. So he is assigned to a psychiatrist that happens to be the most clever serial killer of all. So instead of disposing from consultant he tries to divert his path to become his assistant. Overall I believe this is one of the most exciting series I have seen. Mikkelsen was chosen brilliantly. He is ugly enough to be disgusted as a cannibal although at the same time he is aristocratc, intelligent and clever. You adore him and hate him at the same time. Scenario is all as complicated as you can be making you notice every small little inch of the screen but it also leads you to have your own thoughts before ""it happens"". Brilliant screen play, brillian scenario, brilliant filming. Must watch without any breaks."
146,"Hannibal is a faithful adaptation of the works by Thomas Harris, with, of course, a few artistic liberties included. Hannibal presents itself as a neo-noir crime drama as perceived by a surrealist.The use of color and tone is evocative and intoxicating. Each season follows a particular story line from Harris' books. Season one delves into the titular character of Will Graham and his connection with both Hannibal and the FBI. This season has its own artistic liberties as it lays a foundation of the character of Will Graham from source material in Red Dragon. Season two continues to follow the story of Hannibal pre-capture and his connection to Mason Verger, a story previously alluded to in the book and movie entitled Hannibal. The second season leads into the third, further cementing the stories of both Red Dragon and Hannibal, including Hannibal's escape into Italy, though replacing the character of Clarice Starling with those of both Will Graham and Bedellia du Maurier. It is a series that was cut too short, in my opinion as an avid reader of Harris' works. I feel the show was too smart for television, and the in depth characterization of serial killers in the show were presented as an artists rendering of mental illness, including vivid hallucinations and exaggerated sense of self. Overall, it is a well acted, well oiled machine that few could follow, as it is often more metaphorical and requires the viewer to place themselves in the shoes of psychopaths; a feat that few seem to handle."
147,"Hannibal is one of those great shows that comes along and breaks the norm. It does something completely different which makes it so great. The acting is top notch and the writing is brilliant, the twisted and disturbing ways people kill their victims is really well done. Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy both do an amazing job playing their respective characters especially Mads who really got the creepiness just right. The best thing about this is it shows how manipulative Psychopaths can really be and how they can change people like Will, make them become someone different. This show really delves in to deep psychological conditions and effects and those parts when will is inside his mind look so good.Overall I gave this a 9/10 it is really good and I recommend any fan of Thomas Harris' books watch this, or anyone who is a big fan of shows that do things completely different from normal."
148,"Being a lover of the movies, and the books by Thomas Harris (particularly Silence of the Lambs, and Red Dragon), I wasn't too sure of this when I first heard about it. I decided to give it a go, however, because of the sheer number of recommendations of it from people who have similar interests to me. I was initially worried that Hannibal would be similar to the string of American series that seem to be hitting the screens at the moment, all seemingly aimed at the Twilight generation, all visually interesting but lacking substance.. I find those types of work difficult to digest, as many still desperately clamber to portray the everybody-is-rich-and-beautiful 'American dream' which just makes for more falsity than any of the dramatic fantasy/horror undertones they can conjure.It borrows certain characters and events from Red Dragon, but I wouldn't call this a prequel as such - if at all, and I see it as an almost 'alternate universe' using the same characters. It goes into a completely different direction from the books and movies, and flips everything over. You are seeing the exact same relationship between Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter, but scrutinised, and in an entirely different light because of the circumstances they find themselves in within the story.I think that if you are watching this in the hopes of watching another crime investigatory series, such as CSI etc (and the movies did have such a pattern) then you might be disappointed. This is a series that focuses on Hannibal, on Will, their relationship, and the dynamics of that relationship. Everything else is only a secondary enjoyment. I do particularly LOVE the relationship between Hannibal and Bedalia Du Maurier, his psychotherapist, as well, but I won't say much more on that... I have a feeling that her arcs in the story will be revealing much more about Hannibal, himself, in time.Hannibal is visually interesting, and stunning... but there is much more meat on the bones, and if you can't see where it is then you probably won't. It seems to me, that those in the audience who have gotten the most from this, tend to have an empathic thinking pattern already similar to that of Will Graham.. so, we can understand and sympathise with his predicament fully, as well as that of Hannibal (though it is hard, as even though we do get more glimpses of him than Will, he is very much locked away from us as well - for now), and the characters (both 'good' and 'villainous') that surround and intertwine with them. Here, we have two desperately lonely individuals, on two extreme and opposite ends of the spectrum, both over thinking the details, and harbouring the desire to connect with another. Some of the most beautiful scenes involve Will when he is alone and reflective, much symbolism is used, and is almost breathtaking during his moments of breakdown.It is a slow burner, initially, and I have to admit that I wasn't fully locked onto this until around the seventh or eighth episode. Now, I am glued to it, and am currently having to deal with waiting a week for each episode of season 2 just like everybody else!! I was worried that Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter could not be topped, it was perfect to me, but Mads Mikkelsen has eclipsed him. His portrayal is different, obscured, and much more subtle in some ways whilst being more outlandish in others. His version really is just as good, if not better. His portrayal is much more closed off, sociopathic, and left to the imagination, even as we witness his brutalities, but then I guess we are dealing with Hannibal under a much different set of circumstances here. I wonder if he will be as colourful and as outspoken when (and if) he is caught in the continuing series, as Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs. What is beneath the stitching of his 'person suit'?"
149,"After a couple of episodes into the first season, it is possible to talk about general impressions only. However, if you're a fan of the Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, you might already be a tad disappointed.The ""new"" Hannibal is modernized and faces some challenges. The main is how to attract the viewers with Dexter and several incarnations of CSI and similar shows behind them. Secondly, we all know who the real bad guy is, so the authors will have to offer something of the extraordinary. This is what they've tried, yet the main challenge remains.Although i'm no fan of such shows, i must admit that the cast is well chosen and the plot fulfilled my expectations. Mad Mikkelsen with his menacing appearance and a foreign accent is a good choice for Hannibal, but there is a trifle in his craft that put me off. He should work on his pronunciation, since some of his lines are impossible to understand without the subtitles... This was not the case in Casino Royale (2006) where he was a worthy adversary to James Bond."
150,"The cast, writing, cinematography, special effects, makeup, storyline are all amazing. As a member of the queer community I adore the way sexuality is represented as fluid. This show is a masterpiece. Art like nothing I've ever seen."
151,"This is not at TV show, its an absolute work of a genius. Hannibal is beautifully written, acted and directed and nothing like the movies of the past. Overall its a masterpiece and deserves fourth season. #SaveHannibal"
152,"That's philosophy, not just a series. You have to pay attention to every dialogue, because it has something to teach you about different philosophical topics."
153,"I don't actually watch TV-series, but this one is amazing and truly addictive for those who love serial killers and psychiatry."
154,"Absolutely loved this series, mads mikkelson plays this character so well! Didn't want it to end. Highly recommend giving this a watch!"
155,"I am going to say something heretical, so hold on to your seats. I thought that the Hannibal Lecter character in the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" was extremely overrated. Subtle, he was NOT, that's for sure. Because of this, I really, really like the new incarnation of the doctor in this Bryan Fuller series. He is sophisticated, clever and, most importantly, a credible villain--not some bizarro dude going on about chianti and fava beans! In fact, the sophistication and style of this show is why I think it's a winner.I must point out, however, that ""Hannibal"" is NOT a show for everyone. Children should NEVER watch it nor should people who are sensitive and would be upset or offended by the carnage in the shows. Some of them are REALLY tough to watch--such as the mushroom people or the angels. Now I am NOT saying don't watch it--but maybe you should use common sense and not watch. Or, do like my daughter does, just avert your eyes when the gore hits a particularly high level...and it often does! Very well written, acted and directed--this is almost too good for network TV.FYI--My daughter has the Blu-Ray for season one. According to her, some of the shows are MUCH more graphic on DVD--such as the one with the musical instrument killer."
156,"Technically this series could be described as a police procedural, but it might be better described as an unusual take on the psychological thriller genre. Rather than building tension in the form of suspense, however, a combination of precisely chosen, expressive dialogue and carefully composed visuals are contrasted with the macabre, unrealistically elaborate efforts of serial killers to create a thoroughly creepy, disturbing atmosphere.The effect is suggestive of a series of tableaux presenting classical works of art, alternating between beautiful and grotesque subject matter. The precision and sense of the aesthetic maintained throughout serve to heighten this effect, giving us a glimpse of the worldview of the title character, Hannibal Lecter.The style might be described as a combination of Hitchcock and Lynch. It's surprisingly explicit for American network TV, though almost tame compared to some cable TV fare. It doesn't have anything close to enough gory imagery or violence to please fans of the Grand Guignol gruesomeness found in many modern horror/suspense films, but it has enough that a warning to the audience is appropriate.Each of the regular characters are developed and explored with care, and even the minor characters come to life. The dialogue has the quality of a good play rather than the commonplace, realistic vernacular one might expect from subject matter like a series of FBI investigations."
157,I do not rate any other series/show close to how awesome this show is. I am glad it was made and I get to watch it! Now please can we get s4 asap.
158,"Can someone please just give Bryan Fuller the keys to Hollywood so he can make more shows like this (and American Gods) to his heart content?! Oh man, Fuller is such a brilliant director. This is a lavishly rich visual masterpiece. It is dark, sinister and eloquently written with many intelligent layers of metaphor. The soundtrack is unparalleled.Fuller has remade a classic story without sparing any detail. Mads is amazing, such a great all-round cast.I wish people appreciated shows like this more often, intelligent shows that challenge the genre and remake old stories with glorious results. I highly recommend."
159,"One of the all time best TV series i have watched so far. the acting is absolutely flawless but i did not expect less from both Mads, Lawrence and Gillan. Taking my hat off for this masterpiece!"
160,"Every single details is perfectly fit in the movie. Every plot is full of surprise which make me wonder what will happen next. The informations about psychology and cuisine have proved the talent of the director.
What impressed me most is the ways that Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy delivered the characters which were so brilliant and fascinating. Can's keep my eyes off the screen.
Moreover, i would like to say that even this is a horror movie series including lots of killing, murdering scences, they do not seem so frightening but aesthetic. This characteristic makes this series distinctive.
I am craving for season 4 now !!!!!"
161,"TV shows like Hannibal comes once in a decade. The story, characters, soundtrack, everything is top notch.
The second season of Hannibal is a memerizing,riveting and sickening experience that evolves the series with true artistic and dark gravitas as it builds to one of the most operatic climaxes in television history."
162,"I'm totally speechless. How can a tv show goes that far. I loved this show. The visualization , the dialogues everything just everything was great. It's the greatest thing I've ever seen and it will. I really really really loved this whole show. I just can't explain my fellings about this."
163,One of the best TV-series I've ever watched. Mikkelsen's performance is great!
164,"Hannibal TV series is a masterpiece in every way, and here is why:1. the characters and the actors (the 3 main characters)first of all let's be rational here saying that ""an actor can't act because they are not native speakers or because they are simply terrible at their job"" is an opinion that must be kept to yourself because that's not true and hurtful,so please have some respect when talking about people who've been appreciated for a long time now, thanks to their GREAT ACTING SKILLS1. starting with Will Graham who's portrayed by the talented Hugh Dancy.
Will stands out for me and I think he's the best character in all the series Hugh's acting was wonderfully astonishing I felt attached to him, could feel the pain in his eyes i felt dearly for him because of how good he portrayed a broken person who is trying his best to win his war against the darkness growing inside him
also you could see how much he developed after he got cured from everything that Hannibal did to him (the disturbed, mentally ill genius in season 1) (the doubting, yet certain dark side of him in season 2) (the confident, reckless profiler who is able to manipulate the manipulator in season3) so yeah, i believe hugh dancy did more than a great job portraying will graham, he owned the character not like any other actor who's ever played will graham
2. Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter: I guess this man is perfect for the role and he actually creeped me out the way he looked the way he acted was screaming (hannibal lecter). I enjoyed him so much as Hannibal even more than Anthony Hopkins it's my own opinion I did not really feel anything when watching Hannibal that was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins
you can tell that he's a psychopath from the way he talks from the way he manipulates people and even from the way he tried to get to convince will that he is actually a serial killer just like him.Crawford was so irritating to me because he was so blind in the series but Laurence actually portrayed him pretty beautifully because you can tell that he was a little bit too blinded by Hannibal's kindness and how occupied and logical he was not to mention he's also a psychiatrist so he couldn't actually question his loyalty or his smartness and Laurence nailed that to the point I started hating him because he was always on the Hannibal side against will (proves how amazing he is as an actor)2. the scenes that looked so artistic and vivid yet mysterious I felt as if I were there, "" you can create an indie music video from thoes scenes for they are truly a sight for sore eyes"" .
The intensity of the scenes was breath-taking, better than any adaptation that's ever been made and here is a small exampleif you watched anthony Hopkins's movie again you could tell how stupid the stabbing scene turned out to be, (the camera angle, the atmosphere, the acting) I felt like laughing but if you actually thought about the scene from Hannibal TV series you'd be rubbing your flesh to get rid of the goosebombs. The scene was filled with emotions and well-acted to the point it drove many people to tears...myself includedThe story:Everything was deliciously clear from the beginning of season one when Jack asked to borrow will's imagination and as will started solving cases people began to think that he's a psychopath himself, which made jack seek hannibal's help to become will's sanity. But he did the opposite, he wrecked will and killed people in silence, until he made everyone believe that his patient is the one to blame. Driving everyone believe, including the profiler himself.season 2 got a little darker when Hannibal Lecter took will's place and everyone was doubting Will, but he was aware he wasnt a killer, he knew that everything was designed by Hannibal Lecter, so all he desired was to reveal to reveal Hannibal's real identity...he even tried to kill him in order to bring that madness to an end, but he was criticized for it. Alana fell for Lecter and Jack started believing in him and no one believed in will until will was released for being innocent, and thats when he tries to manipulate lecter, but the older man figures out his game, which leads to a painful ending.season 3 now I understand where some of you you are coming from, true the first 4 episodes were not so appealing and the whole idea of italy didn't go so well... But then the show was back on track in no time. the red dragon shows up with an interesting story. and then Hannibal Lecter hands himself over because will rejected him. So hannibal is in jail and will Graham has a family. But because Hannibal wanted Will for himself he asked the red dragon who was a big fan of hannibal lecter to kill will's family, and it drove will mad, he started questioning his forgiveness wanting to kill Hannibal again, but they have to work together one more time to lure the red dragon and it works, so after they kill him, Will ends both their lives cause he promised to kill hannibal no matter the cost by pushing them off a cliff...
There is truly nothing boring nor unrealistic about this, not to anyone who's a fan of psychological crime drama, or anyone in their right mind.."
165,"Really an extraordinary experience, especially the climax...which gives hope for more!!!"
166,One of my best tv shows and I put Hannibal on the top 5 best tv shows that I have watched
167,"Episode 10 of the second season minute 38:20.. Making dinner together, what a beauty right there.. what a family.. What a killer"
168,"The character of Hannibal Lecter has always intrigued me. I remember seeing the adverts for 'Silence of the Lambs' as a child of 9 and being scared of Anthony Hopkins in the role. 'Hannibal' is another animal entirely. I hadn't heard much about the show and only stumbled across it while channel surfing, luckily catching it from the beginning. I was amazed at what I saw.The first thing that caught my attention were the production values and directing. Aesthetically, 'Hannibal' is in a league of it's own. It's a gorgeous looking show. But, beauty being skin deep, there must be more to it than the way it looks.The show itself is fascinating. I'm not much for shows like 'CSI' or other ""killer of the week"" programs, but 'Hannibal' is much more than that. The show focuses on gifted Special Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) working with the FBI in the field catching Serial Killers and, of course, the titular Character Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), whom Will is seeing due to psychological issues he has with his gift and job.Those familiar with the previous ""Lecter"" movies know the not-so- good Doctor is, eventually, caught by Graham and it is during this imprisonment he meets Agent Starling. Part of what makes this show intriguing is wondering when Will Graham will ""catch on"" to Lecter's ""game"". Here is a special agent, out trying to find serial murderers, and he works with one of the most dangerous and cunning of them all. I have not been let down by this show. It mixes stark imagery, danger, intrigue, and even humor into a piece of television art that I can't tear my eyes from."
169,1 season was impressive The second season is inspiring while 3 final series is a masterpiece!
170,"Hannibal is a brilliant, creative TV show. It's a masterpiece."
171,"I just can't watch any thing,no movie or series,not any more.My standards are on another level now and nothing please me.please bring back our favorite show and save them.I wanna see more Hannibal and Will in my life time"
172,"The pilot of this series is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of watching and I'm glad to report that the following episodes do not disappoint. There is no lull in this series as it revolves around the multi-faceted dimensions of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter's relationship. They start off as colleagues, graduate into being friends and transform into something I haven't been able to name. Murder husbands sounds great but it's not all that accurate.Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are incredible in this and they do an amazing job at convincing viewers of the dark magnetism that their characters share; the push and pull between Will and Hannibal is delicious though their relationship is toxic and very unstable. It sometimes feel as if the other characters are just collateral damage while Hannibal coaxes Will into embracing his darkness. It's like watching a car accident happening in slow motion.I wish that this show was given another chance because what they've done with it so far has been nothing short of entertaining as heck. Everyone involved in the making of this series are amazing and kudos to them for completing the series the way it did. I like that the ending is kind of up to interpretation as it leaves viewers to their imaginations, which has resulted in many wonderful fanworks."
173,"I have to say, this TV-Serie deserves to be continued. The cinematography is excellent, the actors did their job well and the special effects improve the ""visual experience"". I especially like the sound effects and the creepy music. The story itself unfolds over multiple episodes.I can recommend the TV-Serie Hannibal and I'm waiting for it to continue. I really have no idea why they cancelled the show."
174,"Very dark,psychologically intense ,brooding show...Just how I like them)
At the beginning I had some trouble adjusting to Hannibal not being Antony Hopkins ...Even though I love Mads Mikkelsen in all his movies...But after couple of episodes I really started to appreciate what he brought to the table,pun intended)
Great actor's performances,good stories,overall great show for people dark minded ,like me)Enjoy!"
175,Extremely well written n the dialogue is superb. The acting is outstanding n beautifully executed. A true masterpiece and faithful to the book n author. Its gratifying to watch n so tense n suspenseful n at times very dark n atmospheric. A definite must see for crime n horror fans alike.
176,A Blend Of Psycopath Cannibal- Hannibal With Some Exquisite Dishes...
177,The most amazing character in the TV . Everything in this show will never happen .
178,Hannibal is a truly remarkable series. The acting is as good as it gets in television or film and the story is very engrossing. I'm not someone that typically appreciates art the way many do but it is shot in the most beautiful and haunting way. It is too bad that the show didn't get the seasons it deserved but the three they gave us are gold.
179,Such a great series. I cant stop whatching. Every episode is extreamly well written. I really recommend it. A perfect series to watch if you have seen Dexter.
180,His acting was seriously pure gold. I don't know why he is greatly underrated.
181,I did not expect an ode to the 90's movie in the form of a serie to be as great as this. From directing and especially the acting and story I loved it. Mads Mikkelsen stands out of course. No one else in my opinion could have pulled this off. Start watching and get dragged into the world of the most famous psychiatric serial killer in history.
182,This TV series represent Hannibal lectre more thrilling but still the Hannibal lectre in the movie the silence of lamp is best.but I like the mads mikkelsen he look so fit in this character. both the protagonist and Hannibal lectre have a very good chemistry and both are blessed with the ability of reading people mind. In between the every season story was little dragging or tedium but the beginning and last few episodes goes beyond the expectation and i didn't find this series very predictable as the story is very much similar to the movies but with few twist they turn it into very enthralling. If you guys want to see more of the Hannibal lectre then give it a shot because the side this series very much focused on the strive between the protagonist and Hannibal lectre.
183,"Okay, so this show is supposed to be intelligent -and to a degree it is. Compared to a show like NCIS, it's genius; unfortunately, NCIS doesn't exactly set a high bar. For example, Hugh Dancy's character is a guy who can empathize with serial killers. In terms of plot, this means that he uses this empathy to rapidly solve cases, pretty much single-handedly, by being able to understand what the killers were/are thinking. An innate ability to understand the killers motivations, a few clues tied together, and a possible leap of logic later, and voilà, they're knocking on the killer's door. Besides that, there's lots of other little stuff that bugs me. If I only I didn't demand intelligent programing to actually be intelligent, I might like this show. Regardless, this show has fallen short of my expectations. Oh, I do like Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal though. I hope to see more of him in the future."
184,"I am a fan of these kind of show since the first CSI aired. I have seen Las Vegas and all of its spin-offs, Criminal Minds, Bones, Castle, Dexter, Grimm, some L&O, lately The Following and also some British like Morse, Prime Suspect, Poirot ... Hannibal is the best so far and I am not exaggerating. I am not belittling the other shows, they are absolutely amazing. Some were absolute pioneers and each one has their own ""hook"". For one is the main couple, for another is gruesome murders, another is twisted killers, evidence analysis, witness questioning...Hannibal gathers all the experience from all these shows and gives us a perfectly creepy product. The colors of the sets are vivid, camera movement is very well handled, lighting, etc. everything contributes to creating a beautiful atmosphere and yet it gives you chills. In the forest scene in the fungi episode you could almost smell the freshness of the forest but then you see what is beneath and the shock I felt was like nothing I saw in other shows. Mads is perfect giving life to a classy, smart, ruthless and extremely twisted killer. The food is exquisite, which creeps you out even more. Dancy's character is so haunted by all this that I think I would be just like him in his place! This show is so creepy and amazing that some people just can't stand it, like my mom. It has it all, great actors, great crew, good plot, gruesome murders completely shocking, twisted minds that will puzzle and amaze you, evidence and forensic analysis, cop scenes, witnesses, psychology...and food!! Congratulations to all the team."
185,"This could be very very good, but it's horribly directed, and the dialogue takes itself way too seriously for what is essentially freshman level psychobabble and some 70's psychoanalytical terms thrown about recklessly. Laurence Fishburne appears to have been heavily sedated on the set, and refuses to emote in the slightest (even when told his wife has cancer). Hannibal, as others mention, exudes a dripping creepiness that any normal person would find off-putting (if someone talked to you that way, you'd find it abrasive and weird, surely), yet all the characters apparently find it ""fine."" But what I find perhaps most halting is that the FBI praises the work of someone (Will Graham) who has the gift of being essentially a psychic who shows up after the fact; so like a reverse psychic or a sort of medium. Forget ballistics and forensic evidence, Graham will stand there, zen out, and take a wild @ss guess, going with what could only be massive speculations that are later revealed to be surprisingly, magically quite accurate. And this gets pitched to us with the psychobabble surrounding it, asking us to believe this is some sort of intellectual show. Enjoy it for gore and a bit of light drama, sure, but this could have been much, much more."
186,"*SOME SPOILERS*I am a huge fan of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (both the films and novels) and was bitterly disappointed by this series. The serial killers they track in the movies are cunning and elusive; Will Graham catches just three of them (including Hannibal) and he's considered a legend for it, but in the TV show he nabs them once a week. NBC has turned the plot into a dull and predictable procedural. You don't even get to see the real workings of a profilers; there's no grit, no digging, they just instantly identify foreign substances with magic machinery. The only redeeming features are the two main characters, Hannibal and Will, whom I actually enjoyed. Certain changes actually angered me: Crawford just seems carefree and incompetent and they keep jamming lines and scenes from the series into places where they don't belong. It's a better then average procedural but its nothing compared to what it could have been."
187,Best Horror and Thriller TV show ever made. It needs to be brought back asap. Hands down the most amazing show in the last 20 years.
188,DON'T LEAVE US HANGING! WE WANT SEASON 4 AND MORE!
189,"for the past couple of days I have been watching Hannibal and I am already onto season 3. I don't usually binge watch shows as I never have enjoyed watching shows from start to finish in only one sitting however I just had to with Hannibal since it is that good. it only took me about 4 or 5 days to get to season 3 and i have know decided to take a break from my binge and talk about the show. Hannibal is a show that is based of the popular books about Hannibal Lecter who is a serial killer who also likes to eat his victims. the character of Hannibal was first made popular by Anthony Hopkins in the classic silence of the lambs. in the show however the character of Hannibal is played by Mads Mikkelson and I have got to be honest i do prefer Mads performance. I know thats a bold statement and I'm not trying to put Anthony Hopkins fantastic performance down, its just watching Mads playing this character in the show is terrifying as you 100% believe that this is a real person. his performance in this show is so subtle and yet so brilliant, there are so many scenes that show Hannibal as this polite, sophisticated gentleman and yet when he does start getting into fist fights with various people and showing of all his different fighting skills you believe that this man could lash out like this and kick some serious ass.besides Hannibal there is also will graham who is essentially the main character of the show especially in the first season and he is played by Hugh dancy who is fantastic as well. Will is one of the most complex and interesting characters of the show as he is a man who has the ability to empathise with serial killers and get into the mind of them and see how they think which he uses to help the FBI catch different killers. Throughout the show you see how this ability haunts Will and it slowly starts to eat him up inside and Hugh dancy plays that brilliantly.with all that said about the fantastic performances in this show I think that the main attraction of this show is the cinematography because wow does this show have some fantastic shots. at times watching Hannibal is almost like watching art, there are so many breathtaking shots throughout the show that i am going to remember years from now. most of these amazing shots come from the inside of wills mind as he is haunted by his ability to empaphize with killers as well as being haunted by events that take place in the pilot episode which i will not spoil saying the show is well shot really is an understatement. the writing of the show is also great to and i found my self being surprised around every corner.there isn't really anything i can fault with this show but i suppose if really wanted to nick pick one thing i would have to comment on is the crime scenes and just how messed up they are. some of the ways that these body's are left to be found had me questioning how in the hell someone could come with this stuff, but with that said i suppose thats not really a negative as it does work for this nightmare like show, its just something that you have to bear in mind when watching this show, you are going to see some messed up stuff ( also do not eat whilst watching this show, just don't).in the end Hannibal is one of the best shows to ever grace the television, the acting is great, writing is great, cinematography in phenomenal and the sound editing is also fantastic. I cannot recommend this show enough especially if you are a horror/thriller fan. the fact this show has been cancelled since not enough people are watching it is such a shame and I really hope netlfix or Amazon save this brilliant show."
190,"This show is not going to be for everyone, if you liked the Hannibal movies (Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising) this series is going to have familiar character names, but that's about it. This isn't a bad thing in my opinion, I like the fresh look and feel of this show, how they made some tweaks to characters and story arcs from the movies, it gives the writers more flexibility to engage the viewer. If you're a fan of the shows Dexter or The Killing you will like this show. Hannibal has some... thought provoking, bordering on extremely violent images that make you wonder about these writers sometimes but overall it helps the viewer understand the demons of the iconic character Hannibal Lecter. The psychological chess game that gets played throughout the first two seasons can be tedious for some but I enjoyed it, adds depth to the story.Bottom line... There isn't another series quite like this one out there, very good plot twists. I hope it lasts."
191,"I feel like describing Hannibal as a crime investigation show is very limiting because it is so much more. If I had limit the amount of facets this show has, I'd say that it follows the psyche of an FBI profiler, Will Graham, who is way too adept at emphasizing with killers. I read on another review that there isn't much time spent on the murder cases, but I believe that's because the show's focus is mainly on the psychological damage of profiling these twisted murderers and also the chest game between Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter, unbeknownst to Will. The way Will's psyche is presented in the show is visually stunning and holds a plethora of symbolic interpretations. The entire season has an arc and every episode is crucial to the plot. There are also beautiful motifs and easter eggs laid out from episode one. It is easy to see that Bryan Fuller is telling the truth when he says he had the entire season planned out before filming. On the negative, the gore is so graphic I'm surprised that it's even allowed on television. It's one of the prime reasons why I don't recommend this show openly to casual friends, it's really easy to write off on the first few episodes because it just gets more and more twisted. On a better note, if you appreciate deep writing, acting, and cinematography this is as good as it gets folks."
192,"It's taken me seven episodes to gage enough of a opinion to justify a review but here it is... It's FANTASTIC! We deal with adult Lecter who has yet to be caught for his horrific cannibalistic crimes and fbi drop out Will Graham who's been drafted in as a special adviser for the worst psychopathic serial killings the state's has to offer. Hannibal is a private psychologist in this series and is used, with will to help fbi investigator Jack Crawford solve these crimes, all the time oblivious to fact that Hannibal is one of the people he seeks, the infamous chesapeake ripper. The casting here is brilliant and mads mikkelsen is the most creepy Dr. Lecter to date, Hugh dancy plays a very different will graham than you'd find in red dragon or manhunter, he's more of a recluse, hates public situations and suffers from autism which he uses as a gift to get deep into the thinking of the killers they try to catch throughout the show. Lawrence Fishburne is also solid as jack and adds his usual gravitas to the role. Nbc took a risk with Hannibal and so far it's paying off, script writer Bryan Fuller is doing a great job at building the relationship between will and lecter and although direction duties are shared between three, they all seem to be reading from the same directional book as every episode has the same darkly candid undertones. The problem? The answer is narrative and story arc, it's simply following the same routine as most stateside crime drama's i.e crime is committed, evidence is gathered and a team is sent out to track down the bad guy, the only difference here is that one of team happens to like human liver and bacon for breakfast. How long can this show go on before Dr. Lecter is found out and how many ""one killer per episode"" stories can we stomach? With Bryan fuller already saying that five seasons have been thought out story wise... It could be a fair few."
193,"Hannibal, in my opinion deserve much higher ratings! One the greatest Crime genre TV Series out there. I was hooked right from the very first 10 minutes of show. The acting, the sets, the script, the direction and the overall team did an outstanding job. Some scenes in the show, season 02 Final, dozens of other murder scenes and after crime scenes where they would analyze the body are what made this show so good. They felt and looked so real than most of the reality TV shows and Movies. Mads Mikkelsen, who played Dr. Hannibal Lecter, knew the likes of Sir Anthony Hopkins will be watching as he portrays what HE portrayed! Mads was the best character of the show, always composed, always knew what he was doing, his dressing, the way he cooks were top notch. It had one the best screen-plays I've seen on TV. Excellent camera works, actions scenes and almost every show has boring scenes, the characters that no one want to see, Hannibal had none. It is highly recommended!"
194,"When I first heard about the ""Hannibal"" television show, I was ecstatic. I was especially excited to see Mads Mikkelsen as everyone's favorite cannibal psychiatrist, and boy, does he nail it. He makes the show. Sure, the rest of the primary cast is good, Laurence Fishburne is stoic, educated, and patriarchal as usual, and Hugh Dancy isn't half bad as the tortured Will Graham, but for me, it's really Mikkelsen who brings home the gold. Every bit as chilling and calculating as Anthony Hopkins, Mikkelsen also brings something new to the role of Hannibal; his accent. Mikkelsen has a very distinct Danish accent, which to some viewers may be a turn off, but I find that it adds a more exotic element to him. Not only does it make him seem more foreign and threatening, but it requires closer attention to understand what he's saying, giving his words an impact proportionate to the focus needed to understand them. In addition, ""Hannibal"" is the only TV show to ever make me cringe about anything, and at times it can even be a little scary. All of these elements, plus excellent writing and rich character arcs--well, for Graham and Lecter, anyway--make ""Hannibal"" good enough to eat. (Sorry, I couldn't resist the cheesy pun.)"
195,"I actually got a little bit disappointed, i had hopes for this show since im a big fan of the movies...But im so sick and tired of shows like this, they start the episode out with a horrible crime...and you understand that you are dealing with a monster serial killer, one of the worst of his kind..Then in comes the main characters...and they solve the whole thing in 20 min or so, and you sit there thinking...AGAIN??? then...in the next episode...the same thing gonna happen again....AGAIN!!! This is the feeling i got from watching the pilot.I just don't understand why they don't focus on 1 serial killer, Lecter and then Graham character...that wouldve been MORE than enough...This pilot turned me off...im gonna give it a few more episodes to prove me wrong...but so for...its a no go for me, i got better things to watch..I actually loved the pilot until the Hannibal character got introduced...Don't get me wrong i think Mads Mikkelsen is a good actor...but to me, he didn't fit as Lecter at all...his dannish accent slipped through, and he seemed...to mumble out the words...i had trouble understanding him here and there...and that was very annoying. Its hard to be compared to the great Hopkins, but when you play a role already so greatly captured...You have something to live up to...and so far...Mikkelsen isn't quite there.If you are a fan of shows like...Criminal Minds (Im not a fan of that show at all...) then you prob gonna love this show as well...But...this is just the first episode...and ill give it another episode as i said above...but so far...this just doesn't cut it in my book."
196,"This is the slickest, most disturbing, most graphic TV horror series I've ever seen. It's so much better that The Walking Dead (which I loved first 2 series)or to be honest any of my old favourites; the Wire, Breaking Bad etc this is just amazing. The makeup/SFX are flawless. No CGI, no half an hour of men running around with guns. Brilliant script and Mads is sublime as Hannibal. The mushrooms and wings episodes actually made me feel nauseous which has never happened in my 25 years of loving horror movies. At the moments I feel like this is the best TV series I have ever seen but I know its only on episode 5 or 6 so I'll try not to get too carried away. This rocks."
197,"I could kick myself rotten for enduring this total garbage, I sat through season 1 and thought, OK, this is a bit stupid but lets see how it develops, now at that point I had made my mistake, have you ever picked up a rock and thrown it over the edge of a cliff? It's drops like a bomb and crashes and lo and behold that's what happens here, it's just stupidly unrealistic, muddled, confusing physco bable trash, I just wanted it to end, please go away Hannibal, it was sleep inducing nonsense, really I'm baffled at who could have enjoyed watching this, it really is that bad, I'm in disbelief at the garbage we get to watch these days, and Hannibal sums it up especially series 3, I can't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was, shocking."
198,"Will Graham is an FBI instructor who suffers from some light mental disability. He's antisocial, introverted, he sleep walks, has nightmares, but he's highly functional and has a peculiar skill that he can empathize with killers to such an extent that he can basically relive and re-enact the killing when he sees a crime scene and puts himself in some trance-like state. And Jack Crawford from the FBI sure sees use in him as some killers commit violent murders and tend to leave elaborate orchestrated scenes for law enforcement to find.The FBI also consults with psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose motives are anything but pure. Eventually he becomes the friend/therapist of Graham, Crawford, and another lovely FBI psychiatrist named Alana Bloom who has a soft spot for Graham and tries to protect him. All the psychiatrists here act more like psychologists conducting therapy instead of prescribing meds.Every episode involves some killing for the FBI team to deal with. But not every killing/episode has one unique killer. Usually 3 of 4 episodes make up the life of one killer. Occasionally it's a single episode.Those looking for ""The Hannibal Lecter Show"" will be disappointed. The main character here is Graham. And Hugh Dancy can and does carry the show easily. Graham's character is fascinating and so unique in television. Lecter starts out almost as a tertiary character but comes to the fore more and more in later episodes. If you're looking for some deliciously wicked Hopkins-like performance, you won't get that either. Mikkelsen's Lecter is different. Younger of course, stiffer, but no less vicious when necessary. He enjoys classical music and cooking elaborate meals that rival stuff found in the most fancy of restaurants. Hannibal features the best, if not only, use of gastronomy on television. And it's no accident that the producers had to get a Spanish chef to advise because Lecter cooks nothing but entrails for him and his guests- which are usually our FBI friends and unsuspecting potential victims. The dishes sure look pretty but not very appetizing I must say. And by Lecter giving their French names, diners are none the wiser. Where the entrails come from are for us to guess.Hannibal features not one but three forensic pathologists one lamer and uglier than the other. They are there I assume to provide some comic relief and to dispel a bit the tension and seriousness of the rest of the show. They usually speculate who the killer is and why he's killing. But aside from these three, the entire cast is very solid. Caroline Dhavernas stands out for her beauty and class.Hollywood has had a difficult time in successfully bringing horror to television. And I don't include the gore-porn cop procedurals. While very gory they are in no way a match for Hannibal. Hannibal can be gory but it's not as vile as those shows, whose cameras linger for hours on wasted corpses zooming in on the devastation with glee. Hannibal is almost reluctant to show gore. But when it does, it's excellent and original. But gore doesn't make horror. And Hannibal is truly a horror show both story-wise and by creating a scary atmosphere. The credit goes to the sound in this show, which is exceptional. And while things tend to move slowly in Hannibal, things don't get boring. The pace and style goes very much with Lecter's characters- methodical, exact, patient. The cinematography also stands out. It must be harder and harder for shows to create unique looks but Hannibal has a very interesting look. The colors, the furniture, the tapestries, the fashions all look like they came from the 70s and yet the look is combined with modernity and technology.A bit frustrating is knowing what we know about Lecter while the FBI folks wine and dine with Lecter, and spill their guts to him, both personally and professionally, giving him insights on their investigations, investigations which should lead them to Lecter. But that has the effect of making Lecter one menacing friend to have.Hannibal, like it's lead Dr. Graham, is all business, without a whole lot of silliness, without posing and posturing, without gimmicks, without neurotic editing. It doesn't treat the audience condescendingly, it doesn't preach about morality or the latest fashionable social issue, it's just about the story. And that is very refreshing. I sure hope that we'll see more television shows made for an audience with a healthy attention span. Hannibal isn't just the best horror TV show, it's also among the very best shows period."
199,"An amazing new perspective of amazing characters. As a dedicated fan of the films, I can safely say that this is an amazing adaptation. The talented performances of Hugh Dancy as Will Graham and Mads Mikkelsen as the iconic Hannibal Lecter are not only talented for their portrayals, but are perfect for the roles. With Dancy's haunting and precise depiction of Grahams stressful and dark talent as an FBI profiler and Mikkelsen's charismatic and mysterious performance as the cannibalistic psychiatrist, makes them the best choice for the roles. Also amazing performances obviously belong to the commanding Lawrence Fishburne as Jack Crawford, the lovely and charming Caroline Dhavernas as Alana Bloom and the surprising and well played performance of Lara Jean Chorostecki as Fredricka ""Freddie"" Lounds.With well written episodes and talented actors, makes each episode fresh and thrilling."
200,"What's it all about? Mads Mikkelsen is on record describing Hannibal Lecter as Satan. The struggle between God/ Everyman/ Satan has its origins deep in the Old Testament in Western culture. Lecter seems lonely: he wants to seduce Will. He has already succeeded in pulling the wool over Jack Crawford's eyes. The only people who recognise Lecter for what he is are those who share the same instincts. There are moments where one feels that Will could bring Lecter back to the human fold but that is just Lecter flirting with him. Violence: The violence has many commentators anxious and there is a lot of violence (or its end product) to contemplate. It is presented in such a stylised manner that it seems very like the violence in religious and historic art from the Middle Ages to now, for example, works by Caravaggio. As for the cannibalism, well, anyone who takes the bread and wine at Mass is technically undergoing a cannibalistic experience. And legalised cannibalism I think includes accepted activities like warfare and the NRA's policy on gun ownership, to name two. And as for the horns – any Scot would sneer - take a look at Blair Athol Castle and check out their trophies. Quibbles: Mads Mikkelsen is a contained and subtle actor but English,spoken with enthusiasm and fluency, is not his first language so He needs the sound recordist to be on top of his game. Mikkelsen does capture the essentially urbane cadences and rhythms of Lecter perfectly. Praises: Hannibal's suits are beautifully cut and the colours (which look too bright in stills – totally inappropriate for stalking prey) do work on screen given the colour desaturation. The music is also particularly pleasing – unobtrusive but instrumentally curious in an unsettling way. Where is this going? We all know where this is going, we've read the books, so it's the journey not the destination that counts, right? We are entitled to speculate that if Lecter is the Devil, Will Graham is Everyman and Jack Crawford is God. Consequently this show might move far beyond ""atrocity of the week"" into an on-going dialogue between God, Man and the Devil. We haven't had that before. The series is turning into a cult hit.Perhaps eventually unshackling the series from the books if the fans allow it may enable HANNIBAL to go to interesting new regions? If Mikkelsen is playing Lecter as the Devil he has enormous emotional scope to play with. Lucifer was after all an angel before he fell, so equipped to seduce, charm and confuse mere mortals. His past angelic background may explain his remarkable sensory and physical attributes (the ability to kill and remove evidence undetected is surely not natural).How does this series compare with the great mad epics like THE SOPRANOS, BREAKING BAD or DEADWOOD? Well, pretty well. My instincts say - add more humour, more idiosyncrasies in Lecter and his oddball opponents. It's there visually, it just has to find that note of inner insanity that lets the plots and dialogue free to soar."
201,"Every performance on this show is brilliant, especially Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of Hannibal. This show deserves to continue on into the path of Silence of the Lambs as Season 4, but it seems nobody wants to pick it up. Have they actually watched the show? That is what I wonder..."
202,"These series are underrated it deserves at least 9+/10, every single episode is entertaining, the characters are fantastic specially Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham. The dialog is written perfectly, it seems really smart and it is. If you love these kind of series i definitely recommend it it is worth your time. Overall mind blowing."
203,"It's one of the best things I've ever watched in my entire life I can't even find the words to describe it. Honestly the role of Hannibal was written for Mads I can't imagine any actor would've played it better than him this man is a LEGEND. This series will touch your soul, your heart & definitely will get deep in your mind I mean really deep. Can't say much because you will know what I mean when you watch it. You we love the story, the characters, the actors, the thrill, the director & mostly you will love this serial killer after this (LOL). At the end chapeau bas MADS MIKKELSEN."
204,"Since 2013 I have watched many programmes and films. Some were good, some were awful and some were quite enjoyable. However since discovering this masterpiece by Bryan Fuller I have been at a loss for words and as an avid film/TV junkie that's a big statement to admit. I believe the lack of character development and depth in the previous films about Hannibal Lecter stopped me from even considering this TV adaptation.Nevertheless, I was wrong for making such assumptions before seeing it and this adaption blew me away.I decided I needed something new and fresh to watch as lets face it, all the popular TV programmes that have enabled the renowned 'Netflix and chill' culture to instil in us all have all come to an end and we are all anticipating their joyous return.And I have two words to remedy this entertainment drought.... Mads Mikkelsen...He is undeniably the best portrayal of Hannibal Lecter bar none. I know, I know I should be routing for Anthony Hopkins as he is an incredibly talented actor and also a national like myself but Mikkelsen sent a shiver down my spine. No actor or portrayal in a film has ever made me excited and terrified at the same time.Mikkelsen's enthralling ability to present Lecter as a calm, controlled and collected psychopath made want to watch more. Okay watching all 39 episodes in a row was not healthy but it made me want to watch more of this ambiguous, ruthless fascinating creature.Mikkelsen sealed the deal on the whole programme for me...The confidence in how he walks, the sensuality that resonates in his voice, his talent in the kitchen; The culinary seduction he possessed made me want to lick the TV screen like it was an M&S supermarket advert.....until you find out he's killing people and serving them Au Ju.Mikkleson's performance sends a ripple of terrifying suspense through all 3 seasons and is only one part of a truly incredibly written script. A script consisting of in depth characters, settings and visual effects. This is a must see for any avid horror fan, even if you do tend to go queasy at the sight of blood, like myself. This in unmissable. Applause to Bryan Fuller on bringing Thomas Harris' books to life.You can see and feel all the effort and hard work Fuller went into brining this complex adaption to our table. I am disappointed to say the least they cancelled this on the last season, it would of been another delicious slice to enjoy, but for now I will relive the past 3 seasons and feed my fear!Bon appétit"
205,"Hannibal has my warmest recommendations. It is an incredible good show, if you like brilliant storytelling and beautiful pictures. I have been stunned and amazed many times by the shows beautiful yet shocking pictures. I have been surprised of the plot developments, of the risks and chances the writers took, that they never took the way you expected and that they always committed to their choices. The characters are extraordinary well played by among many others Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy, Caroline Dhavernas and Laurence Fishburne. The show very sophisticated and you feel that your intelligence is at times challenges as to what to believe and what you see; it often left you wondering about what is going to happen, or what has happened. But it always answers your questions in the end.This show is for me the best show out there, and therefore it saddens me incredibly when I read that it was cancelled. However the ending even though I would have preferred it to be far in the future and without spoiling anything, of season 3 is perfect. I rank this show above other brilliant shows such as Sherlock, Justified, True Detective, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, so I hope that this to some extent, so how high a TV/visual/story driven experience this could be for you."
206,"FBI agent Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) recruits profiler Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) to return to work on a serial killer case. Will gets counseling from renown psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen). Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) is concerned about the effects of the case on her friend Will's psyche. Bryan Fuller brings the characters created by Thomas Harris onto the TV screen.I love this show from the very beginning. The first season is part police procedural and part disturbing psycho drama. Mads is fearfully intense. Hugh Dancy is compelling damaged goods. It's visually stunning. Dead bodies have never looked so beautiful. That's not to say that everything ran smoothly. The slow moody scenes take some getting used to. I still think the psychotherapy scenes with Hannibal are too static. The dialogue couldn't make up for its slow flat tone. By the second season, the show settles into the beauty of the violence and the darkness of the psychological warfare. The show breaks new ground especially for network TV."
207,"I came into this show completely blank. Wasn't expecting anything. I'm not a fan of the source material or have read any of the books. I just thought 'lets give it a go'. Boy am i glad i gave it a chance. The darkness got hold of me and never let go. I'm truly impressed. Never seen anything quite like this before on TV. It's almost like watching dark poetry enfold before your eyes.Every conversation is deep and meaningful. The dialog is beautifully written. The relationship between Wil Graham and Hannibal is done really well. The psychological aspect is impressive to say the least. The most gruesome scenes are brought to life in an unrivaled artistic way. Never have blood and gore looked this beautiful before. The acting is mostly top notch. Especially by Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen. Speaking of Mads Mikkelsen, the Danish actor playing Hannibal, he is absolutely perfect in his role as Hannibal Lector! I had never heard of the man before but i'm an instant fan now.Overall season 1 & 2 are really good. Sadly season 3 is a bit of a mixed bag."
208,"Hannibal is beautifully filmed with writing that sticks true to Thomas Harris. Every episode is LITERALLY a work of art as each frame of cinematography could be hung in a gallery. Watch this show from the beginning. And if you think you know how the story goes, trust me, you don't. Hannibal is filled with new twists that blend in so well with the originals that it flows together perfectly. If you have never read the books or seen the films or know the story of Dr. Lecter, this show would be a good place to cut your teeth. Not to mention the amazing performances from an exceptional cast. Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy, Laurence Fishburne, and so many others playing roles like I've never seen them do before. A must watch series!"
209,"In its first two seasons, Hannibal is a visually stunning, disturbing thriller with decent actors and an unnerving soundtrack. Ultimately, however, it relies too heavily on thin characterization to keep us guessing. Dr. Lecter is little more than a cultured manipulator who plays gruesome games out of boredom. I suppose we are meant to admire or fear him for his intellect and artistry, but the thrill he seems to glean from outwitting the dimwitted is simply childish, and his cannibalism is an obvious metaphor for the insatiable appetite and savagery that (ironically) enslave him, despite his highbrow pretensions. Criminal profiler Will Graham should see through Dr. Lecter instantly and have the upper hand simply because his imagination frees him from the need to actually kill anyone. Instead, the writers keep Will in a perpetual state of instability, as if his empathy and asocial tendencies automatically compromise his sanity when, realistically, he would be least susceptible to Hannibal's machinations. Corpses form elegant tableaux for Will to interpret, and when, having entered the mind of the killer and reimagined his actions firsthand, he concludes, ""This is my design,"" the butcher has become an architect worthy of Will's consideration, if not ours. All of this seems to distract us from the realization that profiling criminals is not crossing any moral line. Will's efforts to help the FBI catch each culprit are actually selfless, but we see a parade of judgmental, morally compromised characters convince him otherwise. In the end, I am not sure what actually motivates anyone other than a script that casually sacrifices its most sympathetic characters for a plot drowned in infinite death and gloom. Anyone clinging to reality or their own sanity might question why serial killers with artistic inclinations abound or why law enforcement must engage in elaborate, soul- crushing exercises to catch irredeemable monsters. The rest of the audience is too struck by two attractive men in the same room to interpret Hannibal and Will's exchanges as anything but foreplay. For the less imaginative, watching Hannibal is not a pleasant experience. The directors, writers, actors, and producers deserve credit for bringing such a nightmare to network television. They have managed to trump Thomas Harris' novel of the same name, which is possibly the vilest piece of fiction I have ever read. I am not sure whether that achievement is praiseworthy, but I may lack the masochism needed to keep watching."
210,"As you can see by my rating and summary, i like.... no love this show. I believe this show is possibly the greatest television program to be created along side 'Breaking Bad','OZ' and 'Game Of Thrones'. However unlike 'Breaking Bad' it doesn't have bad season finales, the ending to season two of 'Hannibal' was the most unpredictable moments of any show, not to give anything away though.Mads Mikkelsen portrayal of Hannibal does Anthony Hopkins proud and more, his chilling performance is breathtaking and his mind games even greater than in 'Silence of The Lambs', however season two was so great to me because of Mason Verger, the link between the books was tied with him and Micheal Pitt became him so well, and his joker style messed up- ness was a amazing add on, and one particular scene with dogs (no spoiler) was so messed up it was eye-wateringly good.For season three look forward to seeing verger again and seeing more of Gillian Anderson and a emotional development in her character."
211,"Just into season 1 , the show was just so dumbfounded. Why would FBI randomly select this Hannibal doc and start sharing all cases with him? So many serial killer copies done with the same detail, it is so obvious it was the guy who is close to it. If will graham was so smart he can't notice the creepiness with the Hannibal? Why the stupid journalist character? Or the Abigail character drag? No one notices the human meat at Hannibal's lunch/dinner?Too much of dreams and annoying sound effects. For some reason everyone keeps confiding to the creepy psychiatrist. Somehow everyone just agrees with hannibal (like the doc to fake mri result). And will graham just stops with one mri? No other doc / colleague/hospital admission I mean no one notices?
This is poorly written and directed apart with the stupid gory scenes."
212,"Man they try so hard to look smart, pretentious etc. but what happens in this show is just absurd, stupid and damn frustrating. What i really don't get why is everybody, i mean every single person that appears in this trash show , have to tell this Hannibal everything they know. And, guilty or not guilty u don't just go to this guy and share every single tiny thing with him, because everybody knows what Will accused him for, hey maybe he's not guilty but still u would have a little doubt in your mind. They try to be so smart, look at our snob killers, our pretentious cooking, annoying sounds, some little opera here and there. And how many serial killers can Boltimore have in such a short time? And of course the classic, ""I'll go to investigate and tell nobody about it and then die"". This has got to be one of the worst garbage i ever seen, i kept rolling my eyes like every 5 min."
213,"Who knew it... After the disastrous prequel that was the last movie, who knew the best Hannibal story since Silence of the Lambs was gonna be this TV show... I was seriously doubtful about this, as many reviewers seem to be... You've got to overcome your own doubts.First of all they don't mess about : right away you know Lecter is a killer, you know how Will Graham work. And unlike the rubbish (and highly overestimated) ""The Following"", each episode gets a different investigation, it's not a stretched boring arc where it takes 10 episodes to catch one killer (hello Dexter...).The directing and photography are also brilliant. I was skeptical after the first episode and the big show they put when Will enters the crime scene and ""sees"" it, but it was done better in the second episode. Characters have depth, and Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor, I've seen him in Valhalla Rising (forget Casino Royale), and he may be the next Viggo Mortensen.Now I'm a bit worried that they seem to find so easily prolific serial killers in Minnesota, which is more or less a quiet place, but at least they're creative about it (Bryan Fuller seems to be having fun) and they don't overdo it with scenes of torture, violence (again, unlike The Following, whose writers should really take notes...) or last minute calls. The scariest thing in the show is actually that giant elk, you'll know what I mean when you see it. It's graphic without being gore.I don't know how many seasons they're gonna do, or how the Lecter/Graham arc will evolve, but if the quality is the same as the first 2 episodes, we may have the best serial killer show since the first season of Dexter... Good writers, good casting, good directing, it doesn't take much..."
214,"Intro: I had never seen The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal (film) before seeing this show. I did see Red Dragon (2002), however, and it was pretty good.The promo for the show definitely interested me in the show. However, I had no idea what kind of show I was going to get myself into. First Season: The first five episodes follow an almost generic case of the week format, making it entertaining enough, but definitely lacking in making it truly great. However, this all changes by the sixth episode where the series becomes so intense and so riveting that I would give put the season up there right with Dexter's first season. The first season of Dexter almost followed the same format as well and took about the same time to gel, but when it did, it was absolutely mind-blowing.10/10Second Season: Now that we are in the second season, the show continues to be extremely creative and risk-taking in its story and gore. There have been three cases of the week over seven episodes (one lasting two, one lasting one, and one lasting 3 and all in the first 5 episodes). However, the difference here is that the cases serve the story rather than being the main focus. It's just completely insane how good this show is and that nobody watches it. I'd never felt so giddy about a show since the last eight episodes of Breaking Bad. And before that maybe Season 4 of Dexter. The remaining episodes of the season were not as smooth as the what preceded it. However, they were still pretty interesting.1st half of Season 2: 10/10 2nd half of Season 2: 8/10Why Nobody Watches It: 1) It's the goriest show ever made (yes, more so than Dexter) 2) It's really dark 3) It's a story-driven show which isn't very suiting for a network TV show.Mikkelsen vs. Hopkins: There's no debate here actually. Even though Hopkins won an Oscar for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter, Mikkelsen redefines the character in such a way that he is far more interesting than Hopkins ever was. A lot of that has to do with the writing team too behind the show as they are improving upon the source material and making their own stories with these characters."
215,"Id give this a 6.5 or so. I wanted to like Hannibal, but for the most part, I think it is over rated. I like forensics, I love Mads Mikkelson, and I have enjoyed Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. First, i hate the convoluted serial killer plot lines where each drama has to be more complicated and outlandish than then next. While a carefully constructed pathology makes for interesting drama, these seem poorly built and convoluted to me. Silence of the Lambs had a story to the offender that made sense of his pathology. The scenarios in Hannibal seem to not be carefully built and internally consistent. Each one is more bizarre without explanation. Secondly, unbelievability. Fishburn does not make a believable Jack Crawford. The FBI would not let someone so unstable to the kind of work that this profiler was doing. Then, after being accused of the things he was, it is impossible to believe that the forensics experts who worked on his case would just go visit him for information on other cases, while his own case is pending. Expert witnesses against an accused cannot remain friends with them or continue treating them therapeutically. I believe in suspending disbelief for fiction, but I thought these were silly. Gillian Anderson. God, I think she is beautiful. But her performance seems no different from most of her other performances. Its her being herself. I DO think the magic in this is Mads. He's totally believable and interesting. I'm not sure that I like the idea that its only curiosity compelling him in his actions. IF they invested in better writing, they would explore that instead of what they are doing. I just feel like these dramas are being cranked out to entertain the bored. People should not be giving this 8s and 9s."
216,"Series 1 & 2 were brilliant! And now... Season 3... What a disappointment. People who almost certainly died at the end of season 2, miraculously survive. And the fact that they just taken the movie and made a series out of it, is just a bloody shame. Series 1 & 2 had an original script with very interesting story lines. We know where series 3 is going. Watch the movie; Hannibal will be delivered to the cripple, maimed guy with the hungry pigs. I think that if the script guys don't find an original story for series 4, this show will end with this season. Such a shame of the acting talent of Mads Mikkelsen. He's a good actor and deserves a good original story. Fire the script writers or whoever decided that they should make a series after the movie."
217,"This is a review of NBC policy which is preventing my appreciation of this and other shows.I missed several episodes last season and was hoping that, as on many cable networks, NBC would re-show the first season before this season started. This series needs to be seen in sequential order. So I won't try to see any more episodes unless you provide multiple chances to catch up on past episodes. In fact, I may stop trying any NBC series since you don't provide chances to catch missed episodes. I try to record all episodes, but sometimes the power goes out or the cable goes out or I mess up the channel the TV is on. How about helping us follow your show?"
218,"Very intense, not a moment of dullness, smartly done with great cast, just wish Mads Mikkelsen would speak a bit clearer, had some trouble understanding what he was mumbling. now to finish the ten lines let me recap again and again and again Very intense, not a moment of dullness, smartly done with great cast, just wish Mads Mikkelsen would speak a bit clearer, had some trouble understanding what he was mumbling. now to finish the ten lines let me recap again and again and againVery intense, not a moment of dullness, smartly done with great cast, just wish Mads Mikkelsen would speak a bit clearer, had some trouble understanding what he was mumbling. now to finish the ten lines let me recap again and again and againVery intense, not a moment of dullness, smartly done with great cast, just wish Mads Mikkelsen would speak a bit clearer, had some trouble understanding what he was mumbling. now to finish the ten lines let me recap again and again and again"
219,"Stow the skepticism, this show is brilliant. The best in the series since the iconic Silence of the Lambs, this a prequel based on Thomas Harris first novel of the series Red Dragon, a re-telling of the Red Dragon movie which glossed over Graham catching Lecter leading to the events of Silence of the Lambs.The problem with doing prequels and sequels to this iconic movie has always been, who can play Lecter other than Hopkins, who can forget his brilliantly improved hiss after describing a meal of brains? Mads Mikkelsen instead of impersonating Hopkins like other Lecters, totally owns the role. He is both charming, eccentric, posh and endearing, whilst secretly being insane, conniving manipulative and twisted.I can't think of a better horror TV show past or present, this show gives off a vibe akin to the old X-files in terms of suspense.Let's break it down:Acting: Phenomenal all round, Fishburne and Mikkelsen are master strokes of casting, Hugh Dancy is brilliant also, but I feel these two make for a stunning mentor relationship akin to the Angel and Devil on Dancy's shoulders pushing and prodding him along.Hugh Darcy deserves massive credit, he is damaged by his ability to empathize with serial killers, and obsessed by catching them, unlike everyone else though he seems to sense off moments in Lecter's character unlike anyone else in the show.Cinematography: Above and beyond what we expect from a network television show, setting the bar very, very high. Scenes are masterfully constructed, the dream sequences eerie and the gore is sickening. True horror at its best.Sound: A good soundtrack, but special mention of the atmospherics, subtle uses of sound to build tension all point to a class A horror film.Writing: The dialogue is great, and in character, for many scenes are just interplay between characters the strength in the writing really shines through. I for one will remain glued to the screen as we watch the go-between Graham and Lecter, wondering when he will finally catch on.To sum up, this is the best horror/thriller TV show, perhaps ever, deeper than the gore porn most series have regurgitated up, and if it continues on such a strong vein, will unseat Dexter (which let us be honest, is losing it) as the best thriller/horror on TV.Far from a procedural cop show, as one might first assume this is a masterclass in television production. Get hooked."
220,"After watching the Season 2 Finale, I have no doubt in saying that this is the best TV show ever.I understand that it it hard for everyone to understand/appreciate this.If you like Silence of the lambs, Hannibal etc. then you will love Hannibal TV series.It has got many complex characters like Hannibal, Will, Abigail etc. Wonderful actors. Mads Mikkelson especially. Such a twisted plot. Disturbingly beautiful. Outstanding work by Bryan fuller.Don't just watch it like just any other TV show. Understand the characters well. or else you won't understand a thing."
221,"whoami: I am in my 40's, love almost all genres of movies but especially drama, scifi, fantasy, action, horror, chick flicks, and cartoons. Silence of the lambs was brilliant. Every Hannibal movie afterwards was disappointing. Like so many others, I went into season 1 with apprehension. But this is series that will be legendary one day, much like the T.V. show Profit is. This is way ahead of its time. Great acting, great story that makes your think and horrifies you. There are other similarly violent shows i enjoy today like walking dead, Game of thrones, and most medical shows, but this is different. It makes me think so much, testing my anticipation abilities, and build suspense (a lost art). If each show was a 1hr movie, they would still be great. If you like a show where the characters don't necessarily have to die (G.O.T.) but change in front of your eyes, this is the show for you. If you like a little fear, a little suspense, and serious gore, this is the show for you. Enjoy while it lasts, there aren't enough of us watching to keep it around for much longer."
222,"SPOILER ALERT. I have watched many a horror show or movie and I have to say this is one of the most tense and scary and dark shows I have ever seen. Today we are lucky to watch great television like Dexter, Breaking Bad, True Detectives and Games Of Thrones. What does all these shows have in common. Yes they are all cable shows where you don't have commercial breaks and no restrictions. Well Hannibal should be ranked with these great shows. The acting is incredible and the writing is superb. The stories were great in season 1 but season 2 is like eating a good lobster dinner. The cinematography blows your mind and the background music and sounds makes your body ready to jump out of your seat. Yes this show should be on cable and this would even be rated higher by critics. The last episode was just so bizarre it can't be seen. This was the episode with the female inside the horse which in itself just by thinking about it is as scary as you could get. If NBC cancels this show it will be a mistake and if so please HBO or Showtime come and get this."
223,"As season 1 ended...I can't help to plea for more.This is absolutely an excellent view of Hannibal. Loved the first season...and I think I'll love even more what's coming. I only can say that every episode made me want to see the next one...and the next...and the next. It was so captivating.The actors play very well their roles...specially Mads Mikkelsen. Never saw his acting before but he really gives us a ""Lecter"" very sane, very down-to-earthly...very stable...cold...without showing any hint of sociopathy whatsoever. I would risk to say that if Hopkins' Lecter wasn't so perfectly done...Mikkelsen's would be way better. I prefer to describe the two as: Lecter after insanity vs Lector before insanity, respectively.**Time for a spoiler** The most awkward thing that I found in the series and my favourite part was undoubtedly the banquets held by Lecter.I was thinking on reviewing the series all over again just to capture those recipes and try to make them for real. Though it's hinted that they were done with human parts...they are astonishingly mouthwatering...and they can be done with common ingredients (we wouldn't need to gut and slice a person to do them).And with this comes the intent of my review as I make a suggestion to marketing and promotions crew of the series (Grant Okita, as credited):PLEASE...coming with the 2nd season...release a book of recipes done in the 1st season (and then the others that come after that).Would be very nice to replicate these recipes in real life, in our kitchens, and Hannibal cooking fans would love to have it, for sure. It should have pictures on set, at Lecter's table and with his dish presentation skills,...maybe main actors reviews of the taste...I surely think that this would really sell and advertise the series better than other means."
224,"Hannibal was truly the biggest TV surprise of the last TV season. I didn't even start it until a few weeks ago, simply because of all of the praise I'd heard people give it. The praise was warranted and more. This feels totally out of place in a network like NBC and I truly hope it's able to go on for many seasons. It's a completely atmospheric show with perhaps TV's most disturbing and memorable imagery right now, and the writing of the characters and relationships is something this network hasn't seen in quite a long time. The two leads are both fantastic and I cannot wait to see what happens with this story. Now, waiting one year is going to be quite the task indeed."
225,A cultured man with SMI. Those are a dime a dozen. Visit any court in session to verify. All people who give good reviews should stand in front of a mirror and read the review out loud. Verbally constipated doesn't begin to describe your feeble attempts at writing.Some are more prone to diarrhea of the mouth. Check out Bates Motel. It's a much better show than this.THere are ten lines required so here they are. There are ten lines requires so here they are. Did you know that Amazon own IMDb? Do you think the rating system is fair or stacked? Has anyone seen my innocence? Like the morning dew.
226,"Season 1 and 2 are worth the watch, but stop there. If you've watched Red Dragon, Manhunter, or Silence of the Lambs you know how things turn out.
What do you get if you only have enough dialogue for one episode but are committed to a whole season? You use lots of shots with actors staring into the distance, as many slowmo scenes as possible, have the actors talk as slow as possible, show ""cool"" shots of every mundane object from different angles, and what the hell, since we're torturing the viewer already, lets throw in music with people beating on trash cans. Or put it in another way, you get the train wreck that is season 3."
227,"This show is the only I dare to call.. Perfect! The music scores, acting, writing. Everything down to the last little prop is absolutely perfect! It's rare you get a mash up of editing & directin, & writing that just seem to go perfectly together that's not forced! Even at times when you think there is plot holes, later episodes tie them up nicely & is on purpose! This is one of those shows im actually glad that got cancelled because it forced Bryan Fuller to create the last season with an absolute bang! If you haven't seen this show & appreciate art work on it's highest level... This is definitely not going to disappoint! I do have to mention, if you are not somewhat intelligent, you'll be lost & miss all the poetry & symbolism! Each show & scene pave the way for the 3 season continuation that is perfect! Anyone who says the books are better are just simply unintelligent!"
228,Absolute stunning visually and brilliant writing. Love this show! A step way above the rest.
229,"first off, The dialog. It is so intense, cunning, creative, profound, Words are not enough. It grabs you by the brain and doesn't let go. And not a show ever, has done that to me. The acting is so amazing in this show, you actually believe Mads Mikkelsen is Hannibal, the deranged, manipulative, super intelligent, homicidal cannibal. Hugh Dancy on his part plays the role of Will Graham, and does this with ever so much cunning as Mads Mikkelsen. In fact the whole cast is excellent.after all these appraisal, I do have some remarks on the show, of course. It seems as that because the first season wasn't meant for Will to haunt Hannibal just yet, they created a lot of serial killers. Serial killers however don't arise like mushrooms out of the ground every time another serial killer has been put behind bars. Not in the same area at least. And they could have let some of the killers not be locked up the same episode they were created in.overall this show is a must watch for psychological, horror, thriller fans.I rate this show a 9.3 and will vote it a 10 for flabbergasting me all the way.Bravo Mr. Bryan Fuller. I am eagerly awaiting the next season."
230,"After watching the entire two seasons, and wondering how, by the second to last episode, they would tie it all together. The last episode was a perfectly tied windsor knot of insanity. Hannibal is both stylish and ugly, disturbing and enchanting. Mads Mikkelsen was perfectly cast for this role. He epitomised middle-European aristocracy from an indefinable place, bearing an indefinable psyche. He has class, style, talent, beauty and strength. His handwriting is impeccable, as is every element of his perfectly constructed self. And there-in lies what makes 'Hannibal' so fascinating. The message here is no matter how perfect the facade, underneath, there's a need for disorder. You can tidy it up with carefully prepared culinary delights, feed them to your guests, even some of the guests to themselves, knowing what they're eating, and do it with good grace and subtle humour. The blackest of humours. This is a must watch series for those that love their meat undercooked but perfectly presented and all that goes into serving up any mammal, tartare. Oh, and matched with the correct wine, of course."
231,"I tried twice to get through episode 1, and both times, I turned it off. I was so excited about this show because I love the Hannibal movies, with the exception of Manhunter and Hannibal Rising. Mads was a terrible choice for Lecter. Anthony Hopkins portrayed him as charming and polite, whereas Mads was rude and not charming in the least. I tried watching a couple clips from the show, but that just made it worse. The clips that I watched showed that the show sped things up much too quickly in order to throw everything from the movies in before the show's end. I saw the end scene of the final episode. They basically took Lecter's and Graham's ""relationship"" from Red Dragon where they were using a sort of quid pro quo system and turned it into them being in love basically. That is sick and stupid. Thank God, the show got cancelled and the writers were unable to get to a season where they brought in Clarice or a Clarice replacement. Take my advice and stick with the movies, a better use for your time."
232,"The Hannibal Lecter stories have played on the big screen as movies but now those who elect what the public will love have created a television series based on this human gourmand. In some ways it works and in some ways is doesn't.The series explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) and his patient Special Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), a young FBI criminal profiler who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers. Another physician has been added in Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) and the FBI lead is Agent Jack Crawford (Lawrence Fishburne). Without much introduction as to why Will Graham sees himself (in visions) murdering the victims we see in this first episode (and there are several grisly ones) we are supposed to understand that Will's special gift is that he is an 'empath' – a person so sensitive to the minds of others that he can understand their motivations and thus be a valuable assist in solving crimes. But so far Will (even as played by the gifted Hugh Dancy) is just another seemingly disturbed bipolar-like personality. Hopefully his character will be better developed as the season progresses. As for Mads Mikkelsen he makes a rather dull Hannibal Lecter as he munches on his gourmet servings of his victims: he will not erase the memory of Anthony Hopkins in the role, but the role may take on a whole new direction in this re-do. The series needs fleshing out (pardon the pun) if it is going to maintain anyone's interest for a full set of programs. It is wise to note that the author who created this concept – Thomas Harris – is writing the series with the help of Bryan Fuller. Wait and see.Grady Harp, April 13"
233,"What can I say about this show other than exceptional. What a groundbreaking piece of television. It is a pity it isn't getting the recognition it deserves. The people that watch the show (me included) know that this is an outstanding hour of television that every week shocks, hooks and literally rips your heart out of your chest (ok not literally but it sure feels like that) NBC please renew this show. It should be given a chance to run a full 7 seasons. Bryan Fuller has done a lovely job with this show. I just don't know why it isn't getting the ratings it should have. Renew this show please! It would be a waste if it wasn't. Wouldn't you like to know what happens to Will and Hannibal?"
234,"It should have finished after the first season. Not enough material to go beyond this.
The only reason it continued on further was to wallow in evil and make money."
235,"The two points I award are solely for some good cinematography in episode one of season 3.Besides that, this is a dreadful vomit-inducing parade of senseless and meaningless interactions between inept, incompetent cops and an omnipresent, omnipotent, all-knowing, debonair, modern day murdering cannibal; who also just happens to be a top notch medical surgeon and a psychiatrist.Its a wonder that a Psychiatry Association has not lodged a complaint for sheer smearing of their profession. The series has shrinks as cops, shrinks as shrinks of shrinks and shrinks as villains. What they all have in common,is that they're all mentally deranged.The shock factor of humans being consumed as five star dinner meals, or rendered as meat-art in every possible shape and form loses its appeal after a few episodes. The fall back position of the producers seems to be dark melodrama between the various characters. The problem with this attempt is the unlikely plot, poor story line and poor writing, and it all ends up pushing the viewer to complete indifference.I'm an admirer of American television productions, but sustaining this drivel beyond even one season is a sure way to kill the industry."
236,"There's not much to say, I love this TV SERIES. Something different, fascinating pictures and characters ( Hannibal LEcter first of all). I also love the scenes where he cooks human body parts with ""first class chef"" recipes.( I know it sounds sick)Something new but with high quality. One of my favorite TV Series for sure, I Recommend to everyone to watch it! Season 2 is outstanding so far!!(Watched until ep.8). The only thing that makes a bit hungry is that pretty much ANYONE understand Hannibal is the Murderer!! If you have a ""dirty"" mind like me, fascinated by serial killers and you like thrillers, this is for you . Makes my top3 with Fargo and Brteaking bad. 10 out of 10."
237,"But you can not stop the show at the end of season 2. YOU JUST CAN'T this show started slowly then took off. Season 3 in France ayyyyy, why not. Try something different. great show, just don't mess it up and only leave it a a two season program. Well it would seem that I have to write more then ten lines to be considered for an Amazon approval, well maybe they should make more than two seasons to be considered a TV show, you go and tell them that Amazon big wigs.Seems you hold some clout so go ahead and do what you can to sort this situation out ASAP MORE SEASONS AND MORE HANNIBAL, dam I like this show, it can't end, do something different script writers and go out on a limb. why not all other shows are the same they start then drag on to far to long then end, but two seasons, that's like meeting the man/woman of your dreams asking them their name then, just like that you are at home in bed, with know knowledge of how you got home, but you do remember seeing some alien looking creatures putting you to bed. ;o) all so ;o("
238,"This show is brilliant. Bryan Fuller succeeds in rebooting the Hannibal franchise. He draws content from the novels and movies about the intelligent psychopath Dr. Lecter, but he still continues to make it an original show. Having seen all the Hannibal based movies, I can say that this is a totally new look at Hannibal, and ranks up there with Silence of the Lambs. It is very dark, but stylish.The first thing that makes Hannibal so great is the cinematography. The unique style of shooting used in the show disturbs the viewer; it unsettles you, through the use of unique camera angles and the pale colors it is shot in, with the occasional use of vivid colors contrasted against this background to draw the viewers attention. The music is also used to set you on edge. The technical aspects of Hannibal are beautifully orchestrated to get inside your head and haunt you.The acting in this show is quite spectacular. Hugh Dancy is convincing and quite good as the intelligent but uncertain Will Graham. However, Mads Mikkelsen steals the show. He succeeds wildly in his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. He not only draws will and the FBI into his web, but the viewer too through his spectacular delivery. The only real weakness of the cast may be Laurence Fishburne, who plays the pushy Jack Crawford. He is okay most of the time, but sometimes it feels as though he is over-acting.As for the actual content of the show: the first season started off slow, and I felt myself getting bogged down in the confusion of Will's nightmares and the overarching plot. But oh, the final episode. In the finale of the first season, it all comes together in one of the most brilliant hours of television in a long time. A lot of time is spent developing the characters too, which is definitely a positive. The characters are not just shallow renditions of the characters created in Red Dragon. The murders in Hannibal are quite brutal. Indeed, this show is not for the fainthearted. These terrifyingly surreal crimes truly horrify me as a viewer. Will's nightmares are another excellent addition to the chaos and horror in this show. They are dark and creepy, and are often symbolic of something that is happening or that is about to happen in the show, so these should be paid close attention to.In conclusion, if you are looking for an intelligent thriller/ horror show, Hannibal is for you. It is filmed carefully, with style. It is headed by a great cast, and it is a refreshingly dark show. Definitely worth the watch."
239,"I was very skeptical about watching this show. The fact that it was ANOTHER serial killer show, and a spin off, and the fact that it was on NBC ... I thought there was no way it would be good. But I could not have been more wrong. This is a truly excellent show. It is not in any way cheesy or dumb the way so many similar shows are. I actually don't understand how this show got onto a network like NBC to begin with-This show is DARK. And I don't mean ""dark"" like it's violent... it's much more than that. There are many great qualities to this show but what sets it apart from all other shows is the tone and its aesthetics. The visuals, the sounds, the imagery-are absolutely astounding. I cannot believe more shows have not tried to incorporate the kind of look and feel that Hannibal has. All in all, if you're reading this trying to decide if you should watch it - then fear not. It is absolutely worth watching. I would actually consider this one of my 10 favorite shows of all time. If you want to know the shows that I am into - the other shows I consider my favorites are: The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Lost, Twin Peaks, Fargo, The Wire, Westworld, Game of thrones, The Americans, Deadwood .... hopefully those choices give me some credibility."
240,The show is a retelling of the Harris novels of the same name. The show masterfully makes use of beautiful artistic camera work and story telling. Mads quickly became the only 'Hannibal' for me.
241,"Hannibal (Season 1 and 2).""I've always found the idea of death comforting. The thought that my life could end at any moment frees me to fully appreciate the beauty and art and horror of everything this world has to offer.""The series is about the famous Dr. Hannibal Lecter and his relationship with a genius FBI criminal profiler who has the unique ability to empathize with psychotic criminals.While the show is named ""Hannibal"", I have to say that Hugh Dancy's portrayal of FBI profiler Will Graham was spectacular. And because of that, he was hands down the most interesting character in the series. Other than that, the whole remaining characters was pretty much great. And that was definitely one of Hannibal's biggest strength, all characters being interesting and properly used. The series was extremely well written, explored deep psychotic problems and had lots of psychological themes. It had a DARK tone/atmosphere to it and kinda reminded me of 'True Detective'. The pacing was pretty solid and never stuttered. The scheming and planning and the anticipation of it playing out slowly and surely created ever increasing tension. This ended up delivering one of the best finale (season 2) I have ever seen. The cinematography is pretty good and often great. Some great scenes, whether reality or not. The soundtrack was awesome and often creepy, increasing the already dark atmosphere of the series. One thing that did slightly bug me was somewhat of a procedural nature of the series. Gladly though, it had just some of its essence and was not a complete procedural like CSI etc. Simply put, psychological thriller at its finest. A MUST WATCH!! Had lots of gruesome imagery though so don't watch it if you can't stomach such things.9/10"
242,"I can't believe the hype over this. Far too overrated.After True Detective ended, I was looking for another serial-killer thriller to fill the void. A friend recommended to give ""Hannibal"" a shot, citing it as a thrilling, captivating, atmospheric show.It was nothing like that.There main problem with this show is the writing. It just doesn't seem to follow any scriptwriting rules. There's no suspense, no buildup, no cliffhangers. The show is meant to be a psychological thriller / horror show, but it fails measurably. I guess they couldn't ""empathize"" with the viewers.The cast is weak. The lead looked like someone I wouldn't expect seeing in a Fast and Furious movie, let alone a title such as this. Hugh Dancy's ""tormented genius"" character got old rather quickly. Very stale and monotone.His psychologist friend, played by Caroline Dhavernas, is just another generic ""are they gonna end up together"" character, and is mostly there to drop lines like ""He can't handle it!"", ""He's not ready"".I guess the only redeeming thing about this whole show is the casting of Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He fits the role nicely, and truly was the only reason I watched a third episode.I'd say wait for the 2nd season of True Detective."
243,"This show is very overrated. I have watched almost entire season 1 and it's hard to continue as this show is really boring and annoying. It feels like some kind of C.S.I. crap. Every crime gets solved in a childish C.S.I. manner and the criminals who have committed them look as unbelievable as the crimes they have committed. Will Graham is very weak reflection of the man who was portrayed in Manhunter movie. Will Graham of Hannibal is a neurotic nerd who just closes his eyes and the crime is solved within few minutes of each series. Only good thing about this show is Mads Mikkelsen, but even he does not seem to be able to make right what scriptwriters made so wrong, with the story what could be so good.To wrap it up - if you have seen Silence of the Lambs, this show will seem like a waste of good material. If you think that C.S.I was ""good show"" most probably you will find this crap enjoyable."
244,"Hannibal that stars Hugh Dancy, Mads Mikkelsen and Laurence Fishburne in the lead acting roles - is a intense dark thriller that keeps the viewer nailed to the seat, puzzled and bedazzled by the beautiful and gory scenes. The British actor Hugh Dancy does a wonderful job playing the FBI criminal profiler in this new series, that you could call a mixture of a intellectual thriller and gore. His (Hugh Dancy) darker side makes him stand more out, than the typical lead actor, that is as thick as creme and poses every 2 second front of the camera - usually leads to horrible acting! Laurence Fishburne also plays the FBI case leader in the series and it is good to see him in quality show since the Matrix movies.if Hannibal the series continues in the same dark intense passage it will have plenty of fans amongst the persons who likes a dark intellectual crime story/Kevin Dasman - Freelance reviewer"
245,"OK, it's over for now, the season started with potential but then slowly declined into surrealistic rubbish. To me the only reason to have kept watching was because I started and hoped things might improve. Hannibal became boring, the end was absurd and still boring, I actually watched the timer on how many minutes were left and just wanted it over. Maybe the book had a better storyline and plot but this to me just didn't work after 5 episodes. Dexter it wasn't, ended up not caring about any of the characters although the pigs were cool. Please just give up on this rubbish and give us something great like Breaking Bad or Hell on Wheels. Sorry but Hannibal made me want to run to a shrink and find out why I would waste so much time on this series."
246,"Dexter and Red John from The Mentalist pale in comparison. Casting Superb, Dialogue Well Written, Camera Work Excellent. Masterful work. I am often dissuaded from thrillers... as whilst I am intrigued by the mystery I am often repulsed but the gore, however where Hannibal is concerned, although it is graphic I can appreciate the artistry of the make up and special effects team to create fantastic and well executed (excuse the pun) - set pieces. There are echo's of Manhunter (Film) in the dialogue, but it only serves to remind us that Thomas Harris and Micheal Mann respectively created true horror masterpieces and to pay homage to their work is a nod in the right direction. For those who are inclined make harsh comments about this series, please be reminded that if you could do it better yourself then you probably would have done by now. Get yourself a camera and start filming with a bunch of actors and then you'll come to appreciate the pain staking time, money, talent, skill and effort that goes into creating just a few minutes of watchable screen time and then feel free to comment from a place of knowledge not just flaming for flaming's sake. For those who have problems understanding Mads Mikkelsen, please stop showing yourself up and your narrow-minded dumbed down attitude. Thank you Josh Weedon btw for bringing Britian to America. The world is made up of many different accents and nationalities so prick up your ears. Already one episode has been banned from American TV due to it's content - but having just seen it myself, I think that this was a little to prudent and a shame that some audiences didn't get to see it, they should have just ear-marked a later screening time.I think that if the writers and the Director(s) can keep up the pace and characterisations by not letting it slide into too much of a weekly murder mystery show and steer Fishburn away from sliding back into CSI mode and maybe even venture further into a back story for a young Lector then an Emmy could be on the cards. My only one critique of this show as a whole is that Lector's table manners unfortunately let him down, as there is some naughty cutlery handling in the table scenes... but hey ho, I'm British - we notice these things. I do wish I could write more, but I'm having an old friend for dinner.Watch it. It's good."
247,"I actually thought the second season was better than the first; an overkill of unbelievably extravagant murder scenes and an annoyingly clairvoyant Will Graham left the first season feeling cheap and contrived. The second season settles down some and is all the better for it. Graham's plight during the first half of it never quite rings true but it's better than what we saw before, and the show as a whole tightens up as the Vergers arrive on scene. I haven't watched the final season yet but so far, I'd say this show is just OK, watchable but not really must-see. I'll update this review once I've finished the entire series."
248,Hannibal TV-series exceeded my expectations as a TV-adaptation. Enough new mixed with the original story to keep it interesting. Straight to the very top 5 on my best TV-list. Mads Mikkelsen's performance as Dr. Lecter was the butter on bread on the show. One to watch definitely. Hugh Dancy was a fragile butterfly ready to be squashed by the all time villain Hannibal and the dance between these two reminded a bromance. Laurence Fishburne's performance as a third wheel brought even more credibility to the show. Gillian Anderson as Hannibal's psychiatrist was credible performance as well. Scared little bird way over her head. Staying alive and trying not to release it in her pants as was I as viewer. Thank god I was on this side of the screen. Don't think I could've managed.
249,"My biggest worry about the Hannibal spin-off TV show, was Dr. Hannibal Lector. Would Mads pull off the same amazing and iconic performance that Anthony Hopkins did in Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon and Hannibal. Well, my worries fell hard, because Mads did one of the best re-imagining song Hannibal Lector that I could imagine. This the. Becomes a fantastic show. Full of mystery, suspense and the occasional horror that you're not expecting. One of the best TV shows I've seen. Violent enough to be entertaining but not too gory to be off putting. Hannibal pulls off something I thought was impossible, but long and behold this is a TV show for the collection."
250,I was worried about the casting particularly regarding the choice for Dr. Lecter. I was skeptical on whether the character dynamics would lean to heavily on Graham. But i was wrong. Dr. Lecter was never a main character. He is a supporter ever as always. Another of my concern was Laurence Fisburne. He was one of the main character in CSI and to see him play another similar role in this series which closely mirrors his character in CSI was actually unnerving for me. I hope that this series will go on from strength to strength because it has so many potential. If it gets canceled i'll probably hunt those TV execs 1 by 1.Which sets me to question myself after watching it. 1. Was i entertained? Yes. 2. Do i love this episode? Yes. 3. Will i watch the next episode? Yes. Suddenly i have a massive craving for haggis.
251,"Hannibal is such a TV series which leaves a legacy forever and it creates such a standard which is rare to be achieved by any regular show . I mean it has left such a mark on me that can never be erased , it made me care about a TV show so much that i was proud to be a fannibal . Everything about his show taking from casting , acting , choreography , music , story line , pacing , plot twists etc are just perfect . Every season starts slowly but mounts pressure with all possible plot twists and ends the season like an an atom bomb . Season 3 was little different it shows in two parts one is Florence part and red dragon arc and both the arcs were excellent and season 3 finale was stupendous and it really would be a perfect season finale but we want more . Thanks to Bryan fuller for giving us such a wonderful series and also to every cast and crew members for making this series successful and hope this show should get picked up and we would have opportunity to again watch this brilliant show."
252,"It takes a lot for me to get hooked on a show. I didn't like House of cards until around episode 6 and I couldn't get into Game of Thrones until about halfway through season 1. But from the very first preview of Hannibal for Season 1 I was hooked! It was the beauty in the cinematography I think that immediately got me. As an artist I was drawn to it, but it surely doesn't take an artist to appreciate this show. The music, cinematography, actors and dialogue really come together to create a masterpiece. This is not just ""another one of those cop shows"" that are overloading the networks, Hannibal is entirely something new. Despite the fact that this is a dark show with plenty for horror fans to appreciate, all aspects of gore are handled with incredible elegance. I believe that there is something in Hannibal for all different types of people to love. Hannibal is literally the greatest show on television and everyone should give it a chance. If not, you're missing out!"
253,"I don't get the positive reviews. They must be by the same mindless droves of people that keep the cringeworthy CSI franchises alive and expanding.Fishborne frustratingly plays a completely clueless investigator who apparently can't see his own hands in front of his face.Dancy's flashbacks are filler, gimmicky and an attempt at mystery - but really is just a reminder that you are indeed watching a bad CSI drama.Mikkelson is great, but it's unbelievable that with everything he does in an episode, short of murdering someone in front of Fishbornes face, he flies under the radar.This show is an attempt at CSI doing Dexter, complete with terribly wooden CSI jokes and an endless supply of serial killers that skirt security, traceability and plausible plot lines.The killer of the week is able to display dead bodies all over busy public places and never be seen. They seem to all be able to take out cops single handedly and every single one of them has the same dry sense of humour. They are all cookie cutter tv murderers that speak monotonously and quip here and there to show that they are ""insane"".Is there an army of Hannibal's? Is that the point of this show?But seriously, every 2nd person is a murderer on this show. How is anyone alive when 85% of the population is a serial killer?This show is total garbage. Watch the first 3 seasons of Dexter instead."
254,Just stunning in EVERY aspect! Please bring on a season 4! I need more Hannibal and Will!
255,"I really liked the series, with a very good development in what is the plot and characters and with quite similar to the movie since both are adaptations of the same book, a good adaptation of the book (red dragon) and with a good cast of actors tell you that the series will be promising, there are parts of the plot that are confusing but then I will explain it to you as you keep watching it, there are times that Hannibal will not know whether to hate it or love it for me that highlights the good performance of the actor and the script, I can highlight the performances of the main characters hugh dancy (will graham) and mads mikkelsen (hannibal lecter) and also its director Bryan Fuller, unfortunately for fans of this series (including me) the fourth season no it could happen."
256,"Great show, I really enjoyed season 1 and 2. Hannibal is lightning in a bottle; so fun to watch, and such fun gory scenes, so well executed. In season 2 the show really hits it's stride with good complexity, good pacing, spectaciular gore, lots of Hannibal and lots of intrigue. I am not sure what happened, but the show falls off alot during season 3. The pacing goes, there are far too many long camera pans and slow, melodramatic conversations.. especially Gillian Andersons character and the Japanese character. The execution is much weaker, like they changed the editing or special effects team, and so is the gore. There is also much less of Hannibal. It wasn't awful, but was disappointing after 1 & 2. Definitely worth a watch."
257,"Many TV shows and same stories , this one is a quite different idea. Great work, not only the story but perfect acting and scenes.Will Graham is not perfect but Hannibal simply is PERFECT."
258,"Dark, exciting series. Better than the movies. Mads Mikkelsen acts great"
259,"Mads Mikkelsen is one of the most unique actors of all time, and in this series he kills it with great a performance as always, his character, and face expressions are some of greatest well played performances."
260,"One of the best rv Shows ever, Maybe Not the tension of Breaking Bad or the Big budget like GOT, but sure the best Thriller ive ever Seen! A Must See for Psycho fans"
261,"This show is undoubtedly one of the most beautifully developed pieces of art I've ever seen. The dialogue is amazing, the visuals are perfect, and the action is pure adrenaline. I could compliment this show all day long. Mads Mikkelsen is the best Hannibal I could have ever dreamed of. There is excellent acting and the evolution of the characters is amazing. A true testament to how skilled Bryan Fuller is. Watch it, please. It will be an experience you will be glad you participated in."
262,"This series is remarkable, perhaps even unique, (There is much in the way of TV I have never seen) in four ways:1. the adrenalin level never lets up. You are perpetually on the edge of your seat, dragged from terror, to horror, to anger, to disgust, ...2. The crimes are the most imaginative and over the top I have ever seen in a TV series.3. Hugh Dancy, who plays Will Graham, is so vulnerable, so on the edge, and completely convincing. Watching him is like watching a baby who has crawled out onto a high-rise balcony and the railing is broken. At first I thought Will was Jim True-Frost who played Det. Roland 'Prez' Pryzbylewski on The Wire, but they are two different actors. Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is like a perfect Bond villain, so smooth, cold, polite, calm. He is like a cobra stalking. His light Danish accent gives him a hint of Nazi menace, without making him sound too much like Victor Borge. The casting is spot on for the other characters too.4. The gore special effects are very hard to remind yourself you are not seeing something real. They did not skimp.However the show has one highly annoying flaw. Will Graham, just KNOWS the details of how any crime happened, without almost no detective work. All he has to do is walk backwards at the crime scene, and magically he can see back in time and watch the events, and know the thoughts, motives and emotions of the killer. Further, He has so problem convincing others of his Ouija board infallible evidence. There was a similar TV Series called Medium. This gimmick is a lazy-man's way of avoiding having to compose logical and intriguing ways to deduce the killer from subtle clues. An episode is like the mirror image of a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Psychic cop is shooting fish in a barrel. Oddly, the dodge is closely related to those Christian entertainments about angels, Jesus and god, using bizarre divine intervention as the primary plot engine."
263,"I'd like to first remark on the fabulous acting that is to be found in this series. It is wonderfully casted with great performances from Fishburne and Dhavernas. But the outstanding acting here is found in the performances of Dancy and Mikkelsen. Revolutionary. I am beyond impressed with the depth and feeling conveyed by these men. The genre is not typically my cup of tea. But the way in which this series is presented and the phenomenal acting had me hooked from the very start. The premise is fascinating and a refreshing change from the murder mysteries we find on TV these days. And I will be honest, I am not a fan of the original Hannibal movies. But this series brings a new take to a cult classic that I find incredibly interesting. It keeps me coming back for more and I can't wait for the new season!"
264,"Shows I hate - Criminal Minds, every CSI, Law And Order SVU, and any other network show that uses gratuitous violence as the only reason to watch the show. This is my first review, and I am compelled to write my opinion because I am tired of fun and great shows like ""Firefly"" and ""Awake"" being canceled because of the lack of viewers. I will try and play my part in generating excitement about a network show, so read on. This show was really good. The violence was kept to a minimum (obviously it is a lot, but not stupidly gratuitous; a bullet does not take a half hour to travel through a body because the writing is so crappy that the moving bullet is better than the show. I digress...) by insinuating what happened behind the scenes. The acting was great. The writing contained very few of the commonalities of today's dramas - ""but what if..."", ""I wonder..."", ""unless....."", the bull crap of people finishing each other's sentences as though it is perfectly normal to do that in real life 72 times an hour, and the stupidity of everyone coming to the same conclusion at the same time and therefore somebody's life is saved because 15 of the main characters converge at the same point in order to kill the bad guy who nearly kills the main character. Without throwing in a spoiler, I loved that the writers wrote in a nightmare scene and when the character wakes up, he is covered in sweat. Instead of having him show off his wet body and then calling up a friend to share his feelings, they have him grab a bath towel to put down on the soaked mattress and then fall back asleep. Perfectly mundane, yet awesome because I know I'm not the only person to have done this. This realism just doesn't exist in other network shows, because every scene seems to contain only sensationalist crap. We all know that Hannibal will be caught, this just adds to the excitement of following and scrutinizing every scene he is in. He is brilliant, he is nearly perfect - where does he make his mistakes? I enjoyed the show so much that I was sad when the hour was up. I haven't felt that way about a show since I saw the first episode of ""Sherlock"" on BBC a few years ago. Watch the show - watch the replay on NBC.com; you will not be disappointed."
265,"Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor and huge star in his own country, he's from Denmark, and sure not German. I'm a big fan of his work. Most of the movies or series he work with in Denmark turn up to be great. I admit his English should be better for this part an Lector, i had a real hard time to understand what he said in to many places in part 1. He was the nr 1 bad guy in one of the 007 movies and didn't have a problem then. How ever i hope it get better.....?!!? Anyway the show looks great. Well, this is only part 1 but until now the series looks to be a hit and not so bad as so many of the other new series that just started. I give it a 8 to go. And Sorry: My English is to to good to..."
266,"I loved the season knowing that in the end Will Graham will win and Hannibal will get behind bars. How wrong I was. This series has a horrible ending, it doesn't play in with the concept of the book.(Spoilers) Honestly guys, why would they think it'd be a good idea to put the protagonist in the state hospital rather than the antagonist. In the book Hannibal's the one in the Hospital, NOT GRAHAM. Honestly, this season made me very frustrated. The ending was by far the worst part. In every other episode, Hannibal is shown as a friend of Wills. However, in this episode, he stabs him in the back. To whoever's reading this, stick with the movies; they are much better than this piece of crap.Giving this a 4/10 because I think it's that bad."
267,Everyone in this series claims to be a mind reader and profilers but fails to identify Hannibal. And looks like Hannibal can defy all the logic and can fool anyone and do anything on will. He can go in and out of FBI and place a dead arm and phone in morgue and no one knows and look like there are no cameras in FBIs offices. And how is that possible that whole of FBI eats at his home and no one notices that he is feeding them human meat. They discuss every case in front of him and tell him every little secret although he is not part of investigation. Everyone suspects Abigail Hobbs to be killer but no one uses lie detector test to see if she is lying. looks like they don't use any modern investigating techniques. May be this is their design!!!.
268,"I'll start with the positive. It's stylish, flashy, and the cinematography is stunning. The acting is competent thanks to a high profile cast. The beginning of each new crime or episode is usually exciting because of the unusual nature of the crime, the flood of visual and audible imagery that accompanies it as well as the suspense that is brought to the screen. These are the most attractive qualities of the series. Underneath this exterior however, is a constant thick layer of psychoanalytical gibberish that is passed off as intellectual jargon, implausible leaps of logic, impossible leaps to conclusions, absurd plot points that were only pulled off because of convincing acting and direction but do not make sense if you stop to acknowledge them for at least a split second, as well as educational dream sequences (the last seems the most plausible characteristic- the brain suddenly putting together the jigsaw puzzles lying in your subconscious, but in reality its nothing more than convenient plot device; Processing facts and suspecting someone's involvement through cognitive processing is one thing, but recalling an event under a drug induced state that rendered you unconscious is rather absurd).The dialogue is often unintentionally misleading or hindering the narrative progression, convoluting the story while giving it the appearance of being highbrow in retrospect. This makes the series seem grand and highly intelligent when it really isn't. It's like finding a well dressed member of the opposite sex bright because of their looks- they're attractive, confident and extravagant but they're only appealing as long as you don't spend too much time delving below the surface. As this show suggests, appearances can be deceptive. Sorry, I took a peak behind the curtain and saw the great and powerful Hannibal for what he really is, which means I won't be staying for dinner to try the tainted meat or drink the kool aid."
269,"Hannibal Lecter is personally my favorite criminal. I love him. So, naturally, I was relatively excited for the television series. I watched the Pilot last night, and I have to say, it was not what I expected, another crime show. Not to mention the fact that it is set in modern times, which doesn't really work for this character, I see what they were trying to do though, because other things have successfully been brought into modern times, but the whole reason Dr. Lecter became this criminal was because mainly his sister was killed and fed to him, during World War II. All in all, I suppose if you aren't a ""Lecterphile"" then you may like the show, but if you are, you will be extremely disappointed."
270,"OK... I've been meaning to review this title, because there is such a discrepancy between seasons. Season 1 is a 10. It's the murder mystery show you've been waiting for. They do go a bit over the top with some murder scenes, but manage to keep it almost believable. We have great acting, great writing , great relationship dynamics. It's not without its faults, but overall it's a 10. OK, let's move on to season 2. Season 2 is in a pickle. They've got their main character in an insane asylum , and they probably went a bit too far with that. Will Grahm is a lovable guy and no one wanted to see it go that far and it didn't need to. I really thought they could have had him just question his sanity and so Hannibal could avoid detection. Season 2 just deteriorates from there... The writing stays good but the plots. The characters , all take a dive. Season 2 also started exasperating the symbolism and slow motion camera. Season 2 I give a 7. By season 3, now every episode spends about 20 minutes just on slow motion drops of water or rain or blood segways, or some weird color symbolism. It worked in season 1 because they didn't overdose on it. By season 3, it's an art house movie, think David Lynch. Season 1 worked because it was like a FBI files drama. Season 2 and 3 just get lost into that Lost Highway mood , and it doesn't work. They went too far with it when we want plot and mystery and drama and life. We want a realistic look at this, it's just goes too far and they really twist it up. Some people like that, I think if you like season 1, you probably won't. Just too much. I'm not sure if they ran out of script, it almost feels like an excuse, like they are trying to just fill the time, so watch this crow fly in slow motion. Or whatever. Season 3 tries to get back to the original formula but they just can't let go of that David Lynch feel , they lost the balance with season 1, and go overboard with the latest serial killer. They need to really simplify to get back to the drama gold they had in season 1. Season 3 is a 6."
271,"I enjoyed Seasons ! & 2 of Hannibal but the third series was a complete let down with too much emphasis on politcial correctness or rather trying to be edgy in its poitical correctness and failing.I was enjoying the back story of how Hannibal came to get caught as shown in Series 1 & 2, however Series 3 came along and.....They changed the story completely, added surrogates, lesbians, a hom- erotic relationship betwwen Hannibal & Will and a completely different ending. The scenes in Italy were more about the directo being as artistic as possible than actual story and it was just not enjoyable to watch. This character is one of the cinematic greats but as the second novel was described you see where the writer had writers block and went off on a complete tangent...this series follows that mould."
272,"I don't know exactly why, but I never found the 1990's movies with Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins that scary. Perhaps that's because my mother had read the books and told me what the character was suppose to be like. Then as I got older and read the book myself I can actually say the TV series is considerably more loyal to the characters original personalities and even evolves them. Hannibal Lecter is certainly a cannibal and a murderer but he's more logical, complicated, and very sophisticated- unlike in the movies which portray him as the stereotypical very physiologically messed up and barely contained raging killer. Dare I say it, but the true Hannibal is a lot more like Dexter (another TV series)- focused on killing those he deems unworthy of life. Now I do admit I'm biased because I loved Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy as actors even before this series so I about died when I saw they were in this. But they both do exceptionally well. This series is definitely not for the faint of heart or mind. It's very physiological and intelligent with dark themes and imagery wrapping all in a blood stained bow. There is also copious subtext and tension that finally pays off in the third, and hopefully not last, season. To which I can only say it is completely refreshing to find a TV series that was not born of Netflix that does not pull its punches and actually 'goes there' as someone people may put it. It's 2015, its time our programming reflected that."
273,"I've been watching this show since the beginning and it fascinated me. I've seen all the movies about Hannibal and read almost all the books(still planning on doing so) and I actually couldn't see anyone else then Anthony Hopkins pulling off Hannibal. Well, Mads Mikkelsen is in my opinion even better! Season one started with a lot of characters from the books, sometimes even switching their genders and the seasons more or less follow the books. It's not very faithful to the books, but it really builds a new world around it. There's a lot of psychological talk and things can get really complicated, but it's not really to hard to follow actually. But what really stands out in the show are the brutal deaths and fascinating (serial)killers. They are really well put together and make this show really interesting. I must say that season 1 is still my favorite. In my opinion it declined a little in the start of season 2 and regained it mid season 2. Season 3 is a little odd. It seems to me that the director goes more for semi-interesting visuals in between scenes and less on story and character development, which is an odd choice. It's still a good show, but it declined a bit."
274,"After finishing one of the best shows I have ever watched Dexter I automatically wanted to find an alternative to the blood thirsty vigilante. So everywhere on the internet pointed straight to Hannibal after the first episode I could not stop watching, I binge watched till my eyes couldn't stay open any longer. So I would like to say that the thing that most impressed me about this show was the music. The music brought me into every aspect of the show, the music made me feel like I was there with Hannibal cooking a spontaneous meal. Another part of the show I really loved was the cinematography, the imagery was amazing and I did not realize how significant cinematography was to a show until watching Hannibal. Honestly the gore and blood did not mind me whatsoever the first two seasons and then when I started to watch the third season I was so disappointed I nearly cried. Each episode was more boring then the other, I fell asleep in every episode I watched. The music and cinematography were still there but the plot and suspense was no where to be seen. I could tell that the directors were trying to hard to make the third season gory that it disgusted me so much I was angry. I would've deducted more out of my rating because of the third season but I was extremely delighted about the first two."
275,"Hannibal had a slow start. After the first episode I was tempted to give up on it as I thought there was no way I would get into it. However after reading some very good reviews I decided to give it another chance and push on with it. I'm glad I did. Hannibal is an interesting and engaging series that explores the minds of both Hannibal and his patient Will. It keeps you guessing as to what Hannibal's motives are and why he plays the mind games he does with Will. The show has a lot of blood and gore which adds to the realism. The aspect of the show which let's it down is the fact there are so many weird murders going on and none of the characters seem at all surprised that they are amongst so many pychopaths. People are not just murdered on here, they are always involved in some sort of pychathic agenda for example the violin murder and the 'animal' murders. The last episode of season 2 was great, very unpredictable.I am really looking forward to season 3 next week."
276,"I watched the first few episodes of series 1 and thought it boring and fake. I just didn't get it. But .... after a couple of months I came across series 1 again and started watching a bit later in the series. (I purposefully skipped a few episodes with the hope that the series would gain momentum. And I was right!)The series actually got a whole lot more interesting several episodes in. By the end of series 1 I was hooked. Series 2 was gripping from the start and moved a lot better than series 1 (in my opinion). I actually watched all of series 2 and am now keenly awaiting the next series.It is artistic, gory, entertaining and very clever. Gripping twists and turns that keeps one guessing. I thoroughly enjoy it.I haven't read the books and am not planning to."
277,"Beautifully shot and well-acted, 'Hannibal' Series 1 is an incomplete dish, though delicious in parts.The writers rely heavily on clichés to drive the narrative along, especially regarding characterisation and dialogue. For me, this is another 'magic detective' drama with a serial killer cliché. By 'magic detective', I mean that age-old trope of having a detective who can essentially solve crimes no other person could do, utilising a sort of 'magic' or 'superpower'. They often have an equal and opposite flaw, to balance the character and create drama and tension.Here are some examples: Sherlock Holmes - powers: incredible perception and deduction / weaknesses: antisocial, drug addictionMonk - powers: incredible perception and deduction / weaknesses: social anxiety, OCDMedium's Alison Dubois - powers: supernatural perceptionThe Mentalist's Patrick Jane - powers: incredible perception and manipulationWhite Collar's Neal Caffrey - powers: master manipulator / weaknesses: corruptible, disloyalLie to me's Cal Lightman: incredible perception and master manipulatorColombo - powers: incredible deduction, perception and master manipulatorPerception's Daniel Pierce - powers: incredible perceptionGhost Whisperer's Melinda Gordon - powers: supernatural perceptionUnforgettable's Carrie Wells - powers: incredible deduction, perfect memoryDeath Note's L - powers: incredible perception and deductionBody of Proof's Megan Hunt - powers: incredible perception and deductionNumb3rs' Charles Eppes - powers: incredible deductionSo on and so on... In Hannibal it's 'total empathy' which gives William Graham incredible powers of perception and deduction. Yawn.Hannibal isn't wholly good or wholly bad; there are some great sequences, creative visualisations, strong performances. But it's hampered by some silly writing and clichéd narrative, in my opinion."
278,"Will Graham, the protagonist in NBC's HANNIBAL, reminded me of the quote from Nietzsche: ""He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you."" The show is equal parts beauty and grotesque. It explores the very definition of self, sanity, and reality. It's VERY well written, acted, and shot (filmed in Toronto). It is debatably the best adaptation of Harris' characters, but this is not for everyone. You have to be able to stomach the gore (pun intended). This show, especially if you marathon it, can make you feel ""weird"". I have very few complaints, other than perhaps an overuse of dream sequences, and that the ""serial killer of the week"" is more to appeal to new audiences than simply continuing the main narrative. Lance Henriksen is woefully underused in his episode and his murders were arguably the most interesting, but he has the weakest motivations. Overall, fantastic show for any fan of Silence of the Lambs or serial killer shows like Dexter."
279,"I had grave doubts when it was announced that the iconic Hannibal Lecter character would once again be back on screen, albeit the TV screen; it seemed to me that Dino De Laurentiis had flogged this particular horse until it had died a slow death, so desperate he was to squeeze every last drop of cash out of the 'franchise'.As a fan of the Thomas Harris books however, looking in on the new series was difficult to resist, and I wasn't just pleasantly surprised; I was completely blown away. I hadn't really immersed myself in any of Brian Fuller's work previously (I caught a few episodes of Pushing Diasies, and that was about it), but his vision for Hannibal was truly worthy of the source material.Visually, it is stunning: the nods to Kubrick have been noted an acknowledged, but even at its most gruesome (and by heck, it can be gruesome), Hannibal manages to retain an almost hypnotic beauty to its visuals; you simply cannot take your eyes off he screen.And nor should you, because the next thing you notice is how tautly written it is. Scenes of conversation that on the face of it are there to slow the pace down are very tightly scripted; every word uttered seems to bear some relevance later down the line, particularly where it relates to the development of the character of Hannibal and Will. Miss a sentence, and you may well miss something vital.Season One provided a very strong start to the series, but Season Two has comfortably surpassed the early success. It seems to have it all: clever use of music, thematic depth, excellent acting (the cast is truly outstanding), and of course, strong reference to the source material. Naturally, the series does not follow the canon established by the novels due to the ownership rights relating to some major characters, but the series is none the weaker for it; indeed, it lends the show an element of unpredictability that keeps you on the edge of your seat, even if you are familiar with the books.Its been a long time since I've seen a TV series that has people talking about it for days after each episode, but this certainly is one of them. Bravo to all involved, and may the standard set so far continue."
280,"It's definitely unjust to compare Hannibal the series with any other crime shows, CIS-style, or even Dexter and Criminal Minds. Hannibal is not so much a crime show as it is a voyage into the mind, an exploration of the psyche, a disturbing peek into what's it like to be losing your mind. That's why, to be able to fully appreciate the series, the viewer must dispense with certain traditional perceptions and focus not so much on the plot, but on the main characters and the atmosphere, and allow to be led into a dizzying descent into darkness. The novels that this series is based on are serial killer novels, and all those delve deeply into the mind, mental illness and crime. I must confess I've never read any of them. So much for the better – it gives me a better appreciation of this superb show. Movies based on the works of Thomas Harris have had varying success to date, and of course, it's the theatrically creepy Anthony Hopkins in his iconic role that has set the benchmark and influenced the audience's expectations. I dare say, Mads Mikkelsen has reinvented Hannibal Lecter as a truly menacing and malevolent presence, made so much the scarier with his suaveness and charm. Such understated yet intense acting, putting his cold, impressive facial features to such fascinating use -Mikkelsen gives a simply magnificent performance. Hugh Dancy on the other hand conveys so very convincingly a tortured man, blessed with a cursed talent, teetering on the brink of madness, unsure of himself, unsure of his friends and his actions, sure only that his world is terrible, horrifying and damned – and so is he. Not a martyr, but a victim, Will Graham is the representation of humanity, the symbol of the fragility of our inner world, of all our worlds. A compelling performance, truly disturbing and on par with the icy demeanor of the true Satan, Hannibal Lecter. So convincing is Will Graham's madness, that it's more scary, more disturbing even than the graphic gore of the crimes, which has nevertheless been presented very elegantly. Should you get nightmares from Hannibal, it will be because of Will, not the blood and guts.Too bad the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. I cannot really say whether it's to be attributed to the actors, or the writing, but luckily they don't detract much from the cat and mouse play of Hannibal and Will, a suspenseful high stakes game. It's nice to see Gillian Anderson though, hopefully her character will get more time in upcoming seasons. The final scene in the season finale is the perfect illustration of the chemistry Mikkelsen and Dancy have on screen. So little is said, but so much is implied, leaving a huge field for fans' imaginations to run wild. This is where not having read the novels really pays off, because I can speculate and look forward to the new season with all the excitement of a fanboy. 8/10, hoping future seasons will give me reason to add more stars."
281,"How thoroughly disappointing Hannibal has been throughout all three series.The only shining light has been Mads Mikklesen , although still a watered down Anthony Hopkins, and perhaps Raul Esparza , but only after his session with Mr Mikklesen at Hugh Dancy's farm. I feel, as an avid Thomas Harris reader , that this 'retelling' has been akin to a poorly cooked meal , the courses served out of order and 'complimented' by a rather ordinary house wine . I'm sure we have all heard the old adage 'if it isn't broken don't fix it' and it applies here . Manhunter was remade and was far better for it , but i fear this offering has been a waste of celluloid or whatever they use now. Please please please spare this tremendous story the indignity of a fourth series."
282,"A surprising series. It is always difficult to produce a prequel – The prequel of Dune written by Brian Herbert, with the help of Kevin J. Anderson, is for example far from what his father Frank Herbert produced – since we know Doctor Hannibal Lecter is in prison at the beginning of The Silence of the Lambs. In the prequel we have the story of a criminal who is going to be caught. We can see his style, how he manipulates people in order for them to appear as being the criminals while he is nicely going on with his crimes and cleaning up around him all those who may have a suspicion. He is a perverse cook and he cooks for anyone, friends and fiends, police and civilians, patients and strangers, fancy dishes and even banquets. The only thing they do not know is that all the dishes served to them are based on human organs and flesh. He kills to get the organs or parts he wants, or is needs? All the guests to his table are thus turned into cannibals though they don't know it. He even turns some bodies into the growing soil of some of his mushrooms or vegetables. The series is clear about his great power to manipulate people and make them commit the crimes he wants them to commit, or assume the crimes he has committed and he wants to cover up with a fake culprit. He only kills those menacing his activities himself if he can't do otherwise. In this season he aims at getting the FBI special agent who has psychic powers because his psychic powers could easily reveal his true identity, not as a helpful psychiatrist but as a resourceful murderer, and because he is easily manipulated since he can easily be brought to the point when he does not know where the divide between reality and psychic vision or nightmarish dream is. Apart from that the only other interest is that some of these crimes are highly creative and committed by other criminals that in a way or another he uses to create an ambiance, an atmosphere of fear and suspicion. The culinary expertise is really nothing but a prop in this plot. The cruelty of this man is just what we expect but the cruelest crimes are not committed by him. Then the series becomes a vision into what perversions our society can create or rather give free rein to in order for them to find an outlet, Hannibal Lecter being only one of these criminals who can stand over this mess to pull the strings and produce the smoke screen he needs, a smoke screen that has a nice aroma, a nice fumet, a nice edible fragrance that titillates our appetite if not gluttony. And we forget glittony is a deadly sin so that we can accept the guilt of anyone around us, even our best friends, provided the food goes on running down the table to our china plates and silver platters. The end of the season is a perfect suspenseful situation in which special Agent Will Graham has found refuge in Hannibal Lecter's office after he escaped from prison by killing a few people who were supposed to transfer him to some high security prison for a whole series of crime he did not commit but Hannibal Lecter has manipulated the FBI and Will Graham himself into believing they have been committed by Bill Graham, by himself as for Bill Graham. Gruesome, bleak and probably over-realistic, but crime has no limits and the divide between sanity and derangement is so invisible that we could all be main suspects in the hard fate of our neighbors.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
283,"Just watched Season 2 opener and looks like it's going to get very interesting.Watched the last episode of Season 1 the other day just to prepare for the opener of Season 2.Watching the last episode of Season 1 reminded me how good this show it. I recall one episode was banned in the US for it's violent and nasty content. But every episode it pretty near the mark.Don't like giving spoilers way in my reviews and this is no different.I understand this a network show in the US so free to all to watch without subscription, so jump on board and start watching it.We all know the story of Hannibal Lector, but this show has no bearing on the movies other than he's an intelligent, charming person who so happens to commit the most brutal of murders. And in this show they are brutal.Don't be put off by the actors who some may already dislike. I wasn't a big fan of Gillian Anderson, but since watching her in Bleak House, Hannibal & The Fall love her dearly.As said at the start Season 2 is going to heat up, and a preview of episode 2 shows no sign of that changing.Miss this show at your peril, it's a million miles ahead of the dross True Detective that everyone is raving about."
284,"Really enjoyed watching this outstanding series. Very strong cast and excellent camera-work and video-transfer. The storyline seems to be a bit predictable, but turns out unique and surprising in many ways. Also very strong dialogs.It all adds up to a impressive and dark experience watching this show, and really blows your mind ! The final episode makes really a outstanding connection to the previous Hannibal movies.Mads Mikkelsen is the best Hannibal you can imagine ! Many kudos to cast and creators for this brilliant series. Really glad there is a second season announced !!!!!!"
285,"A breath-catching, detailed series. This is not a show for the faint- hearted. I will even go as far as to say that this will become the next Dexter. Mads Mikkelson delivers her performance rarely seen in modern films or series and the same can be said for the protagonist played by Hugh Dancy. 13 Episodes of mind-torture, mysteries and a guessing game that does not end. Hannibal does justice to Thomas Harris' writing. If you have not yet started watching this series then do yourself a favour - if you are easily disgusted pull closer a bucket or skip dinner and if gore is your god then sit back and wait to be intrigued and mesmerized. Well done to the creators, writers, director and actors - superb does not begin to describe the masterpiece you created."
286,"In an interview with Mads Mikkelson, he said when he was talking with Bryan Fuller about the series that he wanted to play him as Lucifer, a terrible, dark angel. In my view, he's succeeded. Physically beautiful, connoisseur of all the fine arts, and without one shred of any emotion, positive or negative. Just pure evil, remarkably and coldly calculating.It's pure pleasure watching Mikkelson who reacts with just a flicker of change in his expression or body. Watching him interact with his psychiatrist in the 11th episode was a wonder in subtlety from both him and Gillian Anderson.As others have said, this is a far different interpretation of Lechter. The crimes are a bit outlandish and elaborate. It's the price you pay.Fuller has outlined his plan for 4 seasons of Lechter, and he only has the rights to some characters, such as Mason Verge. He doesn't have Clarice; she's MGM's, who a series about Clarice ""in development."" I'm not sure he'll get that far. I'm thankful for the 2 we're getting."
287,"Hannibal isn't bad. Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are both very competent in their respective roles. My issue is more with the re-imagining of Special Agent Will Graham. Petersen's portrayal back in 1986's Manhunter (directed by the always awesome Michael Mann) was nothing short of groundbreaking. His Will Graham teetered on the verge of going too deep into the mind of psychopaths, yet was still resolute in his determination to stop these madmen. Manhunter was so good that Ed Norton's Red Dragon, while competent, felt completely redundant. Dancy's Graham is far more ... sensitive, almost equivocating. It's not necessarily bad, but different enough that I can't quite get my arms around this. It's OK, but not sure I can say it's a must-see."
288,"Based on this first episode, I would say that this is by far the best psychological/criminal thriller I've seen. I don't say this at all lightly - I'm an avid fan of the genre and the Hannibal trilogy (or quadrilliogy if counting Manhunter).The reason it works so well is that it walks the line perfectly. It balanced perfectly the character depth needed, without feeling sluggish or, conversely, too 'CSI'-like in it's speed. It's dark and gritty, without feeling forced, tacky or trite. It also doesn't rely on gimmicks or clichéd characterisation nearly as much as many in the genre do. I also felt the casting is spot on. The two main leads fit their roles fantastically, and the supporting cast shone out enough to not make it just a one on one (like the following). Those complaining about Lector's lack of grandiose speaking and more subdued nature - I feel this is a conscious choice, and something that will develop throughout the series (as this is very much about going back to basics). Obviously, that's pure speculation, but as the rest of the show is so well crafted, I doubt they would overlook or change that aspect and it would make sense for this to be his 'character arc'.The reason for my 9/10 is that I will concede that it did seem to, at times, move a little bit quickly and some plot aspects could have been given more gravity.All in all, in an intensely crowded genre, this really does stand out. Well worth your time."
289,"Review by Matt:  When trying to adapt a specific character from another medium, say  literature or film, to television, its always a tricky proposition.  Since the character is already established in said mediums you have to  know the audience that already recognizes the character and make them  believe the transition is seamless, while still exposing the character  to a new market, fans, critics, etc. One of the most recognizable  characters in modern crime novels is Hannibal Lecter; the  psychiatrist/cannibal that haunted our dreams through the words of  Thomas Harris. Even if you're a ""lament"" you've heard of Lecter in some  way, shape, or form. Now we get to see Dr. Lecter on the small screen  as he assists criminal profiler, Will Graham, from the novel ""Red  Dragon"" to try and track down serial killers. While the premiere  episode of ""Hannibal"" was bumpy, at best, I'll still give it a mulligan  for what its trying to accomplish, at least for a few more episodes.  If you've seen, or read, ""Red Dragon"" or ""Silence of the Lambs,"" you  pretty much know the deal. There is a killer on the loose, in this case  a killer impaling young girls on antlers, and on occasion one or more  of their organs missing (see where I'm going with this). Will Graham is  on the case, commissioned by Special Agent Jack Crawford, played by  Laurence Fishburne, to find the killer. Crawford brings in another  consultant, Hannibal Lecter, a respected psychiatrist from the  Baltimore-area. Graham and Lecter seem an unlikely duo at first with  each one trying to outwit the other, but Lecter sense a kindred spirit  in Graham with his ability to empathize with the killers he hunts.  Despite my misgivings about this show, the more I think about it, the  more I want to see where it goes. You know the end of the journey for  both Will and Hannibal, but now its the journey of how they both got  there. It's the cat-and-mouse game that will guide the show onward,  which isn't that bad when you think about it. With so much fervor on  origin stories about mythological characters (just look at every Marvel  Studios Phase 1 film) ""Hannibal"" has a chance to succeed with an  audience that wants to know; Why? and How?  While I've talked myself off the ledge about the storyline of  ""Hannibal"" my main concern is the casting; namely Mads Mikkelsen as  Lecter. For starters, I like Mads, I think he is a solid actor who  knows how to play a villain and steal scenes on occasion. But I just  feel that he is wrong as Lecter. For starters, he LOOKS like a killer.  The thing about Anthony Hopkins playing Lecter, or even Brian Cox for  that matter, was that he didn't look the part of a psychopathic,  narcissistic, cannibal. He was a posh doctor with a penchant for opera,  fine dining, and drawing. Hopkins was the ultimate wolf in sheep's  clothing. Mikkelsen, on the other hand, is a wolf in wolf's clothing.  If I saw him walking down the street I would run the other way because  I knew I was only a remark away from being served with a nice Chianti.  I also found myself struggling to understand Lecter when he spoke.  Since Mads has a pretty thick Danish accent, not all the dialogue came  through clearly which isn't great when you are trying to hang on to  everything Lecter is saying to get deeper into his character and  motives.  With that being said, I don't blame the casting either. If the creators  are basing this version of Lecter on the novel ""Hannibal Rising"" it  makes sense. Lecter, by birth, was Eastern European, not British as  some of us might assume. While aristocratic, Eastern Europe, namely  Lithuania, is vastly different than the British Isles. Can Mikkelsen  outshine Hopkins as a Hannibal Lecter for a new generation? Well, we'll  have to see about that.  From a literary standpoint, the show sticks pretty close to the source  material of ""Red Dragon,"" which is good in my opinion. It sheds more  light on Will Graham and his special gift for empathy, but it comes off  as kind of a second rate Sherlock Holmes, more so the Benedict  Cumberbatch version than the Robert Downey Jr. version.  Bottom line, I'm giving this show a mulligan. I can't judge a show that  I have reasonably high hopes for by just one episode. Sure, there are  kinks to work out, and the show suffers from ""a style over substance""  problem, and if another network had the rights to Harris' work, namely  an FX or dare I say, HBO, maybe the show could push the envelope a bit  more, but that's not really the issue. I think the biggest thing people  are having a hard time wrapping their heads around are the casting  choices and the overall mood. We fear change, and we've been spoiled by  the Hopkins' Lecter for over 20 years so when this new, ""exotic"" Lecter  comes along our first inclination is to bash him, and I fully  understand why, but before we jump to conclusions, divorce yourself  from preconceived notions of who Lecter was, and let this new  incarnation do it's own thing."
290,"If you're a fan of the books or the movies, don't worry. This series has nothing to do with them. You won't ever find yourself complaining that this isn't like the books (or the movies) because this 39 episode series had 12 directors and 21 writers, and none of them read any of the books. But they sure liked to do 'shrooms!Like 'Lost' and 'Game of Thrones,' there was a lot to work with. Great story, great cast, cameras that did whatever they were told to do, and the ability to have a musical score if they had wanted one.Everything starts encouragingly. The dialogue, the acting, the filming, and editing were all crisp and clean. But you know how it is when you have the budget and material and cast to hit it out of the park. You start thinking, ""Hey, is that a squirrel over there?"" and you wander off and never come back.That creates a perfect opportunity for anybody who has ever wanted to write a screenplay, and everybody who has ever wanted to direct, to try it out! You don't even have to know the storyline or anything! Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can, as Arthur Ashe said.That goes for pot, mushrooms, microdot, whatever you're into or have wanted to try. The folks working on the first season were pretty set on making an excellent series, and they did, except for whoever wrote the background score-more about that in a minute.By season two, they had lost most of the squares and were starting to have some fun. Sure, it's kind of hard to follow, and Gillian Anderson began to use the tone and cadence of a lady at the library reading to the kids that came on the short bus. But if you payed attention and didn't think too hard, it was still a pretty good series.And then season three rolled in like a barrel of drunken monkeys. Some directors wanted to be Alfred Hitchcock; some wanted to be Clint Eastwood. Some writers we're fans on Stephen King, and some were fans of thick paperback romance novels. Gillian was still reading to the slow kids, and Laurence Fishburn decided he was Brian Dennehy, but that's not so bad. Mads Mikkelson and Mr. Dancy didn't let all the monkeys on the lot, or the odd sprinkling of vanishing characters, throw them off. Remember the 80-pound supermodel, who was an expert sniper? Yeah, me neither. She did do a drive-by, though. (Ha!)Eventually, the mushrooms and cannabis won, and the folks who weren't invited to the party began to write and direct. Everybody had a good time, and the producers had already brought in some patsies to blame, so the barrel finally rolled off a cliff, and everyone went home.Except for the background music guy, who was sleeping under the mixer and drinking out of other people's cups. He hung around and recorded everything he could think of until somebody spotted him and ran him out. They played Rochambeau (Rock-Paper-Scissors if you're in Gillian's reading group) to decide what music went with each episode.Was this fun to watch? Yes. Did it make sense? No. Is it an 8.5 or a 10? Well, I'd did seen the kids voting..."
291,"There is no doubt that Hannibal is a visually astonishing piece but what strikes me the most is how it was ahead of its time and it still is for many people. I only catched its true essence after I rewatched it for a third time, and I usually do not find enjoyment in rewatching anything at all."
292,"A show that always twisted in unexpected ways, but with two male leads that could hold a scene with silence.There's some disturbing visual effects but one of the aspects I loved was its artistic take on gore. It's a show about serial killers, dead bodies were a given, but violence and death is so theatrically engaging that it's almost secondary to the drama.Only detractors I think is that as a network show they wouldn't confirm a LGBTQ realationship for the leads, but that's hardly new."
293,"This show is dark, but incredibly good!
The cast - perfect!! Each character is played so well.
Mikkelson as Lecter is superb! He brings a reserved, crazy calm kinda vibe to the character. He is so good at the 'hiding in plain sight',,, just shows how good of an actor the man is.
Dancy as Graham is outta this world!
Fishburne,, what more do I need to say other than his name, right?!?Imo,, the first 2 seasons were as close to perfect as a show can get. Season 3,,, there was so much good stuff done,, but it was not on the same level. Also,, I didn't care for the 2nd half of sn3 (had nothing to do with casting,, Armitage was a great choice as Dolarhyde). Idk why,,, there was just something about the way it was done that didn't set right with me,,, idk.If you liked the movies,, watch this already!!"
294,"First of all, this is a retelling of the Red Dragon novel. It is by no means directly comparable to anything from the source. Don't look for motivations, key plot points, or absolutes from the books or movies. This is its own beast.It is also not meant to be taken as a scientifically accurate or logically iron-clad procedural crime show. It is, by design, not supposed to be realistic in its depictions of elaborate post-mortem stagings, lax law enforcement and basic psychological musings. It is set in that world before hardcore forensics. A place that lacked surveillance cameras on every corner, and everyone and their relatives' DNA profile on the internet.This show is part Grand Guignol, theater of the absurd, Greenaway, Alice Cooper and Twin Peaks. There are things that are irrational on purpose. That is the nature of things when making deranged and shocking works of art.And like an hallucinatory fever dream, it moves how and where it wants. That is the joy in it."
295,"Loved the first two seasons! Gory, spooky, thrilling and even comical sometimes. The third season was almost a little dull in this 'new' killer but still sparked my interest, however the ending of the series was very confusing and dissapointing. It left alot of loose ends for me, however I would still very much recommend watching it atleast once."
296,The acting and storytelling was second to none and it's a shame it ended far too soon.
297,One of the best series in TV history. Too smart for network tv. It should have been on a premium service. One of the rare cases where a reimagined work has been done well.
298,"This was one of the best shows ever it's so elegant, please we want the show to be renewed."
299,"Everything is simply delightful. Cast, direction, ambientation, rhythm, etc.Transforms the grotesque in refinement ( I know, it sounds contradictory, but that´s exactly the point). At the beginning, I was just little bit confused on Mads' interpretation (maybe because of Hopkins). But through a couple of episodes, I realized what he was doing. Everytime he appears on the screen one should expect something extraordinary (even just a micro-gesture)."
300,"Season1 &2 was fine.season3(just ok) story was absolute vague and totally went on the wrong path.There are too many logic mistakes in it but it's not boring.so throw away the logic and just watch,you surely likes it."
301,"I absolutely loved this series, Brillant performance by Mads. So sorry the series ended."
302,"No spoilers.
In this show, Hannibal character was produced differently than the movies yet it was absolutely amazing and admirable. Even if you get annoyed quickly, i am sure most of people will not feel this way. The show have number of serial killers with crimes that are more close to art ! The show gets deep in each character's personal philosophy. It is of course expanded from the original story yet the same old red dragon story exists. All the actors actually had a remarkable performance yet Madds (Hannibal) was absolutely something else. the story is very well plotted and twisted with a huge shot of physiological horror and thriller. Personally, this is my favorite show so far and unless you are one of those who only watch romance and comedy, it is very recommended that you watch it and i am sure the vast majority of you will enjoy it."
303,"Hannibal is a great series it contains all the elements of magnificence , i adore this show because this is something i have never seen in TV and as i am a vivid fan of crime genre i love each of the significance of the small details given to this series.."
304,"Season two of Hannibal was absolutely amazing, introducing mason verger and amplifying the the performance of Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy to another level, One of the few series out there requiring a few viewings to truly grasp. Bryan Fuller and Thomas Harris really blew this out of the park."
305,The best show I have ever seen! The dialogue is mesmerizing. You can enjoy this show at face value or you can appreciate the tiniest of details. It was one of the only shows I would have been willing to pay to subscribe to so that it could continue. Very refreshing to have an intellectual show especially with these particular characters. I was a huge fan of the movies but Mads Mikkelsen is the best person for Hannibal!!
306,"No spoilers - though I do make reference to characters and known parts of the story (book and film) being present and absent, without going into the details. In many respects it is complete, albeit a little unresolved at the end. Such a pity it doesn't however go into other aspects of the complete story. We get Red Dragon and Hannibal feature heavily, without Clarice Starling however, and sadly no retelling of the Silence of the Lambs. It begins prior to Red Dragon, to further explain Hannibal Lecter's working relationship with the police, manipulation, and so on, while also working in some of the Mason Verger back story into those parts, making the Hannibal book story work, but for some reason or other they seemed unable to include Clarice Starling and Silence of the Lambs. There was some talk of progress forthcoming in that regard, but it all seems to have now been dropped entirely. As such, you could just watch this, and then when it finishes go into The Silence of the Lambs movie, and have it all end right there. You probably wouldn't want to go into the Hannibal movie however, quite simply because elements of that story pop up in the series.I've given it 8 stars rather than 10 because it wasn't able to fully embrace all parts of the overall story. I suppose there were some issues with rights, and all that, though I'm not really sure - can only assume."
307,"it has the rare gift to be an absolutely new series about an old subject. that, it is a well made, almost admirable psychological movie who dares reconstruct the story of Dr. Lecter in a superb manner. must important - it seems be a film of actors. Mads Mikkelsen is the same, exploring and using with high science, each detail, transform each image in a profound precious job. but Hugh Dancy could be a real revelation for many viewers. Hannibal does it using entire potential. he impress, gives a fascinating mixture of vulnerability and force and the result is special. more than a smart/beautiful series, exercise to discover the potential of a subject in new light, it is a wise series. almost a surgery job."
308,"Seasons one and two were very well written, encaptivating, and exciting. But it stops there. Season three was just awful. The storyline didn't match the same level as prior seasons."
309,"OMG, this TV Show is unbelievable, This show just seems to be better and better and for someone that loves any good Thriller, Horror, Drama all rolled up into one,"
310,"Deeply dark and often disturbing. With beautiful and thoughtful cinematography as well as articulate dialogue. Certainly, not for the faint of heart."
311,This psychological thriller... Is way beyond our imagination...!!... Too good
312,"The many things that this show has done so well will hold up many years from now. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is sublime. If you dislike drama this show is for you, if you like drama this show is for you. So many elements to appreciate here, horror, intrigue, and dare i say...love? Top notch and underrated but you will enjoy taking a bite out of these 3 seasons..bon appetite."
313,The most beautiful show I have ever witnessed. Pure perfection.
314,"One of the greatest series ever made, there is no discussion about it. What mesmerizes me the most is the the writing which is not only complex dialogue but how the story evolves through the episodes just like the characters, such as Will Graham who had the best character development I have seen on TV in a very long time."
315,"If this show was made today it would not have been cancelled because it is clearly ahead of its time not only in the writing and visuals but the whole base of the show which is the relationship between Hannibal and Graham that alludes to good and evil, which with greatly written character development we can see that clearly there's no real good. I hope this gets picked up from cancellation soon, I believe that today people are ready for a fourth and more seasons of Hannibal."
316,"I am still struggling to believe a series like this was aired five years ago and has not received the amount of appreciation it deserves yet. Honestly, this whole piece is ahead of its time in terms of visuals and of course, writing. I believe the writing is the strongest point of this show. The relationship build between Hannibal (evil) and Will Graham (good? evil?) were so complex and so well developed, and the outstanding acting? cheff kiss."
317,"I believe that the reason this show lost massive viewership (including mine), and wasn't renewed for a 4th season is because Season 3 destroyed the balance between reality and fiction. I'll explain, what was so compelling about seasons 1 & 2 was that the show maintained a deeply unsettling psychological and imaginative undertone, but the storyline was moving forward and evolving. Simply put; there was enough action and gorey events to keep us excited and entertained, and enough oniric and metaphorical elements to hypnotize our senses and engage our intellect.
Season 3 lost it's way, as it seems to take place in a dream-like place where nobody stays true to form, nothing is what it seems, and everyone lives in their own head... it's like they all died at the end of season 2, and now reside in their own version of Dante's Inferno (Hell) . Just as the writers lost interest and checked out; we simply didn't care about what happened to the characters anymore."
318,"I gave the first 2 seasons 9/10 or higher.Amazing. Recommend them to anyone, so good!Season 3 is just talking. One of the most boring shows I've seen. On episode 8, and thinking of just giving in."
319,"Quite a few dark scenes which it was difficult to see what was happening
Couldn't stop watching it even though it was so strange at times - mesmerising"
320,Not being a fan of horror nor gore I did not expect to enjoy as much as I did. I watched it last year and it is still in my mind how gorgeous and terrifying this is! Simply wonderful and memorable.
321,How Bryan Fuller did this I don't know but it is amazing each and every part of it. The horror walking side by side with beauty and evil and good hand by hand. Beautiful.
322,"As a person who is not fond of gore and thriller shows, this one really blew my mind and changed my perception of what a well written show should be. A huge bonus is the complex relationship between Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter and these questions of what is good and evil. Absolutely amazing."
323,I am a big fan of crime series. This is one of the best series in the world I loved it every episode. Do watch it do watch it man don't don't skip this series it's the best series cannibalism.
324,This show covers almost everything! It doesn't directly give you all the answers.. with aesthetically pleasing scenes and metaphorical expressions of wills hallucinations just sucks you into the fannibal fandom!
325,"This show quite possibly changed my life. I instantly fell in love and got thrown into the deep end. I wish everyone would give this a chance! It is extremely bingable and there is only 39 episodes so it is not overwhelming. The editing is amazing, the filmography is beautiful, the actors are incredible, the characters are believable and I love them all in their own ways. Please give this show a chance, I BEG OF YOU. I cried frequently, out of excitement and sadness the season 2 and 3 finales especially. The chemistry between Hugh and Mads is electric. The stories are complex and entertaining and the 45 minute episodes FLY by."
326,"I have only seen the first episode so far. The story is intriguing and well done. Most of the characters are played well enough.I do have a major gripe about Hannibal Lecter tho... Hannibal is supposed to speak loudly,distinctly and hypnotically. He loves the sound of his own voice. The fella they have playing him mumbles and apparently doesn't speak English well at all. Bad Bad Choice for Hannibal. Sure he looks odd enough but it's the voice that makes you want to listen to Hannibal... I get that shows are running on low budgets these days. This was just a bad casting decision all around. The Graham character is pretty interesting at least. I doubt it will be enough to carry a show about Hannibal.These reviews that are half a page long are so obviously paid people as well... shame on you."
327,"Unrealistic dialoguesI feel cringe always when they overuse psychological terms, everytime they state how smart and special graham without actually being smart or special."
328,"I was wary of how the novel 'Red Dragon' was going to be portrayed as a TV series. But after only 3 episodes I am totally in awe of the adaptation and the wonderful acting. So far, 'Hannibal' has been deliciously intriguing and entertaining.The main cast selection is quite remarkable...each character and actor fluidly blend with it each other. The overall dialog is also very intelligent.Congratulations to Bryan Fuller for developing this series and many thanks to NBC for ordering a complete season. I can easily say that Hannibal is better and stronger than the other show in this time slot.Mads Mikkelsen is a natural Hannibal Lector..in a style that is different than Anthony Hopkins, but very convincing. Laurence Fishburne's character's overall temperament as an FBI profiler fits the script. Hugh Dancy as Will Graham is a great lead character...so many facets waiting to comes forth. I can't wait to see how well he works with Mikkelsen through out the series.Overall, it is an impressive presentation and I recommend it to viewers looking for something a bit different in the horror genre."
329,"I came into this series entirely by accident, simply by its name (I thought it was historical, about Hannibal Barca)but went ahead and watched anyway. It is a standard detective procedural, where you watch the good guys and bad guy maneuver around each other to build suspense for a climactic showdown. In the meantime the stories are part CSI, part Numb3rs, part whatever else they show 20x per week on primetime.While none of the characters are who you'd want to spend time with, they're certainly entertaining to watch, and the stories are entertaining as well, given how well-trod the entire genre is.I docked it a point for 2 things: 1)When the main guy goes into his ""trance"" the amount of loud throbbing sub-bass and the amount of time it lasts is really irritating. You could turn down the sound, but inevitably the next scene is someone having a quiet dialog and then you miss something. 2) Only 2 episodes in and they went for the cheap pulp-theology bit along the lines of 'God must love killing, He kills lots of people every day'. Fine, whatever. It just sounded less like the character and more like a Hollywood screenwriter trying to sound badass and edgy.All in all, this is a fine watch-it-when-it's-on series, but if you miss a week, don't hang yourself over it."
330,"""Hannibal"" is a rare gem in the realm of broadcast TV drama. The last decade everyone has been looking to cable for quality, thought provoking TV dramas, HBO and AMC being the leaders of the pack producing a long line of excellent shows. However now it seems that broadcast has found footing and is starting to release shows able to take the fight to the cable channels. No doubt that ""Hannibal"" is among the greatest current dramas on broadcast and a prime example of how far broadcast has come.The first 3 minutes of the pilot will blow anyone away, it is the best opening to a show since LOST's famous pilot episode, we are wasting no time and are quickly getting acquainted with the rather unnerving powers of Will Graham. But as his ""powers"" are turning from a tool he uses to solve crime into a manifestation that threatens to render him incapable of working with the FBI it becomes clear that he needs professional help. Hannibal is hired as Will's Psychiatrist to help him cope with the heinous crimes that he is trying to solve. The two form a unique partnership, Will the intelligent yet weirdly naive, unrefined and simple man versus Hannibal the equally intelligent but extremely well versed in etiquette, inter-human behavior and manipulation. If Hannibal thought Will would be an unfit opponent intellectually he has mistaken, Will is very much up to the task and that is what makes the show so great. The show does not have the rating it deserve, but there are a plethora of reasons for this. The show is airing during the TV graveyard on Friday evenings. It has a little known main cast to Americans (except for Laurence Fishburne, who does a great job). It is based on a book/movie franchise (which rarely does well in TV adaptions, omit GoT). And the marketing by NBC has been, what should we say, less than adequate. However the show has backing from European companies, so I hope that NBC can live with the reduced revenue from advertisers due to the ratings as they can to some extent rely on their overseas backing to keep down cost of the production. Hopefully Hannibal will keep getting renewed so we get a chance to see Bryan Fuller's exciting plan for the show come into fruition. It is a stunning show, an excellent acting (Mads Mikkelsen is nothing less than brilliant as the title character), disturbing murder-of-the-week episodes, and the source material is so abundant that the show should have quality material for years.Keep it cool NBC, you have a cult classic in your hands, don't waste the opportunity."
331,"What makes it a great show? Some could say the acting, some could say the story... I for one, agree, but that's not what makes it great. It's not what makes it one of the best shows to ever grace television. There are tons of shows that have fantastic acting and engrossing stories. Hannibal goes beyond that. This show is grotesque and beautiful all at once. Soothing and unnerving. Civilized and savage. One of the things that makes it amazing is how it delves into the psychology of killers. It's a show about the titular character while being about everything BUT him. It's about Will. It's about Jack. It's about the other killers the show revolves around. The cinematography of this show is nothing short of art. The imagery of the Stag and of Will's ""...this is my design"" flashbacks are things of beauty. I have never seen a show that made bloody, unmerciful murder and death look beautiful, and yet, here it is. Then, there is the cannibal aspect of the show. The fact that Hannibal Lecter is a highly intelligent and sordidly disturbed psychopath, he serves up his kills to Jack and Will in highly imaginative and gastronomic ways. One of the more disturbing scenes was with Able Gideon (played by the ever amazing Eddie Izzard﻿) being served a last meal of... well... I don't want to spoil it. Even then, the dinner looked worthy of a Michelin Star. This show is intelligent, it is artful, it is unique. The fact that this show is uncertain of renewal is an insult to the creators, cast, and crew. Watch this show. There really is nothing better on TV."
332,"Hated the premise, prepared to hate the show, failed. This makes Homeland look like 24 in terms of U.S. TV development.Finally we can see the gray that exists between black and white... and it's mysterious.Two characters equally opposed in almost mythological terms but also connected.The two leads are in a class of their own, their interactions are some of the finest acting I've seen on TV.I understand the show can't keep at that intensity level so we drop down to Crawford & Bloom, that's fine.But... the full episode 4 which I saw tonight, was the edit for the U.S. based on respect for the viewers? Glaringly awful CSI scenes? Stilted dialog?That episode is actually still my favorite so far, it's that good.Hannibal has great cinematography, a great script, great direction, some great performances, great score and sound design, great editing.It's uh, great."
333,"This is not your normal network show and that's a good thing, however it's probably too much and over there head for the typical network viewer that is use to brainless, zero content, non-thought provoking programs. It's very cerebral and I can see this series developing a cult following. It's certainly a pretty risky program to air on public TV at a prime time hour, it has a very graphic nature to it normal reserved for R rated movie theaters.It's not a good program during multitasking (if you do, you'll hate it). You actually have to really watch it and listen the entire hour with both ears and both eyes which could be it's downfall.So far (ep. 3) this series is on par with with good European series like Wallander, Luther, Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, Criminal Justice (UK)......etc.While I'm not into to slice and dice horror content, this series has been a pleasant surprise and I have to applaud NBC for airing it. Now let's see if NBC can hold on to it's integrity and let the writers continue to write it the way it was intended and not bow down to hurried ratings and change/speed it up/dumb it down the orig writing to appease the ones who don't get it. If they do it will fail. It is a bit gruesome and nightmare prone but then again it's needs to be to fit the storyline.I can understand while some hate it and don't understand it but then again this series was not intended for everyone to like but I think it will be popular in time but we shall see."
334,"Glad this show was cancelled. Was constantly asking myself ""why do I continue to binge the rest of these episodes?"" but like with all other shows during this pandemic, it's the only thing you're really allowed to be doing.Theres dialogue that makes you laugh that's supposed to be serious or dark. Especially the episode of the human totem pole.Will as a character is a joke. Why did this character replace the leading role of Claurice? How did anyone remotely think a stuttering nimrod with major psychotic breaks could be a ""teacher"" at the fbi? And who gave the actor the direction to annunciate words like he was chewing air?And these serial killers somehow make massive artwork of tons of humans without anyone ever noticing?This show is a joke like AHS- always attempting to shock you but never really accomplishing that feat."
335,"Without doubt without Mads Mikkelsen this show would not tick all of the boxes it wants to tick...the dark, psychological thriller boxes. He is just an amazing actor and whenever he comes on the screen thought processes change from Hannibal being an ordinary crime show, to Hannibal being a show about a man who hides in plain sight. I mean the story lines are great, as well, and the plot leaves no stone unturned-it is just a great show, a must watch. I have seen the comparisons to my favorite show in the world, Dexter, however, this psychological thriller, that makes you think about your own actions, like Dexter, cannot be compared to it. Hannibal is not as relatable as Dexter, rather, he is a dark character, that's it. Please watch and rate highly, 8.4 isn't good enough..."
336,"I'm not as enthusiastic about this show as I was when it first started. The acting is very good even though the director lets some of the actors, especially Hugh Dancy, get a little over the top. Mads Mikkelsen is wonderful though. About half way through the season I could feel that the writers knew they were going to have to go into a second season. The story stopped advancing, went round and round, covering the same ground over and over. The good guys became either crazy, incompetent, oddly charmed by Hannibal or all of the above. I felt as though I was chewing a nastier and nastier tasting piece of gum waiting to spit it out. Finally I just erased the last two episodes - felt good. I like a story to make headway, move toward a goal, have an ending. This doesn't look like that will happen."
337,"The character of Dr. Hannibal was the only good thing in the show , so realistic and consistent.
Rest of the characters was fluctuating all over the show with unrealistic reactions , new characters entered in the episodes of the last season means that all main characters lost the power to land the show at a good finale so they needed support ."
338,"The plot was good at first and was a little over the top, but as you go further into the Third season the whole plot just circles and basically starts back from square one with the same gimmicks and plot armored characters that just won't go away. The main Protagonist Will Graham is the worst part of the show. His character makes the dumbest decisions and seems to just make those decisions to make the show more interesting for lack of good writing. He's supposedly this genius who can relate to Serial Killers, meanwhile he can't make a rational decision as to not be at the wrong place at the wrong time and criminalize yourself.
The rest of the cast was tasteless as well and could care less about any of them. Hard pass on this one."
339,"Season 1 & 2 are good but they should have stop there.
Season 3 is terrible. Visually it's still beautiful but acting is bad and scenario is awful."
340,"First off All Em not a Big fan for this type of Shows where a lot Blood and contain violence.. Still I watched this show Due to Mads Mikkelsen..His acting is good, I have its movies , specially Casino Royale :) As i started to watch this show, Its really boring and its hard find interest in this TV show, but after few episodes i find some interest in it.The show carries a weight that draws you into the imagery and dialogue and keeps you locked in until the end of the season..The first season is OK but the second is WOW.. So much thrill and drama.. And I love the chemistry between Hannibal and Will.Highly recommended it if u are looking for a clever and engaging physiological thriller...!!"
341,"This show is not normal at all...I have never seen a show which contains so many sentences that makes think what they mean, and when you figure out each one, you will love it.Amazing performance, crazy scenes which comes by surprise, very unpredictable storyline(for me) and dialogs that will stay with you long after the episode...By the way: this show has connection to the movies of Hannibal, but not the same at all, so no worries.bottom line: if you are into complicated, not easy to watch shows... this is for you."
342,"It's a dream come true of mine making a spin off show of the 'Hannibal movie franchise, my favourite movies and Bryan Fuller made my dream come true. The main cast are Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lector, Hugh Dancy as Will Graham and Lawrence Fishburne as Jack Crawford. The whole cast was outstanding. after watching Anthony Hopkins and i always said no one can play a Hannibal Lector besides him. and Mads really pulled off. he was brilliant.this show is a masterpiece and it's art. The series slowly brings in other characters from the movie in the series and if you've seen the movies it gets you excited seeing characters from the movies. it makes the show more fun. its one of the only shows that never get bad. every episode is good. and it gets better and better each season. if you haven't watched it yet and looking for a show to start. watch this one. its a must watch.thank you Bryan Fuller."
343,"the season finale was a great ending,lots of fan think they both died but the series was canceled half way the season and the creator had a season 4 and last season in mind with silence of the lambs ,but either way we all know that in movies and books Hannibal never gets caught a second time ,as we see during the credits Gillian Anderson aka Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier,was a dinner table eating her own leg waiting for him to show,just like will warn her he will come for you after this is done.the relationship of will and Hannibal was what made this show so great ,the only concern i have is did will made it ? overall I'm glad it was not a terrible cliffhanger ,i wish netflix would do at least a 6 part series finale as the creator of the show intended but i think he knew this masterpiece was not for everyone and end the 3 season in a way it can end there"
344,"In short - I can't even remember the last crime drama horror Show I've watched except for - "" True Detective "". I have watched few episodes of Dexter but never caught my eye to keep watching... that being said- this is the best series in its genre I ever watched.. It seems like the small percentage of more intelligent population will like this more and get attracted to this, than a show like "" Dexter "" which compared to this is like a little baby - Honestly... It is so dark , scary , intelligent, well-made and well-acted that going from one episode to the next was extremely easy... Be warned though - there is a lot of blood and gore from the start and till the end...."
345,"I thought this series would resemble the movies too much but there is hardly any resemblance except for Hannibal being his subtle horrific self.Hannibal is the same character as in the movies,but in the series he is a trustworthy and renowned psychiatrist AND an adviser of the FBI which makes everybody believes him.Or, he coerces them into believing him by the occasional drugging,manipulation and/or killing,that is just brilliant.An ingenious feature of Hannibal is,that he himself also visits his own psychiatrist weekly.Let's not forget Will Graham's character who is vital to the story line: mentally unstable adviser of the FBI who feels what the perpetrators did to their victims and why; sublimely acted!The way the story is being told is magnificent: you,the person who watches,know a lot of horrifying info,but the characters do not.Step by step they find out, or not,under the influence of Hannibal.The overall storyline of Horrific Hannibal combined with the separate cases of bizarre serial killers works very well.The limitless imagination of the writers is admirable. Even the episodes in which not much is happening,there is always an eerie ambiance.Acting/story/music/filming = sublime,props to the creators!"
346,"Great article http://fifaworldcup2014livescores.com/ this article i just so awesome, this will have a great impart on peoples mind.I don't normally review TV shows, but after seeing the pilot of Hannibal, I am compelled. As the (arguably) foremost monster of all time, Hannibal Lechter still fascinates and appalls us at the same time. His suave, debonair demeanor and taste, combined with his overwhelming brilliance makes him the most attractive monster since Dexter (or Gary Oldman in Dracula). So it was with great expectations and serious doubts that I approached NBC's Hannibal. After all, besides praising the Obama administration, what does NBC do well? I was very pleasantly surprised.Hugh Dancy (Will Graham) and Mads Mikkelson (Hannibal) are great. As they work together on the current case, they are probing each other's psyche and working to establish control, command, dominance over the other (naturally more on Dr. Lechter's part that Will's). In a take off on Dexter, Dr. Lechter is part of the team the FBI has brought in to help solve the latest serial killer problem. What is always compelling about Hannibal is that he always is in control. He has thought out how he will proceed, how he will step in the water closely with those who would naturally want to stop him in his curious habits, yet while always being able to protect himself. (Another good example of this is Anthony Hopkins in Fracture - if you haven't seen it, you should)."
347,"Oh. My. Gosh.Oh how can a show simultaneously have me riveted to my seat and yet want to run screaming from the room? That's Hannibal.Full disclosure: I've never seen ""Silence of the Lambs."" I do, however, know the basic story. And I've seen clips, of course. I believe this series is based on a book called Red Dragon, which is written by the same author as Silence of the Lambs. Red Dragon is a movie, too. But I've not seen it, either. Hannibal would seem to be a sort of re-imagining of what happens prior to Red Dragon. It's set anachronistically, much closer to the present time, than the book(s) were set. I think that anyone familiar with the books or movies likely needs to suspend disbelief and just go with it.Anyway, this is to tell you that I've come in cold to this series. I started seeing ads for it (during another fantastic re-imagining of well-known characters -- Dracula) and so via On Demand watched as much of the second season as I could. I'd not seen the first season and was admittedly confused at first as to when this was taking place. ""How is Hannibal out of prison?"" I kept wondering. Then I got it, this takes place prior to Silence of the Lambs.So I've seen seven or maybe eight episodes of the second season, and (sadly) none of the first. You're probably wondering what gives me the idea I can write any sort of review? My answer is ""I dunno,"" other than I think you (yes you!) should be watching it. Why? Well.. this is darned good television. In the most recent episode Hannibal forces someone KNOWINGLY eat his own thigh (there is an amazing line there... something about the victim being invited to his own last supper), and I find myself being stupefied that such a scene could even be on TV. They are pushing the envelope here. It literally made me feel faint, and sick, at the same time.In the same episode one of the many shrinks we encounter in the stories, Dr. Chilton (played by the amazing, wonderful, brilliant Raúl Esparza) for the first time (maybe?) calls him Hannibal the Cannibal and you can't help but have your blood run cold (by the way -- Dr. Chilton is pretty darned creepy too, and if you enjoy this actor in SVU, you'll be amazed at how different he is in Hannibal. Kudos!).There is an overwhelming sense of the darkest kind of danger here. Horrible things happen to the people who suspect Hannibal, or who get in his way (even those who don't suspect him get served human meat). Dr. Chilton is terrified and yet, like many, drawn to Hannibal like a moth is drawn to an open flame. There is some serious jeopardy here... as we saw when one of the main characters (Beverely Katz) gets brutally (oh so brutally!) killed, vivisected, and displayed by Hannibal.It is almost, but not quite, too much...It is not too much... it is worth watching, for many reasons. The music is fabulous. The sets are unbelievably beautiful. The scenes surrounding the preparation of food by Hannibal are works of art. It is beautiful, slow, exquisite film making.And the acting! Mads Mikkelsen is a Danish actor and a national treasure. He's absolutely riveting as Hannibal. It is a feat of casting brilliance to have him play the role. He is sexy and yet disgusting. A strange, bizarre combination. But then the entire series is strange and bizarre. Hannibal is refined, intellectual, talented, beautiful. He is a gourmet ('natch!). He composes music. You want to laugh and yet... it's really not funny at all what is going on here. It's terrifying.A British actor, Hugh Dancy, plays Will Graham (honestly, is there no end to these fantastic British imports?!). Will is a troubled (to say the least!) FBI profiler who has fallen into Dr. Lechter's sphere. Having missed the first season, I fear I don't yet have a good feeling for the entirety of Will's character. He seems to be quite torn apart by his singular ability to empathize with serial killers. At the start of the second season, Will is in prison (falsely accused) and clearly is suspecting that Hannibal is much more than he seems. Other major characters are slowly coming to the same realization. The question here is will they survive their enlightenment.The imagery is something to behold. The plot and progression is slow if not cumbersome, but that seems okay as it is such a weird, twisted, joy to watch these episodes. And while it is tempting to use the analogy that Hannibal is playing all the other characters as he would play pieces of a chess game -- it feels like what is going on here that he is instead composing some sort of great, symphonic, work of music and manipulating all the other players as he does the notes of music on his composition pad. When he scratches out a note... oh boy.There is a lot of craziness in this show. And like Rhys Meyers' Dracula, it feels a bit perverse to like it so much. I mean, just because I think Hannibal is sexy and sort of erotic doesn't mean I support his serial killing nor his cannibalism. Right? The fact that this airs on Friday nights is worrisome. I suspect NBC is shuffling it off toward an early grave (no pun intended). What a pity if so.I believe episode titles are taken from types of sushi. Since I'm a vegetarian, I guess I don't have to worry about the next time I go out to eat. But if I wasn't, I'm not sure I'd ever look at sashimi the same again."
348,"Marked by a great performance by Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He pulls off the slightness of Lecter's subtle bravado and terrifying grace with great skill. One has to consider that the role has been synonymous with Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character since ""Silence of the Lambs"" to the re-polished ""Red dragon"". I've not read Thomas Harris' anthology of the erudite killer cannibal, but I've been coaxed even further into doing so by this series. The series itself is an entirely fictionalized prelude to the Lecter series' first book, ""Red dragon"", where the troubled Special Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), with a knack for immersing himself with the killers' psyche at the cost of his well-being, is influenced by Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) to take on the case of solving a series of grisly murders and eventually involved with the brilliant psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose role is to monitor Graham's progress as well as psychological health during the arduous trials he faces. The series moves slow, but this isn't to be seen as a crutch. I find that the character development and the relationship between Lecter and Graham to be at the core of what makes this show great. The complexity and dynamics of their characters and relationship is pulled off with seeming ease and fluidity which is the mark of convincing and skilled production. Although the series consciously drives the parallel storyline on and slightly askew to what is deemed friendly to the continuity of the books and coupling with ""Red Dragon"" (the character Miriam Lass is introduced as a substitute for the Will Graham of the book) I find that I do not mind it being elaborated upon. As long as the series will not suffer from the problem of prolix and pleonasm, as so many American TV series do these days, and exercise restraint in furthering a series just because it is a cash-cow I will find this show intriguing for some time to come. I am looking forward to season 2."
349,"Hugh Dancy does an excellent job as Will Graham. The only thing I remember him from is Evening with wife Claire Danes, and while he was great there too this is quite something else! Mikael Madds seemed an unlikely Hannibal to me - mostly because when I think of Hannibal I think of a role immortalized by Anthony Hopkins. But setting aside the traditional Hannibal Lecter image he does a very good job. He's less obviously deranged, more business-like, and lacks the horrific grin that made The Silence of the Lambs one of the scariest thrillers of the nineties. He gives a very polished performance, which works for the Hannibal in this universe. The entire series is full of gore and aberrant violence, but is so ultra-polished in its execution it lacks the grimy dirtiness of having a job like Graham's (Dancy). That being said all in all it is a very entertaining, very gruesome, and very intense show. An addictive watch, definitely not having me look at my own watch. Roll on season 2. And watch out for Eddie Izzard in a bizarre, alien role. He's one of the highlights - part of a league of older actors who do surprisingly dark projects."
350,"Not being a fan of any of the Hannibal films or in excessive gore in TV/film I was surprised to find myself becoming intrigued and in the series.It is not without its flaws, after 5 or 6 episodes it seems the crimes get a bit random and I felt it lost my interest a bit around here, not really doing a good job of linking it to the story on the whole.Character wise, Will Graham is an excellent character for the most part, a likable main character with great depth in his story and you have empathy for him towards the end of the series. Saying that I found it a tad annoying how much it focuses and i'd say over plays his situation in the last few episodes.Mad Mikkelsen as Hannibal was great casting although I did find it hard to pick up what he was saying at some points with the thick accent.Laurence Fishburne is much as you would expect, plays his role well.Alana Bloom and Will Graham relationship works well due to the chemistry between the pair on screen.The characters of Jimmy Price and Brian Zeller (two of the forensic scientists) are terrible and annoying, it seems they are meant to portray some kind of comedy role which doesn't fit at all in the series.Good watch, can't wait for the next series to see how the rest of the characters develop, recommended"
351,"When I first saw the advertisements for this, I will admit I was a little skeptical about a Hannibal television show. I proceeded to look up to see Bryan Fuller who not only created three shows I loved: Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, and Pushing Daisies which all ended way to soon. I love this show, I personally haven't watched Red Dragon, so I can not say if the characters are portrayed spot on to the movie. I can say that I love these characters, Mads Mikkelsen is an excellent choice to play Mr. Lecter. I hope this show does not go the same fate as Bryan Fuller's other projects, it would be so great to see these characters play out."
352,"The best tv show that was ever made and best cooking show , nothing I would say would describe my feelings towards the show but its massively good , brilliant"
353,"Hannibal portrays Will's descent into madness/insanity very well. Often times I find dream sequences to be cliche tropes that are rarely done well. Because of this I generally prefer them to be absent from cinema because movies/shows seem to have such a difficult time using these dream sequences to their greatest advantage (simply a personal preference, which I'm sure plenty of people disagree with). This show's dream sequences, however, are fundamental, and add to the increasing sense of Will's loss of sanity, and normalcy. The surrealist imagery constantly has me questioning the nature of its reality, am I watching something happening during a dream or not?They cast Hannibal, and the supporting actors around him very well. The cinematography is great. The entire vibe of the show works well to portray a synergistic look into the mind of Hannibal and the other characters.Overall I have binged it, but I will say this, it is a difficult show to binge. Being constantly submerged into this vat of insanity is honestly difficult to do. It is perhaps the first show I've had to momentarily step away from, not because I'm bored, but because of how truly unnerving it is. It is perhaps one of the most unsettling, unnerving shows I've seen."
354,"I went into the series not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised as to how great the writing is. I have to admit I tend to root for he bad guys in movies or shows, so you can imagine I love this series. I just wish it was longer than 3 seasons."
355,"All aspects of this show, I absolutely love, from the perspectives of each individual major roles, and how much artworks from food to human bodies. I'm only on season two and I wish this show has more than just 3 seasons. Hope they bring it back."
356,"The makers completely lost it while making season 3. A murder suspense psychological thriller became a mystery and fictional / philosophical I dont know what.
Honestly I feel that Meds Mickelsen was a miscast. May be coz no one can play Hannibal Lector better than Anthony Hopkins, or may be he was too good looking for the role and also he didn't do justice acting as Lector.Disappointing end to what could have been a fascinating series."
357,"I couldn't have enjoyed this more, I can't recommend it enough only saddened that It's come to an end after 3 series but it ended as it started uncompromising and creative. The cast is fantastic and all contribute without carrying each other in any of the scenes, the narrative the whole way through is well thought out with great vision. Loved it."
358,"People write bad reviews and give it 1/10 after seeing 1 or 2 episodes. Come on, at least watch the first season before you critique the show.Some of the reviewers criticize the frequent visions/dreams of the black stag and that Will Graham isn´t able to see, who Hannibal really is. Those reviewers didn´t get it at all. The black stag IS Hannibal, Will Grahams subconscious constantly confronts him with these visions to remind him, that there is something wrong in his environment. Hannibals psychiatric methods and his distinguished mask prevent Will from uncovering the truth.
 
The show is incredibly well produced, the dialogue between Hannibal and his potential victims are well written. Mads Mikkelsen is a fantastic actor. His cold, analytical look, when his Patient Franklin puts a used tissue on his designer table gives me the chills every time. You can see in his eyes and his subtle facial expression, that he plans to put Franklin on his menu because he despises Franklins thoughtless action... The other actors are great as well, especially Laurence Fishburne as Jack Crawford, Caroline Dhavernas as vulnerable psychiatrist Alana Bloom and Gillian Anderson in a guest role as Hannibals involuntary psychiatrist. Hugh Dancy tries his best to express the mental problems and internal conflicts of Will Graham.
 
Some people may find the series boring, but in my opinion it is finest psychological horror. The music and sound effects of Brian Reitzell are perfect for the series, generating a constant uncomfortable feeling. In rare moments Will can find a peaceful place in his mind, which is underlined by a beautiful piano melody from Reitzell.The directors, cinematographers and visual effects are creating equally haunting and beautiful images, the scenes in Hannibals office are prime examples for excellent set design and lighting.There is much gore and violence in this series, but these scenes don´t overshadow the subtle psychological horror. In one Scene (season 2) Hannibal drugs Mason Verger and manipulates him to cut of parts of his face and feed them to Wills Dogs, which is equally visually and psychologically disturbing. Various scenes showing Hannibal preparing gourmet meals using human organs, while listening to classical music capture the essence of Hannibals hedonistic, narcistic personality.In my opinion Hannibal is a successful reinvention and way better than every Lecter movie, that came out after The Silence of the lambs. Hopkins Hannibal is an imprisoned Psychopath without regrets for his deeds or any regards for other humans. Watching Mikkelsen as respected psychiatrist, who constantly manipulates everyone around him is not less frightening.AND NOW I´D LIKE YOU TO DRAW A CLOCK..."
359,"I rarely give 10 out of 10 stars. As a matter of fact, I only did this 2 times before ""Hannibal"".10 stars... What a truly wonderful show! 
Brutal yet sensitive. Gruesome yet artful. Highly intellectual, yet a careful homage to human fallacy. Love and hate depicted as an eternal dance of indistinguishable partners. IMPRESSIVE soundtrack, surrealistic, intricate plot, dialogues covering psychology, philosophy, art and history...And last but not least: breathtaking performances of Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy, Gillian Anderson, Rutina Wesley and so many more..."
360,"I would be lying if i say this show is not disappointing, with all that they had in their hands they could have made a masterpiece which would have stayed on TV making a name for itself in the league for the best TV shows.The good: The show has one of the best visuals i have ever seen and a very fitting soundtrack. The casting is very well done , all the characters are very well acted to say the least if not very well written, with major kudos in picking Mads as Dr Lecter. The murders are twisted and gory as would be expected from a show called Hannibal with each crime significantly different and twisted as compared than the previous. The Bad: Notice i said crime in the ""Good"" above as the crime is interesting the solution to find the criminal is utterly bland. The story is very poorly written , there is hardly any character development. Will Graham is supposed to be smart but the way he is presented he might as well be psychic, which is why even though the visual presentation is fantastic it effectively makes him appear like a psychic. There is no connecting the evidence no creating a profile of the killer. It feels like writing the answer to the math problem without actually showing the work. How you get there is very important in a show about psychology.
I am still watching it in hopes that it will pick up and start patching the holes in the story that could make it an interesting watch but so far haven't seen any. The more you watch the less sense the story starts to make. The direction it is going so far after 5-6 episodes i am not surprised it got cancelled.
I would love a reboot by someone else , possibly by people behind Netflix's Mindhunter because atleast they are jumping in the psychology which this show seems to miss so much.
I will still finish the show because its just 3 seasons and there might some good things around the corner (i doubt it but i have to know)"
361,"The first season of Hannibal wasn't bad — it was intriguing to see the story retold and re-imagined. The cases that Will Graham, Jack Crawford, Hannibal and their team work on are gruesome and novel. For fans of the films, the odd nod via score and dialogue felt like Easter eggs, although occasionally the lines didn't quite fit the circumstances.Season Two was okay. It was great to see the introduction of Mason Verger, knowing what was to become of him. It was also appealing that the fates of certain characters were different from what happens in the books and movies.The special effects are brilliant. The effects guys and production designers must really enjoy themselves. I was disappointed when I heard the show was struggling to get recommissioned for a fourth season, BUT after watching the first two episodes of Season Three, I understood why. If they contained any more filler I could use them to grout the bathroom!Dull, slow and increasingly pretentious. So much slow-mo that you could go for a toilet break and not miss anything. Daydream sequence after daydream sequence, which do nothing to progress the story and only succeed in padding out each episode. I'm not sitting down to watch an art instillation, so please give me some story! Also, the arty dream sequences have so much gore that they drastically reduce the impact of the real murders and atrocities caused by the psychopaths. Hugh Dancy is fairly one-note (this might be his acting but it's more down to how his character is written, I would have thought). I like Mads Mikkelsen as an actor but in Hannibal I find his style a little too minimalist and very often incomprehensible. He also lacks the menace that he showed he is able to display in Casino Royale. He doesn't have to do an Anthony Hopkins-style turn, but Hopkins proves that there's so much more you can do with Lecter. Gillian Anderson seems to be there because she's got nowhere else to be - not a slight on her acting, but her character only serves as a pretension partner for Hannibal in lengthy, poetic, uninteresting discussions about psychology. Laurence Fishburne is fine as Jack Crawford (although the subplot featuring his wife is boring), Raúl Esparza is very good as Dr Chiltern, Michael Pitt makes a decent Mason Verger (although why he felt the need to mimic Gary Oldman's voice so closely is a mystery) and Caroline Dhavernas has great presence as Dr Bloom. Two pieces of casting are way off-track: Scott Thompson and Eddie Izzard (who CANNOT do an American accent). There are times when those with a natural humour can add a lot to their roles and the mood of a show. This is not one of those times. AND ENOUGH WITH THE STAG MOTIF, ALREADY! It was getting tired when it turned up in every other scene of the first two seasons - it can stop now!"
362,"I've watched this from the beginning, and was intrigued from the start -- the first two seasons were really good! ...then the 3rd Season came. What a huge disappointment! Sure, visually, it's very cinematic -- perhaps even too much so for TV -- but the dialogue became very distracting in its streaming of pithy little sound bites. I've been struggling for a while to come up with the right words to describe it: it's like streaming overly-dramatic one-liners together to make up a sentence. Terribly distracting!Then there's the utter confusion, the warping of space/time that Einstein would've been proud of witnessing. That was always the initial hook of the series, through Will, but it took a whole new level this season -- enough to be just utterly confusing and, honestly, less fun. So, while I've enjoyed the first couple seasons, and, have been struggling thru the last season, I see no other way for this series to end but by overproduction suicide: over-thinking it to death."
363,"season 1 + 2 were awesome as others have said. as for season 3 first 4 episodes i was walking away for it felt like they didn't know what to do with the show but from episode 4 -8 so far it brings the story together, and i have just fell in love with the show again! I love the acting it is top class and i cannot believe the show has been cancelled. Just stick with season 3 get over the first few episodes and you will agree with me!! I love the way the story is going and would like to see it picked up by one of the other companies it would work really well on netflix. I give this show a good 8.3 out of ten. So people start watching and hope someone gets this show back on air!"
364,"As i sit here now listening to the final score of the finale of Season 2 (Bach's Goldberg Variations), i am reminded of just how great the music was in this tour de force in television making. The music is an integral part of this show and credit should be lavished upon Brian Reitzell as the soundtrack is nothing less than exceptional. I must confesses that it has been nearly a year since i watched the climactic end of Hannibal but with pictures being released of the third season i felt compelled to write a review. The show, in my eyes is nothing short of a masterpiece (sort of..), and here's why: The first thing that really catches your eye when viewing the show is the sleek cinematic techniques applied to each episode. Attention to detail on screen is noticeable and fitting given the meticulous nature of the main protagonists. The lighting is visceral and builds emotion perfectly and the camera angles and editing are as sharp as one of Dr.Lectures cooking knives. The acting truly is sublime, Mads Mikkelsen is on career defining form throughout, playing Hannibal superbly. In my eyes it took a while to warm to Hugh Dancy's character Will Graham, however as the episodes rolled on attachment and sentiment towards the character was established. Laurence Fishburne was tough (tough enough to make it into season 3..) and played Jack Crawford with integrity. A surprise character that grew throughout season 2 was Gillian Anderson's Dr.Bedelia Du Maurier an exciting character which will most defiantly be playing a crucial role in Hannibal's narrative in season 3. Finally, as mentioned in my opening gambit the music really is the standout aspect of this show. At times it becomes like it's own character, perfectly taking the audience through a roller coaster of emotions. Often leaving me on the edge of my seat, with the lights firmly switched on as the dark and emotive scenes unravel.I would seek caution in 'binge' watching this TV show, allow each episode to be absorbed in the psyche, take your time with it as it is often not an easy watch. But be persistent as it is beautifully twisted."
365,"Initially, I was a bit skeptical about Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal. Mikkelsen's performance was a bit inconsistent in the first episode(the pilot). The cold calculative demeanor, which we normally expect of Hannibal seemed quite forced. May be it is because, I expected Mikkelsen to reproduce Sir Hopkins' performance and as such this rigidness could be forgiven. But having said that, this was the only thing negative I could point out about Mikkelsen.Mikkelsen's portrayal as Hannibal after this initial hiccup, brilliant. I felt like having a shower, each time I watched him cook!! You have to be truly cold at heart not to feel terror and disgust each time he cooks. You have to be a true sociopath not to feel violated each time he calls for a dinner party!! Whew!!! That scene where Jack Crawford asks what the dish was and Hannibal saying it was rabbit or pork loin....I had to remind myself that this was just TV!All in all, for a connoisseur of fantasy and fiction, I must say I have not been terrified this way after watching a movie or reading a book for a long time.But,I wish the editing was a bit tighter . I could point out a few;but I will just mention this one instance of a goof up.I noticed a goof up in Season Episode 7 when Miriam with a prosthetic hand. You can clearly see Miriam's fingers on the prosthetic hand move. Well, prosthetic fingers do not move the way they moved on her."
366,"I wasn't sure about the content of this series....It has a demanding theme,it requires good acting,appropriate atmosphere and continuity and that's something quite dangerous since almost every series that has been put to the test has failed.... The first season was amazing but even better ware episodes 1-7 of the second season.The story unfolds with proper pace and the agony piles up.The situation skyrockets and you are left at the edge of your sit. The next episodes put me off a bit cause they were distant from what had happened right before and the situations were hard to keep up with....They were a bit surreal.You couldn't put yourself ""in there"" and feel what was going on cause it was too less smart and justified by the characters personalities in comparison to what we had seen up to that point....That though,didn't last long as in the last episodes everything return almost to their previous brilliance.I liked the end a lot but I am eager to see how they will connect the next season with it.They could have ended it right there beautifully.I hope they don't make us wish they had...."
367,"I have watched this show twice so far, and the second time was just as exciting and thrilling as the first time, or even better. Films empathize on psychology have always been my favorite kind, and this particular show have meet almost all the highest standards in my mind. Some think that it doesn't fit the the Hannibal character in those films or novels made before, but if you put that aside,I've got to say, this show basically blows all those out of the water. The show Dexter get 8.9 and Hannibal only 8.4well this is crazy.What I want to say most though,are not the perfect taste, the dynamics between characters or how classic and elegant the show is as many viewers have already reckoned, but this, the concept of 'Empathy'. Hannibal's living a perfectly fulfilling life based on his outstanding intelligence, considering his taste and interest are intolerable by the society. But the existence of a person with the capacity of understanding him, a troubled individual between the dark side and the moral values rooted in himself, a kind of struggle Hannibal don't have yet could comprehend, get him involved in a series of contingencies, and thus the show began.So at some level, I love season 2 more than 1 because the interaction between the two characters got more frequent and intimate. As sophisticated as Hannibal, he couldn't resist the inclination of intimacy, or more bluntly, of not being alone. But it got him weak, at least at some point, which led to a somewhat tragic ending of season 2.The lines, especially those only involve Will and Lecter, are so beautifully presented, so you can feel the tensions between the two characters vividly. Though it's always vague, subtle and complex in the extreme and requires strong focus, but if you give it time and think deep into it ,you'll find yourself trapped in those words and emotions and couldn't even get out.The moment I decided to write a review I found the depth of this show has somewhat beyond my expression and language skills, so I can't emphasize how much I love it. It's the perfect show in my mind."
368,"I will preface my review by stating the positive aspects of this show: - decent plot - Mads MikkelsenOh, were you expecting more? Sadly, the above-average story-line and Mikkelsen's acting are really just about the only redeeming qualities of this show. So why is Hannibal so widely revered as an example of pure television gold? Simple; the show runs under the false pretense of being deep and substantial. How could it not, when the namesake of the series is a charismatic and brilliant character that has been immortalized in cinematic history due to the sheer depth of his character? Yet, upon closer inspection of this show, you will sadly find that it just doesn't make up for the tropes, clichés, and many flaws that exist in Hannibal (the show, not the character). Let's start with the script... it's not good. There are two, and only two, distinct ""types"" of lines in this show: horribly cheesy '80s-action-film- esque lines that will make you groan, and pretentious dialogues of lightning-fast banter that aim to impress you, but are merely cover- ups for the fact that the characters lack any sort of personality. I get that these are the bright, learned minds of seasoned FBI agents, but it truly breaks the immersion when you're very much made aware that you're watching a TV show through the dialogue alone. When you aren't forced to endure the disgustingly cliché close-up-camera-shot-followed-by-dramatic-one- liner, you find yourself wondering why the characters feel the need to dress up their conversations by incessantly speaking in riddles and metaphors in an embarrassingly desperate attempt to flaunt their ""higher knowledge."" The same criticism can be applied to the acting in this show as well. Unfortunately, the acting in Hannibal (Mikkelsen excluded) might be the only thing worse than the script. Why? The actors/actresses in Hannibal make the same mistake that beginner high school theater students make: they mistake intensity for good acting. No, yelling all your lines, constantly donning the same cold, unwavering facial expression, and behaving like an angry bad-ass in every scene does not make you a good (or even mediocre) actor. Mikkelsen shines in comparison because he possesses the one quality as an actor that literally every other cast member in this show seems to lack: subtlety. Daniel Day-Lewis, Marlon Brando, Tom Hanks, etc. (a list of stellar actors, just to clarify) did not rise to stardom by ranting and raving through all their lines and shouting louder than the other guy. They did so with tact; they behaved on-screen like human beings ACTUALLY behave in real life. Simply put, their acting made you forget you were watching a movie/TV show. I'm not sure whether Mikkelsen is benefiting from this by being on the better end of a polarizing comparison, or if his career is being harmed by this show wasting his talent on an ensemble of B-list actors at best. However, despite my harsh criticisms, I will say this: this show's plot is VERY interesting. The fascinating concept of the show, coupled with appropriately-placed cliffhangers, proves to result in a flawed mess of a half-decent crime drama. Sadly, with all the glaring problems this show contains, it leaves little to enjoy on episodes where the plot may fall short."
369,"Like anyone who starts a new psychological show,i wasn't sure whether they'll portray Hannibal as the cruel being he's known to be because of NBC.But they didn't disappoint.This show will keep you on your feet watching it with anxiety like a little kid catching a glimpse on a horror movie.The cast is top class which makes the series even more watchable,and i couldn't choose a better actor to play Hannibal than Mr.Mikkelsen.The storyline is as astonishing as you would expect if you are a thriller fan.The most brutal crimes analyzed to death,and yet causing the analyzer the same amount of shock it causes you.I rate it 10/10 and hope this will go on for a long time."
370,I did not expect much of an Hannibal make over - but I have to admit that this might be very well among the TV shows I do like best this year.The story line is interesting (so far) the cast well chosen - a nice mix of well known faces and fresh faces. The photography is outstanding indeed it is so good that it easily matches cinematic standards. The dialog are interesting and providequite a bit of debts to the different characters. The gore and violence part takes up little room and do not leave me with the impression to push the adrenalin button. Well done - I am looking forward to more twists in the story - it certainly has a lot of potential!
371,"This is one of the best shows on TV right now. It is an incredible take on the Hannibal material that incorporates satisfying amounts of shock and gore. This is wrapped together with great story-telling, fantastic style, and sharp dialogue. I would recommend this to anybody who was interesting in an enthralling, exciting, intelligent TV show. The characters are well thought out and great to watch. The dynamic and chemistry between them is great as well. The show carries a weight that draws you into the imagery and dialogue and keeps you locked in until the end of every episode. Once again this is a show that I have no reserves against and one I would highly recommend to the TV enthusiast."
372,"The casting is on point, each actor-- including the extras-- excels at portraying their character in a realistic manner. Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal Lector) vs. Hugh Dancy (Will Graham)? The most promising and exciting game of Cat and Mouse on TV I've ever seen. ""Sherlock"" is a wonderful show, but where Sherlock and Moriarty's genius is practically shouted about at the audience through a megaphone, the ""Hannibal"" audience will experience Lector and Graham's. Hugh Dancy deserves an Emmy for his superior execution of Will's mentally tortured, neurotic, unconventional hero persona. The cinematography is not flashy, it's elegant, beautiful, seamless. It's not ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" mindless gore, it's a Francis Bacon oil painting, structurally wild, disturbing and intriguing to study. Discussable, not disgusting. The writing isn't predictable, isn't corny, isn't unnecessarily drawn-out to see how many season's they can squeeze out of Thomas Harris's creation. The writing is respectable, clever, three-dimensional. Watch this show."
373,"Show is great, don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the story of Hannibal Lecter, the photography is unbelievable, the cooking is top notch and you're left with such beauty that you forget the ingredients being used. But after the first 13 episodes you're left feeling like the characters are all living in a poetry book and communicate using nothing more than whispered thoughts of repetitive ideas about ""finding yourself"" that gets tiring and quite boring. Haven't seen such an annoying character unable to deal with their feelings delivering their dialogue like Will Graham, second only to Dexter's own sister Debrah Morgan. Worth the watch, it's on Netflix and most people are still home so give it a shot, great show just not excellent as most are reviewing."
374,"Making a suspense/horror/thriller series of 40 minute-long episodes that keeps your interest at all times is no easy task. Having seen ""Silence of the lambs"" with majestic Hopkins in the role of Hannibal, I couldn't really see the direction that this series would take. At first, I was wondering if it would even be worth it. Well, to my surprise, not only was it worth it but it resulted in me watching all episodes, one after the other, in what was merely a handful of sleepless nights.I am having trouble finding a starting point since there is very little (or even nothing) that I didn't find of my liking in this most excellent melting pot of quality acting, thrilling cinematography and a plot to match. Maybe I should just begin by saying that Dancy (portaying a most gifted but also haunted special agent of the feds) and Mikkelsen (portaying Hannibal) deliver upon us some gripping performances. Initially, I felt Dancy's performance slightly over-the-top, but as the show progressed, he turned those thoughts away, up until the moment when I realized he was an equal on-screen adversary of Mikkelsen.Mikkelsen is Hannibal or is Hannibal Mikkelsen? How can he ""step out"" of this role when going back home? He is probably one of the most cleverly scripted psychopaths, and Mikkelsen seems inmerged completely in his role. Top notch to say the least. The rest are of good proportional high standards, Fishburne being the third actor to stand out.In order to keep this review as short as possible, let me just mention a few parts that really took this viewing to the highest level for my standards : The dream sequences of Will Graham( Dancy ) are building up as the show progresses and become even spine-tingling. The relentless no nonsense action that keeps the episodes 40 minutes long but oh so dense. The oozing intelligence of Hannibal and the way it leads Graham into questioning his sanity. The excellent ""full-frontal"" blood and gore which I enjoy and in this case can view through a prism of exquisite taste and craftsmanship.I mean, I could go on for quite some time but I ll just say this : ""Make sure your psychologist is not a serial killer that likes to play with the human mind for fun"" and of course a clear 10/10 - could have been a 9.6+ but what the heck, this kept me glued to the screen, so props to all those fine people who are about to deliver us season II in one month."
375,"I liked Silence of the Lambs a lot - and I do not like CSI type of police procedurals... Thus, not a good start for Hannibal TV series? Well, yes, but I like Mads Mikkelsen whom I consider the most versatile contemporary Scandinavian actor. I have never seen a movie with his presence which is boring, although not all are masterpieces of the world cinema.But this series caught my attention from the very beginning: splendid directing and camera-work, episodes with various degrees of distress and gloominess, correctly formed flashbacks, entanglement of characters and events, strong and compatible international cast... True, there are some doubtful moments related to time necessary for committing crimes and some over-sophistication, but overall value of this series is still high. I was also pleasantly astonished by Hugh Dancy's performance (as Will Graham): until then, I had remembered him vaguely, not knowing in which movies he had partaken; his teamwork with Mikkelsen and Laurence Fishburne, above all, is pleasurable to watch. But even minor roles are presented by interesting actors, with Eddie Izzard in one of the most awkward ones.Besides, I wonder, how many viewers have reassessed their culinary desires or have become vegetarians - after seeing Hannibal..."
376,"Hannibal is a phenomenal television take of an iconic serial killer movie series. Mads Mikkelsen portrays Hannibal Lecter in a stunning performance, and Hugh Dancy gives a better perspective on the character of Will Graham. Hannibal Lecter is a dark and foreboding character, so for a television show to go as it did surprises me. They went as far as showing a homicidal cannibal prepare fantastic meals out of the flesh of the victims, giving enough allusion of Lecter interacting with them, only to serve them to unknowing guests, and kept it cleaner that most murder television shows genuinely shocks me.Freddie Lounds, however, kept having much to be desired. She was a criminal journalist, yes, so she had a strong stomach, but after having a man's brains blown out with matter sprayed on her face, to her having been kidnapped and have to participate in the surgery of a man by keeping him breathing while he held his own organs, and show no mental disturbance is baffling.If you truly love the dark and macabre, I'd definitely recommend Hannibal."
377,"I never thought I would see the day when a crime/suspense/thriller on network TV would rival those of cable TV. This show has it all. It's dark, eerie, raw, disturbing, intriguing and suspenseful. The writing and direction are fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant. And the rest of the cast is top notch.The only thing that can hurt this program is the network. NBC canceled one episode because of violence among children. Odd that a liberal network would air such a violent and disturbing concept and then cancel episodes. Make up your mind... take a risk or don't... get off the fence.This show is too sophisticated for the average viewer and probably won't make it to a second season, which will be beyond disappointing. It is a sad day in entertainment when Honey Boo Boo and the Kardashians receive more demand than a masterpiece like this."
378,"When I saw the previews and the commercials for this show, I thought to myself, this looks like it's going to be a really great show. As a huge fan of psychological dramas, I love this show. Hugh Dancy is fantastic as Will Graham, he really has gotten inside his character. He is deeply disturbed and troubled by his empathic ability, and being able to get inside the killers mind.Mads Mikkelsen is so dark, cunning and brilliant as Lecter. Nothing against Anthony Hopkins by no means, Hopkins portrayal as Hannibal was deliciously evil, but Mads has really gotten inside his character, and knows what makes him tick, what drives him to do what he does. I love the fact that you know every meal that he serves, is human, and his dinner guests have no clue.Every storyline so far, has kept me coming back for more, and I will continue to watch this show as long as NBC keeps it on the air. For once NBC has gotten something right. A character driven, psychological drama, that has been missing from their lineup for a long time now. Yes, there is a lot of gore, but it is so brilliantly filmed that it doesn't bother you, it adds a nuance to the show that if it weren't there, the show would not be as good.Before I forget, the rest of the cast is just as brilliant, Laurence Fishburne is fantastic as Jack Crawford, and the other minor characters are just as good and really add to what makes this such a character driven show.I give this show to huge thumbs up."
379,I'm with the other reviewers who see this for the crap it is. Tho I came to that conclusion 20 min into the first episode. I did not see Hannibal but could not watch anymore due the the cheesy dialogue and awful acting in the 20 min I was able to get thru. I'm not upset that I didn't get to see Hannibal tho after reading how horrible the actor portraying him is. Well my journey continues for a new good series. This was the third one I turned off last night.
380,"I am a HUGE fan of Bryan Fuller who has created such amazing shows as ""Dead Like Me"", ""Pushing Daisies"" and ""Wonderfalls"" but his one?? It takes you into a dark realm of serial killers and cannibals. The cast does a great job. The murders are horrific and something that nightmares of a twisted mind are made of. It is very dark and the imagery is haunting. Don't watch this before you go to bed! It is one of those shows that you don't want to watch but something about it pulls you back. The meals that Hannibal prepares are done with grace and aplomb even though he cooking human parts. The visions of Will are disturbing and violent. If you want happy, happy, joy, joy just run! If you want a thrill ride into a disturbing mind with blood and gore then this is your cup of tea."
381,"For anyone who is a fan of Silence Of The Lambs, I highly recommend this series. (I am currently halfway through the second season).Lets start with the acting. Hugh Dancy as Will Graham is the stand out for me, with an excellent intense performance. Mads Mikkelsen also deserves a mention for being able to portray a character already made famous by Anthony Hopkins. Despite this, Mikkelsen manages to make Hannibal his own (something I have not seen since Heath Ledger's The Joker). Lawrence Fishburne is solid as Jack Crawford and the rest of the cast all do excellent work in their portrayals.The direction and tone for the budget given is just outstanding, with production values looking high and the tone creating a very eerie and uneasy mood.The writing, music score and all other aspects combine beautifully to make this a very compelling series to watch.I am a big fan of serialised dramas including shows like Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Game Of Thrones and The Shield and I feel comfortable in saying if you enjoy shows like that, then I strongly suggest you check this one out."
382,"Ughhhhhh. I wanted to like this so bad. But in reality it was torture. From the shaky confused moody and random Will, to the overdone sound and visual effects, to the sheer number of stupid iconic hallucinations... To the corny ""this is my design"" line... ugh! All I wanted was an intelligent thrill but ended up suffering through episode after episode hoping I could watch Netflix on 2x speed. Grrrrr..."
383,"Good God would someone please kill that b!+ch off or put her in her f'n place!?Absolutely ridiculous, annoying and absurd that this annoying a$$ journalist woman gets to prance around, obstruct justice, tamper with evidence, slip past 10 cops & FBI agents to start questioning people in the middle of a crime scene, break laws left and right and NO COP OR FBI AGENT does a damn thing about it even though they can't stand her! Somehow they're powerless against her!? What f'n sense does this make and on what f'n planet would this be allowed to happen? Oh right, feminist Hollywood! That irritated me and made me want to skip ahead everytime she was on screen... that wasn't the least bit realistic! She and Abigail were just horrible character in this series.I can only be asked to suspend disbelief for so long..."
384,By the third season you realize how incredibly pretentious and empty the storyline is. The writer's obsession to over complicate things made it impossible to watch. I cringed the hole last season
385,"So yeah, just finished the last episode of Hannibal. My encounter with this TV Show was accidental. I happened to watch the 1st episode of this with my friend, and it happened to appeal me. It was different from whatever I've seen till then. 1st episode made me finish the series by the week. Frankly, I do not know how and where to start. I personally felt Hannibal can be classified as 3 different parts. First two seasons being the 1st part, were really good. It had the same flavour of the 1st episode and the pace really built up quickly. Boy oh boy, there were lot of twists, prepare yourself for this. There will be lot of things going on in your mind as you watch (Probably because I watched the whole series in a week). The pace of last episode of 2nd season will be at its peak. There is a god damn break put in 1st couple of episodes of 3rd season which would be the 2nd part. You would wish you don't want to watch it anymore or wished it ended soon. Just as one stumbles through 4th episode of the last season from which begins the 3rd part of Hannibal which again gains pace quickly, there builds up a new story (I find it ""new"" maybe of what happened to Hannibal) with links to the old characters, which I felt was fine. The ending couldn't have been better (when Hannibal says, ""This what I want for you"" and Will Replies ""Its beautiful""). I am finding it hard to not spoil the fun for you, because this is a journey one should TASTE. All I can say is, prepare yourself before you go through this, you will enjoy, have fun, despise, hate it, may also feel neutral about it. In the end this is series that gives a TASTE of everything. You will enjoy the complex relationship Will and Hannibal have throughout the series. PS: I also feel this show is not for everyone (like sitcoms etc), there will be people who despise the show!"
386,"Put aside whatever preconceptions you may have about the character of Hannibal Lecter based on what you've seen before, because if you're approaching this as a cult fan of the previous film adaptations of Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon, as well as Anthony Hopkins's overly campy portrayal throughout those films, you may likely be very disappointed.If, on the other hand, your preference tends toward Brian Cox's coldly banal and eternally jaded interpretation of the character in Manhunter, you may likely enjoy this new series immensely and what Mads Mikkelsen brings to the dinner table.Hannibal Lecter is of Lithuanian background. He isn't a native born American. Cox and Hopkins play him as a highly Anglicized Mid-Atlantic blueblood, someone cut from the same sociocultural cloth as John Houseman, William Buckley and George Plimpton. Mikkelsen is the very opposite of that characterization. He is distinctly foreign and exudes the appearance and dialect of someone who is of Central European background, which, being an ethnic Balt, Lecter happens to be..Mikkelsen's typical accent when speaking English closely approximates the Germanic dialects of Central Europe rather than that of his native Danish. If Lecter was not thoroughly Anglicized -- which, if he was, would result in a Mid-Atlantic accent common to American bluebloods -- then his accent when speaking English would sound like the one Mikkelsen speaks with. His personality and mannerisms are also much closer to the Thomas Harris novels than Anthony Hopkins, and perhaps even more so than Brian Cox, who unfortunately was not given enough screen time to really flesh out the character the way Hopkins was granted in Silence of the Lambs.Keep in mind that at time the original novel, Red Dragon, had been adapted for the screen, Silence of the Lambs had not yet been written or published. Brian Cox's characterization was thus limited to what Harris had presented in Red Dragon, in which Lecter is the secondary character to Will Graham, who is the principal lead. In Red Dragon, Lecter is an out-and-out antagonist and total villain, with nothing suggesting that he is some type of antihero or anything even remotely redeeming or likable. He is presented as pure evil incarnate, infinitely more evil than the serial killer Will Graham is pursuing. The twist presented in Red Dragon is that the principal antagonist is not actually Francis Dolarhyde, as Graham believes throughout the story, but rather Lecter himself, who, from his supermax-like psychiatric prison cell, manipulates and plays both Dolarhyde and Graham against each other as part of his master plan to take revenge against Graham by having Dolarhyde slaughter his wife and child.Lecter does all this knowing full well that while Dolarhyde may actually be able to keep his insanity in check long enough to complete his murder cycle -- what he refers to as his ""becoming"" -- by murdering Graham's family, he is too insane to be able to elude capture afterward. Lecter knows that once Graham realizes he ha has lost his wife and son, he will experience a psychotic break and stop at nothing to personally catch and kill Dolarhyde outside the boundaries of the law, making him a killer.Lecter does not actually want Dolarhyde to kill Graham -- he doesn't even believe Dolarhyde is sane or competent enough to take him one on one. More so, as much as Lecter wants Graham dead, he doesn't want anyone else to kill him because he would not derive any pleasure or satisfaction from it. Lecter has to literally consume Graham to attain that result.So, if Lecter cannot personally murder and cannibalize Graham himself, the next best thing is for Lecter to push Graham, who he already drove to the edge of insanity prior to his arrest and incarceration, over the edge and see him locked up in a psychiatric ward for the rest of his life. For Lecter, such an accomplishment would prove to his peers and the rest of the world that he is truly a higher species of predator above ordinary human beings and that his killing and consumption of humans is not murder and cannibalism, but rather the natural order of Darwinian evolution, with Lecter at the top of the food chain.Taking all that into consideration, as well as taking into consideration all the additional facets introduced in the later novels, if Hannibal Lecter were a real person, Mikkelsen's characterization would be as close to that reality as has been thus far presented.Bon appetit."
387,"There's a lot of dramas on right now. Game of Thrones, Blacklist, Person of Interest, Breaking Bad. I've not seen all of these, but it is my entirely biased opinion that Hannibal is superior to any of its peers.Hannibal sees Hugh Dancy's FBI consultant Will Graham and his incredibly complex relationship with Mads Mikkelson's exotic Hannibal, as initially 'patient and psychiatrist' before developing into an astounding game of cat and mouse.Based on the books and movies, there are many homages to those previous material, but generally most of them should be forgotten in terms of relevance to this.Hannibal stands alone and is all the better for it.As those familiar with the franchise will know, Hannibal's intellect is intimidating, with an uncanny knack of penetrating the epidermis of everyone around him, and Mikkelson absolutely nails the psychological nature of such borderline non-lingual-persuasions.Hannibal programs and controls those around him in a vast maze while they scoot around like mice as he watches on, adding obstacles and variables to make it more interesting.Graham is the victim, yet Hannibal's actions upon him aren't deliberately to make him suffer, but due to how much of himself he sees in the FBI's lead profiler. They are genuinely friends, yet the worst of enemies at the same time.A word has to go also to the quality of the show. From the writing, to the acting, to the absolutely exquisite direction and editing, Hannibal is a pretty perfect show, which, admittedly, due to the gruesome nature of a great deal of the content, is not for the faint-hearted.Hannibal, is, of course, a cannibal, but it's delivered in such an eloquent way as to give his behaviour purpose, meaning and even beauty. He respects every living thing he kills, and loves them, considering consuming them the highest honour to their life.And that theme of beauty and death is the perfect summary of the show - two opposite, irreconcilable concepts blended wonderfully together to create a masterpiece of a production.I won't spoil much more of the plot, hence this review has focused more on the show's structure than its actual content, but it's safe to say Hannibal is untouchable as far as current drama goes.Beyond highly recommended."
388,"The reason I started to watch this show is always excellent Mads Mikkelsen. He's amazing in every movie I've seen, even if I didn't like the movie itself. Same here - he steals the show, I would love to watch the scenes with him, but not any other scene. They totally lost me at ""dinner&worms and other creatures"" scene. Thank you very much, but I haven't signed for that. Few murders now and then and a lot of mind and hand twisting between 2 main characters, but pointless gruesomeness was really off-putting. Some people can not stomach everything, sorry. I turned off the TV and I won't be coming back for more. I'm short of 10 lines so let me add to the hot topic - this one or The following. Well, I expected more from both of these shows. Until they start to show decomposing bodies and worms eating through flesh I guess I'll continue to watch The following, although it isn't much better, just more watchable."
389,"The (British) actor who plays Will Graham actually has the speech mannerisms of William Peterson (Will Graham in Manhunter). I liked that a lot. I assume that is acting skill.Yes the cast are all your normal US casting mistakes - everyone is beautiful especially female characters who seem very forced into the story for the point of having some female glamour - it doesn't fit in with the ambitions of the show..I must say this show is grotesque and VERY graphically violent.It's unclear what Graham's FBI role is - It is made clear he is an ex cop but not FBI, yet in the first episode he has an unconcealed gun in a hip holster AND approaches a suspect directly when he knows his guilt (inadvertently involving Hannibal Lecter) resulting in at least one death due to possible incompetence.Yet in episode 2 he is both a fully fledged 'special investigator?', exonerated for shooting the previous perp 10 times and given free reign! Regardless of the silly US TV inconsistencies, the cinematography and sound are exceptional, the show is more grotesque and sadistic than Hostel and there is genuine promise and talent in this - I'll definitely be watching!"
390,"ugh its so hard to sit through an episode of this. it has to be the most boring show I've ever watched. i watch the occasional episode and its the same thing each week. will talking to Hannibal, Hannibal talking to will. the whole show consists of loud music, water drops, a bull with horns and talking, so much boring talking. i understand good writing and this show does have that at times, but its supposed to be about a serial killer yet the series doesn't show any of the murders. plus all the talking is silently muttered and mumbled with loud noises. i was expecting so much more from this but its a huge waste of time. i much prefer a show like Dexter or The Following cos they might not have a great 'visual effect', but i don't watch a serial killer show for effects and music, i watch them for murders and action and entertainment"
391,"If you're like me and can't stand actors who whisper their lines for dramatic effect, this movie series will drive you nuts. Hugh Dancy decided to become a low talker around season 3, I think. Maybe it was before that and I just didn't notice. But by Season 3 it was so pervasive that I wanted to pull my hair out every time he said his lines. Dancy is sooo pretentious he seems girly. But the whispering, the whispering, the continual whispering, even when all about him are speaking in their normal voices. I can barely force myself to watch this last jumbled up season.
And all that art-house stuff that others are taking about here? Not so. It seems so utterly childlike to me. You will have seen all these techniques before, time and again. Not clever, not awe-inspiring, not technically impressive, and rather ""Ho hum, get on with it."""
392,I tried binge watching this show and found that it was just far to far fetched for me to take seriously. All it seemed to be was a collection of gory images or the weekly gourmet feast shot. The actual plot frankly silly.
393,"I really loved this show, so sad it only lasted 3 seasons.The first season started slow, a lot of what happened, happens on a psychological level and Hugh and Mads play it wonderfully. The settings and killings were like paintings artfully beautiful, crazy and amazing.The second season is my favorite season especially the last two episodes are among the best episode i've ever seen in a season finale. Mads played Lecter on to a new level and to be my favorite Hannibal of them all. As much as I love and admire Mr. Hopkins Mads played diverse and impressed me. A shame he didn't got a Golden Globe for the last episode only, he deserved it.The third season is a bit weaker than the second season but still a good enough to keep all the crime and serial killer shows behind Hannibal."
394,"I originally started Hannibal off of a recommendation from a friend and I have to say I was not disappointed. From episode one I was hooked by a morbid curiosity of Dr. Hannibal Lecter's bizarre actions. Mads Mikkelsen does an amazing job playing him as a cold, psychopathic murderer that manipulates the people around him very easily. I found it to remind me of Breaking Bad in that when Jack and Will were looking for the ""Chesapeake Ripper"" he was right in front of them; even feeding his victims to them at dinner parties. Similar to how Walt was right in front of Hank the whole time.I would give a 9/10 for this series (maybe even a 10) if it stayed as good as season one and two but the third season seemed to have a lot of plot points shoved into a short frame of time. I've heard because they knew they weren't getting renewed for a season four, I don't know if this is true but it would make sense. Overall I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is an avid fan of horror. A lot of horror shows/movies end up being poorly done (I say this as a fan of the horror genre) but this one is able to deliver."
395,"Just surfing on the internet/IMDb came to know about this show and the moment i watched it ,the DARK atmosphere of this Show had me on the edge of my seat,The Mads mikkelsen is terrific ,This is one of my favorite shows easily.Season 2 was the most fast paced,filled of thrilled moments,Season 3 was a bit slow but series finale was the most unexpected and a beautiful ending.The brutality of the show is like pretty close to GOT.This easily is the most dark shows ever!HUgh dancy was so great in this show you actually are so much attached to him and one always try to know what is going on his mind,His relationship with Hannibal is beautifully Scripted and visualized.I just loved this show only complaint i had was slow paced season 3 and few of its early episodes (it had some silly moments which made no sense to me,were not so logical )but all in all this show is really Dark and a PERFECT Representation of Hannibal -THE CANNIBAL!"
396,"From the movies you know that Hannibal Lecter is a manipulative sociopath who eats people and likes to manipulate their lives since he knows he is powerful. First of all, hats off to Mads Mikkelsen, his portrayal of Hannibal is spot on, enough to send chills down your spine. Hugh Dancy also gets it right, and it is a joy to watch these two men bring their characters to life on screen. The show itself is not so much a portrayal of psychopaths and the FBI's efforts to catch them. It is a study of what goes in in the mind of Hannibal Lecter and how he is always in control. It is the tale of the Devil and how he walks among us and even though we think we can catch him at his worst moment, he knows through us what our designs are for him and he manipulates us into a false sense of control. Never has drinking wine or the preparation of a meal been more foreboding. To Hannibal the people who come into his life are puppets to be manipulated for his amusement, pigs to be slaughtered and eaten so as to satiate his appetite. As the show begins, in Will, Hannibal sees an equal, somebody he can mold in his own image. But Will is on the side of good and Hannibal is on the other side, that of pure evil. When Will realizes that it is impossible to catch Lecter, he pretends to be seduced by Lecter's therapy thus giving him a false sense of kinship with him. But it is unraveled by one small mistake that costs Will the lives of the people he cherishes the most. The first season is good but it is the second season where things really take off. It is like watching a work of art changing colors, with each change, a new picture presenting itself but what you see on the canvas is what Lecter wants you to see even as the viewer. Truly a masterpiece!"
397,"As many others have probably already watched the existing film franchise ""Silence of the Lambs"" ""Red Dragon"" etc...then you are already expecting a slightly creepy, seriously smart, psychoanalysing cannibal that kills...with a flourish. This TV series did not disappoint, not only do we see a more refined version of Hannibal The Cannibal but we also get to witness his skills as a Psychologist and then a twist...a teacher with a mentally unstable mind and of course this interests the beloved Lecter.The first episode I watched almost felt like my mind had been thrown from a fast spinning roundabout with scenes such as Will imagining the crime scene of a double murder. I could go on and on about this serious despite only having watched the first season I would say that the films previously come no where close to the beauty of this TV show.Anyone who is a serious foodie will enjoy the scenes where Hannibal cooks up lavish meals for himself and others who will unknowingly eat meat that is from one of the chef's victims. Of course we get to witness the meal and the witty banter that is thrown between the guests and host with a few cheeky puns thrown in by said host.And speaking of the stomach you'd better have a strong one to watch this as there are scenes where victims from other kills are shown and are quite graphic although amazingly detailed and imaginative.The only reason I did not give this series a 10/10 instead of a 9/10 is generally due to my dislike of Abigail Hobbs a young girl saved by Will and Hannibal from her father who almost killed her. She becomes quite a problem in the first series and almost constantly acts like...well a child in my point of view and yes she is young but perhaps this is just a person pet hate of mine for the show otherwise top marks."
398,"This series has solved all the problems present in the films and redevelops the plot so that fans will still be surprised at every turn. For example, cannibals are usually of low intelligence, which was always a sticking point for me to believe in the character of Hannibal. Untilnow that is.The series takes the time to correct all the mistakes I observed in the films. For example, some of the psychiatrists, including Hannibal and his own female psychiatrist, are seen practicing indirect therapy, drawing their patients out with very believable expertise.In the second series, we even hear a plausible explanation for the cannibalism. The films tried to blame it on one single experience, whereas this series manages to expand the character to explain it more plausibly.It's not a series for the squeamish, with horrific scenes appearing frequently. But as a psychiatric thriller, it stands out as the best work of the genre ever to reach the screen."
399,"Now, how often do we fall in love with murders and gory. This Series brings out art in murders. Each and every murder is beautiful in its own way. The imagination is so vivid, you almost fall in love with the killer. The direction is fascinating and the imagery is magnanimous. You would instantly fall in love with culinary skills of Mr Hannibal. The raw aura of silent disaster he possesses is immaculate. All in all, this is one the best things to be ever made. Each episode increases your appetite for more and more. I'm hooked to it and it makes you desire it. I would recommend see it before you die!!! Killing was never so beautiful."
400,"This series is quite brilliant on many levels. The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning and the story lines are intense. I can hardly wait until the episode comes out, but that feeling isn't induced by operatic cliffhangers. Yes, there are twists and turns in the plot, and they're also quite brilliant, but the overall feel of this series and suspense got me more hooked than for instance True Detectives did. The main actors are matched by their entire supporting cast, the score is amazing, and for a fan of Hopkins' Hannibal (plus the prequel), this does not let me down. In fact, Will Graham has never been better portrayed in my opinion. No Benjamin Raspails in this orchestra. May this series live a long long life (no pun intended)."
401,"I really, really was trying to like this show. I like Mads Mikkelsens visage but everything except that was just bad. Bad acting from all, like high school theater, pretentious, pathetic, bland, empty, emotionless, would-be intellectual gibberish. Feels so ""TVshowieusly"" i would cry. 1/10 for MM."
402,This series is fallowing the movie called Hannibal. First they told us how to became cannibal and how he caught by agents. after movies everybody expects to see a relation with movies.because novel is same but movies and series are different.this makes this TV series bad. first thing is Freddie Launds is a man in the movies(Red Dragon and Manhunter) and Freddie is a girl in the TV series. other issue is the year they shoot this movies and series. Movies show old Lecter but in the series we can see more technology. Hannibal in the series doesn't fit with the movies.In the movies you can see Hannibal attractive and out of control.they put his face in a cage.but in the series Hannibal killed Miriam Lass. it was a murder not cannibalism. I hope they fixes these things and then maybe this series become like Dexter and will have a great success.
403,"I was a bit wary of watching this as I thought it might ruin the films for me because I'm a big fan of the film series, but downloaded and watched this after reading some great reviews on here, I had to download it as it's only just been released over here in England. I was looking for a new series to watch until The Walking dead returned and I'm glad I found it! I never thought I would enjoy it quite so much! It draws you in and keeps you wanting more. I eagerly await for each episode to come out and it just gets better and better! I didn't think I could see anyone else as Hannibal after Anthony Hopkins in the films but Mads Mikkelsen plays him brilliantly! This is my first review by the way, I just had to tell everyone how amazing this show is! 10/10 would recommend to everyone! Also I heard somewhere that NBC (I think that's who done the show) where planning on axing it.. Which doesn't make sense to me as it hasn't even shown the full first series yet! So if that's true (Which I hope it isn't) I will be very disappointed to see this show cancelled when it hasn't really even started yet.!"
404,"I really wanted to like this because I'm a fan of Mads and Silence of the Lambs. I've watched the first season twice now. (Once when it first aired and again years later). And even though it's very well made and the cast are great, the writing is absolutely ludicrous. This is written by very stupid people that think they're smart, for very stupid people that think they're smart.
And I just can't get past that... I've tried. Twice."
405,"1st season: splendid
2nd season: meh
3rd season: awful.
I'm serious, don't waste your time. Don't let Hannibal fans fool you. They fooled me and I'm really upset now. The first season is really good but after the first season there is almost NOTHING. A BIG NOTHING."
406,I'm not sure what my final thought is yet on this show. The first episode was fantastic and the rest have been good but I have slowly noticed a very slight decline happening. It concerns me that this is happening so early in the series and makes me wonder if it has the ability to last. The show could turn it around as it finds it feet but I have a feeling that it will keep heading in the opposite direction.I don't think I have any common ground with the characters or the cast playing them which is never a good sign for keeping someone hooked on a show. I shouldn't be all negative though because at the moment the show still is interesting and is a great idea but maybe that is the issue. It was a great idea that was done so well with Anthony Hopkins that maybe I cannot move past his performance.I don't know. I'm going to stick with it for now but I predict in the foreseeable future I will lose interest.
407,In my opinion the script of this series is absolutely brilliant! Small Spoiler alert for how the show is! It shows how genius Hannibal is! I definitely recommend this series. It's not for the wimps that get sick at the sight of blood though. It's insanely interesting. I LOVE IT! Consider me a Fannibal! The actual movie hannibal actually got me interested in being a neurosurgeon as crazy as that sounds! If you haven't seen the movie I won't spoil the scene that actually encouraged me to be a neurosurgeon. Once you watch the movie you will have no problem figuring out what scene could have possibly made me want to do that profession. Spoiler alert on hannibal's behavior! I know I probably sound like a crazy person but I'm not I just find the character hannibal just so ridiculously interesting because he does such awful things but has this genius mind. You definitely don't see shows like this very often. It's a must see.
408,"May contain spoilers, but I do not want to ruin anything for those who have yet to see it, so I will talk about aspects of the show and not the plot. If you have not watched this show and are at all interested watch it ASAP.I read a quote somewhere that said something like ""The most beautifully shot show on network television."" That is not at all a lie. I was hooked after watching the very first scene. The colors are so thick and vibrant it's almost as if you're watching a feature film every week. The actors are also superb (Mainly just Mads and Hugh, but they all have their moments) and I really don't think anyone else could've played Hannibal so well. I've been a fan of Mads since Casino Royale and I can only hope this show will be a turning point for him.I also enjoy how the overarching plot takes a backseat to the different murders that occur in each episode, and although some of them seem out of place, it all comes together by the end of the season.Although I always wanted to see it I never got around to watching ""Red Dragon"" until I finished the show and was fending for more Will Graham and Hannibal Lector. I was very surprised to see many similar scenes and lines taken from the movie. The one that comes to mind is when Jack says ""Would you rather go back to fixing boat motors"", etc, etc and after watching the film, which is good for it's time, I've concluded that the show is definitely better, not only because of the things mentioned above, but also because of the direction they took it"
409,"The series is a radical departure from the book, and I can't say that the experiment is successful. Will Graham, who was a highly perceptive and imaginative, but generally normal person in the book, has been reimagined as a sociophobic psychic, which makes it rather difficult to identify with him, but that's not even the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that Graham, who is able to get into a killer's mind just by having a look at a crime scene, is somehow unable to tell that his best buddy is a brutal murderer, and we are supposed to believe that. Lecter's evil machinations are fun to watch, but, by the series' own logic, they shouldn't be possible. Even with Graham out of the equation, there is Jack Crawford, who can smell falsity from a mile away, and who is bound to get suspicious about Lecter (which he eventually does, but, inexplicably, it doesn't lead anywhere). This whole thing might have worked as a miniseries if they toned down Will Graham's character, but the idea of several seasons is absurd. The first season alone was enough to shatter my suspension of disbelief."
410,"Watched this on Amazon Prime, and then Netflix showed it again, so watched both first two seasons. Then I got curious as to why it got cancelled and the reason was ""low ratings?"" ... First two seasons was unremarkable. Couldn't wait to watch season three.... And I kept going, and I am on Season 3, Ep. 5... and the first four episodes were just a big crazy jumbled story line that made it very difficult to follow. Because of the ""cutscenes"" and the ""dreams"" and the ""thoughts"" I had to keep rewinding,... Should've kept or followed the story line of the first two season."
411,"I don't think that this is the best show on television. The show has a major flaw and that is that instead of visual story telling forwarding the plot it uses dialog to an annoying extent. The characters end up talking at each other in order to keep the audience on the right page in terms of plot, but this is, in my opinion, the best depiction of a highly manipulative psychopath in cinematic history. Unlike Tom Ripley, Hannibal plays a chess game and plans his moves months in advance, like a psychopath that I was close to in my personal life."
412,"Season 1 and 2 were absolutely fantastic and such unique masterpieces. Probably the darkest and most visually pleasing thing I have ever seen. Season 3 however is the reason why this show ended. It was dreadfully long, everything in slow motion to make it unnecessarily artsy and turn it into something it didn't need to be turned to. At least the first half...apparently it took a turn at the second half but I didn't bother to watch it. Attention: Season and 2 is gonna give you nightmares if you bingewatch,"
413,"Just watch the movies, save yourself 39 episodes of drawn out acting. They are all great actors, just needing a new story line. #movieindustrygreed"
414,"Brilliant movies. Why does the the film industry insist on make more series about, what everyone has already seen, greed - Unfortunately understandable/tiresome. Great as it is, same story just a long drawn out version. The music throughout is over powering, for the visual experience."
415,"Should have worked--Premise of this series is probably what i like the most of Hannibal. It's unlike any other show (that i know of) to take this approach for a crime-horror-ish show. BUT i feel like you need to set aside everything you know about previous Hannibal films (and books) to really enjoy the show-Without a doubt, Hannibal has one of the most visually stunning shot.
-The acting from the main cast is quite decent,
-Character Development, particularly Will Graham. It's interesting to see how the main character descent into madness. Especially from seaon 1&2shouldn't have worked--
-NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. This is the most frustrating aspect of the series. All the character speaks like they're quoting a romans proverb.
-Though it's shot beautifully, but there are some unnecessary close up shot of some weirdly detailed things through out the series that i wasn't quite sure how to interpret it. (or it could just be pointless shot)
The story line are too 'heavy' and vague at times. I constantly feeling like i was missing something, and not knowing what really happened-Sometimes the score worked perfectly, but sometimes it doesn't work at all and you'll find your self hearing a strange melodies while nothing really happened."
416,"Dr Hannibal Lecter has undoubtedly been the most celebrated and feared serial killer in the history of horror cinema. I was in admiration of this super-villain when I first saw him in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", portrayed masterfully on-screen by none other than Sir Anthony Hopkins - a character that exudes charm and wisdom as much as bone-chilling fear.So when I learned there is a TV show re-creating the universe of Hannibal Lecter, I was naturally overjoyed - and the ratings indicated Bryan Fuller and his directors had managed to re-create the magic, bringing to life the charming slayer again.And my thoughts about how no-one could be more convincing as Hannibal than Anthony Hopkins were immediately cast aside with Mads Mikkelsen's brooding persona and elegant charm.The first two seasons were more action-packed and more importantly, showed the great psychiatrist's mind in action with everyone clueless about his actual identity. This was something no movie had previously shown - Hannibal Lecter at work in his full glory, amongst the FBI, sometimes even partaking in the murder investigations as a consulting psychiatrist. And that is when he comes across Will Graham, portrayed by Hugh Dancy, who has a penchant for murder investigations as he comes with a gift of re-creating the murder events by getting into the criminal's mind.The two hit it off, as Will Graham finally meets someone who understands him and Hannibal realises Will's potential that is just too hard for him to resist playing his mind-games with. Also, Hannibal understands that Will and himself are alike - they understand one another, share themselves with one another, but cannot do the same with anybody else. This paves the way for Hannibal's friendship and love for Will.What impresses me the most about this TV series is that it, for the first time on-screen, allows us to understand the psychiatrist side of Dr Hannibal Lecter. What does the psychiatrist in him think, believe? And we are shown how Hannibal believes in every individual's true self, and he pushes them to be what they really are.
So when a patient subconsciously wants to be a murderer, he brings it into their conscious and makes them accept it.And on the other hand, he is also the curious 'psychopath', who can push people into committing crimes to see what unfolds and how they behave.Mads Mikkelsen has convincingly captured the nuances of the brilliant psychiatrist and a top-class chef that can churn out picturesque delicacies, if one is willing to ignore what their basic ingredient is.What separates the third season from its predecessors is the increased space taken up by philosophy and cinematography. The dialogues are profound and quotable and the cinematography....it is what it is - art in motion.The final scene with the Red dragon battling Hannibal and Will Graham is a mastery in symbolism and cinematography. And when they put the dragon to rest, Will, having realised his true murderous self decides what he feels is the only way, and Hannibal having realised he will feel incomplete without Will joins him in his final fall.This show is definitely more than anyone would expect - truly a masterpiece!!"
417,"Just finished watching all three seasons in a couple of weeks and I was feeling glum about leaving the characters even before watching the finale. I haven't watched many TV series. Normally I just devour movies as I don't have to commit too much time before finding out if it's dull.
I'm glad I gave this show my time. The first few episodes had me expecting another generic crime show, just more gory, but that was a forgotten thought toward the end of season one when the storyline focuses more on Hannibal. It was smart, surprising, disturbing and darkly amusing. I was surprised with just how far they did and were allowed to go for something shown on TV. This is certainly not safe or dumbed-down viewing. It often felt a bit too macabre to binge on.. a world one shouldn't stay in for too long, but at the same time how delightful it is.
The casting of Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal was superb. His acting is very subtle and his face and presence intriguing and it was perfect Dr Lecter. The homoerotic undertones between the two leads put a whole other dimension into the storyline and in season three it felt like the writers played along with what they knew the viewers wanted more of, teasing, which was a fun element.
The only issues I had with the show is that it felt uneven at times. A few episodes (namely the first few of the third season involving the Lady Murasaki's character) were lower par than others. I found some aspects of these episodes a bit silly and pretentious, although still enjoyable. Apart from those other episodes were often quite brilliant. It's incredible what they did with just 40 minute episodes as some felt like watching a feature film.
All in all I loved it. It's deliciously dark, visually beautiful, the dialogue is thoughtful and it's packed with interesting and often horrifying storylines and characters. It's for those of us who like to be struck by what we're watching, ponder over dialogue, enjoy dark and atmospheric worlds and find sinister characters and psychology interesting.
I can certainly see why this show is a required taste; but if it is to your taste then you will adore it.
8.5/10"
418,Full of innovative stomach-churning killing ideas and the bloody ending of the series is a satisfying treat for the viewers.
419,"Hannibal is my favorite character ever
And Mads Mikkelsen has done it perfectly
But there were some directorial mistakes.. and they overuse the visual effects"
420,"After the first season i was like: ""why the hell did they canceled this show It's amazing"" Then i started watching 3rd season and now i understand. To much artistic moments. Sometimes less is more. But still i love the show even with too much artistic parts in 3rd season. Also the music is unpleasently loud in 3rd and 2nd season and it should be dark and scary but Its just loud and unpleasant. The rithmic parts on ""radiators"" all the time Its just too much, and no melody just sfx. It will be forgotten thats for sure."
421,"Okay . hannibal was probably not what you thought about the mysterious serial killer that was most infamous in the movies played by anthony hopkins the series however drives into a darker , weirder lore background however the new hannibal lecter is played by mads mikkelsen who also was in a recent netflix movie called polar and in the upcoming PS4 game death stranding by the metal gear solid creator hideo kojimahannibal definitely is the best tv show i recommend if you're into messed up crime scene series/movies these ones however are disturbingthe only actor i know in the show is laurence fishbourne who was in the matrix with keanu reeves however the other actors/characters are played epic and seem to resemble the novels more
the violence is gory/ bloody at times but i'm used to those stuff in movies and tv shows evil dead must have probably introduced me to the gory/violent side of moviesbut for hannibal lastly i'll give it a solid 8/10 would love the series to continue a 4th season but sadly 3 was truly the end since the red dragon arc was the most interesting"
422,Molly heard the floor of her wooden house creak and assumed there was an intruder. -_-
423,"Season 3 finishes off just as strong as the second season by delivering breathtaking, gory moments, comedic value and a strong ending that leaves you with questions. Mads Mikkelsen's performance as Hannibal from start to finish is wonderful."
424,"After watching Hannibal, I can confidently diagnose myself with the infamous pure empathy disorder. Let me share with you what it feels like to watch Hannibal: This show will transport you into a parallel reality where darkness governs your world and where you are haunted by a mirror-image of yourself that embraces all that you ever denied and feared. You will face your demons and enter into a ruthless battle for your soul. You won't be able to understand your own feelings and even your principals will be challenged. You will suffer from nightmares and strange hallucinations and you won't discern between imagination and reality. And most importantly you won't be even able to predict your own actions. If you find this acceptable then you are ready for the ride. But even after such labors and If I may review Hannibal, I would say that: This show was a masterpiece served with elegance and grace, crafted by the hands of the muses and given to us in the course of three magnificent seasons. I cannot recommend this show enough. I loved everything about it, the acting was superb especially Dancy and Mikkelsen, the imagery haunting, the sets were beautiful and the dialogue and the themes absorbing. I never expected to like it this much because I 've read the four books and watched the movies, but the show is unique and to me it transcends all its predecessors. It is also a bold take on the Lecter story that will leave you wondering. So, if you want to watch something smart, beautiful, intellectual and rewarding You got to see Hannibal. And believe me even if you will end up having the pure empathy disorder, you will keep coming back to Hannibal over and over again and immerse yourself into its/his transfixing madness. Left to say: bon appétit."
425,"So, the series has come to what appears to be a definitive end. It's been an engagingly interesting and frustratingly bumpy ride that definitely took the scenic route. Season one showed great promise but was overburdened by too many distractions. The plentiful serial killers trying desperately to outdo themselves in needlessly convoluted killings only subtracted from what was the real thrill of the show; Hannibal and Will. It was as if the writers didn't trust the audience to find the dialogue and central characters interesting enough and felt the need to entertain us with shiny objects to keep us from changing the channel. Season two was an improvement in that sense. More focused the background wasn't quite as muddled and the main story was rightfully given more of the spotlight. Some strong supporting characters made for some great tension and despite some major logical flaws the build up and subsequent finale was as satisfying as one could hope for. In season three we're finally rid of all distractions. Essentially a remake of ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"" in reverse chronological order the first half of the season is mostly set in Florence. Though many scenes and the main plot is lifted straight from the book/movie it still has enough original material that makes it fit quite seamlessly with the shows unique tone. One can hardly accuse the show of appealing to the lowest common denominator. The startup is a challenging, slow paced and surreal introduction to the final season. Though visually stunning as always I found myself growing tired of the forced and sometimes over- pretentious dialogue that seems every bit surreal as the visuals. I kept wishing for some natural, realistic dialogue to break off the somewhat pompous, stuffy tone that permeated each episode and almost every character. Though I guess that is also part of the charm.The ""Red Dragon"" part is in that sense a breath of fresh air. Though still staying true to the aesthetic fingerprint of the show it is generally more fast paced and has a more obvious sense of direction and development. In most ways it's simply a re-make of ""Red Dragon"" and a lot of the scenes are pretty much copy-pasted from the 2002 film. It's however a very good remake, the visuals are astounding and the acting is top tier. Special praise goes to Raúl Esparza as Dr. Frederick Chilton and Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde, the red dragon. They share an especially unforgettable scene i episode 12. A carbon copy of a scene from the movie but nonetheless spectacular. The finale is one of the more satisfying I've seen on TV. Though the buildup feels a bit rushed the end is simply poetic and beautiful. The show is not without flaws and annoyances. Season one was needlessly contrived, the dialogue isn't quite as smart as it thinks it is and the whole third season, though well executed and not without original minor plots and embellishments, is still basically a remake. It's a shame that the series was already in its death throes when it finally found a tone and voice that was a perfect balance between pretentious art and engaging suspense. Hannibal had all the potential to become a modern classic but fell a few short yards from the finish line."
426,Season 1 was ok. Season 2 was great but Season 3 was nothing but horrible and a boring waste of time full of plot holes with an even worse ending. Disappointing.
427,"Ive watched hannibal back to back and loved every minute of the show and got to the end hoping for the next season which would be silence of the lambs, so may I suggest to the casting supervisor a superb recommendation for buffalo bill and I do mean perfect, buffalo bill as Dacre Montgomery or as he is probably best known as Billy in the third season of stranger things, I think he has the right look and I know he would pull it of like a champ, I have to make you aware that I'm no late comer in the hannibal world as I've watched all movie over and over throughout my life, I remember when I first seen silence of the lambs, my god, the chemistry between lector and starling was tense and buffalo bill will never leave my subconscious, lotion, basket, do I need to say more, genius, so with that it's goodbye horses, I've got to go now, I'm having an old friend for dinner CHOW"
428,"All I can say is, WOW! This series is amazing. I can't believe that it was canceled. If you're a fan of the movies, then you will LOVE this. It takes such a drastic examination of the human mind to even make you feel for Hannibal. If that's not good writing, then I don't know what is."
429,It's an amazingly thrilling series. Sadly it had low rating aftar release so it got cancelled aftar 3 seasons..😭 I must say it's a Masterpiece...❤
430,"The incredible cinematography combined with the chilling-at-times sound design, as well as Mads' great performance as Hannibal all combined together compliment each other to create a brutal, yet precise and artistic show."
431,"Generates a familiar feeling from Silence of the Lambs, but it provides much more in depth grasp of the sinister and playful intent of Hannibal Lector. Such an intense pleasure to absorb the meats of this production."
432,"I was a little unsure about this show at first. I love crime shows but from what I had seen in previews I worried that this show would be over the top gory and slasherish (not gonna lie it's gory, yet it is done in an oddly artistic way that is somehow beautiful) I ran out of shows to watch so I decided to give it a try. All I have to say is thank goodness I did!!From the first episode I was hooked. The characters were all so well developed that from the very beginning I felt invested in their stories. Dancy does an amazing job playing the slightly awkward yet brilliant Will Graham, and Mikkelsen's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter could rival that of Anthony Hopkins. From the beginning we know Hannibal is bad yet you can't help falling in love with his character, and watching he and Will's relationship unfold will have you on the edge of your seat biting your nails. I wanted to scream at Will to stay away yet I also never wanted he and Lecter to be separated!The first season was incredible and I worried it may be one of those series that just fizzles out after the first season, but thankfully it turned out to be one of those rare shows where the next season is a million times better than the first!This show easily makes my top five all time favorites, and for me that is saying something considering how critical I am of most shows.Side note: no spoilers but can I just say that the season 2 and 3 finals were easily some of the best season finals out there! Personally for me they rival those of Game of Thrones."
433,"So absurd it's incredible. Brilliant performances all around, very natural story progression, beautiful gothic romance at its core."
434,This series is the best thing ever in my life. Every minute was worth it.
435,"If you're a fan of the dark and macabre, you'll love this. Interesting characters and visually intriguing. It's a mixture of American Horror Story and Law & Order."
436,"If I was giving reviews solely about the storyline and the series itself this would be a solid 9 at least, but my ratings drop a bit because of the idea devouring dead human body by selfish reasons like art. By doing that it sends a message in to the real world that this is somewhat becoming more and more acceptable. And by that we lose our humanity step by step if we start to treat each others bad and do stuff that we would call inhumane. This tv series is in my opinion dangering normalizing cannibalism, taking dead human body as a form of art and turning just plain evil human being's something to be desired for. And a last thing if you think that you are not mentally strong enough I would stay away from this tv series, because this tv series is pretty heavy if you view it from a sociopaths point of angle for example."
437,"Making a near-narrative reinvention look effortless, and expanding its visual vocabulary into ever-more imaginative flourishes, Hannibal's third outing secures its place as network television's greatest current triumph."
438,I absolutely love Hannibal!!! Please make more seasons.
439,"If this show was made today it would not have been cancelled because it is clearly ahead of its time not only in the writing and visuals but the whole base of the show which is the relationship between Hannibal and Graham that alludes to good and evil, which with greatly written character development we can see that clearly there's no real good. I hope this gets picked up from cancellation soon, I believe that today people are ready for a fourth and more seasons of Hannibal."
440,"This series is rough, but carries the same mood of movies. The acting is great, I was a little put off by Hannibal's actor at first but eased into role. Lawrence Fishburne is amazing. (Spoiler) watching him say good by to his wife is emotional. I was really enthralled with this series, but found the the end of the second season and the third to be off. It is not an easy watch. I find myself wondering if I need to be high too follow it."
441,The writing in this show has depth it sounds like poetry and all the philosophical points are amazing. The beauty of the show is also a strong element. Simply loved it so much.
442,This show is so mesmerizing and an elevation of the genreit gets me real mad to know this was cancelled when it clearly is a masterpiece above almost every show that is mainstream today. If it came back it would simply change the game.
443,Man the story telling is incredible and the writing is so complex it is so interesting to watch and the unfolding relationship between Hannibal and Will is chef kiss.
444,"There's a certain elegance in this show that is fascinating, I am obsessed with it."
445,"Just watched it for the second time over Netflix and I still don't understand why this show was cancelled ..it's an absolute work of art.. direction,music,cast, storyline, dialogues everythings portrayed to it's best ...
Mads is easily my favorite Hannibal lecter 💞"
446,"I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers so I was extremely excited to start this show! Every detail in this show was extremely methodical and played an important role in the storyline! My favorite is the grotesque aesthetics portrayed throughout the show because it really tied together Hannibal Lecture's character. Also props to all the actors for the immaculate work. Will's portrayal of disassociating from himself was my favorite. Personally, for me, I felt the show was at times ""slow"" and it took me a few times to finish."
447,"Wow, what a relationship they put on between a patient and his therapist like how far a doctor/ therapist can go knowing his patient. Awesome"
448,"First off. I'm a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Couldn't have picked a better guy than Anthony Hopkins. I'm also a fan of Mads M. and I don't think this is the fault of the actors.Secondly, I'm only just starting episode 4 of season 1. At some point I'll inevitably continue watching it. This is the only reason it gets the third star.This series loses me when it forces you to swallow things that any normal criminal investigation would wrap up in a moment or never allow to happen.Almost from the beginning we are told that Will doesn't socialize well and he's on the spectrum. None of this reflects at all so far. He's put in places he never would be, dealing with people he never should see, assuming rolls he never would have to do even if he wanted to.Then you have crime scene control. The redhead apparently finds out about stuff and gets the scoop on scenes even before the FBI (who are specifically working this case only) can get there...multiple times. She would be in jail...not just threatened. Then she is a direct, witness to a crime and it just kinda goes away and the murderer just kinda infiltrates a hospital and kidnaps a patient. The access she has is ridiculus. And she's not the only one in places she shouldn't be...just a primary offender.Then there is Will. He's more likely portrayed as someone with schizophrenia that being slightly on the spectrum. He's a risk teaching a class much less being brought into the FBI as a consulting specialist and working as field agent. I also just don't buy his dialogue with Hannibal. The writers could have done better.Speaking of Hannibal the great and mysterious, I was enjoying him pull the strings till the end of 3 when the debauchery at the house all went down. I felt like so many things went wrong there. Redhead at the house early. The graffiti which should have been removed. Critical people allowed to wonder around. The brother in the house. How it ended and people just went their separate ways. Etc.I realize I'm digressing into specific examples (and there are plenty more), but it only illustrates the unbelievability of the series - which kills any immersion.This follows in a long train of garbage burdened with the idea that gore, artistic effect, railroading of characters and plot, and general broodiness all equate to suspense. Some audiences are looking for something more intellectual and intriguing. But then this is a psychological thriller...or maybe more aptly a psychotic shocker. No subtle breadcrumb trail here.Some people would rather be lured to the scene than pushed into it."
449,"Hannibal is a masterpiece. This is art. Mads Mikkelsen is the guy! There's nobody better for the role of Dr.Hannibal Lecter. I mean this is 10/10! And the end... the end is so perfectly created! I can watch this over and over and over again! Nothing more, nothing less! Enjoy the masterpiece!"
450,"I just can't say enough about this series... I think (at some point) ""Bryan Fuller"" exceeded the original materials (Book by: Thomas Harris), in depth, dialogs (of course with the whole writing team)This is not just for ""Mature Audiences"" to watch, but I think it is for ""STABLE MIND Mature Audiences"".the visuals are as poetic as each word of dialog, and the best thing to me, they never fail me in each episode.I just ordered the whole ""Hannibal"" movie collection (5 of them. where ""manhunt"" is almost the same as ""red dragon"").and, I do have doubts that these movie collection will be up to the high level of the show. (Even ""Silence of the lambs"", which I most see it differently now)SERIOUSLY, MANY WANT THE SHOW TO COME BACK (look at the ratings for instance)"
451,"Although this series is slow-paced and a bit weird at first with dream-like imagery and might take a bit of adjustment from normal network shows, the performances and relationships developed are outstanding. There's currently nothing like it that was released in the last few years.The series finale and the Red Dragon's six episodes were particularly drawing. I was already a big fan of Richard Armitage, and thought his performance as Francis Dolarhyde was electrifying. Armitage managed to pull off a painful vulnerability struggling with a dark power that I thought was brilliant. I can't wait for Bryan Fuller's next series!"
452,"I've just finished watching season 3 with my partner and we can both honestly say this is, without a doubt, one of the finest TV shows ever made. The pace, the story telling, the acting, the cinematography, the style are all stellar! Absolutely superb! I love the relationship between Hannibal and Will Graham (both acted superbly by Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy). I think Mads' performance as Hannibal Lecter is the best version of that character (sorry Anthony!). I Love how it ended but I desperately want to see more. I sincerely hope they get to make more. It appears all involved are on board should the opportunity present itself, so here's hoping a network has the sense to pick this up. I'm a total ""fannibal""!"
453,"At first I didn't want to watch the series at all. I love the movies and I thought that no one can cope with the role of Hannibal Lecter like Anthony Hopkins. But finally I decided to give it a try. Since the first episode I got absolutely obsessed with it. I think it's a mistake to compare the movies and the series, because the series portray a different view on both Hannibal and Will Graham. I like the relationship between them, I like the way the series are created ( hallucinations, slow motion, etc.). After watching the end of season 3 ""Hannibal"" has become my number one show and my appeal for everyone, who likes the books or the movies, is to give it a try and enjoy one different but fascinating version of Hannibal and his twisted mind."
454,"*SPOILERS*Let me start out by saying that The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite movie of all time. So I put off watching this show for 2 years in fear that it would ruin the Clarice character even more than Julianne Moore did. I was overjoyed to see them not even touch her (aside from some references to her in the Miriam Lass character). Additionally, I found Hugh Darcy's interpretation of Will Graham to be far more endearing than Edward Norton's. They strayed from the original material with the Freddie Lounds character, who in Red Dragon is a man. This was a brilliant move, Freddie was scheming and borderline psychotic without adding to the relative sausage fest that would have ensued had they stayed true to the source. They also used Freddie to help deliver the writer's plethora of sexual innuendos. My favorite character, though? Bedelia, and not just because I'm a huge X-Files fan. I found myself becoming impatient at the gap in the second season that she's away after she wisely ""peaces out."" For this reason, as well as Alana Bloom's character development (which I will touch on in a second), the first 6 episodes of the 3rd season were my favorite of the series. in fact, I think a spin off is in order: ""Hannibal and Bedelia's European Adventures."" My theory is that Bedelia is in fact the most twisted character in the series. Most would argue that that award should go to Hannibal, and rightly so, he's a sociopath, but Hannibal knows exactly what he's doing, and is fairly open about it. Bedelia on the other hand is either lying to herself, or has effectively tricked every character that she's come into contact with (including Hannibal) that her ""dark passenger"" (dropping a Dexter reference) is a product of peer pressure and professional curiosity as opposed to an all encompassing darkness akin to (but more controlled then) Hannibal's. I sincerely hope that Bedelia's feast in the closing seconds of the finale is her own doing, rather than Hannibal's revenge. In a perfect world, eating her leg is an act of compensation for the adrenaline vacuum that Hannibal left her when he ended the chase by jumping off a cliff. ​Now onto Bloom. I thought she sucked in the first two seasons, so naive. Not stupid, but certainly a narrow and fairly sunny world view (an interesting thing to have in her line of work). Her being the only real female character (Kats died) up until Margot was introduced became rather trying on my patience. I mean, really Alana? Jack got with the program. I understand that she had more history with Hannibal than Jack did, but good lord, she literally had to be pushed out a window to figure out what was really going on. In season 3, though, she did a complete 180. Alana 2.0! and I loved her. Baddass, decisive, a sense of humor drier than Arizona, it was awesome to see. I think the wardrobe shift to the ""modern noir"" genre helped with her transformation into basically a mobster hellbent on revenge (she used Mason's money to pay off the cops, remember?) ​Mason Verger was the perfect Hannibal bad guy. Creepy, twisted, and totally crazy. His relationship with Margot was instrumental in the writers teaching their audience to truly hate him, not begrudgingly, but ""he got what was coming to him when he ate his own face"" kind of hatred. Like the TV.com reviewer, I preferred the first half of the season and honestly could have watched the Hannibal/Bedelia, Vergers/Alana, Will/his own insanity dynamic for at least an entire season and possibly even a movie. In fact, somehow throw Bedelia in the final Verger show down scene and I'd put that DVD right next to The Silence of the Lambs on my shelf."
455,"I was immediately hooked when I saw the first episodes of Hannibal, recognizing that this was something quite different than most, often pretentious series about killers, cops and violence, or mysticism, for that matter. Hard to get a grip on just watching the first seasons episodes, it soon grows on you, when the intellectual battle between Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen) and Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) gets increasingly complex and dangerous, when you start to wonder if one of them could actually exist without the other one.Hannibal recognizing himself in Will, toying with him and his ability to get into the most twisted mindsets of the most twisted humans, and his own inner battle to keep himself sane in the progress.It only gets better. You never tire or stop being amazed of the twists and turns in this mad dance. It was a huge disappointment that in the country I reside in the series had dwindling numbers of viewers, making the network showing it counter that by moving it to worse times, from almost prime time to whatever slot that was not occupied by other more mediocre series.It was clear the mainstream viewers had missed out on the cleverness and artistic splendor that was on show, but it has got a growing following now, thankfully.Season three has to be mentioned especially, as from what I have heard it was very unclear for a period if it should be continued at all. It took it's time, but in the third installment we are taken from the often grey, desolate US east coast settings, and into the core playground of Europe's cultural elite. The brutality is worse than ever, but has been accompanied by a breathtaking beauty, featuring artistic shots of ancient cities and buildings, almost classic paintings, or art-interventions, when the story is unfolded.You constantly have the feel that you are watching a high-class feature movie, not a TV-series, wanting to concentrate on every moment of clever conversations between the fantastic actors (the guest stars are brilliant, Eddie Izzard for example making one of the absolute top performances of his career) and the fantastic environments and ornaments, filled with symbolism and hints of what is to come next...who will be on tonight's menu? Who has to be sacrificed and who is to be spared?This is a must for any fan of high-quality TV entertainment!"
456,"I will try to keep this review very short and spoiler free. So I was actually very hesitant on watching the first episode, due to the catastrophe that was Hanniball Rising. Hannibal Rising showed me that a Film exploring Hannibals past was utter s**t, even with Harris' involvement, so naturally when it was said that Hannibal would delve into the past i was worried, but the first episode convinced me otherwise. As of now the series is a prequel to Thomas Harris' book Red Dragon (higly recommended, a great read), with elements of his other books thrown in. As this is a story yet we haven't explored yet. It does a great job of introducing and setting the characters and their respective Arch's, as well as beautifully shot scenes with amazing soundtracks. It features enough plot twists (amazing ones) to make M Night Shyamalan jealous, but they never feel forced. The pacing is quite amazing, as it ain't too fast or too slow but right in the middle of it. The acting is superb, evidenced also in the supporting roles as with Freddie Lounds (who is a smoking hot redhead here) and Dr. Frederick Chilton both of whom unbelievably unlikeable and morally in the Grey area as all they want to achieve is fame and fortune, with very little to no regard for other human life, but nevertheless you just watch them because of the convincing performances. Laurence Fishburne also is a great Jack Crawford (a friend of Will Graham and later in the books mentor and guide to Clarice Starling). As for Hugh Dancy as Graham, I see a little bit of William Petersen, who portrayed Graham in the original Manhunter, in him but in subsequent episodes he is just fun to watch, and also recreating famous scenes from the films and books alike. As for the man of the hour, Dr. Lecter himself, I had my doubts about Mads as I, like many other people, can't picture anyone but Sir Hopkins in the title role. But he proved he can make the character his own, and not resort to Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character. Mads is just a blast to watch his many interactions(his inside jokes particular: I'd love to have you and your wife for dinner!) with the characters is amazing and shows Hannibals traits, like him being always in control and cunning, manipulative, charming and a hell of a cook. In closing I might say although the first season was not that good, the second saw the mistakes and improved upon it, so lets hope the upcoming seasons do also better."
457,"For those who love this kind of dark,intense even sometimes heavy mind games and moments on TV this is your cup of tea.This series will slowly crawl under your skin and get you hooked so you will want to see more and more.I absolutely love how the producers did their jobs on this one.The characters are very well developed and I find that to be one of the basic foundations of every good show.After all I wanna mention that this really isn't a TV show for everyone,especially for those who have a weak stomach.I love the character of Will and how complicated he is,it is simply astonishing how complex his mind is.I highly recommend this one,a must watch for me,i give it a 9/10 for sure!"
458,"I just ran a full Season 1 marathon and I must say: the show makes me watch with delight. Hannibal simply has one of the best cinematography TV has to offer. I like the subtle plot hints brought by the lighting and choice of wardrobe colors, although I think the background music has to be improved. Personally, I don't find it too gory--I think the production team added all the necessary touches to materialize grotesque things that originate from twisted minds.One reason that excites me every episode is learning more and more about the title character, Dr. Lecter. Because no one orchestrates a crime more delicious than he can. Also, I am actually left quite curious about the his appetite for the human flesh. Overall, I think the production team did an amazing job. I just hope they never run out of good ideas.Can't wait for the next season."
459,"I am an avid series and movie critic and Hannibal has gripped me.Episode one IS the most important episode in the first season, I cannot stress it enough.Now you either need an incredible memory to remember exactly what happens in episode 1 by the time you reach the end OR, as I have just done, and strongly suggest, after completing the season, rematch episode one.The reason I stress this and feel the need to write this on this forum is because I believe that episode 1 is extremely confusing and after consulting with friends I now it's not only me who feels this way. Now due to the amount of confusion it gives out, you end up missing some important dialogues and actions in the first episode.I hope you guys like it as much as I do. Bravo NBC"
460,"Overblown, overhyped, tedious, achingly boring, plodding, pompous and beautifully choreographed lemon."
461,"I had high hopes! HUGE Hannibal fan but this show despite decent acting and good production values relies to much on fancy murder scenes that are staged like world class art that would take a team of artist a couple of days to construct somehow one man does it without ever being seen, not to mention the overly artsy camera angles. Not every scene needs to be a masterpiece in cinematography. It makes me feel like the producers are trying too hard to deliver a story beyond just the script and actors.
In the end, halfway through the second season even a laymen like me would see that the killer was Hannibal but yet everyone is fooled except Will Graham and despite his best efforts to convince ppl of the true killer no ones listens and of course that has to happen. How else can you extend the series another season! ...I think if they kept it at a two season mini series it would have been alot better. As is, it's a water down version of the movie!"
462,"Like the title says, you really shouldn't watch the third season. It's like they fired all the good people from the production team from the first two seasons and wanted to spread the butter over even more bread.
They completely ruined it. It's boring and terribly slow. Long drawn (supposedly meaningful) pauzes to make it look arty. People mysteriously coming back to life. Everybody loves the man that maimed, disfigured and left them for dead.
Another example of ruin by greed.
Just learn to stop when it's over people!"
463,"I always had the feeling that 'Hannibal' is one of the most popular series of these days. Many people recommended watching this show, which I trusted for the first season. I was not blown away but it was enough to risk the second season. Over the course of this season, I lost more and more interest because I could not bond to any of the characters because I think they are all too predictable and shallow. Especially from the role of Mads Mikkelsen I had hoped for more because I'm actually a big fan of his work. Unfortunately, I could not surprise this series and I lost interest before I could finish the second season."
464,"My ratings for Hannibal are after watching the first season. I know there are at least two more seasons for me to watch so I might change my ratings after watching those ones. But for now a six is fair enough for this series. It doesn't get more for now because I find one of the main characters a weak point in this show. Hugh Dancy as Will Graham is just annoying. Is it is character or his acting, or both? They should focus this show much more on Mads Mikkelsen (playing Dr.Hannibal Lecter). He acts brilliantly and his character should be the main character of the entire show. Laurence Fishburne is also good in his character. I was expecting much more from Hannibal. I thought we would see the life of Dr.Lecter known from The Silence of the Lambs. But it doesn't come even close to the suspense you had in that movie. And after watching the top show Dexter about serial killers I thought this would be the same. But you never get that same sensation of suspense. The only good thing are the creative murders the serial killers have in Hannibal. That keeps you interested but the story itself is sometimes a bit too slow. I had a couple of times where I missed a couple minutes because I fell asleep. That would never have happened with Dexter for example. Anyways, I will watch the next seasons in hope they get better, with more Hannibal Lecter and lesser Will Graham.Edit: After watching season two my opinion certainly didn't get better. There is a lot of annoying stuff in this series. It's extremely slow, the music and sound effects are(the least you can say)hypnotizing and annoying and make you fall asleep every episode, the story is also far fetched without any suspense. I'm hesitating watching season three because I can't see any improvement with this show.Edit 2: After watching the first episode of season three I just abandon. It makes no sense, it's extremely slow, and the hypnotizing sounds make me fight not to fall asleep. Too boring to continue watching this series while there are so much better ones."
465,"First of all I deal with the positives. The direction and cinematography is superb. It creates a dark and very creepy world around Will Graham. The sound and music is fitting to the environment.The acting is also great. Hugh Dancy is spectacular in the role of Will Graham and the rest of the supporting actors are good at their roles. The other lead actor, Mads Mikkelsen, is very creepy as Hannibal Lecter, however, he never came of as the cunning psychopath we've all come to know Hannibal Lecter from the films, he just came off as evil. But I don't blame Mads for his characterisation I blame the writers.In fact the biggest flaw of the entire show is the writing. In the story Will Graham is an FBI criminal profiler with a gift. He can magically see through the eyes of serial killers in the past when they were killing their victims. I use the word 'magically' because how Will reaches his deductions is never properly explained; the writers lazily excuse themselves by using words such as 'gift' or 'ability to empathise with killers' to explain that he can. Such core plot point should be dealt with more care and detail.All in all the show is very entertaining if you're in the mood for something dark and mysterious. I have enjoyed it very much and I hope that the writers will write with more care and detail when they're showing off Will's gift in action in the following season.7/10 stars."
466,"Who tf talks like this in an normal day to day conversation. They tried to be smart but failed horridly. Also, Mads doesn't fit the profile of Hannibal. Hannibal, as what he does, he needs to be charming and mingling especially when he's breathing down the neck of an FBI profiler.
Mads Mikkelsen is straight up creepy.
And also what's up with those time lapses. They don't make any sense, will graham can't seem to conclude anything from those. No wonder they canceled it after 3 season due to no viewers. Spare yourselves, don't watch . Rather read the story on google about this show, atleast you'll be done in an hour lol"
467,"The only likable character is Mikkelsen's Hannibal. He's the sole reason why I gave it a ""4."" The rest of the characters are tired tropes and cliched. The plot drags. Lazy writing. I can't believe that people rank this so high .Smarten up, folks."
468,"Despite my hopes, dreams and wishes for this show, it's quite mediocre. I'll address the big four: Casting, Acting, Writing and Direction.Direction: Mechanically, there is nothing wrong with this series. It's shot well and the direction seems to be fine. I wish the other three areas had fared as well.Casting: The casting could use some work. Alana Bloom, Katz, the forensic tech and Garret Jacob Hobb's daughter were all pretty poor casts. They don't look their parts, they're not particularly good actresses and they detract from the show more than they add to it.Acting: Most of the actors in the show do decent enough work. Some of them do not. Alana Bloom is too emotional, irrational and unprofessional to be believable as a psychiatrist. GJH's daughter constantly uses asymmetrical facial expressions, which are fake. Other than contempt and, perhaps, puzzlement, there are no genuine facial expressions that are asymmetrical, certainly not fear, which she, unfortunately, thinks should be an asymmetrical expression. Katz's character doesn't make any sense. I will cover that more in the writing section, but the actress that plays her isn't believable in the role. She doesn't look or behave like she's in a scientific field or a member of the FBI. The rest of the acting in the show is fairly decent and even very good when it comes to the rest of the cast, particularly, the veteran actors.Writing: This is the biggest flaw in the show. The show should have been centered on Hannibal and his killing. It's not. Instead it centers around Will, who's a nobody and isn't particularly likeable as a character, and his mental illness. Making mental illness the main conflict in a TV series is always a mistake bc people don't want to see some person struggle with hallucinations or internal demons. It doesn't translate well to film. Ever. People want to see Will do his job and they want to see how the cunning FBI catches equally cunning serial killers. As a result, most of the show's plot is tedious and dragging nonsense that quickly becomes tiresome. Poor, poor decision making when it comes to the writing in this show. When it comes to characters like Dr. Bloom and Katz, the forensic tech, they are often involved in work that has nothing to do with their professions. Bloom is constantly blurring the lines between personal and professional relationships which is fairly unrealistic. She's also overly emotional, irrational and unprofessional. Her character is difficult to believe as a psychologist. As far as Katz, she frequently wears more makeup than any forensic tech should wear to work, is constantly making irritating little jokes and often shows up to places she's not needed and operates beyond the capacity as a forensic tech. It's like the show doesn't know who she is. The same way that Will is sometimes just working with the FBI as a consultant, sometimes is a teacher at the FBI academy and sometimes is a special agent for the FBI. There's not a lot of consistency in these characters and they're often appearing in roles and taking on duties that a person in their position would not. That being said, nothing detracts from the show more than the sob, pity drama surrounding Will and whether or not he's crazy. It's tedious, it's boring and it's dragged out for far too long. The show is called Hannibal, it should center on him, his murders and the cat and mouse game with the authorities. Instead, this would be like calling the show 'Micheal Meyers' and then focusing on Laurie Strode and whether or not her experiences have damaged her psychologically. No one with even half a brain would care about that story and no one with even a quarter of a brain is going to care about this one bc of the terrible writing choices. That's too bad."
469,"The dialogue gets worse every season, and so far, three episodes into the third season, omfg. Wow. Can anyone talk like a normal person? Who talks like this all the time?"
470,.....you're prepared to listen to constant random piano and drums and almost all actors whispering.I really enjoyed first couple of seasons but third was a real struggle. It's like everyone is a therapist now. The constant percussion noises are annoying at best and almost enough to drive you to murder.Da da da dum m...mmm.....I can catch you. ..da.da.da dum....... whisper.... whisper.....Repeat for more episodes. Season 3 done.I'd be genuinely interested if someone got stats on how long this season spent not whispering.
471,"Bryan Fuller's adaptation of Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal"" is magnificent. The series is a culmination of superb film-making, sophistication, substantial acting and honorable writing. The series is one which may never be called predictable. It is in fact the viewer who is predictable in this case. One may know the story from the books or the films, but one does not know this finely crafted story. I have found myself guilty of thinking I knew what was going to happen on numerous occasions in the series. Instances where this was most clear was in season 2's finale 'Mizumono' (10/10) and season 3's 'The Wrath of the Lamb' (10/10). The series is perfect in every sense and has redeemed Harris' ""Hannibal"". If you enjoyed Mark Gatiss' and Steven Moffat's ""sherlock"", you will enjoy this thoroughly."
472,"For many fans of the Hannibal Lechter films, the jury is still out on the new TV show, Hannibal. While the ratings have been passable, when you ask people what they think of the show, most will tell you they haven't seen it yet. If NBC would put more money into advertising and let it stream on Netflix, I have little doubt that this will be a top ten show.People are hesitant to watch a Lechter story without the legendary Anthony Hopkins, however once you get into the story, you will see that this isn't a problem. The series takes place in between the events of Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon, featuring Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) in his prime, as the FBI's top profiler. As seen in the opening scene of Red Dragon, Graham got help solving his cases from the world renowned psychologist, Dr. Hannibal Lechter (Mads Mikkelsen). The series focuses on this relationship, with Graham, who of course is in the dark over who Lechter really is. Lechter serves as a calming element in the vary chaotic and troubled life of Graham, and also plays the intermediary between Graham and his boss, Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne). This dynamic allows the FBI to solve some of the most heinous serial crimes they've been faced with.For those of you still hesitant about watching this series, a few things to keep in mind. The same writers, producers, and directors who worked on the four films are behind this series. There are frequent references to all the films, and points where they actually clear up plot holes from the films. That alone should be enough to get people interested, but what really brings the story to the same level as the film series is Hugh Dancy as Will Graham.Will Graham is a much deeper character than we came to know in Red Dragon. He is extremely complicated and as it turns out, not all that different from Lechter. Hugh Dancy, a veteran of a lot of bad movies, stars and is tremendous. Award shows are notorious for ignoring performances in series that feature gore and violence, but if anyone deserves an Emmy for best actor it his him. Dancy regularly gives a performance that is the best I've seen in a TV show since Breaking Bad. He really is that good.Mads Mikkelsen is also terrific as Dr. Lechter. I wasn't sure how a French guy known for B-movies would do taking on the epic character of Hannibal Lechter, but he has shown all the class, humor, and madness of the legendary character. Finally, Laurence Fishburne rounds out the cast as the only big name involved in the project. He plays the boss, Jack Crawford, and is very important as the man who brought Graham and Lechter together. In my opinion, Fishburne is the perfect choice as he's cold, emotionless, and deeply focused on on thing, getting the job done.You don't know most of the actors, but you know the characters. The cast of Hannibal is outstanding and will give you the chance to see your favorite characters in a whole other light. I love the Lechter films and was hesitant about watching this show myself. I didn't want to tarnish my view of the characters or the films, but this series is the missing companion piece that fills in the holes and gives you an all new appreciation for Lechter."
473,"OK, how season one start i was so exited to see greatest psycho of all time :) How produced create killing in his mind is so gorgeous...i know I'm crazy :D i love criminal minds in some sick way and i think people who watching this TV Series are same. About 1st season everything positive, killings, story 10+...but how second season start i was like wtf!!! So with fight of Hannibal and FBI agent is so wrong....it kills exited of all season...till episode five scenes are so obvious, you know the end of them easily because they show you in beginning Hannibal alive...if they didn't show beginning of season like that do you will know that hannibal will live"
474,"I'm not entirely sure where I stand on Hannibal, but having managed to catch every episode so far I think I've come to like it. It has incredibly strong cinematography, easily the highlight of the show; the visions, projections, and hallucinations of its lead character, Will Graham, expertly conceived and executed to convey an eerie unease that TV usually fails to produce when attempting. There are clearly skilled artists at work behind the scenes who know their craft, as most of the images and sets work very well to convey emotions. The story is also a relatively solid one, catching and holding your interest; the relationship between Hannibal and Graham a genuinely interesting one to watch develop. Where the show loses me, and why I can't give it the much better rating it would otherwise deserve, is its hesitance to abandon the common cop-show 'episodic' formula, and the excessive, sometimes silly levels of gore/disturbing set-pieces. Television is in a state of transition, perhaps even in its death throws, and as such has reached unheard of highs and unheard of lows. While the sea of tripe is wide and daunting, there are many absolute gems surfacing; Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire, Walking Dead, The Wire, etc. etc. The common trend among these fantastic new shows is their abandonment of the 'Episodic' formula so common in the 90's/early 2000's. Instead of new situations cropping up and individually dealt with every episode with only vague references to a broader plot (X-files, Law and Order, every version of CSI and most all crime shows since), shows are becoming more trusting of their audiences to pay attention, and are going with running plots which are focused on and developed from each episode to the next. Hannibal is almost there, but is still burdened with a want to introduce a new murderer with a new crazy methodology almost every episode. While it all connects back to the primary story of Hannibal and Will Graham, it often seems like a distraction, a waste of time. There's also an unhealthy obsession with disturbing gore in this show which, while understandable given its nature, goes overboard frequently. I remember I was watching this show with a friend who's critical of it, in a scene where Will Graham stands in an observatory, and looks through the lens of the telescope. ""..there's like, some brutally maimed corpse on the moon..."" he quickly quipped, and I couldn't help but laugh my ass of, as it almost wouldn't have surprised me. Near every episode there's a grisly, over-creative murder-scene, and while sometimes it's entirely plot appropriate, at others it's just excessive and silly. The 'Totem Pole' killer was particularly nonsensical, his motivations for his wildly gory arts and crafts project bordering on the non-existent, and making his whole story seem like nothing but an excuse to bust out that flesh-pole idea they'd been peddling.Definitely worth a watch though, just not if you're squeamish."
475,"Note: This is my first review and the fact that I'm a foreign of the English language may cause some grammatical errors and what not. So please, bear with me.I had first learned about Hannibal when it was in its first season. It took me a good while to start watching it, mainly because I was never a fan of NBC's original series (With the exception of Parks & Rec and The Office) but this show got me hooked like very few had. The coldness and charm Mads Mikkelsen gave to Lecter was just as good as Anthony Hopkins' original cannibal. And to be honest from all the characters the only one that really got into my skin was him.Besides from that the show is extremely gory and elegant at the same time, something that you can only see in a Hannibal's world. I was very hooked on Dexter for a while, and after its s*!&$% ending I think I just found its replacement.To sum up the show have an amazing skill of mixing everything together, a great cast and an OK script. But by far what I most like about it is its cinematography, in general. All real, vivid tones and great, great editing completing an almost perfect match for a television show.Yeah, sure, it have some clichés on the way. But what doesn't?"
476,"All this show does is cut and paste from all four Lecter films. Its pretty awful. I love Mads but Dancy sucks. Stop spoon feeding the audience the plot points. Not all americans are stupid, thank you very much. This show sucks and contaminates red dragon. ""Having said that though"" Edward Norton is on the top ten worst actors of all time, and for that Hugh Dancy shines as Will Graham."
477,"God I really want to love this. I've read all the books and it's definitely not an issue of things not lining up with the books. I don't care about that. It's a beautiful looking show with amazing characters and awesome gore, but it just feels like it's too much. They're asking way too much. I'm not looking for something believable. But this is just so far fetched out there and the things people choose to do or are talked into doing become laughable. And I don't want to laugh at this. But damn guys, come on... I will keep watching. But I'm a little bit disappointed."
478,This is almost as good as anything previously done...obviously the books are amazing and Hopkins was HANNIBAl but there is a devious sadistic story here exploring avenues you would have never expected of Dr. Lecter. This is some of the best stuff out right now hands down it's a much watch! (Get past episode 4) and you'll be hooked
479,"I've been a huge fan of the Hannibal franchise. I've seen all the movies and was excited to see a show coming out. I watched it and was not disappointed in any sense.The acting? Superb
The sets? GORGEOUS
The effects? Amazing
The writing? PerfectionYou can truly tell this show was made with a lot of passion and heart. Every time you rewatch an episode you see something new. A small set detail that speaks to the characters personalities, subtle foreshadowing in the dialogue, references to the movies and what inspired them everywhere!Subtly and characters are really this shows strong points. Which is perfect for a story about a psychologist murderer. Each character has depths and are insanely well written, you really feel for them and feel as if they're real.Also this is perfect as a sort of prequel/remake. They do make many changes but they never step on the toes of the original and the changes usually add to the story and even the movie at times, giving motivations for the movie characters and connecting things they say and do to that of the movie without repeating it all and keeping things surprising and interesting.If you're a fan of Hannibal I highly recommend this. If you're a fan of psychological horror, I highly recommend this, if you need a binge worthy intelligent show, I highly recommend this. Overall this show is amazing and worth everyone time who enjoys smart, well written, and at times a little freaky, shows and movies."
480,"I would argue this as artwork. Beautiful, tragic, thought provoking & spellbinding. Series like Hannibal don't come around often enough. I've watched it in it's entirety, the last season's pace was unusual but I am SO unbelievably glad I watched until the end."
481,"This is My first Review.
First I read Hannibal novel,so I knew hannibal's plot very well. But in this Tv series, I mean this series is something special. The details of anatomy,death and scenes are so dark that will give you creepy feel.The cooking and food presentation is great that you can think Dr hannibal can be champion in masterchef.
But Most complex thing is the Psychology.take your time to understand it so you can get vast knowledge.
Last thing is the Romance. 2 stranger come closer and become friend and enemy at the same time.these 2 starngers act is so attractive so that you will lose yourself in their ""Love Crime"".
Thanks"
482,"One of the best series I've ever seen in my life! 
The performance of Mikkelsen is perfect! The Hannibal character fits him perfectly! 
The storyline is great! 
A very well adapted version."
483,"I have watched this series many times and I have to say it is beautiful. The writing, music, and special effects is impeccable. The story grows the deeper you go. It is unsettling and dark.Pay attention and put your phone down so you can appreciate the writing."
484,"To create something off a classical movie is not an easy task, you basically have everything to lose and you know the audience will compare it to it's original. But that's were the directors were smart and said from the start they would not follow the story from the originals in any way and rather create their own universe to stand on, and they really pulled it off brilliantly. Only thing that stays the same would be Hannibal Lecter. He is still the monster we all love. The storyline starts off with Hannibal as a psychiatrist dealing with troubled individuals and offer them the treatment he see fit. And we get introduced to a new character which in many ways replaces the role Jodie Foster had in the original movies in Will Graham which is played by Hugh Dancy, an FBI profiler with the ability to empathize with serial killers. The show really focus on Hannibal's and Will's journey and their fascinating friendship. So to finish it off: The show is brilliantly made. It's a show you can watch without having to read the books or the previous movies. The portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is almost the same level off what Hopkins did in the past. The visuals is some of the best you will see to this date. And they are not afraid to push some borders which for me is great, for others might be a little disturbing so be beware of some very graphic scenes."
485,"I was really hoping for this to be brilliant and like many i find the topic of hannibal very interesting. However for all the good elements to this series it was distracted by too many flaws and repetition.I personally love the slower counseling sessions and reading between the words in conversation, but i found there are so many scenes repeated over and over that i detracted from what could have been a more cohesive and interesting series.Firstly repetition of dreams while often stunning became a little tiresome and my word there are a serious amount of serial killers in this area! I am surprised there is anyone else left! And without giving anything away they are some seriously stupid FBI not to get a fairly good idea who the killer was!!!! I know people will say that the repetition is necessary as about madness of the mind as much as anything else which builds and builds but i would argue the audience got the gist and didn't need beating round the head with it to get the picture. Anyway, very brief summary but overall enjoyed it all but could have been a lot better considering some of the talented actors/actresses"
486,"This is one of the better shows I've seen on NBC. I am amazed at what they can get away with on network TV these days. It's pretty awesome! This series is an interweaving of all the books and movies with some new stuff added in to make a more fleshed out detailed. I think they really did a good job of it too. It's really fascinating and the script and dialogue between he characters, although a bit pithy, is really well written and just clever as heck. I love Will's and Hannibal's relationship. If you have a weak stomach, this is not for you. Wow, it is gruesome! Some of the mode-optives of the serial killers are just crazy and there's a lot of irony involved in the killings. There's one serial killer who plants his victims live into the ground and uses their bodies as fertilizer. When they are dug up, they have plants and mushrooms growing right out of their bodies. One serial killer creates a totem poll of his victims and one serial killer poses them skins their backs to create wings and then with string and wire, poses them to look like praying angels.. Hannibal is a killer psychiatrist who helping the FBI solves murders, including the ones he committed. Will Graham is a teacher and Serial Killer expert who just has a knack for getting in their heads and figuring out what they did, why they did it and when and where they may strike next. I can't wait until season 2 to see what happens because season one really ended with a bang"
487,"I really wanted to like this show. It had potential but my GOD I'm mid way thru season 3 and am READY FOR IT TO BE OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I almost gave up in season 2)I watch 90% of episodes on mute because of the score. It's almost unwatchable with sound! The drums, the loud shrieking = INCREDIBLY IRRITATING!Any time there's music it's WAY TOO LOUD. It doesn't help set the scene or mood.Don't get me started on the plot holes and the utter stupidity of most of the characters. UGH."
488,"Even though it has nothing to do with Hopkins' Hannibal, Mads Mikkelsen's shallower version of the character is the only good thing about this series. Even he however can't carry the show on his own. By the end of the 3rd season he seems as he can't wait to get it over with and for a good reason. The show can be summarized with one word - forced."
489,"I like themes like this, big fan of serial killer movies but this one is just unrealistic.Scientifically and... even mere logically incoherent.To be honest, at this point, might as well give the detective actual superpowers and put it in the fantasy genre."
490,"I can't even watch this because it makes me cringe so much. The music and spooky noises are so ridiculously loud compared to the dialogue which is a great distraction from the bad acting and incoherent plot. Excessive gore and unnecessary sex scenes are another great way to distract from bad writing and acting. Silence of the lambs didn't try this hard to be so ""psychological"" and this pales in comparison. The weird visual scenes, flashbacks, and loud noises ruin this show the most. Typical bad thriller go-to is to make scenes super loud to seem scary when it wouldn't be otherwise. Gah this show really sucks."
491,"I don't want to tick the spoiler box.But I do want to kick my TV-screen in.I have nothing bad to say about 25 of the 26 episodes.But now my TV has a nice big target on it.I loved all the performances (especially Hugh Dancy's), the food porn, the incredible shot composition, Brian Reitzel's amazing soundtrack. I put up with the pretentious pseudo-philosophy, and random tenseness, because it was all part of the glorious, glorious ride.But now I have my big boots lined up in front of the TV, and I sit in the dark contemplating whether the set will survive.I would happily give this series 10/10. Happily.But the angel of destruction of the 26'th ... demands that my TV die.And so, I can only give this series 5/10.Writers, producers, directors.You have some work to do.And you might owe me a new TV."
492,"Overall, if you love Bryan Fuller productions with wonderful (awesome) actors whom present the intentions of Mr. Fuller's vision; I recommend this and hope that you love/like it just as much. I will not put anything specific to the show, as when I do I normally spoil (and I do not like to), but if you have followed Bryan Fuller's work then I would recommend this. Warning there is a lot of dialogue to this and is not a comedy as Dead Like Me was. This is all a play on words and with each time of watch, one will notice something new. So, as I have been going on a tangent and need to wrap up my point, I recommend this completely and will continue to show my displease at the canceling. I for one, and all the others will agree, this series needs to be continued. Hopefully this review is of help.From me to you, George"
493,"I've recently watched and re watched 3 seasons of Hannibal.still can't believe it's over for good :( the show was so powerful and had particular audience.Such a thoughtful and brilliant show should go on for at least 7 seasons. Bryan Fuller did a great job portraying the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham, something that was missing even in the original books of Tomas Haris. Did show really needs to be saved by on of the networks. I know that eventually they have to continue the story, even 7-8 u=years later(like what they did to Arrested Development).Spoiler....................The ending though ....Oh My God! the season 3 finale, that awesome soundtrack(Love Crime),was outstanding."
494,"When I first heard of this show I had high hopes but low expectations. After finishing the first season I have to say that my hope was rewarded and the overall quality reaching far, FAR beyond my expectations.Not only is this a good show, but is a GREAT show, in ways I didn't imagine. It is a psychological thriller centering around the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham, where Mads Mikkelsen (excellently) plays Lecter as a truly cold and calculating psychopath and Hugh Dancy (also really good) playing a profiler with a superb, but double-edged ability to empathize with serial killers. And it is here we find one of the show's greatest (and most surprising) strengths; Graham's gradual descent into mental instability caused by his superior profiling capabilities.We're given a really dark and unpleasant view into someones crumbling mental state, and that's all enhanced by the show's dark visuals, graphic imagery and haunting auditory.Full review: http://kenikkiscorner.blogspot.se/2013/06/series-review- hannibal-season-1.html#more"
495,"I see people like this, but I expect more, not less, when you have an opportunity to improve on the story.Mads Mikkelsen is a good Hannibal but the writers and director don't have a clue about what they were doing. It's sort of like Dexter but at the end when it sucked. Dexter was ok for one or two seasons, then it went down hill.Writers in Hollowood really need to get their heads out of their brass. They can't write anything original any more and they are in a quagmire of boring. The plots are filled with errors that they are obvious to a blind person.There is nothing about this show that was good except for Mikkelsen and that isn't enough to give it a good rating."
496,Completely ruined by bad writing. I won't give any spoilers but you're safe to watch the first season and then pretend there aren't any others. It reminds me of Three's Company. You know the one where they jump to conclusions. All of them.
497,"Seasons one and two very enjoyable and was really looking forward to the third but....oh dear.
As other people have written, had to drink to get through it as it disappears so far up its own backside. Plot? Style over substance unfortunately. Yawn city... Anyway you get the point."
498,"In and of itself, the three seasons of HANNIBAL have become good. It is mocked, there is a litre of blood and the actions are clear.
The Characters Hannibal Lecter, Will Graham and Jack Crawford are also cast, with the actors Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy and Laurence Fishburne.
The one who knows the movies with Anthony Hopkins may get a culture shock here: you won't be directly involved in the plot and it takes a long time for the stories to get going. The creative mind behind the series, Bryan Fuller, succeeds in balancing art, mythology, thrillers and blood.
Two seasons are persecuted, hunted and deceived. It only becomes critical from the third season. The story is divided with Hannibal and Verger. In the second half, the Red Dragon comes into play.
For some, this series is certainly boring and rarely gets to the point.
For the other fans, it's waiting for the next trophy on the table and what meal Hannibal serves on the table.
Verdict: Modern adaptation of the novel hero, which in some places is too long!"
499,"I love visual cinema. You can see it from my ratings. I adore Fincher and Ford, I loved ""Moonlight"", ""Drive"" and ""I Am Love"". Films like paintings, that communicate more through the color palette and composition than through action or dialogue, thrill me to no end. I'm pretentious like that.Having said that, ""Hannibal"" is visual approach gone wrong. And believe me, I wanted to like it.But what's a girl to do when the FBI has about five agents in the whole city? Really makes you wonder how they fit all those murderers in there - there's a new one in every episode! Each with a penchant for aesthetically pleasing killing. Thank God, otherwise the only reporter in town would've nothing to do! All of these agents eat up Will Graham's every word, even though his ideas are often... lacking. A man is hung by his own back skin up in the air and he concludes it's suicide? F*cking hell.Not to mention his obvious mental instability. The man looks like he's about to fall over any moment! But nah, we'll just send him to Dr Lecter after hours. He'll be fine.The power plays between the characters could be delicious if they weren't so clumsily executed. Everyone's thought processes make me imagine their neurotransmitters as lazy flies hung in honey. Or perhaps, you know, they think so slowly not to commit any faux pas. Cause ""Hannibal"" is soooo sophisticated, OMG. You couldn't possibly make rude comments on the weird taste of meat on one of Lecter's dinner parties. You might drown out that harpsichord in the background.They talk slowly, too. And the dialogue is so sparse. I suspect that's what gives ""Hannibal"" the air of depth that many people rave about. (That and the slow mo symbolic sequences scattered through the main ""plot"". And the disturbing atonal music in the soundtrack.) But for one, it's not enough to talk nice and slow to give your words meaning. And apart from that, all the characters have a disturbingly similar way of thinking, like they're in the same sect of something. Could it be that the writer couldn't get over his own worldview? I really feel bad for the actors whose work in this was mainly giving each other long looks and moving in slow motion.*** As you can see, I really can't run out of reasons to bash this pompous piece of trash. I don't even know why I'm giving it 5 stars. Must be my love for pretty things speaking. Cause I have to give ""Hannibal"" that: I'd never have thought death could be so aesthetically pleasing. The crime scenes in this show are among the most morbidly beautiful things I've ever seen on screen.Other than that, it's as hollow as a blown egg."
500,"(SPOILER ALERT) So, season 3. Something many people complain about. I have to admit it was pretty bad made compared to the first 2 seasons but I can't say I didn't enjoy it at all but, again, it does have some pretty big flaws.* Characters survivingOh please, at the end of season 2 we have some major deaths. OH WAIT, yeah. I don't remember many people dying. Actually I can't name 2 characters that died. Now, Will pretty much had to survive, he is the Jon Snow of ""Hannibal"". I'm also OK with Abigail being alive but come on, the rest of the characters really didn't have to survive. The writer of this show has to learn to let go, my advice is to talk with George R.R. Martin.* The plot is very confusing.There is just to many shadow on different parts of the story that could have been explained better.* Season 1 and 2, Hannibal is a cannibal serial killer. Season 3, Hannibal is just a killer. People find serial killers interesting, that's why people watch Dexter. Season 3 just didn't have that.*** NOW WHAT I LIKED ABOUT SEASON 3The writer opened so many different opportunities for prequel-seasons, like Hannibal's time in Italy before he came to USA, or even before that, his early life. Also I'm not sure if he was killed by the fall so that road is always open. Anyway ""Hannibal"" is an amazing TV Show, I recommend it to you all! :D"
501,"I have now seen the first season and two episodes of the second season, and I'm impressed with this show. Making a TV-series based on Hannibal Lecter feels like a challenge. The character is so closely associated with Anthony Hopkins, and in my opinions, the quality of the franchise has suffered since Silence of the Lambs (in my opinion). I have read a few of the books and I was generally unimpressed. This show on the other hand manages to make something more out of it.What I like most about this show is how the story progresses with each episode, many times I feel that TV-series are afraid to go places. They tend to stagnate for a few episodes and not really move the general plot forward. In Hannibal there is a distinct wish to develop the characters and the story in each episode, and I'm still interested to see where it takes us.What I feel less ecstatic about is the level of gore in the show. I don't feel that you would really need this amount of blood and grimy killings, it doesn't add very much to the show and if you are averse to that sort of thing I imagine it could put you off. Also, there is a very dense amount of killing, many episodes feature a large amount of victims. This doesn't feel entirely credible, I don't have the statistics to know the number of serial killers in the US in the last decade. But here they seem to grow on trees.In general the actors do a fine job. Mikkelsen is a good Lecter, although I wish that he had worked some more on getting rid of his Danish accent. Maybe I'm more bothered by it than most (being from Sweden), but it doesn't entirely fit the character. Otherwise, no complaints.I would recommend this show to anyone wanting an interesting viewing experience, who is not really looking for casual watching, and who doesn't mind the level of gore or darkness that this show provides. It can be bothersome to watch at times, both visually and psychologically. But then again, that's sort of the point.7/10."
502,"This TV series is a typical psycho-killer based series with blood, gore and some mystery to keep you hooked . It delivers all you expect it to. The main guy is Will Graham, an unstable guy who has the power to empathize with killers and put himself to their point of view. The FBI uses him to solve some of their cases and this somewhat damages Will, with each time he empathizes he grows weaker. That's where Dr. Hannibal Lecter comes in. He is loved by everyone for their respect towards his profession and cooking. He is somehow associated with FBI and thus is told to take Will Graham under his supervision. Now there is something strange about Hannibal , but i'll leave the intrigue and nail biters to you guys. Do watch this show, it's awesome."
503,"First thing,this is an extremely well made show and Hannibal is played to perfection. The problem with it is,and this is true for a couple of shows at the time,the FBI comes across like morons where as the bad guy comes across as brilliant. If Will had to be written as well in the show as in the books this would have been as great as everybody says it is."
504,"It a good series for sure and really entertaining; BUT some of the murders are so staged that it would have taken the killer days or at least a week to put the scene together. They are staged in public places which apparently had little foot-traffic for a really long time; must have been post-covid-19.In one of the killings, the victim is all tied up and suspended from the ceiling, and he was suppose to have done this to himself? I don't understand.I'm good at suspending my disbelief ( I mean I live in the age of the Trump administration), but this is harder than that, and that's really hard.Show has incredibly beautiful actresses in it however, one after another (hope that doesn't sound sexist, just the truth).Madds should have skipped this movie because now he will always be Hannibal. He can never play a good-guy part again. Kind of the opposite of Jim Caviezel after ""The Thin Red Line"". I can't watch a movie with him in it if he is a bad guy cause he played so convincingly the part of a person that was so pure and good."
505,"It's not the same Hannibal as the original films, it's different, and intentionally different to keep the series running (rather than something 1-dimensional). The plot itself is a drawn out version of the movie, wherein Hannibal helps the FBI catch serial killers. Sometimes I get lost in the show thinking, how does this one city have this many F'd up serial killers? Despite that, the visuals are pretty incredible and a lot of thought was put into the kills/deaths. Storyline is lacking, but the gore makes up for it."
506,"This is really great show,from acting to everything else. I can't stop watching this,so dark,intense,psychological and brutal!! Better than Red Dragon,Hannibal and Hannibal rising. Great show!!"
507,"Hannibal, is the show were you have intresting characters, but the characters do not make the most sense. Hannibal needs very little work, for me it had more so do with how old they made him apear next to Will, if they made Hannibal look younger or Will older than this would have been fine.Will on the other hand could not seem to make up his mind if he liked or hated Hannibal; while this does seem to be one of the reasons Hannibal is drawn to Will at first. I do not believe this is something even Hannibals character would have wanted to play for as at as long as he did. Hannibal had to wait two possibly three years before Will even atempted a friendship of some sort.The show could be about 5 to 10 minutes longer. The show did need at least one extra scene per episode to make the development of the plot and characters have more structure in the show and their relationships."
508,"Hannibal, this show is perfect! The writing of this show just blows my mind every single character is unpredictable, the choices they make and the way this show unravels is flawless. Dr Hannibal Lecter is the kind of person you are supposed to hate but I find my self sympathising for him I feel sad when the things are not going well for him or when he is hurt and all the credit goes to the writers they did an amazing job of writing this character he truly was unpredictable, even by the end of season 3 I just couldn't figure out if I could trust him or not. Will Graham is also very well fleshed out as a character and throughout the run of this show, all I was wishing was that he doesn't die. These two characters are truly the way Dr Bedelia describes them ""Can't live with him. Can't live without him."" When these two characters are together it just makes you feel happy even though their friendship is toxic it just feels right every time they reunite.About the show now, It is a masterpiece. There is a lot of violence and gore throughout the show and its heart-wrenching. Throughout the three seasons of this show, I constantly found myself at the edge of the seat and just restless. There are a few episodes which are hard to watch the gravity of violence hits you.Season 1 is all of setting up the world and making us familiar to the characters and Season 2 is where the show is at its peak the incidents that happen in season 2 are incredible. Finally, the Season 3 of this show is very slow-paced it might get a little boring in the beginning but trust me as the story progress it gets exciting and the finale of this show is not disappointing you feel like you have had a journey and also a bit sad that the show is over.All in all, this is an excellent show the writing, action sequences everything is handled with a lot of attention to detail."
509,"Unless you have seen Hannibal, it is difficult to understand how can a horror story about a cannibalistic serial killer be so alluring. I have never before come across a show with such intellectually stimulating and intelligent dialogues. Visually, every scene is a masterpiece - the show is so artistic and esthetic, that I often wondered 
how can a horror show actually be so beautiful! It is dark, suspenseful, thrilling, and sophisticated - so much so, that it cannot be compared to any other show in the genre except for, maybe, the Bates Motel. 
If you are a fan of Mads Mikkelsen, you are likely to consider this show as his magnum opus. As Hannibal, everything about him appears mesmerizing and brilliant - including his accent."
510,"Mads Mikkelsen is such a convincing actor it makes one wonder if meeting him in person potentially translates to my last day on earth, sliced, skewered and if I will be presented with a dab of foie gras on the side. Such is his portrayal of the macabre Dr. Hannibal Lecter, cringeworthy but with such Da Vinci palette strokes, one cant help but watch.Gillian Anderson also showed a different facet to her, graceful , barbaric, unrelated to any of the past characters she portrayed , there will be no moment you will be reminded of those.If the taboo is a form of fuel to the creative engine one soul represses, this is the material that will challenge you to think, not scream."
511,"Although gripping, I found this series very frrustrating to watch. Why is it that directors allow actors to constantly speak in whispers, especially in series three? I ran it through surround sound with speakers on high just to try to get the dialogue with constant rewinds, but when an action event came on it was deafening, which spoiled what should have been decent entertainment. I would advise skipping episode six, series three, as it's just a compilation of clippings and a complete waste of time."
512,Hannibal is cooking up a Michelin star dinner with corpses as the main course. i really enjoyed the show ! if you enjoyed any of the Hannibal themed movies you'll surely enjoy this show. a unique take on the red dragon idea story and i really loved the blood. would have to say the cooking aspect was one of my favorite parts too. cast of actors is top notch.the way that Will can see the murder through his eyes is very cool and Hannibal is a complete madman.
513,"Very few crime dramas are well made and this is one of them. However, there is one thing that is extremely annoying and it ruins the while watching experience. It is the background music, especially in season 2. That ticking morbid sounds are distracting, mind numbing and they do not add anything to the overall darkness it intends to portray. Whomever thought this is a good idea, was very much wrong."
514,Buckle up everyone.This one is a doozy. You might have guessed from the title what's the show is all about.I'm just here to tell you what to expect from the show.This show is the derivative from the film 'The Silence of the Lambs'.Yes the film which won Sir Philip Anthony Hopkins the Oscar for a short but an effective role as Hannibal.This show is a little bit different from the film but as the same intensity of the film.Dr.Hannibal Lecter is a character that is always listed as one of the top villains of all time.He is also one of the most terrifying villains just because of his profession.He is psychiatrist.He has the ability to kill your mind and your body.After he kills you he will eat you.I know it's sick to even think about it but if the execution is perfect then it will be a success.So let's get into the world of H(C)annibal.http://paul96.org/hannibal-the-cannibal/ http://paul96.org/dr-hannibal-lectar-the-psychotic-psychiatrist/ http://paul96.org/will-graham-the-epitome-of-empathy/ http://paul96.org/jack-crawford-a-stellar-abettor/ http://paul96.org/the-concept-of-cannibalism-subjecthannibal-lectar/ http://paul96.org/hannibal-the-best-episodes/
515,"Whoever wrote the scene about the girl killing the elk, which becomes a whitetail deer once it's lain on the table in the cabin, wherein they begin to gut (field dress) it..... y'all need to write in accuracy and authenticity. Unless you are a city boy, you field dress, ah um, in the field. It makes the body lighter, for one thing, and the woods critters dispose of the offal so you won't have to when you get home. And you don't kill a cow elk and have it miraculously become a whitetail doe once it's on the butcher block at home. Idiots. Another reason to quit watching tv."
516,Can't stand Will Graham any longer....he is just a bore....Mikkelsen not much better...
517,"The show's characters are based upon the book 'Red Dragon'.It is nicely crafted and all characters seems to add depth to the story. The plot revolves around an FBI criminal profiler who is gifted with an ability to look at a crime seen from the eyes of the killer, but this ability makes him vulnerable to horrifying hallucinations.On the other hand Dr.Hannibal Lector looks like a well groomed psychoanalyst who seems to understand Will's problem.The cinematography is superb and the acting is good so I think all in all this seems to be the next big thing in the genre of Crime and Thrillers as far as TV shows are concerned."
518,"The cinematic and symphonic aspects: great. The acting: ya it's there. The plot holes and real life psycholgical field of practice and criminal justice/federal government that privatize (FBI) regulations in this show is real?! No. No. No. No. definitely not there. Then...spoiler alert: they make hannibal in love with Will, but was saving that for a second. But I wasn't mad learning it because hannibal straight up told his psychologist in season 1 he was Will's friend and wanted to be friends that's how romances start.
The thing I hate: Will is on the autism spectrum and asbergers syndrome (supposed), so he has incredible empathy (on the show) but lack of reciprocity of feeling if he had this issue mentally (which is what they told us he had from day one?!) Do he's a guy who shouldn't feel, and is socially inept, on a clinical level, unstable, yet incredibly empathetic, able to woo a woman, keeps animals, helps to solve crimes, yet kisses and is in love with a cannibal. Yep, really believable writing."
519,"In 1981 Harris published Red Dragon, which introduced us to a character, forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter. This character was elaborated in his following novels, The Silence Of The Lambs(1988) and Hannibal(1999).All the novels were made into full length feature films starring Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter and all were commercial successes. Harris wrote a prequel Hannibal Rising(2006), which explores the boyhood of Hannibal. The prequel was a flop and great disappointment to fans and critics worldwide. This series is about the life of Hannibal when he was working with FBI special investigator Will Graham, and the time when he was killing young teenage girls. He was dubbed the Chesapeake Ripper by the media, a name he found exceedingly rude. Hannibal explores the interaction between a exceedingly inhuman character towards normal, human persons. In the TV series it is revealed to us earlier that Hannibal is the Chesapeake Ripper, and the series main plot-device is what heinous deed will do next...The series features over the top gore and makeup effects. It also shows Hannibal cutting up human body parts to make his meals, which he then serves to others or eats alone. Hugh Dancy gives a superb performance as Will Graham, as well as Laurence Fishburne who plays Special Agent-in-Charge Jack Crawford. The X-Files star Gillian Anderson has a small role as Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier, who is Lecter's psychotherapist.The main difference between the Harris novel's and this television series is that the Hannibal portrayed here is an exceedingly evil calculating killer who can strike at any given moment. Plus he also kills persons that are not ""rude""(as he calls them). We are able to see for the first time the special gift that Will Graham possesses which is a kind of flashback through the eyes of the person or persons doing the killing. The series ins interspersed with other serial killers besides Dr. Lecter such as Dr. Abel Gideon, a surgeon institutionalized for killing his family, who is led to believe that he is the Chesapeake Ripper by Dr. Chilton. Tobias Budge (Demore Barnes) plays a musician who is secretly a serial killer. Matthew Brown (Jonathan Tucker) plays an orderly who is also a vicious killer. This Series is a bonus to fans of Thomas Harris. Now you have a lot more to see after you have seen all the previous Lecter films...Other serial killer movies: The Gray Man(2007), Albert Fish: In Sin He Found Salvation(2007), Citizen X(1995), Evilenko(2004), The Deliberate Stranger(1986), Ted Bundy(2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), Dahmer (2002), To Catch A Killer (1992), Dear Mr. Gacy (2010) The Boston Strangler (1968), Deranged(1974), Cannibal (2006). These films are based upon the lives of real-life serial killers. Thanks for reading."
520,"Although critical exploit the fact classic big-screen TV, with typical ""If...?"" or common ""What happened before...?"" This series has caught me by surprise. Although the character of Will Graham is far from created by Edward Norton in Red Dragon. This is a much more fragile and fickle character . It is perhaps the only thing I did not just fit in the series , but you may also try their own evolution once met the cannibal. Another thing I did not expect is that Crawford was black . Anyway, Lawrence Fishbourne is a great actor and also complies neither comes to hair that inquisitive look that usually always put. Arrived at Lecter ... you had to be a real headache for the casting director to find a credible Lecter after Anthony Hopkins. This Hannibal is more threatening, less charming and seems to be more twisted, which I like, but one of the great attractions of Hopkins was certainly raise that Really is this man so dark? And then you put those eyes and said ... Yes, it is ... With this already suspected from the beginning, but I must admit I have fallen well. The resources that are used to enter the mind of Graham by reference to their ability to breading with murderers is pretty gimmicky, but maybe I can become tiresome if they abuse them just a little. And the story seems good."
521,"This show is remarkable. To be honest the first episode wasn't my favorite; I liked it quite a bit, but I wasn't entirely sold on the idea. However, the more I watched, the more I loved this show. The most recent episode is my favorite, and I know they have plenty of deliciously disturbing plans for future episodes. Overall, the storyline is captivating, the acting is incredible (Mads Mikkelsen is in some ways a better Hannibal than Hopkins), and the cinematography is reminiscent of Sherlock (in other words, innovative and phenomenal). If you're a fan of dark shows (think Dexter or American Horror Story) or if you like crime thrillers (think CSI), then this is a great show for you. This is a must-see show!"
522,"I had heard so much about this intense, well crafted show. I was kind of looking forward to it. Mikkelsen and Fishburne are great. This was just...laughable. I hoped that maybe I'd get used to will Graham's actor ridiculous over-acting. The ""acting"" was so bad , and often so uncalled for, it made for humorous scenes that weren't meant to be. The plots of those first few episodes again, were funny. No excitement, no tension - out of the blue they run in and arrest ""the killer"". We kind of lose track of which killer master mind we're after. The guy planting for mushrooms...I mean...I don't even know what to say. How did he even make it out the door in the morning? Mainstream TV at it's worst."
523,"Having always been intrigued by Hannibal.. This series explores his extraordinary ability to manipulate situations/people to his advantage.. You really get the feel of Hannibal a few episodes in, Mads masters his air of power and control, creating an air of mystery an Fear around him, obvious to the viewer but yet leaving the other cast unaware of his manipulation. I must admit i'm not a fan of Will Graham's ""condition"" to help him solve crimes; it doesn't seem true to the book by giving him an actual condition.. He just can make the jumps without having that ability housed in a medical condition.. Graham's performance is good however and Jack Crawford is played well if not a bit awkwardly.. All in all, the show is more mind games and psychology than gore although the murders within are.. Well horrendous to see.. Any fan of the books won't be disappointed and neither will anyone with a penchant for intellectually stimulating drama.Enjoy... (as I do!!!)"
524,"Having just watched the pilot episode of the new American TV series Hannibal, one cannot but draw references and parallels with the 'Hannibal' material already extant, and perhaps, also, to the Millennium series starring Lance Henriksen.The character Hannibal Lecter engages our interest for any number of reasons, he certainly engaged mine, as I have read all the books, and have all the movies on DVD, but I don't obsessively re-read or re-watch the material over and over again, so there's nothing to be read (in the way of a profile) for my interest in the character. The Lecter universe came from the mind of American author Thomas Harris, so what sort of profile about him could be gleaned about that? I thought the pilot episode too short. I felt it would've profited more by dealing more with Hobbs' killings. We enter the frame after he has killed 8 girls, but we soon learn that one of the murders was not Hobbs', but made to look as if it were to hide the real killer and his motive.Will Graham, a character whom is the opposite side of Lecter's coin, twins of polarity, equally engages our interest, through his flawed and fragile disposition. He's an acute empath, and able to intuit motives of others by their actions and words, able to feel other's pathological behaviour and know their raison detre, bringing him face to face with the most unpleasant knowledge.Hugh Dancy plays the character of Graham with too much overwrought conviction, he makes him too fragile, bordering on dysfunctionality, and doesn't present the one thing that drives him to take on the cases...his sense of wanting to protect and to bring justice, for without which, his empathetic ability would have him constantly crumble into a heaped mass of gibbering insularism. Dancy needs to dial the fragility back, and dial forward a bit more on his inner strength.Mads Mikkelsen seems to be playing his Bond bad guy character in portraying Lecter. He needs to bring more gravitas to the character as Lecter is a super-intelligent, socio-psychopath of incredible range and versatility, with an almost supernatural sense of foresight, and as such, a most fearsome predator. He too, paradoxically, is an empath, but in the negative sense to Graham's, having disconnected morality altogether from the ability due to environmental life experiences whilst growing up...utterly devoid and incapable of emotional response or connection.The series is not gruesome enough, nor dark enough in resonance, and therefore lacks the gravitas it needs to convey the terror of both Graham's empathetic immersion into the killer's mind, and the actual acts of the killer. The way the series presents Graham's actual immersion into his empathetic imagination will soon become repetitive and annoying, so I hope future episodes see a lessening in its use.With a little more daring and darkness, a little more immersion into that which Graham is capable of imagining, this series, already a winner, could become a classic series, but it needs to take more substantial risks as it is too sanitised for its subject matter."
525,"An interesting bloodfest and Hannibal's subtle manipulation of Will Graham in S1 is especially interesting because Will Graham is basically Dr. Reid from Criminal minds, so it's a duel.
But I can't take the stupidity of the rest of the FBI staff, especially the boss Jack Crawford. Transfer these guys to the Lifetime Movie police. He dogmatically believes the first theory that pops into his head as a fact, in one second he concludes, 'its a suicide' and will brook no contrary explanations, 'you are speculating that this is a homicide', yeah but the suicide is also sheer speculation. Can't stand the guy. Hannibal fools him for two seasons because he's so easy to trick.
By S3 it gets weird in a bad way. Even the character's voices change. everyone looks into each other's eyes like they are all vampires.I know I am making this sound terrible but I heard great things about the show and it did have its moments. If you like gore, top notch, very realistic and the things they did were as bad as nightmarishly ghoulish and sickening and you can't look away. If you are a sensitive (or normal) person, and you see something you hate, it only gets worse.Dr. Frederick Chilton, this guy cannot catch a break, was this supposed to be some kind of sick long running joke? At first I hated the guy but now I feel really sorry for him.Beverly Katz - Hot Korean actress, smart, wish she got more screen time but the time she had was well spent."
526,"Genius, intelligent series, with a photograph of ""Falling Chin"", brilliant actors and actresses! Mads Makkilsen makes you forget the old Hannibal from the also cool AnthonyHopkins easily, Hung Dancy, Laurence Fishburne and Caroline Dhavernas are great too! And the soundtrack ?! Fantastic! Hannibal is a masterpiece in the universe of the great series and also a series much, but much above the curve of good series, perhaps an Everest!"
527,The show is not bad but Will Graham's acting sucks. He always has the same face expression!
528,"This show is definitely thrilling but is also very creepy. I was only able to watch the first four episodes even though I kind of enjoyed them. I just had a feeling it would only get ""darker"" as it progressed and decided to stop watching it. I would definitely recommend this show to people with a strong gut. The actors are great in their roles and the plot unravels pretty quickly, but definitely has the creepiest vibe of any show on TV. I don't know how long this show could keep going though because of people like me who are scared to get creeped out even further. Also, it is much better to watch this show if you have seen Silence of the Lambs previously."
529,"Okay, after doing a complete watch-thru once again of all three seasons I am ready to give a final scoring and review of Hannibal.I will just say this show was a pretty fun ride. Not true to the books but it was an entertaining version of characters masterfully written by Thomas Harris.This review will just summarize my scores from my more detailed rants and walkthroughs of most of the episodes.Season 1Season 1 we are introduced to all the great characters from the books. With a few minor variations. Though the Season was pretty good. it wasn't without hiccups here and there. But through the averages of the episode scores Season 1 ends up with an 8 of 10.Season 2Season 2 there were a few hiccups. A couple episodes were just incredibly average which really didn't help. Plenty of Lecter dinner parties however kept the season afloat. Season 2 gets a 7 /10.Season 3
Whenever a show gets news they are cancelled that can have a devastating effect. especially if they are still filming. Not exactly sure how the news or even IF the news affected the writing or storyline at all, but judging from the final episodes of this season I can only conclude that it must have. Season 3 gets a score of 7/10 from me. I really didn't care for a lot of how there was little regard for human life at all in a few of these episodes.So overall the show gets a barely 7/10 based on the average of 3 seasons from me. I will say, I rate Mads Mikkelson as Hannibal Lecter a perfect 10 /10. He was great in this role. The other actors, really really good. Especially Gillian in her part and how it developed through the seasons. I always enjoyed Hugh Dancy and Fishburne of course as Jack Crawford. The 2 different actors that played Pig Man were really awesome also.Overall a good show. I can be proud of saying that ive watched seasons 1 to 3 thru 3 times!!! And I will probably watch them all again someday. Kudos to Bryan Fuller and team for bringing Hannibal Lecter to Life once again."
530,"It's a very visual show with some interesting photography.
The food presentation is outstanding.
The actors are fairly good, Gillian Anderson swallows her words.
Will Graham has one expression.
Richard Armitage performs some exceptional acrobatics.
I can't find anything else to say to recommend this show. After watching season 3 I had a rethink about this show. There were complaints about Season 3 but the problem lies with the writers of the show. Too much emphasis throughout was placed on the actual profiling of the crimes, and how Will cracks it and Hannibal interferes because he has often had some interaction with the so called killers. The Red Dragon is a good example, because with the Buffalo killings, Will goes to the house and looks round the crime scene twice. The writers are obsessed with the protagonists and not with the antagonist, i.e. the Red Dragon. If we had been allowed (if that is not too much to ask of these so called clever people) to see the Red Dragon himself performing the crime we might have been more interested and more involved in the Third series. This is the same kind of thing that goes on in that other psychological thriller, Killing Eve and its BORING."
531,"An absolutely brilliant show but all of the female main characters are for the most part intolerable, especially the fact they weren't originally females but were made such simply to put a romantic spin on a story where it wasn't necessary. I have read about peoples anger that Beverly was killed to further the story, none of that makes any sense to me because her character was essentially a bit part meant to further Will and Hannibals story but that in itself is the story. Feminists will be mad about something even when nothing worthwhile presents itself."
532,"""Hannibal"" had pretty big shoes to fill and mostly succeeds, with great craft and many good ideas; but there's also a few irritants-occasional, and chronic.Some actors do an outstanding job: Laurence Fishburne flawlessly portrays Jack Crawford's ""misleading obtuse mien"", Raúl Esparza actually elevates the thankless Chilton role, and Richard Armitage's chilling physical performance of Dolarhyde was arresting. Dancy and Mikkelsen are quite up to snuff, too, but could've notched down their respective extremes: Graham too often one breath short of epileptic, and Lecter a bit too inexpressive (though at least compensated by a livelier physicality); still, I wish they'd gone with a native English speaker for a character whose every meticulous word we're supposed to hold on to, and is never said in the novels to have a thick accent.Gillian Anderson is a fine actress and her Du Maurier character a good idea, but what was with the slow talk? If it meant her treading carefully to try and keep up with Lecter, it just left me drowsy. Mason Verger was another letdown: a hardly menacing baby-faced prat pre-Hannibal, afterwards he goes into a lame imitation of Gary Oldman sans the masterful underlying sadness.The visuals are evocative and classy, softening the relatively abundant gore, though the cinematographer may have been a bit too in love with slow-motion close-ups of splashed liquids (no, not just blood).What annoyed me the most is excessive quoting from the novels and movies. I don't mind a couple winks to the fandom, but so much of it became off-putting, especially as some of the quotes were so utterly trivial; ""... and a modest outlay for two bags of cement""? Come on, it ain't Shakespeare."
533,Well done series - just completed all three seasons. I have never witnessed such unsettling and beautiful imagery in a television series. An excellent interpretation of Red Dragon and Hannibal Would love to see a Silence of the Lambs series with Clarise Starling.
534,"I'm really gonna miss this show. A dark, stylish, brutal and mind-shattering edge of your seat thriller.
A 10/10 for me."
535,Really nice to watch just because of the character of Dr. Hannibal. The way he really enjoys cooking and tasting what he has prepared after he has hunted and killed his catch is amazing and believable. It's a pity that the last season become so philosophical and actually more suitable for viewers with more refined taste. Men could feel forced to immerse deeply into the plot which is not clear in the last season at all and I think it is actually not what the serial is about.I hope somebody finds out how to continue and we will live to see the next season.
536,I loved the way it begun and ended. Really a must watch series if you have a knack for it
537,Captivatingly gorgeous. The most interesting series on television to date.
538,I love Hannibal so much it's really unique and amazing
539,"I see some very silly reviews here. Giving 1 star ratings for a show that has a great cast, excellent writing and a grit that will peal your flesh in dread and wonder.
I've also noticed while reading through the reviews that the low rated ones are posted multiple time...? What gives IMDB?
Basically the negative reviews are coming from prudes who cannot handle the violent nature of the main character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. If it's not your kind of show, which should be obvious from the previews, why did you even bother to watch? 
And anyone who says CSI was a terrible show really has no taste. What would you expect them to rate this one? My guess is they hate every TV show released...something is not right in their head!
If you love the horror, suspense or detective type movies and TV shows then this one is definitely worth a watch. Is it pure to the novels? Nope! How many movies and TV series have you seen that are? Extremely few and far between."
540,"First of all, I love this series to a fault. It's not perfect, but I just love it. It has some of the best TV episodes I've ever watched, but it also has some of the most scattered storytelling I've experienced.First, the positives.The aesthetics. BEAUTIFUL. Every frame in this series is designed to perfection, and it is just beautiful to watch. The slow motion sequences, the cinematography, the MUSIC. Everything falls together to be a feast for the senses.The performances!! All the acting is flawless, especially that by Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy. Their performances let you see through their friendship enough to both mesmerize you, and scare you to death. Hannibal cares for Will, but he also sees him as a test subject/plaything. Will knows, but let's himself be immersed into it all for the sake of the greater good. It's all a vicious circle that leads who knows where, but we want to be there to watch.The rest of the cast is amazing as well. Special mention goes to Richard Armitage, who played Dollarhyde frighteningly well, and the great Gillian Anderson.Seasons 1 and the second part of 3 are hypnotizing. All the best parts together to make a wonderful whole. The series works best when there's a concrete situation to resolve, no question.Now, for the not so positives.I understand we want inclusion and representation in modern series, but it sometimes feels forced. Freddie Lounds, for example. We are supposed to feel revulsion at this character, but making her a woman, and beautiful, doesn't help. Making Chilton go through what she should have, felt forced and contrived. Alana Bloom was a woman just because there were too many men, or at least it felt like that. Also, I hated her going from warm and caring to femme fatale style, and out of nowhere falling for Margo Verger. Talking about the Vergers, the first part of season 3 felt all over the place. Mason Verger was absolutely perfect, but the changes to make the story fit made the story and his ending underwhelming. He should have been eaten by his pigs, like Thomas Harris wrote. 
The bit they included about Hannibal Rising was completely out of place or context. I mean, Will gets thrown off a train and then he reappears with nothing but a few scratches?? The Japanese mysterious lady is introduced only to a act as Ex Machina to let Hannibal do his thing, killing those who would hurt/kill him. No, just no. There's too much going on at once.I understand they didn't have time. The series was cancelled way too soon, and as a result, the first part of season 3 (and a bit of the second part) is messy from trying to include too much in too short time. I wish we could have had at least one more season, so the stories would've been better told and better stitched together.I said I love Hannibal to a fault, and I stand by that. I tend to minimize its shortcomings because I think it's just that good. Don't let anyone's opinion influence you. Give it a try."
541,"As a student of psychology in love with the phenomena of perverse structure (a.k.a sociopaths), the Hannibal series - which I had already begun to watch in 2013, the year of launch - drew my attention. After watching two other series on mental phenomena, Mindhunter and The Alienist - the two, also, investigating criminals - the series directed by Michael Rymes was next on the list.The relationship maintained by the investigator and murderer was able to provoke me to various feelings, mainly anxiety.Hannibal, as Will was lead to understand, placed himself in the prision, where he would not fail to be seen. Hence, we can understand his surrender as an attempt by the serial killer to curb his deeds.
Hannibal ended lives and gave up his own. ""You know where I am,"" Hannibal says incarcerated.
The final episode is of great mastery. ""That's what I wanted for you - and for me,"" adds Hannibal. Since Will was already unable to live a life in which Hannibal did not remember his own evil, and his absurd acts, he participated in the plot with his rival - conscious
The romance between a pervert, the mental disorder, and the common investigator touches us as he denounces us dark desires and interests. As Freud says, perversion is the negative of neurosis: what the neurotic fantasizes, the perverse does in fact.
Hannibal takes Will, during all the plots, to acts. The last act, the most awaited, finally realized. Will embodies all humanity, doubt, fear, hesitation, madness. But it also borrows from Hannibal, which builds during the plot, certainty. Certainty this staged in a last act, that also causes its death."
542,"I originally rated this series with 10 stars, after watching only the first season. Hannibal's story is fantastic, and the presentation here is spectacular. The characterization, writing, acting, and visuals are all wonderfully done. And the mild changes to Hannibal's story present during the majority of the first season were understandable in order to make a TV series work.However I've re-rated the series after the seeing the end of the first season and the entire second season. (Spoilers ahead!)In order to stay close to the original story they would have had to capture Hannibal toward the end of the first season--and they alluded to this possibility, but apparently they couldn't figure out how to write a second season within the original story line (I could/can). So instead they mutilated and rebuilt the entirety of the rest of Hannibal's and other characters stories in order to build a second season where the same kinds of things happen; just not necessarily in the same time-span, or to the same people, or with the same people present, or in the same fashion.For instance, in the books and films a person actually dies in some brutal fashion at the hands of another serial killer, not Hannibal: in the TV show a similar person death is faked in the same fashion by another person, who is not a serial killer.For those who are not familiar with the story, this is certainly acceptable. But for those of us who are fans, it is just rude and unnecessary.One could argue that this TV show is only another story based off the characters created by the original author, or that it's the telling of those characters experiences within an alternate universe/time-line. However there was no need to create a new story. A TV series, or TV miniseries, provides a prime opportunity to express more details of the story that took place between books, but that were never explored otherwise. The first season is presented as though this was the intention. And, as a fan, I welcome such exploration.In other words each season could've further explored a different unexplored period of the time-line. resulting in a visual display of a story that complimented the books and films, rather than one that conflicted with it.In my opinion, if they didn't intend to stick close to cannon, they should have renamed their characters and refrained from the implication that the TV series was at all related to the original story.So, as a result of being misled and of the TV show creators brutal mutilation of Hannibal's story, I'm a tad disappointed. But otherwise the TV show has many desirable and respectable characteristic and deserves a decent rating for those qualities alone."
543,"Have just watched,probably, the most pathetic and most unrealistic season finale ever.So disappointed as I have loved this series.The three main FBI characters know exactly what Hannibal is but don't act as if they were prepared.Shoot the b*****d and ask questions later.Hannibal was holding a knife,Jack could have shot him and said that Hannibal attacked him first. Will Graham has a gun but would rather have a conversation and bleed to death than shoot Hannibal.Up until this episode would give the series 8/10.Writers seen to forget about realism nowadays.They had brilliantly written source material so use it.I know it's only based on Red Dragon but even so don't spoil it. SO DISAPPOINTING !!!!!!!!!"
544,"So I am a frequent series/movie watcher and I make sure what I watch makes the full of my time and is worth watching. I thought of giving this series a try but it failed egregiously. The whole plot seems to be derived from the very classic series ""Sherlock"" which was commendably in-acted by Benedict. However this here is so over being the worst that i wish i could give it 0/10 if only IMDb permitted.The whole plot is nowhere revolving around the main character ""Hannibal"". There's this wannabe special agent who deduces the crime scene poorly while the FBI stands beside him like gauche_ish group. It is more of a classroom of FBI listening to the teacher and doing everything like a dummy. NO REASONING ! NO JUSTIFICATIONS ! NO EVIDENCE ! This is not worth watching if you are into classic crime-thriller genre.SAVE YOURSELVES!"
545,"It's like an entire team of new writers, directors, everyone but the actual CAST came in and said; Let's just forget about the first two seasons and produce THE MOST BORING, IRRELEVANT garbage possible...what a waste."
546,Season 3 episode 1 was so completely horrible I just couldn't go any further...it was like paint drying IN MY MOUTH!!!!!
547,"This feels like an eclectic mess of Mindhunter, Twin Peaks, True Detective and a dab of X-files, knowing very well that this show preceded some of them. The one foot in this show that should have had a secure foothold in reality, is as stable as that of a drunkard on the night of recieving his social security money. The other foot being amputated. Much of the research for this show seems like it was based on the first Google result, even the ones where you can see that the second result clearly contradicts the first one. A provocatively lazy job.
There are two parallell lines in the story, if this is a conscious choice, I don't know. One is the simple, unrealistic but scenic one that moves the story forward. It lacks taste, complexity and could be a direct replication of any mass produced crime TV show. It follows the same pattern, it's repetitive and everyone can figure out what will happen and feel a bit smart. The other one is Hannibal, the true protagonist, a complex character which is always in control and is both the hyperintellectual villain and the hero simultaneously. The dialogue is rich and most of the time rational and realistic. He gets enough headroom in the show to give the viewers wanting more than a brainless watch some flavour, but not enough for the less demanding viewer to get bored. It is a dull show, lacking what many other may offer. Every killer is a sociopath and a simpleton with mainly one underlying motive. A brain tumor, a single childhood trauma, a sickness, a diagnosis or maybe the worst of all, the mycophile. The mycologist episode with the slightly amusing Paul Stamets reference is so far the low water mark. The level of realism was next to none and surprisingly, not even the flashing imagery of the Maxomycota plasmodium pulsating whilst some deluded madman kept talking about mycelia could save it.
The only reason to watch this show is Hannibal Lecter, not completely unsimilar to the first season of True Detective and Rust Cohle, who carried the whole show's quality on his shoulders. At least that could be the case if this show weren't so dumbed down. This makes his character seem so isolated that it causes a contrast and an obvious dissonance, that just tends to drag the shows quality down even further."
548,"This is a general rating for the first two seasons. The first season gets a solid 8 with the writers creating a new dynamic for Hannibal. I was thoroughly engrossed with the battle of wills, minds and brains between Graham and Hannibal. Great photography. Alana Bloom is an emotional ally, Jack Crawford is a hard ass but cares about Graham initially then totally abuses his commitment to ""protect"" Graham. Beverly Katz - the forensics expert is able minded and works some magic in the first season as well. The dialogue is smart and knowledgeable. But there are too many instances of Hannibal just planting evidence that is never found out to be ""planted"" So they all believe in Graham's gifts until he actually tries to prove himself innocent.The second season is what? A filler? By now, no one trusts Graham and they just let Hannibla control the narrative throughout. And how, even after he is pointed to as a suspect, why don't they really investigate him. Endless videos of meatcentric dishes shown in all of their prep with dreamy music, heavy slow motion,(it takes like 25 seconds to pass a key from one hand to another somewhere in this mess of a season. Alana falls into a relationship with Hannibal?? I mean how stupid is this for a few love scenes which made me sick, thinking of Hannibal as a remotely romantic person, or that a Psychiatrist would fall for his tricks. YUCKThen Beverly Katz goes all ""Grahams Guilty"" and won't even look into evidence in an impartial way, and when Graham tells her to investigate but be very cautious because she is dealing with a genius psycho path, she goes right back to Hannibal and is so obvious that she ends up dead within 24 hours.Jack, by now is completely compromised while eating dead people with Hannibal and thinking he's going to catch him serving human meat at a big event when Hannibal is getting suspicious.. Just ridiculous. I just felt sorry for Mr Fishburne and Raul Garza as well. Made into self serving caricatures.The second system was so boring, I found myself reading a synopsis and then watching the episodes where the story was moved along but by then I didn't care for any character in the show. Even Graham turned into a robot like man with plan. He lost the ability to communicate emotion or generate it in any of his collegues, or Hannibal for that matter. Second season a 5 for production values. If I want to watch a cooking show - I'll tune in to one.If anyone made it through the 3rd season, not even going to try, let me know if gets better. Truly a sad follow up to a great premise and 14 episodes."
549,"The sad attempt at unsettling sounds were more subtle. Throwing a relentless screech of sound is not creative it's lazy at best. For such a great concept of a story, having the common horror trope of banging on a water harp actually takes away from the show"
550,"It's no doubt captivating, with a phenomenal cast and their precise delivery. Comparing it with a similar series Mindhunter which had the situation and charters personality offset, I found that it lacks the realism so well projected in its counterpart.
To put it vaguely this is to Mindhunter as James bond is to the Jason Bourne."
551,"Will Graham is a special consultant with the FBI. He has a special gift whereby he can empathise with any individual and put himself in their shoes. This means he gets to help solve vicious murders, especially those involving serial killers, as he can profile the murderer - their method, motives and personality profile. For a particular case, the FBI also seek the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a highly-respected psychiatrist. Will and Hannibal hit it off, and Will becomes a patient of Hannibal. Little does he know or suspect that Hannibal might be the most wanted serial killer in the US.Brilliant..in spells. Started pretty conventionally and not entirely engagingly. The first half of Season 1 is all about Will Graham, and he's not a particularly likeable character. Nor are the stories that compelling, as they feel not much different from your average crime-investigation drama. However, as Season 1 goes on, Hannibal moves to centre stage, and the story becomes much darker and more original. Season 2 continues in this vein. Plot- and character- development in Season 2 is excellent and makes for very compelling viewing.Season 3 is a bit hit and miss, with some interesting twists and a powerful ending. However, it is also chock full of padding, and also feels like it should have finished after seven or so episodes. The Red Dragon development at the end felt unnecessary, like it was tacked on as an afterthought.The padding that is overtly apparent in Season 3 also occurs in Seasons 1 and 2, though to a lesser degree. This is the factor that prevents the series from fulfilling its full potential. After a great series of scenes and plot development we often have these drawn out navel-gazing scenes that ruin the momentum. Some of the more introspective scenes are necessary, as they reveal the evolving relationship between Hannibal and Will, but many are just there to kill time. Worst of all is the recurring stag imagery - it was relevant when it first appeared, in Season 1, and is occasionally relevant to demonstrate the mental connections Will is making, but is often just there as filler. It's as if the editor said to the producer ""Hey, we still need two minutes of footage"" and the producer said ""No problem, fill it with stag imagery"". 8/10 for Season 1 (was heading for a 7, but it then ramped up towards the end), 9/10 for Season 2 (the padding prevented a 10/10) and 7/10 for Season 3."
552,"Believe me i tried, but, the story line does not make any sense, dr hanibal is far away from being more than a wine taster, the script does not make sense either, even the murders , the FPI, the invistigations, nothing is good about this work!"
553,"With each of the characters being written to both have complete amnesia and to have flashbacks about the previous happening of the world created makes for complete choas for the timeline and narrative of this.
Mads shines, Darcy Does not. Lastly the mixing of sound was infuriating with all dialog at a wisper and the score at 10,000 desibells."
554,"HannibalExceptional actors. Sad to watch actors play characters based on deeply flawed scripts, where actors are forced to play characters that defy common sense and behave counterintuitively. It's impossible to ignore in this series because it happens continuously, and find yourself saying: ""Please. Seriously?"" That eventually leads to fatigue.There are 2 characters, for example, psychiatrists, one walking behind the other, and the one behind the other one knocks her unconscious, but, presumably, all she can recall is nothing. Really? It's not a stretch to stitch simple facts together. No one else is in the scene. Thus...Overall, the behavior between action and reaction is absurd and endemic in every episode watched.There are 2 characters who manage to circumvent the absurdity and whose behavior is consistently sound, except for one critical gaff. The main character is so empathetic and therefore valuable as an agent, because he has a unique skill: He can adopt the mindset and emotional behavior of serial killers. It's intense and emotionally exhausting.However, if you've ever known someone on the autistic spectrum, that's exactly what they cannot do. That trait distinguishes them from others, i,e., "" normal"" people. Doesn't mean, they're not gifted in other areas, but emotionally they're disconnected. They can mimic ideas, like a son from the mother, but this is mostly a repetitive task, rote learning, like teaching a parrot to talk. Doesn't mean they lack awareness of who they are, and know they're different, and how.So that is the gaffe that completely contradicts level of social engagement of main character.It's a psychiatrist's nightmare.
And wasted talent."
555,"As usual Mads was such a perfect fit for the role of Hannibal... he always makes the perfect villain and just has such a natural sinister look! He's low key one of my favorite actors and I didn't even realize that till watching him in this series.The only downside to this series imo is actually the actor playing opposite of Mads... Will Graham! Mr. I'm so much smarter than everyone else and so deep/complex 🙄 I thought his dry acting was just the role and hoped it might get better but it didn't. He's just so boring to watch and so weird in this role that it got to the point I couldn't stand seeing him on screen. I don't think it was necessary or helped the series along for him to be so out of it and to always have such a blank dumb look on his face! Not to mention such a shi++y shot with his handgun! Haha. I just found him overly annoying and borderline pathetic.
In all fairness, there are a couple other bad actors like Abigail. She isn't believable in her role and also makes stupid dreadful faces. God she's terrible too. Watch, you'll see real quick.Anyway, them aside, this is a near perfect series! I like when they know to quit while they're ahead, like Mr. Robot. Go out on top and leave the viewer wanting more! So few know that balance and end up ruining a good series all for a quick cash grab. You won't regret watching this show... Get started!"
556,"Hannibal is a TV show created by Bryan Fuller, lasting three seasons from 2013-2015 ""Explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist and his patient, a young FBI criminal profiler, who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers."" The show is restricted to Mature Audiences for dark themes, including brutal murder and cannibalism, violence and themes of horror. I first began watching Hannibal back in late 2013, when I finally joined the Drama TV network along with Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad. However this show felt different and it caught my attention almost immediately. Not with the interesting plot or brilliant acting, but with the characters and the dark themes that circled around them. I was engaged in all 13 of the episodes and I felt like this was a show with a lot of potential, and thankfully the creator managed to continue the show for another 2 seasons. The show follows the protagonist, Will Graham, an FBI teacher at the academy as he assists with the arrests of serial killers with the desire to eat, mutilate and display their victims. The main catch to Will is his ability to perfectly analyze a crime scene by putting himself in the shoes of the killer. I had seen similar styles of analyzing to this in other shows, specifically Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Sherlock'. What made his style any different though? It felt a lot darker and the continuous strain of constantly putting himself into the killer's shoes began to take a toll on his brain as he began to suffer as a result. The FBI ""Guru"", Jack Crawford, assigns Will to a psychiatrist who he believes can help Will deal with his problems so that he can continue working in the field. However the person whom Will is receiving treatment from is actually the serial killer that they have been searching for all along, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. With the introduction of this character I was immediately hooked as I found every single action of his interesting and like they all fitted into a big puzzle that Hannibal was making. Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal Lecter) managed to add a more darker and strangely more likable feel to the classic horror character. Although original fans of the 'Silence of the Lambs' movie might prefer the truly terrifying performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins, it isn't hard to see the similarity between the two versions and both are likable in their own strange little ways. The show gradually gets darker which can be easily noticeable by how violent the show starts to become. The murders become more common, each feeling more violent and darker than the last, and the mind state of Will Graham begins to be questioned by the audience to whether or not he is actually sane. The music and sounds become a lot more eerie and horror-like, scenes that involve Will hallucinating a ""black deer-like creature"" have a very full on and intense sound to give a sense of danger. The sounds reoccur for certain events, however the light classical orchestral playing in the background is soothing but it is usually associated when Hannibal is preparing human meat for consumption. Strangely any scene that shows any of the characters eating can make the audience feel hungry, even though they know what is being implied when the characters eat. Overall the show, while dark and somewhat disturbing at times, is entertaining and enjoyable. I would personally recommend this show to anyone but it would be better if you could handle a small amount of gore at times so that you had a better understanding and feeling to the show. The acting is both realistic and believable which contributes to the creation of such interesting characters. The sounds fit in well with the scenes and continue to establish the dark nature of the show, although the nature of Hannibal Lecter contributes mostly to that. The show should be watched by anyone older than 15 due to the dark nature and content of the show. Season 1 was both engaging, exciting and I loved every minute 8.8/10 ~Reel Time Reviews"
557,"Way too much use of imagery, terribly written and even more terribly acted, yes even Mikkelsen. Don't bother with it."
558,"So I'm binge watching this in 2020 since its covid and this show was highly recommended. Perhaps its not a show that should be binged because the ""artistic"" elements of the show become very grating after awhile. I LOVED the first season and a half, and then it got really slow (with the exception of an episode or 2). Slow motion camera. Creepy music. Slow boring monologs.Then we get to the Red Dragon part of the show, which is pretty much exactly like the movie. To the point where I know what's going to happen next.I keep hearing that the show has an amazing ending and I'm about 3 episodes out so I'll update when I'm done but I honestly just can't wait for it to be over."
559,"I've got so far as Season 3, Episode 5. It started amazingly well. Every episode had me hooked and I wanted to watch more. The storyline was great, dark and psychological, you want to see more. Then Season 3 happened. I don't know why but the style of the episodes has changed. The constant slow motion parts, the dramatic unnecessary music - it's all a little too much. Maybe they got a bigger budget to spend on different shots and effects but sometimes less is more. I'm trying to finish the whole Series but Season 3 isn't living up to 1 and 2 at all for me."
560,Great cinematography. As usual cheesy and fictional police and law enforcement procedure and WAAAAYYYY improper crime scene procedure. Corny. Lame. Lots of potential. The BEAUTY of Dr. Lecter In the books and films is that he carefully Selects deplorable persons as his victims. Those that the viewer kind of takes joy in seeing be tortured and killed and eaten. Too bad Lecter never made it to Congress and DC to clean house with a nice Fat greedy buffet Of sleaze.THIS Series portrays him as a belligerent sloppy mess. Yet another franchise ruined by tv and Beatin that Big old fat dead horse into the ground.
561,"Anthony Hopkins sold us on the idea that Hannibal was beyond reasonable intelligence, that he was somehow almost clairvoyant. There was nothing rude about that Hannibal, nothing absurd. He was brutally efficient but always with reason. You felt like Hannibal was always in control, even when he was strapped to a dolly with a mask on his face.The new Hannibal has no such gravitas. He's serious enough, but doesn't come across as intelligent. He comes across as just a guy with an overbite who is a creep and likes to eat people and serve them to his guests. The writers try too hard to make him sophisticated - operas, fine wines, being musically talented, Johns Hopkins graduate, master chef... because Anthony Hopkins pulled it off. But Hopkins was old enough to have lived through the period of learning required to get there. This new guy doesn't strike me as being experienced enough to pull it off. For this reason, I was never able to accept this guy as being intelligent. He too quickly puts his neck on the line in circumstances that don't merit it. Scully didn't necessarily make him seem any more intelligent, as she was pretentious and over the top as well.Because I could not suspend disbelief for this new Hannibal, I could not accept the deus ex machina so ever present in this series.The other issue is that I never really cared about the protagonist. Giving him a dozen pets didn't make him more likable. He was still just a robotic creepy guy.Fishbourne got away with too much experimentation, never learning his lesson, and where in the hell did his wife go after the cancer episode? I find it odd that a non-agent consultant would go into a hot area, weapon drawn, with no back up and yet everyone thinks it's ok."
562,"The first few episodes were so well done. But the whole ""Will is losing his mind"" scenario got old real quick. If he is losing his mind, he should quit. His boss should be kind enough to let him go. Blaming him for being unstable is ridiculous, the stuff that he has seen are tragic. I didn't like Hannibals character and it's so predictable that Will and the others would have NO clue that it was Hannibal all along. Like what? Your with the flipping FBI.
Think about it - in a real life ""2020"" scenario, he would NOT be allowed to still be working. He would be on workers compensation or a certain type of leave due to medical issues. Do not even get me going about the story line! when the Doctor was killed and the only other person within the deal & room was Hannibal. It's not rocket science!
So sad honestly, it had so much potential. I don't think it's THAT hard to make a good show, with a moderate amount of drama and good developed characters. Like really? Or is it? Tv shows are going down hill in the last few years. I still have favourites of mine made back in the early 2000s that I could watch every few years for the rest of my life. These newbies need to go back to acting school. Let the pros take over from here!
Before I get people looking at this and think I'm older, and I'm not young enough to enjoy / understand this type of series, I'm 22 and happen to be studying a Bachelor of Criminology. So take it from someone who's actually going into the field!"
563,"Mads is magnificent as Hannibal and Hugh Dancy is awesome as Will Graham. Laurence Fishborne is always great and does his Jack Crawford spectacularly.All that said, it breaks my souls to know the books and movies are very well respected in this series. I understand there were many freedoms within the series from the source material, but none that are justified in my opinion.I don't understand the tokenization of Dr Alan Bloom made into a female. Then making her a romantic option to a tokenization gay character who becomes in charge and powerful. Takes over for Dr Chilten as head doctor. Silly. Then, with her lover Margo, take out the bad man Mason by drowning/feeding him to the eel together. Should have been fed to the pigs by Hannibal. One reason I disliked season 3.Then making Freddie a female. Why. Just why? Not only a woman, but a seductive, intelligent, and manipulative pretty woman. Freddy should be scummy and gross looking. Someone we hate and are disgusted by. Also, allowing the female Freddie to live and changing the wheelchair death to a stunt for a trick, then further replacing Freddie's death with the series' favorite punching bag, Dr Chiltin? Why. Can't get rid of a prominent and powerful woman?I don't understand the reason Abigail exists in the show. However, I don't mind her addition to the story.The last thing is I hate how the show is forcing a near homoerotic relationship between Hannibal and Will. It's so forced and cringey. The relationship between the two should be nothing other than curiosity and dominance. Hannibal's character shouldn't need to explore love or need to explore a gay romance. It's not what Hannibal is about. Hannibal is not a love story and anyone who disagrees is obviously not a true fan of the character or the books/movies. For this reason, I do not want a 4th season.The 3rd season felt so rushed and no passion was seen. Just a bunch of ridiculous dialogue that is incredibly unnatural to make viewers think they are smart for liking it. Most of the story and characters are disrespected from the actual story line, Red Dragon. The annoying theme of love and romance kills the original Hannibal vibe. And the fact Mad's Hannibal never becomes a full physical force of fear like Hopkins Icon take, broke my heart. I was waiting for Mads' Hannibal, now no longer needing to hide who he is, to become more sinister and scary like Hopkins. Never happened.It's a good show until the third season. It becomes harder to like if you're a fan of Hannibal Lecter and the movies/books with the political stances taken within the series. The changes to characters bring you out of the world/fantasy because they are a reminder that this isn't an original Hannibal.I'm conclusion, this more of a fan fiction brought to life on the screen. Borderline homoerotic fanfic that wasn't justified enough to give it a 4th season. Enjoy the 1st and 2nd seasons, then take a deep breath to witness ridiculous mediocrity."
564,"One of the most boring series ever. It could have been done in one season. All the wine pouring, close ups of snails, blood, violence, pseudo-intellectual conversations...just ridiculous."
565,"Good photography, nice production values, but... the first few episodes held interest, and then... repetitive tedium set in. The story lines became more unbelievable, the formula was the same episode after episode and the pace became glacial."
566,"The acting for some characters was pretty good at times but the amount of changes they made to a lot of main characters was irritating, to say the least. It served no purpose but to add rediculous levels of intrigue to a wash-up of a recap.
At times, said storyline was captivating and engaging... It almost made you forget how many details were borrowed and scattered throughout the retelling of the whole story.
Chiyo was supposed to be Lady Murasake? Maybe I'm mistaken. (Still hasn't been made clear, to my knowledge.) Alan Bloom became Alana and Freddie Lounds became a redhead with a slight build, a wonderful stand-in for Philip Seymour Hoffman; et cetera, et cetera.
I have no idea why all this is pertinent to the overall remake. It skews any idea of the original characters and dashes the linear details into shreds.No honor was paid to (the more classy) Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal. It's just a ride on the ""Who does he dissect next?"" rundown with no clear purpose to the choosing process or reasoning behind half of his victims. Mads Mikkelson was alright but I agree with the assessment that the mumbling delivery of his lines just made it difficult to understand in parts without the closed captioning turned on (which can be rather distracting). He wasn't suave. He wasn't graceful. He was stiff.
I liked him in James Bond but if this is what the director/s wanted, then he did it masterfully - for this rendition only. This is not Hannibal, this is an impostor. With a series of this caliber and the cult following it earned, you have to be careful not to spoil the depth of what was by making the newest version flashy and cheap. Quite frankly, this version is tawdry and crass at best. Mads was not entirely uncouth for his role but it was overrated and underwhelming.Will was portrayed well enough but the level of madness wasn't so evident by the original author. No clue if he intended this to be the true, untold backstory of Will Graham.
Let's take the lead of the book itself (if not the movie) from which this show seems to be based. He didn't kill anyone for reasons outside of serving his purpose as an FBI agent. He wasn't completely insane, nor was he drawn into that level of madness with Hannibal.
I also paused and checked the clock that Will drew - it's the same copy both times Hannibal asked him to draw it. That is completely lazy for the production of the first season and wouldn't have taken more than a few minutes to redraw the thing instead of using the same prop for both scenes. Don't believe me? Pause and take a picture of both of them. It's not a huge deal except that it shows how poorly planned and executed the behind-the-scenes efforts must have been.
And yes, the stag. I get that Will is being hunted by Hannibal but the imagery of the former being the horned figure makes little sense other than the beast that dwells within both. But if the latter is a figure of innocence and the stag apparently dies when Will is cut, why does the symbol of innocence not show up again after Will has come back from the verge except to emphasize the horned figure of Hannibal?Being gutted is not the same as being stabbed in the gut. It means that all your innards were removed. Abigail didn't gut him, she just sliced Nick open good and well. If he was, it was done by Hannibal and not explained well enough.Hannibal's love interest was conjured out of thin air and expressed a sliver of the same sort of madness that he had. She probably would've taken more joy or assisted a bit more in the murders unless he were domineering in the way of enjoying the hunt and capture of his prey. Of course, that would be at least somewhat out of character for him as made evident by this idea of what he is. Pushing people to be his puppets in their ""transformation."" He would've loved the act of his pawns moving to do his bidding. And if she was as mad as he, she wouldn't shy away from that sort of opportunity, nor chide him on his return as Il Mostro.Dolarhyde was NOT - I repeat, NOT - a patient of Hannibal. Most of our killers were also seemingly pawns that Hannibal pushed over the edge in previous treatment like some quasi-sophisticated Charles Manson. Writer's convenience can only go so far until it all falls apart, which is what this series seems to be doing at a lot of points.
The early episodes were way too easy to put together. Too obvious before immediately jumping into some plot twists that resemble an M. Night Shyamalon piece of pyrite.The production value was fairly decent in parts, as stated. Almost believable graphics if you can't tell the difference between realism and CGI. But not enough consistency.
Some flashbacks were in black and white but it seems like they forgot (or didn't care) to do this for other scenes. Makes sense for, say, the conversation switchover between Bedelia, Will and the patient she killed. (And, by the way, there was NO sense of danger aimed toward her from this former patient. Which makes no sense except to show that she had a slightly demented side in this instance.)At worst, you can consider this an alternate universe. (You know, like the Justice League movie vs. the cartoon series. No Hawk Girl, no Martian Manhunter... Add recent movie rehashing title here.) This is more like how Di$ney has ruined the Star Wars concept. Great potential wasted on lesser efforts of lazy and thoughtless writing.At best, you should probably not waste your time. Go watch the originals. Or, hey, pick up a book and see what the mastermind behind this whole concept *really* wanted you to experience."
567,"This show tries far to hard to be psychological, creepy and crime focused. Characters are not very fleshed out, aside from maybe Hannibal (Mads). Many random time jumps, plenty unexplained stories and sidetracks. Music, editing and sfx makes this overly dramatic and unrealistic. Writers gives us a child's explanation of why and how certain things happens and believes the viewer to go with it. I wanted this show to be good because it has great potential and I gave it a fair chance but this really doesn't deserves that high of a rating, imo. What bothers me most are the rushed plots that only last a single episode, like why should I care at all about any character or event when the team behind this doesn't care: disappointing..."
568,So in the first episode the killings take place in MN by someone that lives there but yet when they go to his kill cabin it's in MD 🤔
569,"I watched the first episode and i liked it
but the second and the thered is about the same case and the same story
like just move for the next case
i am not gonna watch multiple episodes about the same case"
570,"I can't understand what he says the majority of the time! Louder, clearer, better English? Watching made me miserable."
571,"Before it's over, this series tries your patience in every way possible. Binge-watching it for the first time, before the end of season 2, I found myself fast-forwarding through pretentious dialogue marred by too many repetitions. (I know, I know, I know: Hannibal and Will want to be friends.) By season 3, I was scoffing at one preposterous over-reach after another, testing my patience with torture porn and genre stereotypes. (Yes, yes, yes: this killer prancing around in front of the mirror fancies himself the Red Dragon.)I suppose I stayed with it because the series is as odd as its characters, who break the mold again and again, whether it be the one that fits out psychiatrists and FBI profilers or the one that fits out serial killers. The molds shatter in descending order, like Russian matryoshka or nesting dolls, until the series finale, where what's broken gives us a glimpse of what has been missing all along. It is something so simple: friendship, intimacy, that feeling of having been completely satisfied. I was reminded, in a good way, of the death of Ragnar Lothbrok in Michael Hirst's Vikings, where he may die in a snake pit but not before he shares with us a tiny bit of his glory."
572,Too many plot holes. Kinda dumb stories. Starts out pretty good though.Also can't get over the decision to make Hannibal a German.
573,"This show started off well enough... A little backstory between Hannibal Rising and red Dragon, some halfway decent phsycho-thriller feel, and some interesting plot twists. Then it got super campy. And then it got super weird and actually surpassed its previous almost excusable gore with pointless greusome bloodlettinginute by minute. This is one of the few shows that actually turns me off, not because it's too bloody, or too risqué, or too psychedelic, but because it's too EVERYTHING. By the time we get to Season 3, the producers just decided to pull out all the stops and save no shockers for later. It's a dump truck of guts, sex, drugs, and obscurity. Completely beyond reason. Absolutely devoid of any redeeming qualities by the end. Seven more episodes to go and my eyes couldn't roll any harder."
574,So disappointed.The reviews from IMDB was sold to me.. I was expecting a masterpiece. Fell WAY short of that.10/10 for the food presentation.Season 1 was pretty good.. after that it just went downhill... i was watching 'recaps' from end of s02 until the end and even that bored me.
