0,"I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)"
1,"During the 90's I was a big fan of the X-Files to this day I still am. The X-Files had great stories and character development, which is needed for a great show. Supernatural has that from the very first episode. I admit that I missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but I knew exactly what happened and where the story was going. Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural. CBS's Threshold, may not live up to the X-Files, but Supernatural does. One final note, as long as the WB doesn't do any tweaking of the show this series will last for quite a few seasons."
2,"There will be no spoilers.
There will be no long rants.First five seasons were amazing, season six and seven were trully good, seasons from eight to eleven were allright. After that - a sharp decline, degradation and death. Final and absolute death.
Agony is over.
Yeah, journey is important. But in the end destinaion is all that matters. And if your destination turns out to be a burning pile of organic wastes...Boy, did i waste my time!"
3,"After being disappointed by mediocre to bad new shows like Threshold  and Invasion, I am glad that there's at least one new show that really  delivers. Supernatural is in a whole different league, with proper  style, suspense and great production values. This is a  dark, moody show that understands how to use the television medium. The  story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you  in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the  supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm  usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective.  It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way.  As it is, the show is way, waay above average, and I rate the pilot  episode an 8 out of 10."
4,"When the show started I will admit I was apprehensive. It was compared to ghost busters and most notably X-files, but the first episode was everything but. It was action packed with two bad-ass brothers fighting no not crime, but ghosts. Spirits. The writers have done their research into urban legends and local myths, building on spooks we've grown up hearing about, sometimes beings scared of, and other's apprehensive. They give these spooks a face and then send Dean and Sam to blow them to smithereens. While the coated focus is naturally the supernatural, the deep artery of the show is the love between these brothers as they sort out their past and arguments with ""Dad"" and challenge their future with a new light. They're action packed, gun toting, hot rod driving, (not to mention sexy) heroes saving people from harmful supernatural beings, (as they're not all ghosts). The music choice of the shows is also superb with everything from Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't fear the reaper"" to Iron Butterfyl's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". If your looking for an action packed, thrilling, GRASPING, hour, tune in, It's now Thursday at 9 Eastern-Standard on the WB."
5,"Save yourself the pain of watching this mess
This show will erde 15 years of character development in the final season
I've seen hundreds of finales in my life, I've never seen a finale that was more ooc and made less sense than spn's, the game of thrones one is a masterpiece in comparison.
Conclusion: this show is not worth your time nor your money."
6,"With each season the downhill... It has become bad, boring and repetitive., plot holes..Death becomes them for a minute or two, unless they run out of ideas and kill a brother for longer time and bring him back safe and mostly sane"
7,"Well , I was ready to forgive Spn for all the plot holes and unfinished stories, for the misogyny and queerbaiting , everything if only they made an effort to give us a decent ending but it looks like that was too much asking.
The ending is worse than game of thrones, how I met you mother and dexter reunited.
in conclusion : life is short , don't waste months of it watching this ."
8,"The ending was insulting not only to the the vast majority of fans, but also to Sam and Dean, who looked like they only care about each others, and by doing so they totally destroyed what was the second important message of the show after ""free will"" , ""family dont end with blood""
But judging by the speed with which they moved on from their 11 years best friend and their other loved ones, family does in fact end with blood, Mary and John blood."
9,"It started as an average monster show with some nice episodes and some really awful s1 to s3 , then become gradually very good ( 4 and 5 seasons) but after the creator left at the start of S6, the show tatted declining again to the point of becoming unwatchable, most writers of seasons 7 to 15 are bad. Some of them were hired by pure nepotism and this ruined the show.
There is an even more important reason why you shouldn't watch this, is that you will love the characters , the show's writing is average but the characters are beautiful and very lovable, some of them will last longer than others but they will all be sacrificed in the worse way possible , they will have an awful ending , some of them will simply be forgotten and not given any kind of endgame
If you have a heart and get easily attached to characters don't watch for your own good."
10,"It is not the same show it used to be, now it's so lame an full of nonsense. Sam and Dean keeping getting those really really lowend jobs, come on! they have been to hell and back, all the weak creatures should run away from them and not towrds them.Most of the episodes of every season are not about the main plot... Guess what? Those episodes suck!"
11,"We are living in years where there are series like Breaking Bad, Dexter, Game of thrones....and this series is very bad.All in all it has potential and some nice episodes and story lines at some points, but that about it. In a season of 22-23 episodes you have at least 15 of them are fillers (episodes that don't contribute at all to the main plot and if missed, nothing will be lost). This is a complete waste, especially if you want your viewers to be immersed in some plot story.After season 6, the main plot...is done, from that point on it is season for season to think of something stupid in order the series to continue on. The fillers always there, to screw even the slightest interest of the plot. The cool things are Dean's jokes and from time to time the ridiculous episode scenario they come up with.It is not a small budget show, but it is regrettably wasted on bad script writers who can't seem to think how to make an intriguing series.If every season had 4-5 episodes, then it would be great, cause the plot will be followed and every episode somewhat interesting. So if you like some relatively cheap shows, with jokes and don't really care about a serious plan where things are going and progressing, well then you are in luck - supernatural is for you. Bad thing is, X Files was created first."
12,"The writers destroyed what made the show great , and by doing so they also destroyed the majority of their fans, I needed 3 days to recover a little before getting the courage to write this review, they shattered our hearts, they killed everything and everyone we cared about.
I don't think I will ever be able to get attached to any character ever again, and that's because of you Spn writers
This is so cruel. I'm heartbroken"
13,"No, no, no, hell no, NO!!!! What are you thinking???"
14,"The ending of a story is very integral and this ending was the laziest thing i have ever watched in my life. The only show you can watch the first and last episode and nothing has changed, a disservice to the characters and all their development. No Cas, no found family and friends, Dean dying like an amateur from a nail (lmao) after he defeated God himself and of course not a single woman in sight, even Sam's generic wife was shown blurry in the background for 5 seconds. Dean deserved to live a happy full life with Cas and his brother. Sam deserved Eileen (who was never ever mentioned) and friends. Cas deserved someone to tell him that he was loved too. It was all so lonely and depressing. Truly prefer 15x19 at least it was left open and they seemed happy and we can just assume they went off to find/save Eileen/Cas."
15,"Wow, this series was so far ahead of its time that you can watch the pilot and then the finale and miss nothing! That is what I call visionary."
16,"Don't waste you time and money in this.
This show stopped being good after season 5 . All good writers left and were replaced by amateurs.
Skip it for your own good"
17,"This show should've ended years back. The writer(s) were clearly exhausted on generating yet another similar grand plot. Things get boring, especially when you know that death for the protagonist will almost always be nullified sooner or later. This brings no depth to the overall plot, no layers to the character, and they all mixed together creates what you call a disastrous show. Conclusion: all good show should have an end, because when it doesn't, it turns bad. Really bad."
18,"As the season goes on, you notice they are two hypocrite brothers that suck at their job where rules or facts change over time to fill up time."
19,"Make no mistake, the first three seasons of supernatural are good, 8 or 9 good. However after the introduction of angels in season 4 the series changes. The first three seasons are about humanity against evil and in particular the lives of two brothers fighting for humanity. The fourth season shifted to a good vs evil set up and in doing so looses the uniqueness of the show as there are many, better good vs evil shows. The length of the series may also be a factor of the later seasons feeling weaker as there is only so many times that one of the main characters can be killed or on the brink of death and be saved before it looses meaning. The later seasons are watchable but are nothing compared to the far superior and quality first three seasons."
20,"Don't waste your time watching this. This will only leave damage on your mental health.
The ending erased the whole story.The writers of this show love to kill female, lgbt and minority characters after fans get attached to them.
Don't let yourself be fooled by the faltering reviews, most of them are from false fans, the show's network is well known for its very efficient marketing team.
You can watch the 3 first seasons then jump directly to the last episode and you won't miss anything except that the actors aged.
Seriously, If you are the kind of fan that get attached to characters you should skip this, you will have a countless number of heartbreaks and disappointments and it's really not worth it."
21,"I know he is not a protagonist, but why exactly he is not yet? he is great and lovely at the same timeI like much more than sam,at least we don't have to rescue him every two chapters! as sam! why sam always has to be saved? It is very stressful, he is a big boy already , it is not he ??castiel at least can handle on your own.anyway, I have great expectations for what I still have to seeI'm just starting the season 10, first 3 chapters and already miss castiel, why? because he is not doing nothing but walking with a girl, away from the central action."
22,"I'd rate first 5 season with 9/10, after that Supernatural is pure crap that only girls can find any good because of actors. I don't know what happened to supernatural after 5th season but it seems to like it's not made by same people. I'd say Michael Bay is working on Supernatural, it's that bad now, such shame. If I see one more saves in last second by burning something I'm gonna vomit it's Superrepetitive. Also it's full of bullshit like 2 mortals killing angels and demons like nothing. Sam haven't improved acting, one of worst actors in big TV Shows, Crowley is kinda only bright spot with Dean in this TV Show, cancel it pls, can't believe people are giving good rating after 5th season are people blind and stupid?"
23,"Man , the 2 leads must have made so much dough and multi multi millionaires . Not bad for 2 underwhelming actors!
And cheesy writing got bad after a couple seasons , instead then give better acting and seriousness wt good continuity to the story. way too many episodes, wayyyyyyy too many.
I heard the final is very bad , like most series finally or last season it seem.i may watch it just to see if its worst then Games of Throne disaster(well like after season 4 or 5 it dropped bad anyway).
Its easy to blame only the writers when i think the head of the pyramid is the Producers / studios as they got final word on the matter and influence .
i think drugs,money n power fame changes storylines negatively very most of the time, like Dexter, so inconsistent in moods/ sound /characters after like 4th season. i guess its commun in bands music album and series continuity, aging wt money corrupt ha ha ha"
24,What even was that? What was it all for? The supernatural writers clearly don't have a clue. I wish I could give a lower rating for just how disgusting that ending was. So glad I have AO3 to sort out this absolute MESS.
25,"It's hard to spend any amount of time online without hearing some gushing about this show. After so much hype, it's not surprising that this show let me down. What is surprising is how much it let me down. This show is bad, that's not to say that it doesn't have some good aspects, but the awful outweighs them. By a lot.The acting isn't great, although the show has the some good supporting characters (especially Jim Beaver's character). The two leads aren't the best, and were clearly hired for their appearance rather than their talent. They do show some improvement over the course of the series, but their acting in the first season is truly bad. It also suffers from poor writing. Character development is minimal, and is often undone for the sake of pointless drama. At this point the main characters have been killed and brought back so many times that the threat of their deaths no longer means anything. On a less relevant note, the sexism in the writing is truly disappointing, but for a show so rooted around classic horror, it is unsurprising. The rampant queer-baiting also got annoying.The season long story arcs are boring and distract from the one area where the show truly shines: the monster of the week type episodes. These episodes are truly terrifying, funny, and often original, even when they should just be a rehash of a popular urban legend. The comedic timing is flawless, and the show's self aware humour is great. Unfortunately, these episodes have become rarer and rarer, as the show has begun to focus much more on season long story arcs, I couldn't name more than a couple of them simply because they're all so similar, it just becomes déja vu.All in all, I might recommend watching a couple of the earlier seasons just for the monster of the week episodes, which, as I mentioned before, are brilliant. However, with overly dramatic story lines, bad acting, and flat characterization, this show is not worth any long term investments. Don't believe the hype."
26,We deserved better than this. The finale ruined any character development. Don't even get me started on cas confessing and then instantly dying.
27,I was enjoying the show at first but it started to become stupidly predictable and boring to a point where I want to kill the brothers myself! Same stupid choices they make jeez! Some characters make you want to pull your hair out so I started skipping those scenes and all the boring repeated dialogs but I just couldn't continue with the show. They should have stopped the show after few seasons!
28,"Started average in season 1 , improved in season 2, was good in season 4, peaked at season 4 and was spectacular in season 5.
This is exactly where it should have ended !Now it has become just a steaming big pile of baloney. Everyone from the cast to crew seems to be sleeping and churning piles of crap every season. Time to end this atrocity"
29,That's how you know how bad this episode is. They are deleting reviews and refusing to allow new negative reviews to be posted.
30,"When i first saw the trailer of the show, i didn't actually get it. But now that i have seen it i completely get it. I understood completely about the entire story. I didn't know that they(cast) can tell everything that has happened in just 1 hour. Jensen Ackles again did an amazing job for the WB. He had a background of Kansas, which is ironic because he was in Kansas in another hit WB show Smallville. He played the older brother who kind of taking care of his younger brother played by Jared Padalecki. Jared's character was tired of hunting supernatural things. but when his own girlfriend dies the same way his mom died, he decided to hunt that thing. This all happened in the pilot episode. Both brothers are also looking for their father who hasn't returned to them in days. He was on his hunting trip( looking for the thing that killed his wife). This also happened in the pilot episode. I don't know if the time or day of the airing of the show will be changed, but i will watch it every week. The WB has made a wise decision of picking up this show. I recommend to everyone to watch this show. You wont be sorry."
31,"Now this show is not without problems. I'll be the first to admit it. It's very basic premise and sometimes convenient plot turns are not lost on me. Two monster hunting brothers travel cross country and extinguish a different monster each week. Not too much on the original side, I know. However, I can't help but watch this show every week with a fondness for my old junior high days. For those who don't know I was a huge sci-if/horror geek in my younger years and I loved reading about ""The Crazy Hook Man who kills Teenagers"" or ""The Ghost of the Lady in White"". I ate those stories up, and apparently so did the show's creator. This show takes me back to the years before I learned what character arcs, and plot contrivances were. It strips that all away and just lets me enjoy what it was like to hear ghost stories. What it was like to get chills down my spine every time I rode down a dark road at night expecting an apparition in white to appear. What it was like to come so close to saying ""Bloody Mary"" to the mirror and then passing out. There is a likability to this show that can't be ignored, and there's even some great moments with the two main characters Sam and Dean (played quite well by Padalecki and Ackles) but it is that nostalgic feeling above all that brings me back each week."
32,Be prepared for an ending that took us away from what we loved and instead gave us too much emotion. I hated it
33,"Hey! i've been a fan for five years and this show stepped on me! don't watch it :) it is a hate crime against anyone that isn't a cishet white man <3. the writing is bad, there is no plot line, it is homophobic, and they killed all the fan-favorite characters. i sincerely hope no one who worked on this show ever gets a job again! don't watch this awful show."
34,"The show was supposed to end after Season 5, that's how it was planned from the start. But then they realized they can milk this cow for more coin which is exactly what they did for the next 10 seasons which were basically copy paste of one another with barely any episode adding anything of value.The first 4 seasons were great and I do recommend watching those. But after you finish with Season 5 you can just stop unless you want to feel your IQ dropping with each new episode after that."
35,I love this show but that ending was horrible. Misha and Jensen both deserved better. I'm just so disappointed with how it was handled. 15 years wasted.
36,"Tired of all my shows tanking the ending.
All the ingredients were there for greatness, or even half decent, and we got this instead??
You could literally have 15*20 follow 1*1 and remove everything in between and it would mostly make sense because they torched all the character development"
37,"I was browsing through Netflix when I came across Supernatural. It sat on my list for quite some time before I started watching it.At first, I liked it. It was an okay show. But, as it progressed, it started being less and less appealing. The constant misrepresentation of the Pagan faith and Witches put the nail firmly in their coffin. By season 4 episode 7: ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester"" I was done. I just couldn't take it any more.I know shows have the right to portray whatever they want at their discretion, but... it just made the show unwatchable for me. So, beware if you are Pagan and/or Witch sensitive, this is not the show for you."
38,"It's acually I great episode I guess...
if we were able to see the REAL confession scene..."
39,"The 1st few seasons are decent enough but the story goes to crap rather quickly. By season 14, it's a struggle to power through the episodes."
40,"Finale is actually the worst ending I've ever seen. Worse than GOT, worse than anything. My god."
41,The finale was terrible to the point Game of thrones and Riverdale was better
42,"Watch till season 15, episode 19, then stop.
The Show ends miserable and disappointing."
43,"The first five seasons are amusing, as long as you turn off your brain. This is a brainless show. At first, it was like an entertaining but awful b movie, made into a TV series. However, it should have ended in season 5.The later seasons become a total mess. The plot goes nowhere, and it becomes cartoonish and silly. Eventually, they end up inside of a bunker that looks like a mixture of Cheesecake Factory and the Enterprise from Star Trek TOS. The world building is sloppy, and honestly, flimsy. There's a point, where the monsters start look like stuff from a Nickelodeon cartoon. There is no consistency. The later seasons look like a completely different TV series.The X Files had some genuinely well written episodes and memorable side characters and monsters. I can't say that about Supernatural. There are no memorable monsters or side characters. It all blurrs together and is easily forgotten. During the early seasons, Sam's psychic powers go absolutely nowhere, and go away quickly, and the reasoning for it, never makes any sense. I enjoy psychic characters, so that was rather disappointing, but not unexpected.Death has no meaning in this show, and there is no character development. Death is a thing that happens, and they just walk away from it, over and over. Every single season is about stopping an apocolypse, and the rest of the world is weirdly daft as to what's going on. (The Scooby Doo episode was entertaining and amusing, at least.)Also, the characters become unlikable and annoying. At one point, Sam is mad that he was brought back to life again. This grudge went on for that entire season, while Dean sat around brooding. Each season has Sam or Dean, keep a secret from each other, a secret that would resolve tension if the two characters weren't so stagnant. This show kept going, in my opinion, because of money, fandom, and the eye candy leads.I enjoy paranormal stuff. Really. It's fun stuff! However, paranormal shows suffer, when they drag on for too long. The X Files also went off the rails and became an unwatchable convoluted mess towards the end, and Supernatural isn't any different. Watch the first five seasons, for some brainless fun, don't expect anything other than b movie cheese, and pretend the rest doesn't exist.PS Knocked off another star. Those last two episodes are so bad, I barely got through them, and I watch b movies. Like The X Files, this show fizzled out. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first five seasons. In those last episodes, they even pandered to shippers, which was annoying and out of place. The writing and acting went so far down hill, it was on par with a Party City ad and the Live Action Sailor Moon TV show. Only the Live Action Sailor Moon Show was actually amusing and self aware of its cheesy qualities. To be honest, the last few scenes looked like something from a corny Lifetime movie. Dean dies after falling on a rusty nail, because Sam doesn't bother to call an ambulance. Also, Sam dies of old age, and looks like he's wearing Spirit Halloween make up to look elderly. Then, they're reunited in heaven at the end. Also, Castiel died randomly too, which angered a bunch of people in fandom. Castiel, in my opinion, was a one note character, who after awhile, acted like Patrick Starfish from SpongeBob.Don't bother with this show. I fully expect to see thrift shops bloated Hot Topic produced Supernatural merchandise, that will probably end up in a landfill somewhere."
44,"I watched this series when it first came out and then tuned out after a year or two.Sam and Dean are the protagonists. The key phrase is 'Angry White Men.' This enables them to be badasses, but the writing, while not completely banal, is mediocre with flashes of good.A Veni, Vidi, Vici show: ('I came, I Saw, I Conquered) in nearly every episode. Last season they loosed God's Sister, whom God had imprisoned Lo, those many billions of years ago. She lived inside a rune on Dean's arm (which was the mark of Cain. Loooong story). So, after the 10 episode buildup (complete with stories that have NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the impending crisis of God's Sister UN-doing All Creation, Naturally, God's Sister wins the showdown with God. But then she lets him live because all She ever wanted was His Love (Sound like God and His Sister are part of the typical dysfunctional American Family? You'd be right.) You'd have thunk they'd close up shop afterthat. No Fear. New Gotterdamerung every season. I would like the show ifthe protagonists could act, but their skills are poor. OH, and there's an Angel, who, despite, having lived a billion years, is completely ignorant of the behavior of humanity. He's on the two brothers side because 'God has plans for you.' Oh, the grandiosity never dies. Anyway, the Angel is on their side, too. However, he's been killed (yeah, Angels die by thehundreds here) once or twice. The worst is the dialogue. Everyone - even the Angel - speaks as though they were born after 1990. The usual ""lets do it"", and every other current colloquial is used - even if they travel back to the 18th century, you can be sure the speech patterns don't strain the brains of the viewers. No reason that, while they go back intown to get The Colt (45) gun, even the townsfolk sound as though they're 20th century citizens. Scriptwriting = 2. Like so many current TV shows, not a lot of depth, but lots of action. Just don't watch it if you expect intelligent dialogue. And it's CW, acronym for Childish Wishes. Nobody is over 12. Okay. 14. Misery hangs over the entire series. Demons drink, Angels have the exact same emotions as humans, nobody remotely resembles an otherworldly being. It's as though to watch adult drama, once must turn to PBS Murder Mysteries. Good for fast forwarding through, and clearly has its fans, but it ain't nowhere close to All That. Started out good: formulaic as Hell (and Heaven) now. OY."
45,I hate cw. i can write an essay about how much i love this show and y'all ruined it with that stupid finale.
46,"What started out as an amazing, well written story and funny/cool characters is slowing going worse and worse. I personally loved the first 3 seasons, but after that it just started to get repetitive. For me it's starting to get to the point where I barely can bother watching it anymore. There's just too much unneeded drama, stupid plot-twists, and boring story. Angles and demons were interesting for that one season but now they're pushing 9th and its still about them. What happened to all the vampires, ghouls, ghosts, and other creatures? Why can't they go back to basics, at least a little more often than now. I can't stand the demon- angle fight anymore."
47,"I used to really love this show years ago. I even recommended it to multiple people. After having seen the show finale last night, I just need to warn you....don't. Don't watch this. Spare yourself. Go find some better show that respects its characters, understands the concept of character development and isn't socially deaf.There's plenty of good shows with strong writing out there. Pick another one."
48,"This is the kind of show that everybody has been waiting for! I have been watching this show since the very first episode and I have noticed that all this reality s*** out now is getting to be more and more obnoxious but it's nice to know that a show like this is still running! The horror and suspense actually gets to me, in a good way of course. You would not expect to become nervous while watching a TV show, but this one knows how to start suspense and end suspense within an hour and make it absolutely amazing. The special effects are always fantastic and the script always has me on the floor laughing, well not literally. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are one of the best teams I've seen in a very long time! They play off each other very nicely and not to mention the fact that they are both extremely attractive. Although if you are thinking about starting to watch this show now, I'd take the time to check out or even purchase the first 3 seasons, the show is so much better watching it from the beginning as compared to starting it mid 4th season, as with most shows.All in all, if you aren't watching this show, you are missing out!!!!(you're not allowed to shout in your comments in this, but I want to shout in a good way! It won't let me!!)"
49,"I made an account on IMDB specifically to make this review, and I'll try and make it really short.Looking for something to watch, I browsed through TV shows / series and filtered them by ranking. In most cases, I feel the ranking was pretty coherent, shows I felt were exceptionally good had very high rankings and vice versa. And then I started watching Supernatural.I could hardly believe it! I double checked that the ratings / reviews on IMDB and the show I was watching were the same, and they were.The acting is poor, in many cases, it's atrociously horrible. The scripts and dialogues couldn't be more cheezy, the jokes and humour are bland 1st degree. The story and plot, but also the invents that unfold within each episode lack a lot of coherence and I could go on and on and on.So I quit watching it after the first episode.A bit later, searching for another good show, I decided to look at the reviews a little more closely.It's got 93% score on rotten tomatoes!!I mean seriously? What is it that all these people, and I'm not saying they are wrong, or dumb, or anything like that, I mean it's got high scores even with ""official"" or professional critics, but what is it that they all find so good about this series?""All right then"", I thought to myself, I'll give it another shot, maybe it matures later on in the season.Well ... I'm on season 1 episode 9, and I swear I'm being honest and truthful and frank about this, but I really don't understand, cause from where I'm sitting, it's a cheap, boring TV series if I ever saw one..."
50,"Before the finale: no regrets
After the finale: one regret and it is watching this show"
51,"I almost quit watching when they portrayed God as promiscuous & bisexual, but it was one episode out of many excellent ones, but making God the enemy of the final season, NOPE!!!!"
52,Please for the health of my entire family please just be done
53,"The first 6 seasons were amazing and addictive.
the next 3-4 seasons became a little political at times, no longer scary or intriguing but I felt it was being written for the crush struck little girls who started watching the show, still the story was evolving somehow.
the last couple seasons? no story really just lots of fight scenes, the script is being repetitive only the characters change. Some characters are being constantly revived and recycled with weird storylines just to keep the actors' jobs and it shows, the political nonesense became unbearable, and the main characters become evermore flat.
I would have loved to watch 14 seasons of the same quality of the first 6, but it's just not what happened."
54,Most homophobic gay love confession in the history of cinema. They really said bury your gays and dipped. Castiel didn't end up in super hell so dean could die of tetanus. Who greenlit this?
55,They completely ruin the story by doing what wouldve happened if dean had never got sam from stanford. sam lives a normal life while dean dies young and isnt ever happy. plus they completely ignore castiel in the last two episodes of season fifteen. this show called me a slur in 15 different languages and if i wanted to be hatecrimed i wouldve come out to my grandmas husband.
56,"The first five season are amazing.
The other five after the first five are alright.
The next five after the other five after the first five are... well, mediocre.
At best.
Lore is being screwed over again and again, God's turned into selfish bored idiotic ""villain"" (i wonder if this is somewhat personal... maybe one of the screenwriters played ""hide the pickle"" with a priest?)... It feels like Game of Thrones season 5 through 8 all over again.
Well, we have at least seven more episode to go. There is hope, i guess. Dwindling - yes - but hope nonetheless, that Supernatural will wake up and will be able to provie a propper farewell. We shall see soon enough."
57,"Supernatural is gonna draw the obvious X Files comparisons so we might as well get them out of the way now. Its stars are an intrepid duo who travel across America encountering all manner of paranormal phenomena and mythological creatures. It has a lot of ex-files staff too which is apparent if you have watch both shows pretty closely.Supernatural isn't as smart as The X Files , nor is it as cleverly written. The X Files was ahead of the time in many ways and is still unique in others, in that it was a mature drama which took its subject matter very seriously. It managed to blend sci fi and the paranormal skillfully so that you almost didn't notice the seams. Supernatural in a way is like The X Files - lite. It knows what it is and I think is a more focused show then its predecessor. From the get go it lays it out to you that it is situated in a world where ghosts, demons and witches really do exist. Once that is established its on with the show and there is no looking back whereas the X Files constantly had the viewer questioning and thinking about what he was seeing and hearing. Where The X Files was the thinking mans science paper, Supernatural is a camp fire ghost story.Which is more then fine by me. As a lover of ghost stories myself Supernatural makes for fantastic viewing. Its strongest points are its atmosphere and visual imagery. The storyline surrounding the brothers relationship to their father and to each other is in its fledgling stages and will no doubt become stronger over time. Already though it is fun to watch the interplay between Dean and Sam. being the older brother in a family of two myself I find myself sympathising with Dean. Not just because of that but also because I find his personality something I can relate to. His is very Mulder-like in his often whimsical approach to situations. The other brother Sam I find downright annoying at times with the overplayed teen angst.As for the story lines themselves this is Supernaturals weakest point. So far in the first series Supernatural has a basic structure which rarely changes - brothers drive into town, weird things (usually deaths) happen, brothers use fake ID's to find out about the demon / witch / ghost just in time to save the Hot Chick of the Week(tm) wash, rinse, repeat. If it continues Supernatural is in danger of burning out real fast. However in latter episodes there looks to be some sort of mythology developing which should hopefully complicate things. The fathers connection to their mothers death, Sams visions, the Meg demon etc.Having just criticised the story lines I have to admit I love their themes. Each week focuses on a different legend such as the woman in white, bloody mary, vampires etc. Each handled very well and with a surprising amount of knowledge. You can tell that ghost story telling is a real labour of love for the creators. It also introduces a lot of lesser known legends such as the wendigo, shrika etc. Someone is doing their homework and I cant wait to see what creatures appear in later episodes. The references to other supernatural shows such as the x files and ghostbusters is an added treat for fans of the genre. As is the classic rock soundtrack. My god someone has taste. Its like they reached into my mind and put down all my favourite past times on celluloid. Well the ones that can be viewed by under 18's anyway. I wouldn't say Supernatural has ""made scary sexy"". I would say its made scary cool again. If only I could be cool again too. Maybe I would be if I had a Chevy Impala too.All in all an excellent new series dripping with humour, atmosphere and chills. Here's to series two!"
58,If you watch to see the brothers forget about almost everyone they've ever known and touch foreheads with each other then go ahead. If you're watching for the character development and consistency and because you love the journey these boys have been on over 15 seasons don't bother.Also did they run out of money because where was the original version of Carry On Wayward Son and why were the vampires and Sam wearing cheap Halloween props?Hopeless endings are... bad actually. And it's poorly written and weird to boot!
59,The longest hate crime on the history of television. Making cass confess and sending him to the empty and not appearing in the finale. It Sucked.
60,"Overall this is one of the best tv series of all times. Not every episode or season has been a 10/10, but the series as a whole defnitely is a 10/10.Worth watching!"
61,"I wasn't sure this was going to be a ""must see"" for me, but the atmospheric lighting, outstanding writing and acting had me from the first. It doesn't hurt that veteran X-Files director was in charge of the pilot. Steve Railsback (X-Files' Duane Berry) was seen briefly as the haunted husband of the ghost in question. Clever musical references as well as humorous asides, (""Agent Scully. Agent Mulder."") add spice for the viewer, not to mention outstanding ""gotcha"" moments and spooky special effects."
62,"Not only you silenced the Angel , but that wasn't enough, you had to silence the other one , you ruined 15 years of spn just to keep audience for Jared's walker, For you pandered to Jared fangirls, aka the most toxic fandom ever.
I've been watching spn for years, for many reasons , but sam was never part of them, Jared is an horrible actor and if you think he can support a show alone then they you are more dumb than I thought."
63,"Seasons 1-5 of 'Supernatural' were brilliant.Although many of season 1's episodes are ""hit-and-miss"" and its overarching storyline is over-simplistic, the suspense, horror and urban lore makes this show unique and addictive. The plot and writing just get better and better in the next few seasons, with hints and clues that keep you hooked and gradually reveal a clever, wonderfully crafted underlying conspiracy.The writers' attention to lore and their respectful and interesting interpretation of Judaeo-Christian mythology (in seasons 4&5) makes the content of 'Supernatural' incredibly fascinating.Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) are complex, well- written, likable leads. Even the supporting characters - John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Bobby (Jim Beaver), Ellen (Samantha Ferris) and Jo (Alona Tal) are written with depth. Villains such as Meg (Nicki Aycox & Rachel Miner), Crowley (Mark Sheppard), Azazel (Frederic Lehne) and Alastair (Christopher Heyerdahl) are hauntingly chilling characters. And then there's fan favourite Castiel (Misha Collins), who undergoes an almost flawless development arc. Credit goes to all of these actors for portraying their characters so skilfully and realistically.However, after the massive climax of the season 5 finale, the show just seems washed-out and bland. The overarching story lines are all over the place - first there's Eve, and Castiel betraying the brothers, then the Leviathans and Metatron and the Angel War. The massive discrepancy in the feel of these seasons makes it seem that they're set in completely different universes.The mythology, especially that of the angels, is not being treated respectfully any more, especially in seasons 9-10. They are no longer proud, unbending warriors of Heaven; they've been dumbed down to one-dimensional, unintelligent, over-exaggerated, almost childish people. In most episodes the 'monster of the week' reflects the writing team's lack of depth and research.Every episode seems to follow the same overused structure - initial death scene, investigation, death of the monster, and then a long, dramatic conversation between the brothers in the car. During these talks the brothers constantly lie to each other and suffer from massive guilt trips and while this was heartrending the first time, after the endless repetitions it's just become cringeworthy and boring. The character of Crowley, too, has become dull and uninteresting after six seasons without development.Granted, there are a few good episodes and characters in seasons 6- 10. Kevin (Osric Chau), Charlie (Felicia Day) and Garth (DJ Qualls) are likable, unlikely heroes, while Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) and Rowena (Ruth Connell) make interesting villains. Castiel's backstory and an insight into Bobby's regular life are interesting, and there are several standalone monster-of-the-week episodes that are better than the rest.Overall, 'Supernatural' used to be brilliant, but its overused tropes and clichés, its lacklustre storytelling and overdramatic overtones mean that it is only a shadow of its former grandeur. If you enjoy urban legends, horror, suspense and mystery, go for seasons 1-5, because they are excellent. Its creator, Eric Kripke, intended it to stop after season 5 but sadly it was continued and desecrated so that CW could milk as much money out of it as possible."
64,"The finale rivals GoT and Sherlock in awfulness. No Cas anywhere? Dean Winchester, the man who fought God and Lucifer, bloody dies because of a rusty nail in the wall and a bunch of clown vampires with only his brother by his side in his last moments. Absolutely terrible. He wanted to go down swinging and they couldn't even give him that. Sam is wearing a wig from a Party City bargain bin and is married to a woman they didn't even show the face of. I hope CW is paying out damages to Misha Collins, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. To Andrew Dabb, one of the writers who contributed to this fiasco: I am coming for your kneecaps."
65,"When your show started, I was in high school and it was my favourite show ever. It had so much potential! Monsters, folktales, the American Fantasy-Western with jokes and ghosts and interesting characters that filled the uniquely colourful world of small town America. Wow, I thought, I've found it. This is the show for me. Oh, but how wrong I was.Over the next fifteen years, as I grew up, left high school, fell in and out of love, studied, worked and travelled. As I learned who I was and what kind of world I was living in, you spent fifteen seasons trotting out the same hyper-masculine power-fantasty. You spent fifteen years bludgeoning us with the same tired picture of toxic co-dependency, the same lies and fights, the same pseudo-moral-dilemma of weather or not to empathise with a pair of selfish murderers. You gave the same speeches over and over and over. Well, I suppose we can't expect personal growth from characters created by someone who has obviously never experienced any. So, across fifteen seasons, you fridged women, shared offensive stereotypes, insulted your audience and queer-baited us all any time your ratings dropped. In fact, you proved more backwards than any of the most backward folk in any of the smallest towns that Sam and Dean ever travelled to.But I don't have the time or the energy to tell you every way you've hurt us. Besides, if you wanted to listen, you'd have done it by now. But in case you ever care to figure it out, try season eight's 'Man's Best Friend With Benefits' which has a Black woman wearing a collar as a white man's servant or look at Charlie's out of character and off-screen death or look at any other woman who was killed to try and wring a bit more angst out. Look at the countless onscreen jokes about Dean and Castiel's relationship and really think about what was supposed to be so funny about them. Look at the sheer laziness of the emotional arc of any story in your series and look at the substance of anything remotely resembling an apology that you've made. I have gay friends is not an excuse anymore.Then, imagine your fans. Not the ideal fan you imagined having when you fantasised about your success. Imagine the people who supported your work. Imagine the teenagers, going through their own upheavals as they dealt with growing up. Imagine people in the midst of social and political turmoil. Imagine the gay kids looking for representation without stereotypes. Imagine the girls, trying to picture themselves in a world where their existence wasn't just token. Imagine the people of colour and the women and the boys who were just a little soft. Imagine what it would have meant to them if a show that started out so macho could really get in touch with reality. The reality where everyone is different, but looking for the same comforts. The reality where gender is a spectrum and love is boundless and every single person is a fantastic mess of beliefs and experiences. Imagine a man out there whose father taught him to objectify women and feel nothing. Imagine him seeing himself in Dean and imagine what a revelation it would be if Dean could quit being his father's soldier and start being himself.In a changing world where awareness of sex and gender diversity has skyrocketed, where Black Lives Matter and MeToo has shaped the media landscape, where people have more access to information and to differing perspectives than ever before, it astounds me that any program could go through all of that with us and still be so firmly rooted in the past. It amazes me that despite protest from within and without, you barrelled head-long into an ending that ignored the energy of the cast, the desires of the fans and the logic of progress. You excluded a character who is almost solely responsible for any success beyond season 4. You gave us a deus ex machina and a cheap grey wig and a farewell that rung so utterly false it was laughable.When you spend fifteen years telling stories, you have to expect you'll become a symbol. You did become a symbol - for a time in people's lives, for a community of fans, for a way of life. But in the end you became a symbol for the holdouts. The people who refuse to change. The people so obsessed with an idea they had fifteen years ago that they can't see the incredible opportunities they are absolutely wasting.To be honest, I'm relieved. It's over. You can't string me, or anyone else, along anymore. I'm not writing this hoping for change. I'm done hoping. I'm not even writing this hoping for any kind of response. I'm writing this because it gives me the chance to put what I feel into words. It gives me the chance to send it away into the world and to never, ever have to think about your joke of a show. ever. again."
66,"***SPOILER*** I write this as i have completed season 1, 2 & first three epsd of season three. i.e. Horrible, even when I accept the ridiculous premise of the show. Demons who hang out @ a local bar like local drunks! The fact that supernatural beings & humans are at the same level to actually fist fight each other! The dialog/ writing is bad, the only saving grace is the kidding & joking around by Dean W. character.The worst character so far is Tamara @ the beginning of Season three! The impala is a crappy car for the show & the heavy metal music is overdone. The cultural references are (relatively) ancient .Season three opening episode is the most disappointing one yet, they faced the seven sins personified & they fell like dominoes all too easy, three of them killed by mystery woman w/ super killer knife!!!"
67,"I was a HUGE fan of this show since Season 4. I adored the characters, I loved Castiel with all my heart and honestly to me he makes the show(until Jack is introduced) and Charlie, Garth, Bobby, and Donna and many more found family characters. Knowing this information I wish to tell you why I now hate it with all my being and it crushes me to say it however it needs to be said.
I had high hopes for Sam and Dean. I could see them happy and living and loving the way they wanted but the writers cruelly took that away and pleased the most TOXIC part of the fandom and destroyed all that character growth and everything the show stood for.
You didn't take us on a ride dear writers, you did a sharp U turn back to the beginning and slammed us into a tree and ignited the flames. Congrats, you destroyed my comfort show and I hate you for it
#TheySilencedThem"
68,"With each season the show more and more dumb and loses its logic. ""DARKNESS""? Seriously, it 's a new evil? Who writes the script, the herd of monkeys? Why is such an important print walks hand unattended? Why is God sending Lucifer to hell, not taken printing? Where did God, this is going to explain, and we are waiting for another five seasons of his quest? And when Castiel stops wearing face castrated spaniel? These brothers and angel together have done more problems than all the demons headed by Crowley. Each time they make the same mistakes as they are alive so long at such stupidity? I'll be watching the next season with the hope that he is the last and least someone of the trio finally killed."
69,"Trying really hard to like this show but the writing is SO BAD. Watching an episode tonight and they have passengers being directed to their seats by a flight attendant as they board a plane. Nobody does this. It's like the most mundane detail turned into a lie that ruins the show. Why, why? Why throw in things that ruin the believability of the show when you are already asking the audience to suspend disbelief of the supernatural? It's just plain bad work."
70,"I saw the pilot last night and was very happy with the production team. David Nutter, who was involved on the X-Files- hence giving Supernatural that ""X-Files-ish tone"" is a fantastic director. He is a veteran of this field having directed X-Files, Roswell, Dark Angel, Smallville, Disturbing Behavior, Millennium, etc. One of the producers, McG, has produced The OC, and has directed both Charlie's Angels movies. Jared and Jensen are placed in roles they are familiar with, Jared is playing Sam, a character who seems to be a tougher version of Dean, his character from the Gilmore Girls. Jensen is playing Dean, a character who is extremely close to being a human clone of his sarcastic character from Dark Angel, Alec. Opening a WB show with such great effects scores big with me- not giving anything away, the special effects are what Nutter and his team are capable of. Sarah Shahi as a guest star was icing on the cake. The only problem I see with the show is the fact that it is not geared towards the main demographic of the OC and Gilmore Girls (which airs in the time slot before Supernatural) and it may turn away a group of older viewers who may really enjoy it. As long as they don't call it the ""teen X-Files"" or ""Buffy meets Twin Peaks"" it will be fine. Trying to make Roswell be the next ""Buffy"" ruined the show, and it would be a shame to ruin Supernatural."
71,"This is absolute trash. It has the production value of a South American telenovela (or at least it looks that cheap). The writing is smug and free of consequence. The characters are bland paper cutouts. And all horror or supernatural elements are done without any respect for its creatures, ghosts, and so on. Don't"
72,"After a while the storyline is nonsense, seasons/episodes are piling up and logic is thrown out of the window. The channel hang on to it to dear life, but only because they have no idea what to do without it as it's main attraction. They even pushed the second half of the final season to next Fall. I'm disgusted with the way CW handled the run (to the ground) of this show and won't watch its pointless series finale. I rewatch some early seasons episodes, whenever I feel like it. Because it used to have that X-Files feel I love so much. Stopped my DVD collection after season 7. So people telling you it's good, because it lasted 15 seasons, are wrong. The general consensus is that it should've ended a long time ago. And they are dead right. Bring on the thumbs down."
73,The only star in this show is Cas and you can't change my mind.
74,"If you like watching paint dry, then you will love this show. Watched a whole season of it and got bored so ended up painting my fence and watched it dry."
75,"It's a mini horror movie every week. Supernatural brings American urban legends into your home each episode. All those stories you told around the campfire as a child come to life in this explosive TV show. From the exceptional writing to the awesome soundtrack, this TV show is a step above the rest. I love seeing the dynamic between the brothers, Sam and Dean. It seems that no matter what has happened in the past, family is family. I imagine this show is a production nightmare. There are so many great special effects, it's like being at your local cinema. And you can't forget that car. A '67 Impala that the brothers travel the country in. With the classic rock tunes blaring on the cassette player and the roar of the engine, this car is hot! Overall, I think Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV. My only concern is them running out of good material. I mean there are only so many urban legends. However, I've heard they've got the first 3 seasons pretty much mapped out, so at least we can have a few good years, right."
76,"Very disappointing. The finale episodes completely undermine everything the previous seasons had been working towards. While also repeating the ""Bury your gays"" trope, which has been used a lot through supernatural.
I had wrote out a massive review then the website crashed and deleted it and I cannot be bothered to retype it."
77,"If you have yet to watch Supernatural, now is the time to do it. Fans of lore and legends will eat up ""Supernatural"" without a second thought, and come back for seconds. From Demons to the Devil himself, this show has got it all. Here is a small introduction to the series, to all of you newcomers.Supernatural is the story of two brothers, older bro Dean Winchester (played by the sexy, fantastic actor Jensen Ackles, who would be known from shows/movies such as My Bloody Valentine and Dark Angel) and younger bro Sam Winchester (played by the just-as-sexy-and-fantastic actor Jared Padalecki, known from his role as Dean on Gilmore Girls) being trained to hunt and kill supernatural beings by their father, John (played by Jeffery Dean Morgan of P.S. I Love You and Grey's Anatomy, on which he played the memorable character Denny). Years before the series takes place, John's wife, Mary, woke up to the sound of baby Sam crying over the baby monitor. She peeked into his room to see a figure,presumably John, standing by the crib. She left the room, but on her way back to bed she heard the Television downstairs. She walked down to see John watching TV. Noting this, Mary ran back up to Sam's room only to find a yellow-eyed demon standing over her baby boy. Seconds later, she was dragged onto the ceiling with a large, bloody gash in her stomach. John, hearing a commotion, quickly made it to the room, only to see blood dripping into Sam's crib and Mary on the ceiling. Before he could react, the room burst into flames. John had Dean take Sam outside while he tried to save his wife, to no avail. The house was destroyed, Mary was dead... and John had no where else to go. After that day, he swore vengeance on the Yellow Eyed Demon, and he took his sons along for the ride.Flash forward to 22 years later. Sam is now in college, preparing for an interview at Stanford University to study Law. He is with his long-time girlfriend, Jessica. Late during the night before his interview, Sam awoke to a sound of someone in the house. After a brief struggle with the intruder, he realized it was his brother, who has been away with John for years. Dean tells Sam that their father has been missing for a while on a 'hunting trip;' a hunt for supernatural monsters, that is. After a very unexpected turn of events (which I will not state, for it will spoil some things), Sam reluctantly joins his brother on the search. The ""Supernatural"" series begins here.""Supernatural"" goes beyond the unexplained, hitting everything from a paranormal spirit haunting a house to the war between God and Lucifer's army, along the way meeting creatures such as the hilarious and uncalled-for Trickster, a Valentine's Day Cupid, shape-shifters, werewolves, vampires and even angels.""God? Does this show turn religious on us?"" No.Starting in season 4, you are introduced to Lucifer, God and the angels. But, the thing is, it is definitely not what you expect from it. the lore of angels and demons is kept in parts and completely thrown on its head at others. God isn't necessarily the 'God' you know, and neither is Lucifer for that matter. They don't show the devil in the traditional way, with red skin, a pitchfork and horns. He looks like a human being. A very creepy and sadistic human being, but a human being nonetheless.Which brings me to what I like most about the show. The effects. Many shows on television use a crap-ton of CGI (computer generated imagery) to make their monsters. Supernatural, although a fair amount of CGI is present, uses makeup effects and short cuts to get away from the bad-looking CGI beasts. Hellhounds, for instance, are invisible to the human eye. You can hear them and feel them, but you can't see where they are. Demons are large wisps of black smoke that enters a human to possess, at which point the eyes of said human turn completely black. The demons can hide the blackness to get into different areas of society without being noticed. These little alterations make the show worth watching. You don't get the cheesy looking CGI characters that most Sci-Fi shows do a poor job on due to budget and time. You get creepy, evil beasts and creatures that can scare the daylights out of you.One more thing I ought to mention is the unfathomably amazing season finales this show puts on. Seriously. Yes, the storyline and the relationship between the brothers keeps you interested, but once you get to the finale of a season, you automatically want to watch the next. Every season has a perfect cliffhanger that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Summers are a very hard thing to get through with this show.All in all I have to rate this show a 10 out of 10. I can't seem to find anything to fix. The acting of Jared and Jensen as the brothers is fantastic. Their moods and actions are perfect, and you could seriously believe they were real-life bros (likely due to the fact that they are best friends). The storyline is extremely well-written and perfectly paced. The dark and terrifying episodes are balanced out by the humorous ones that leave you laughing until your stomach hurts. Everything about this show is worth noting, but I can't say it all. I'll leave the rest up to you.Now stop reading my rant about this show and GO WATCH IT."
78,"Not sure what's wrong with people nowadays, but rating this show (really made for 12-16 year old female teenagers) a 10/10 if simply beyond belief. The show has nothing to offer - the story-lines are non-existent and repetitive, the acting is really, really bad, and even the special effects are under par. Please understand that there's a huge difference between shows made for the mindless masses and proper works of cinematographic art that actually have a message to share. This show is so bad, that it makes me love and cry at the same time just reading some of the feedback. Ah well... in the end, it's your life you're wasting watching this rubbish, not mine, but please rate shows accordingly."
79,"Here are the two biggest reasons this show sucks.1.) The characters. This show is praised for showing brotherly love between the characters of Sam and Dean. While I will admit there is definitely a connection between these two characters, it can hardly be called love. When these two characters aren't hunting demons, they're constantly bickering and whining at each other and insulting each other. This can hardly be called love. I understand that siblings generally do like making fun of each other, but it's usually in jest and in a loving way. These two characters treat each other like garbage and they mean it. So the connection between these two characters sucks. But I bet you're wondering if they're at least good by themselves, aren't you? Nope. They suck by themselves, too.Dean: I'll admit there can sometimes be some charm to a womanizing main character, but not when the character is constantly making jarringly unfunny sex jokes and going around doing it with every girl he meets. If this character maybe had some sort of, I don't know... what do you call it... HEART? He might be a little likable. But he's basically just a womanizing slut with no regard for anyone's feelings unless it's a hot chick with big boobs and blond hair. You'd think he'd really care about his little brother and want to protect him no matter what, but all he wants to do is make his little brother just as big a slut as he is.Sam: Well. At least this character isn't SUCH a slut. He's got something of a heart, at least. But the problem with this character is that all he does is bitch and moan about how he wanted a normal life, and how his girlfriend died. Now, we can all sympathize with a dude who lost his girlfriend, and who wants to live a peaceful life, as long as he eventually stops complaining and becomes a stronger person. Sam never does. In fact, Sam even turns bad for awhile, which really makes his character plummet. Now there can be a certain interesting edge when your character have some flaws to them. But not to the point where every single one of them is an asshole. That's just unrealistic and it makes your characters unlikable to boot. Also, it's totally stupid how this character has DEMON BLOOD in him. Do you know how stupid that sounds? Other characters: Now, like in a lot of shows, the two brothers cross random people each day and help them purge evil demons from their houses. But all the people they meet are usually ALL THE SAME TYPE OF PERSON. They're all girls who are gorgeous and have blond hair. I swear they didn't save a single fat person in that show. All of the girls have the same type of personality, too. And the demons they encounter are all the same, too. They all have that same slutty personality and they're not even scary like they're supposed to be. There's always a stupid girl demon who comes onto Sam or Dean and tries to sensually make some stupid deal with them to bring back their dad. Even the male demons act like this. Even LUCIFER acts like this. The only likable character in this show is probably Bobby. He's a nice old man who actually cares about Sam and Dean and treats them decently. Also, even the angels are slutty and assholes. Yeah. It's pretty messed up.2.) The story. The story in this had potential to be quite charming, but it even fails there. The biggest problem with the story is the pervading feeling of hopelessness. It just leaves you with a sad, icky, tired feeling after each episode. Because all of the characters are severely unlikable, and no one in this show can really be considered a good person, it just kind of like... yeah the world might end, but maybe it's for the best if every person in Heaven, Hell, and on Earth are assholes. Another problem with the story is that they ALWAYS have stupid hypothetical episodes about Sam and Dean's ideal lives. Now, one of these types of episodes is okay, and can even be quite interesting, but when it happens, like, more than ten times, it can become really annoying."
80,"Thought the first episode was pretty good, even if the brothers were annoying. By the end of episode 2 I found Dean insufferable. Annoying actors, corny scripts. I can't bring myself to watch another episode."
81,"Just saw the preview on Yahoo of the first episode and it was better than I anticipated. There are a few new series this fall with the same idea (aliens/supernatural phenomena/mystery encountered by a pair of sleuths) so it's hard to say if this show will set itself apart. Remember that ""E/R"" and ""Chicago Hope"" were two hospital dramas that debuted on the same night, at the same time, on two different networks (if you said ""what is Chicago Hope?"" then my point is made.) Jared Padalecki, of ""Gilmore Girls,"" is a familiar face who gets a chance to toughen up his image a little. The first episode sets up some mysteries to be solved over the season but also has some immediate gratification. No spoilers here ~ you'll have to watch it yourself. It's got a bit of an ""X Files"" feel to it ~ we'll see in future episodes whether they can keep the stories as interesting while giving the talented lead actors something meaty to work with."
82,"Season 12 was probably the worst season yet. They just shoved random plot lines in there, killed off an extremely good character, but not before ruining their story-line, and all in all made me never want to watch the series again. Word of advice, do not watch supernatural after season 5, because the writing keeps going downhill from there."
83,"Season 1-3 are ok.
Seasons 4-14 are amazing and the reason I love life
Season 15 is utter disgusting and nastyness."
84,"I would rather jump off a building get kicked in the nuts multiple times then watch this sad excuse of BS. Terrible acting terrible plot
I hate myself for watching"
85,"The good old Supernatural Winchester brothers are gone. Now from season 12, Sam is just a weak character with some pathetic compassion that is making the show a drag to watch."
86,"So here's the plot of this show that so many young people say is ""toooo cool"" and of which I've seen most of the first season. Friends tell me the latter seasons go way off the track and angels and demons become everyday people and Heaven gets put into an office complex. Thank God I did not see those seasons! Two brothers who's names don't really matter, gallivant around the country, committing credit card fraud and identity theft in order to track down and do battle with mythical monsters and spiritual beings of folklore. While viewing this mind-numbingly awful series with a teenager, I had to hear repeatedly how she thought one of the brothers was ""so cute"" and I soon found this was her go-to excuse when I commented on just how bad the show was. Seems having ""cute"" stars makes up for incoherent stories and cardboard characters. This show attempts (and fails) to be a younger version of X-Files, a show that is far superior in all aspects and created a phenomenon of other, similarly themed shows that brought us to the dead end that is Supernatural. My advice? Don't watch it. Do something better with you time, like give yourself a paper cut or eat a bug."
87,"This isn't about a ship, not completely. Many people think that we are upset with the way Supernatural ended over the thrown out Destiel storyline but that isn't the whole story. It is the way the writers again and again treated characters that were queer like they were plot devices and then killed them off or wrote them out of the story. Castiel is only the latest example with his confession before being tossed in the empty never to be seen again. Charlie, a fan favorite lesbian character, was brutally murdered by Nazis and tossed in a bathtub. Then there is Claire and Kaia who were both written out of the story in the end.There were also countless other characters whose stories were introduced and then seemingly forgotten about. Jody and the Wayward sisters, Donna (who only got a phone call in the series finale), and worst of all Eileen. Eileen was killed not once, but twice by something she had to hear. First by a hellhound and second by Chuck snapping her out of existence. After Jack brings everyone back in episode 19, there is no question from Sam about whether Eileen was brought back as well. She wasn't mentioned at all in the final two episodes.On the topic of Sam and Dean's lack of concern for the people that they had begun calling their family in the final two episodes, it is very out of character for them. The entire premise of the show is built on 'family doesn't end in blood' and yet the final two episodes reversed that sentiment entirely. Dean begged Chuck to bring Cas back, even if it meant having to kill Sam and then himself, and then didn't even ask Jack to bring him back. Then in the next episode, he had completely moved on from any grief associated with the loss of his best friend. The final episode creates a dynamic in which the brothers are the most important thing to each other and no one else matters which reverses the character development to where it was in season one."
88,"So many shows have potential, but never the willingness to risk anything. There will never again be a show like Supernatural. It's a shame they took their most promising storylines and threw them away unfinished. I don't think I'll bother investing my time in any new shows on the CW network, they obviously don't have integrity if they had no respect for their longest running show. 1 star for a ruined legacy."
89,When they had changed showrunner around season 6(or 7) this show went downhill. In the last season they just started mocking God and Christianity. From Bible-neutrality to hating Bible. It's been low-quality soap drama for the last 5 seasons and the final season is just making it senseless. The show would've had a good legacy if they weren't so greedy.
90,"1. Good looking regulars 2. Action 3. Mild horror4. A script that isn't completely idiotic Add these together and you have a decent show. However it is not ""the best show ever"". In many ways it is desperately dull and unoriginal. The fans who drone on and on about how 'deep' and 'underrated' it is, or how well-written ... please get a clue. Step back and take a look. Stop drooling over Jensen and Jared and really take a look at the show. Now think about how far TV SF/Fantasy has fallen for this to be considered by some as ""the best."" ""Supernatural"" is mildly entertaining, with added eye candy. Nothing more."
91,"I will say one thing - I've opened IMDB account just to give a review to this show. I've heard about it before and gave it a shot. After 7 episodes of Season 1, thing still haven't got ANY better.
The show had a potential, but the characters.. oh boy, haven't seen such bad acting in years. Their dialogs are ridiculous and the way how they are integrating background stories over the cases is super bad. Overall, the show feels like a horror for poor people. Really bad. But I'll keep watching till the end of Season 1, hoping thing will get better. Just because of my compulsive nature of finishing things even if they are really bad."
92,"The biggest and the worst idea in any tv series is the corny way to end the episodes, I couldn't handle Dean! He is kissing every girl he saved, that's way annoying, it looks like friends, the cutie dude on the film, I want to know how the people can love this!?
The story was good but Dean is my only problem, I Stopped watching the tv series because of how they made him like this, flirting with every victim is disgusting that's my opinion, if they changed how they treated him I might be continue watching it, and I think it was made for Friends fans only, because they are the only creatures who wants to see love stories in every thing."
93,"Any time I see supernatural anywhere I immediately say to myself ""Why on earth I wasted precious time of my life on this"""
94,"In the beginning, it was much better, episode with god and angels that became a constant in series it branches with insulting Catholicism, that refused me to follow the series further, I think I stopped around 10 or 11 seasons!"
95,"This is one of the worst series i have ever seen, i stop seeing on 4 season because I'm reading that it gets worse (uau) I don't know were to start; you may not see 4 or five episodes and you don't lose nothing, its to repetitive totally predictable, for example; they enter every building disguised as whatever without no one questions anything, every episode has the solution in the last 5 minutes, if one of the brothers get caught the other always find out the location like magic. its really one of the worst shows ever. And its not going to be a bad classic (the ones that are so bad that they became good)... Don't waste your time. Comparing this s** with x files is a crime"
96,"America has a way of running shows into the ground rather than let them play out a story arc and end them properly and on a high.Supernatural was great for the first 5 or so seasons, after that it lost it's way many times. It has become repetitive as well. How many more times are one of the boys going to be possessed/become evil or get banished to some kind of hell? It just keeps happening over and over.Why do we need the long boring story arcs? I would be just as happy with the original monster of the week stories.And how about more funny? The crazy episodes they did were always my favourite, recently the Scooby Doo inspired one was great.Keep it funny guys and stop trying to be so damn serious all the time. It has become boring."
97,"I personally hate this show, but I'll give it 4/10 for its writing, however I'd preferred they be working on a different show."
98,"Much like movies based on comic books, this show panders to unimaginative people who equate lots of action to quality and don't want to think too hard. I watched a few seasons hoping it would get better, then I felt embarrassed and mad at myself for wasting so much time on this trash when there's an ocean of superior more challenging television shows. The acting is terrible and EVERY. EPISODE. IS. THE. SAME. Oh Dean's in hell again? Sam is sad again? It's pretty obvious what will happen. They ran out of folk lore and mythology, so turned to biblical characters, and now they're just scraping the bottom of the barrel. This show is on rails and doesn't even try because it knows that its hordes of mouth breathing fans will keep watching."
99,"All the tv shows are having their ups and downs, so is Supernatural, but this one here so grow on me over 10+ years I've been watching the show, it would be unfair if I gave it a score under 10.
Over my college years, different cities I've been living at in search for job and myself actually - Winchesters and Casstiel were always here almost every week to entertain me. A long way Supernatural and myself have done over the years so the news about ending the show with 15th season get to me more than I could imagine.As a horror and mythology lover, it didn't took long for this show to get my attention. Leading actors are great, they gave their characters so much life and it is really easy to bond with Winchester/Casstiel gang (except Mary Winchester - she never really had that spark, but I blame writers for not giving her better story)
.
You know how the friends are becoming friends? You just spend enough time with those people and if you have any mutual interests, you are becoming friends after time.
Supernatural is not masterpiece by any means, but those characters crawl under your skin over the years, so ending the show is like watching your good friend leaving for good.Personally, I really recommend this one here if you are into demons, angels, ghosts, ghouls and a touch of a family drama.
Great horror-fantasy with some comic relef and at some times really cheesy but you will be entertained all the way through if you are into any of those. And soundtrack! Oh, the soundtrack... classic and modern rock all the time - it doesn't get much better than that!So go and watch it!"
100,"As a huge fan of The X-Files, discovering this show was like a dream come true. Likable characters, a new case in each episode with an underlying story to keep people tuning in week after week, and lots of twists and turns to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.But this show was intended to end after season 5. I won't spoil the ending of said season, but it's a very solid finale, and if you turn it off afterwards and pretend the other ten-thousand seasons don't exist, this can be a great show.Unfortunately, we horror fans are willing to sit through a lot of crap in the hopes for things to get better, and this show simply doesn't. Time after time, this show breaks its own set rules in order to keep it alive and going. It's almost as if the writers of this show are scared to kill off any characters. Granted, when a character actually DOES die off it's surprising, but again: this show'll do anything to keep itself going, and one of those things is constantly reviving dead characters with excuses that a nine-year old could come up with.Watch until season 5, accept the finale, and promptly pretend the other seasons don't exist."
101,"I had every episode of this show recorded and was looking forward to watching it in big chunks when I got some time. I started last week and finished today. I only managed the first 11 episodes of this tripe before binning everything. How on earth a show as dismal as this one, with appalling lead actors, has managed 15 seasons is completely beyond me"
102,"Several questions were left unanswered, and when episode 20 fixes these things I come back here to fix my grade."
103,"I started watching ""Supernatural"" about 5 years ago when I was looking for an alternative to recently watched X-files. First episodes won my attention – a dark and gloomy story, great characters, that forcing the Evil, good and appropriate humor. But starting the third season screenwriters, apparently, got a crisis of genre – for the next seven seasons series rolled out into the abyss of cr@p, maneuvering above it only with help of Jensen Ackles charisma.And despite the hopes of the last (11) season, that promised a return to the good old origins of the 1st one, it continues to give average $hit, losing even to a distant atmosphere series, such as Buffy or Fringe.I hope that the 11th season will be the last, 'cause each following year of Supernatural crap attract more and more dull children's audience, that eventually would completely kill distinct universe."
104,"Don't get me wrong I actually really enjoyed the first five seasons; the writing was great, the special effects were really good, the atmosphere was close to perfect and the acting was, for the most part, very good. But when the creator Eric Kripke stepped down at the end of the fifth season, the show started to slowly get worse. All of the special effects became computer generated (which looked a lot worse then the practical effects used in the first five seasons), the supporting actors began to get really annoying and the writing is a lot worse than it used to be; for example in the eighth season when Dean tackles Sam and tests if he is a leviathan etc. Sam doesn't seem very surprised to see his brother, who to his knowledge was dead, and speaking of bad writing I think it could have been much more entertaining if Dean had remained in Purgatory for the majority of the season. In conclusion the first five seasons were really entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed them but because Kripke stepped down the sixth season was pretty bad, the seventh season was quite awful and the eighth season is almost unwatchable."
105,"I've watched this from season one, not on CW, but when it went into syndication, and I have watched the series in order. The basis for the show - two brothers, based on the bond of family trauma due to the supernatural, travel about the land looking for the supernatural and usually finding it. The stories are compelling and interesting and often suspenseful. The acting is well done as is the direction. Why am I so ""meh"" about it? I guess it is because, after watching this show through several seasons, I just don't care about the characters. In every episode you could substitute two completely different people going through the same circumstances with different actors playing them and I would have the same connection. In modern TV shows about the supernatural, usually the stories are matephors for the human condition, so it is most important to have characters you know. Characters whose futures you care about. I was a big fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, and I grew to care about those characters in the Whedonverse. I just don't feel the same connection here.If the show is on I will usually sit down and watch it. But if I realize I missed an episode I'm pretty indifferent about it. A show missing such a magic ingredient can only get a 6/10 from me. Apparently from all of the other rave reviews I am alone in the universe in my opinion."
106,"I am completely in love with this show.I had barely heard about this show before it aired. I think I remember it being briefly mentioned in an article about new fall shows, but as soon as I read that it was going to be airing on the WB, I didn't give it a second thought.After the first episode aired, a friend of mine who shares a lot of my same tastes in TV told me that I should check it out. I was skeptical, but it was being rerun in a couple of days so figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a chance.And boy am I ever glad I did! This show is everything I've ever wanted in a TV show. It's suspenseful, the characters have depth, it's funny without being silly, it has a touch of campyness (but not enough to be ridiculous). Not to mention that the two leads are quite easy on the eyes! The strongest element of the show by far is the two leads, Jared Padalecki (Sam) and the phenomenal Jensen Ackles (Dean--who is easily one of the most compelling and likable characters I've seen on TV in a long time). They play brothers who had been separated for a few years when the search for their missing father brings them back together. They grew up hunting supernatural beings with their father so they travel across the country fighting evil things that get in their way.Dean and Sam have excellent on screen chemistry and a dynamic that really works for a show like this. It's important for a show like this, with only two leads (and really no supporting characters yet) that the two leads be interesting and complex enough both together and on their own to keep people interested in the show. The creators have hit the ball out of the park with Dean and Sam.Dean and Sam each bring their own strengths and weaknesses and each have their own crosses to bear. Dean still remembers his mother (who is shown in a flashback being brutally murdered by an unknown evil force) who died when he was a small child so he understands the reasoning behind his father's crusade. Sam is haunted by the death of his girlfriend (coincidentally--or not--killed in the exact same manner as their mother) which was the catalyst for him joining Dean in the search for their father, in the hopes that Dad has found out something more about whatever killed the most important women in his life.Every episode has a ""Evil-Thing-of-the-Week"" so to speak which the boys must discover and figure out how to kill. Most of these things spring from myths or urban legends (ie. the wendigo, Bloody Mary).I was very pleasantly surprised with this show, and after only five episodes, I have to say it has surpassed the many other shows I enjoy and is now #1 on my list of favorite current TV shows.It has a nice old school X-Files feel to it (not surprising, since several people who worked on X-Files created and write for this show), which I absolutely love, as X-Files is definitely my all time favorite show.If you like the paranormal and want to see great characters you can really care about, check out ""Supernatural"", I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
107,"Supernatural is the worst TV series ever. I have always been a fan of horror and thriller movies and TV series. My first thought after watching the first episode was, it's gonna be better than X-Files. Then after watching two or more episodes i realized it is gonna be awful. Every episode follows the same pattern, It seems to have no sense. They meet people daily and paranormal problems existing locally. Seriously every episode is equally boring with the same storyline. There are absolutely no thrills and frills. The dialogues are bitterly awful. Each and every episode , they find out about a ghost or something , they do a little research talking to people and the episode ends up with them burning a dead body, or using salt or some dumb action and the episode ends. There not even a pinch of thrill, suspense or horror. I never enjoy watching it, Very boring"
108,"I really don't know how on earth anyone enjoy watching this show...this is nothing to even talk about. I can't stand a minute of the it. There is no storyline at all,i don't know how they have came up with too many devil forces, but it's so damn fake. The special effects are not good enough,every thing seems artificial and unreal...no connection is made with the watcher.I really was expecting so much more, but i was led down.I really enjoy more watching Vampire Diaries or EVEN Spartacus rather than Supernatural... . In this genre, there is a better option like Primeval...i don't know,in the second thought, maybe the problem is with the genre,not the show."
109,"This is not a comment on the shows content or plots because I could not get past the casting choices to invest any of my time into this show. The random show I saw had some actress (I suppose not a regular) who looked no more than 14 and not much taller than the tallest Hobbit, holding a Magnum pistol, or some other heavy weapon) in the face of one of the leads acting like she was Clint Eastwood. Ridiculous. Everyone is way too young for any of the skill sets they have in the show, not like this is a new thing in film and TV but ""WHY"" do we have to keep this nonsense going. In film there is the ""suspension of disbelief"" and then there's simple, basic unbelievable aspects bordering on the absurd. Ie. This show's cast. Yeswe have had plenty examples like Charlie's Angels way back in the 70's to name only one, but did we not learn from our TV viewing mistakes? I have no problem with a certain percentage of film/TV pandering to this demographic, but why has it become the norm?"
110,"The first five seasons were brilliant. If the show had ended there? 10/10. But dear god it's gone downhill. I stuck with it until season 11, but they just started jumping the shark again and again and I couldn't stay watching. The show has outlived itself, and almost ruined what was once one of the best horror dramas on TV"
111,"I honestly loved this show but the longer this show goes on the more major problems come into focus:There is a distinct lack of female characters in this story. A lot of them were killed off or just 'disappear' and are never mentioned again. Apparently, a lot of that is because of the fanbase that seems to harbour a hatred of all female characters but it is still something that works against viewers, especially female ones. Another problem is the characters: You have your overpowered characters, your overpowered characters that do nothing, your overpowered characters that are killed laughably easy (demons/angels without names), and your 'normal' characters that survive impossible odds. Especially the powerful characters are weird. The angels, for example, are built up to be an atomic bomb on their own, each one a weapon of mass destruction. However, we never really see much of their potential, especially not from Castiel, who's belonged to the show for ten seasons now. The show has a problem with establishing how powerful a character is and sticking with it. Of course, you can't just exposit what each character can do every episode, but some guidelines would be useful. How much more powerful are the archangels in comparison to normal angels? How much more powerful are the demons? It's all a bit hazy.Another notable problem is the shameless queer baiting that's been happening since Castiel first appeared on the show 10 seasons ago. Every objective person would think that Castiel and Dean are either together or aat least have crushes on each other. Not the writers, though. There have been cut scenes where it would have been acknowledged as canon but every scene has been cut. It's a disservice to the fanbase at this point and I actually don't want to continue watching the show because it's too frustrating. 
A problem that really rankles is the fact that the show has major problems with how it represents consent. There are some moments in the show where the topic is either played for laughs or just ignored. One scene is in season 7 (Season Seven, Time For a Wedding) where Becky plies Sam with love potion to make him marry her. This amounts to rape through a date-rape drug. It's played for laughs and it doesn't have any consequences.
Another scene is in in the episode where a cursed coin makes wishes come true (season 5, 6?). One man wishes for another woman to fall in love with him. They presumably have sex. This falls under the same category as the episode with Becky, a sort of date-rape drug if you paraphrase. It isn't ever really talked about and it's seen as something problematic but somewhat harmless.The biggest problem right now is the plot. With every season the problems have to be bigger, the antagonists more powerful, the villains meaner. By now we've had demons, angels, demons, angels, the Devil, the First Demon, a Knight of Hell, Princes of Hell, the King of Hell, The Mother of All (who was somehow defeated in an episode), the Horsemen of the apocalypse, the Apocalypse, and the goddamned sister of god (no pun intended). The villains haven't been good since at least season 10 (Amara), if not before that. All in all the show has gone on for too long. It's gotten repetitive."
112,"Yeah, Andrew Dabb ruined the boys' journey, but... carry on."
113,"I've tried to give this a chance but it gets more and more painful each time I watch. It's not just the wooden acting. It's like someone got a book on folklore out of the library and just recycles the stories without any real kind of originality. And all the macho posturing is too much. Really laughable. When either of them tries to show emotions it reminds me of Joey's 'smell the fart' acting in 'Friends'. All in all it's pretty one dimensional. I suppose that when it comes down to it, Manichaean world-views don't leave much scope for nuance. The closest it seemed to come to anything vaguely new was in the storyline with the vampires who were trying to stay away from feeding on humans and be left in peace. Maybe it's asking too much of a story that sticks pretty close to the Christian parable of Good v. Evil, right down to the rosaries and Latin exorcisms but I long to see something that goes beyond these same old tropes that have been done to death."
114,I really loved this show until the angels showed up then it really just became a must watch hoping that it could move past this mistake but it never did. To add insult to injury it completed itself very amateurishly which just whatever...
115,"So many people (i must say that everyone was women.) around me was watching this show. It was a big disappointment in my opinion. There was some references and the classic (!) ""gotcha"" moments.I learned that the person in charge of pilot was the veteran X-Files director. (X-Files wasn't that good either, which explains a lot.)I surely believe that it is filmed to pay the fans the service they deserve, because they must be really helpful (for paying money) to the writer. I read the book too, it doesn't have a really original plot compared to the rest of myth and magic kind of shows.)Just read the book."
116,"This used to be my favorite TV Show ever created, up to about Season 3-4.Sam & Dean always used to catch/kill mysterious kind of creatures, but eventually the creator of this show who's so full of himself that he even involved himself and made himself look better than an actual actor he is just ruined the TV Show entirely by creating ""over the top"" kind of episodes.I don't want to go into too many details as I do not want to give out any spoilers, but the show just went down hill probably from around season 4 or 5. I'm still watching it, don't get me wrong, but nowadays it's just beyond stupid the things that are going on. They are illogical and make no sense whatsoever.Also, what's up with the entire story jumping all the time? It's like going from point A to points H and then point X, then going back to point C. Rather than points A, B, C, D...."
117,"I liked this show and I disagree slightly with the person who says they need to come up with original ""ghosts"". All of these are things that are rooted in folklore and urban legends. I think it's interesting to see how they'll explore these. Some of this is familiar yes but I'm drawn to see how they learn about each ""creature"" and the best way to overcome whatever they come across. It's a neat show that explores some of America's famous legends with a duo of brothers who are searching for their father and the ""thing"" that killed their mother. It would be neat for it to come up with new creatures but to explore the well known ones is a good way to start the season, to slowly introduce people to the otherworldly aspects of America. I recommend this show for anyone who enjoys supernatural tales and folklore."
118,"Yeah, I wish I never watched this show, every single character had the worst ending imaginable except one maybe ? And I'd say that even thy one was ooc.
I have no explanation for the number of 10* , actors friends and family maybe? seriously what show where you watching guys? Because with the last mediocre seasons and the spectacularly disastrous ending , there is no logic in rating this show more than 4*.
Conclusion : I strongly recommend not watching, this will leave you devastated."
119,"I was having fun with the show for a while, but somewhere around season eight I realized I wasn't having fun anymore. Everyone had already died at least twice and the boss fights had had to be escalated to a few new levels of super sayin the last couple of seasons to keep up the tension.... it just stopped being interesting.Now hearing about the finale I'm glad to not be really invested in the characters anymore. It sounds like they really screwed the pooch on this one. If it had been worth watching I might have picked the show back up but eh."
120,"Loved the show and peaked at Season 5. That was the most amazing storytelling, most amazing characters and script for the show. There was a sense of dread, of doom, of realism and mortality, and a wonder about the hidden world and its hidden-ness. Then it went downhill from there, reverting to soap opera levels, then further down the bar to 'apathetically bad' levels. Since its peak...1. There is no more narrative. It's become a magazine for fans, a habit, something you do in the morning and forget by midday.2. Padalecki's acting has gotten worse. He can now barely get a sentence out of ANY scenario, be it having breakfast or walking, he stutters for every second of the scene he's in. To quote Castiel, 'I find the sound of your voice grating'.3. Plotlines have become ridiculous nonsense. Every episode has one absurd 'rule'. Like who thought of that scene, the guinea pig in Antartica? The most hilarious I've heard is 'The first Reaper to die after Death's death becomes Death' Mwahaha!4. It's like no one in the show cares anymore. Obviously, everyone's had more than enough, the writers are just doodling words, the directors are checking their bucket lists, and the cast's acting have become lazy and monotonous and they can't wait to clock in and go home.5. Too many breaks. It's like the breath of the dying, or the flickering light bulb that's about to bust. Spread anything too thinly and too sparsely, and anyone will lose interest.6. Too much fan service. I get that Supernatural is now run by fans, but some scenes force it too much. People resurrecting CONSTANTLY, queerbating, antagonists being forced to form loving and sacrificial relationships with Sam and Dean, etc.7. Too many fillers. I get this is a procedural, but the main story of any season after S5 can be finished in 4 to 5 episodes. You'll know when a show has a bungling writer when you can distinguish the 'spirit' of the show apart from the episode, and you need a different episode to actually portray the show's spirit."
121,"This show is so close to be being good, it's painful. It honestly has moments of genuine fear, excitement and all-round entertainment. The only problem is its huge lack of originality.Phantom Traveler is the best example of this. Essentially a plane crashes due to an evil force but a few survive the disaster. The evil force demands that there be no survivors however and attempts to kill the others to ensure this. For the whole episode I wasn't sure if I was watching Supernatural or Final Destination. Except Final Destination was far better.Bloody Mary suffers from the same chronic lack of imagination. It has another identikit young girl with the expected black ragged hair who's suffered a terrible incident and takes the lives of others as revenge. All the features seen in the Ring and it even has her come out of the mirror, which is an unashamed rip-off of the Ring's most freakiest moment - her coming out of the TV screen.Also, where is the director during these episodes?! At one point, a woman in her house shouts at them to get of her house but she runs upstairs before they even begin to leave. Why on earth would she leave a bunch of suspicious looking strangers in her house alone when she had screamed at them to leave. Little moments like this often ruin the carefully built up atmosphere due to some sloppy directing.But aside from this, it can be very exciting and scary in places and the production values, especially the gorgeous lighting, deserve tremendous praise. The acting is generally of a high quality and the scripts can sometimes throw up a funny line that'll make you chuckle.Overall, it is a huge disappointment (how many horror TV shows are there now-a-days?) but there are a lot worse ways to spend an hour."
122,"This show has everything in terms of action and spookiness. It is a great show if you like vampires, werewolves, angels, etc. It also has a lot of heartwarming moments. There is definitely a lot of laughs as well. The relationship between the characters is awesome, especially, Sam and Dean. The amount they grow from the start of the show to the end. The amount of pain and suffering that they go through together is crazy. How they would do anything and everything for one another. This show also has a lot of sad moments as well. Just in general pretty much anything you can want in a show, it has it. It also has really creative episodes. For example, one of the episodes is filmed through the perspective of their car. By the way, the car is super sleeky and nice. All in all, amazing show."
123,"I've watched from season 1 to season 14 more than once, because I love this show. There have been some bad episodes(""Bugs"") and some really meta episodes that I personally enjoy the most because they are making fun of their own universe and how weird it is.
At first I wasn't really into it, I watched the first 3 seasons and then stopped. But then I came back because everyone was praising season 4 and I was not disappointed. We were introduced to Angels, once of which became a series regular and a fan favorite.
after season 6 the show became kinda boring and slow because it was focusing on the angel war a bit too much, but I still watched it to see where the series was going. I enjoyed season 8 and how the main villain of that season was actually smart, but I do not like how it ended.
When Lucifer was introduced into the show I got hyped, because he's the actual devil and became my absolute favorite character. RIP Lucifer.
I hated when Jack was born. How he acted and how he went evil was really dumb.
Now, Chuck AKA God.
He didn't seem that much of a bad guy to me. Yes, he left them to suffer. Yes, he didn't help almost at all, but he didn't seem like the God to start the Apocalypse because something didn't go his way.
Super hyped for the next season and the End of the Winchesters.
BTW, ""Carry on wayward son"" just fits the show so perfectly especially for season finales."
124,"I think supernatural is getting bad to worse. it started out OK, quite interesting, and I think it's funny. season 3 is the climax as it is really funny with hot ruby and scary Lilith. now, ever since season 4, this show sucks. Firstly, they made ruby an evil bitch. why can't there be a good demon? if angels are bad, then demons could be good. Secondly, angels are portrayed as weak, evil bastards who torture people. And since when do they lose to devils, and need to get a vessel? they are supposed to be all powerful, and can just materialize in whatever they like. according to the bible, I recall that some angels masquerade as men to warn lot to get out of Gomorrah or something. and all angels are supposed to have seen God at least a few times a year. Come on, Seraphs or Powers are supposed to sing God's praises around his throne 24/7, surely God will be sitting there?? You can check this out in wiki. thirdly, why is dean saved? he is NOT a good guy. he always sleep with women, fight, curse etc. definitely not an angel. even Sam is a better choice. fourthly, humans cannot BECOME demons, just like they can't BECOME angels. They are just humans. Demons are FALLEN ANGELS, so Lucifer is already not an angel. Sure, some demonic offspring, like giants, can be demon, I guess. Checked it in wikipedia. And I guessed that Antichrist, he is powerful, but not enough to turn castiel into a toy. fifthly, why is dean such a dick? just accept to be Michael's vessel! assuming I believe SPN's ""lore"", he should do it for the greater good. Did he think he could take on Lucifer alone? Dream on! can SPN stop that angels and demons crap? I signed on to watch horror, ghosts, and zombies, not God and theology. The only good stuff is Dean's looks, hot chicks, cool special effects, and (occasionally) funny moments."
125,"Supernatural is a hell of an accomplishment to get up to 15 season, now I must admit I fell out the loop on the show round maybe season 10, I couldn't actually say, to be fair this show is just great to have on in the background or if you just want to enjoy a little escapism, you can see and feel the actors having a good time, and everyone knows or has heard how good friends the cast are off set. If you just want a break something enjoyable to watch, something easy, this I would recommend, if you hadn't seen this by now, you've got a lot of catching up to enjoy, that would be one crazy binge haha."
126,I relized from the beginning this show brings real life. Even if there is no real connection you feel it . THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE . That there are others dealing with simular situations. Plus they were the first show to create a help line. When they are emotional in a scene they bring their real selves into it. You can tell real fro. Fake. They helped my 100% To me they are Family.
127,"Imagine a show's ending that is worse than got, dexter, how I met your mother, and lost combined : this is it , this is supernatural.
Don't watch this mess you will lose moths, years of your life and then you will hate yourself for giving it a chance after it ends ."
128,"Straggling to finish in FF, season 8. Show tittle should be ""Supernatural screwballs"", the 2 brothers and 1 angel. 2 brothers screwing up with everything, again and again, heaven, hell, angels, demons and the whole universe. I vote 8/10 up to 5th season and 3/10 for the rest."
129,"I only watched the first few episodes. It's boring, hardly any fun, intense scenes... The brothers basically have no bond whatsoever, at least in the few episodes I watched. Not much depth or darkness either, unlike what a lot of stupid comments here claim. If this is deep and dark then I don't know what to say, except depth and darkness managed to reach a new low. Moving on..."
130,"Oh my God....I really liked the first 3 seasons well at-least did not hate those three much as I do 4th and 5th...What on earth are the directors trying to say??? The creators of SPN are just pulling a rubber-band till it suits them... they are just dragging the serial for God only knows...Yeah and about God...How dare these idiots can just portray or even joke about other religion's GODS...Just having pen,paper,camera and few fools as actors don't give them the right to shoot out all the crap you deem fit...The character of SAM is one annoying thing that just makes me turn of the TV...What the hell!!! he is annoying like Frodo from LOTR or Asin from Dhasavatharam....Just annoying....I would puke on seeing his facial expressions and his speech about right and wrong and of course he ends up doing wrong...There is no justification on what the hell they are trying...God help the fans...."
131,"It kind of reminds me of the first season of the X-Files (the sloppy writing, awkward acting, etc.), but in a good way. I think that if the WB gives the show a chance, it could develop into something worthwhile... the acting was decent... good visuals... the writing needs to be a bit crisper, and they should probably not rely too heavily on 'stock' monsters (i.e. the Lady in White in the first episode)... they should aim to make each creature they encounter unique (or to take a unique spin on an old idea, again like the X-Files)...If they manage to get few seasons under their belt, I am sure that there is some 'conspiracy' or 'mythology' that will develop in the various stories, but here is where the main problem lies... if this is to be an X-Files clone (and I have no real problem with that, per se), it needs to have a strong hook and the problem with supernatural themed shows is that such hooks tend to boil down to a sort of manichaean battle between the forces of Good and the forces of Darkness... whereas, in the X-Files, an alien invasion is something that could, conceivably, be affected by human actions in a meaningful way, such supernatural struggles between God and Satan (or whatever the show is going to call them) really leave the characters in a lurch... the show will either embrace some kind of religious theme (which would be cool, but unlikely), or it will aim toward some kind of Apocalypse... if the creators are smart, they will aim for a more Buffy-style story arc with lots of little Apocalypses leading up to something major... and perhaps introduce some extraneous characters (to be killed off at opportune times, of course)... otherwise, it runs the danger of becoming another Millennium, which would be a very bad thing (sad that so much creative energy went into such a mediocre show).Anyway, getting back to Supernatural... the show has promise... it could build some kind of fan base if given an opportunity (although, I am not sure that The Gilmore Girls is exactly the right lead in... maybe Smallville or something... grab that teen and geek audience)... I am not sure that the Gilmore Girls audience will stick around, and I am not sure the buzz is good enough for people to jump over from other channels just to see it. I will definitely watch the next few episodes, but I have a measured expectation of the shows potential... it will definitely need to pick up from the pilot, which was OK, but not fantastic."
132,"SUPERNATURAL is a fantastic show that gives fans thrills and chills every episode, and it also delivers an interesting story line that captures the viewer and hooks them for the next episode. The main characters, Dean and Sam Winchester, are as different as night and day but they are united by family loyalty and the goal of vanquishing the demon that murdered their mom. They are joined by their dad, a man who had devoted his life to killing demons and searching for the killer of his wife and putting an end once and for all to the horrors that plague mankind.I really enjoy the plot lines that the show delivers. All the ghosts, demons, vampires-they are all characters that push the brothers to the limits and test their endurance and loyalties. Every SUPERNATURAL episode has allowed me to see character development within the Winchester team.The show knows how to grab viewers attentions. The show plays out the Winchester vendetta well and intermixes it with other events and problems. The show has also created very likable characters in the Winchesters. The creators and writers have made sure that people relate to Dean and Sam, and they have made them complex and intriguing.SUPERNATURAL is a great show that hopefully will be on TV for a long time. Every episode offers interesting plots and characters. That is why I hope that the Winchester clan continues hunting ghosts and saving lives for many years to come."
133,I seriously am going to miss this series Sam and Dean are my escape from normal life. Brilliant episodes amazing soundtrack a all in all superseries
134,"I have been a fan of 'Supernatural' for 5 years now and the series is still as awesome as it first started. It is about two brothers, Sam Winchester and Dean Winchester's journey to find their father in the first season. From there it goes through fighting with the 'yellow-eyed demon' to Dean going to hell in the third season and then my most favourite season 4 when Castiel enters. Castiel passes through every demon shackle spell and drawings in the whole building and comes to Dean to say 'I am Castiel, I am an Angel of the Lord'. You wouldn't believe the chills that gave me, the hair on my skin stood up. The 5th season is about the impending Apocalypse, the battle between good and evil with Earth as their war field. The atmosphere this show has is downright chilling and it compels the viewer to get hooked.Sam and Dean are contrasting characters. Sam is the younger brother of Dean. He is calm, innocent and good-hearted. But, some situations make him the bad guy. Dean is the cool one, he kicks back on the couch with a beer in one hand and a hot chick in the other hand and seemingly doesn't give a damn if the world ends or not. He is the guy who takes the risks. They con people, do credit card scams and cheat at pool to pay for their food and shelter. But despite their differences, the brothers have an unbreakable bond between them and they will fight till death for the safety of each other. 'Safety' being not going to hell after they die. This is what makes them so great, their chemistry is there for everyone to see. Angel Castiel is an excellent addition from the 4th season, he made the show so much more awesome than it already was. The characters make you care for them so much that you don't want to miss a single moment of their journey.Dean is a vessel of archangel Michael and Sam is the vessel of the fallen angel, Lucifer. So, now every demon hunter in the country want Sam dead, before he can accept Lucifer's offer to take over Sam's body. There are also many allies for the brothers as the series continues. This is a very different show from others as it deals with a different demon every episode and the main story also continues. You never get bored as the special effects are awesome and even the actors who play the demons are very good.The show isn't all gloom and doom. In fact, it has many humorous moments. Also it doesn't hurt when you have two good actors who are also good-looking. I haven't seen X-files as I was just a kid back when it ended, so I don't have a yardstick to compare this show to, as many of the IMDb users here seem to compare to. Therefore, I think this is the best supernatural show ever that I have seen. The strong point of the show is also the visual imagery which is a treat for the viewers and the background score. Also it gives real legend stories every episode, like the bloody mary, vampires, zombies, hookman, ghost insects, scarecrows, evil children, basically every legend and scary story you have ever heard and not heard. The car, 1970's Chevy Impala is very cool.Buy the DVD's if you still haven't seen the show, as each episode is exciting. There is always something new brought to the table by the excellent screenwriters. Why are you still reading my comment, go and watch Supernatural, The Most Thrilling, Awesome and Coolest Show Ever :)10/10"
135,"Supernatural is, hands down, the best thriller/horror show on TV right now. Everything about it is amazing: the cast, the writing, the story, the special effects, etc. The script is laced with funny one liners and teasing, and the characters are believable and unique. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki play their roles wonderfully.I think the main reason I love this show is the certain ""X-Files"" vibe it has. Not surprising, due to the fact the almost all the writers/directors are X-Files veterans. But it manages to differ itself from other shows, always staying unique and awesome.Each story manages to feature real legends and myths, which simply adds to the authenticity of the show. Nothing is over-the-top or cheesy, but believable and genuinely scary.And the kick-ass soundtrack helps, too. Now all we need is Mulder and Sculy to guest-star, and you've got the perfect show!! 9.5/10"
136,"Save yourself the trouble and dont watch it, it had the worst ending of all shows."
137,"Watched all seasons since beginning. Have all recorded on DVD's. Great show with just a fair amount of good, clean humor. Sorry to see that season 15 will be the last year."
138,First 5 or 6 seasons were great. But now it's a joke.
139,"If I could break this down, I would rate the first three seasons at a very healthy 8 or 9, with the last two seasons averaging at a 5 bringing the total score down. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are two polar opposite brothers thrown together in the hunt for assorted monsters and demons when their ""hunter"" dad goes missing in Season 1 while on the hunt for the yellow-eyed demon responsible for the death of the boys' mother many years before. Along with the search for the father, each episode would feature the guys either being fed tips by other hunters or locating clues themselves to supernatural phenomena in various towns wherein they would attempt to determine the cause and eradicate it. Part of the interest was in seeing what new beast or specter would be the villain for the week and how the guys would pool their resources (with the help of guest stars and recurring characters) to defeat the evil being. Padalecki and Ackles shared a nice prickly chemistry and proved to be adept at action, drama and comedy, as the material called for it. Despite sometimes being gruesome, the early episodes were reliably scary, fun and imaginative. Unfortunately starting in the fourth season, the tone and quality became jarringly different. The creators altered the focus away from demons and creatures of the night and started utilizing the mythos of Judeo-Christianity rapture fanatics to the point where it became the focus of nearly every episode. The result - with Lucifer and various angels making weekly appearances - has been humorless, depressing and solemn to the nth degree. Every third or fourth episode, the creators will throw in a fun non-angel/rapture-centric one that will remind viewers of why they originally loved the show, but it is getting to not be enough. The dialog between the brothers usually now goes along the lines of ""I can't trust you!"",""Yes, you can!"", ""No, I can't"" and so forth - just alternate the brother saying it. More often than not, Ackles and Padalecki face each other with pained expressions like they are suffering gastric discomfort or a stubbed toe, while mouthing the same angsty platitudes back and forth. Recurring characters from the opening seasons have by and large been killed off with little fanfare and replaced by utterly pointless characters. Misha Collins is gravely beautiful, but utterly pointless as a rogue angel added to the cast to basically unveil nonsensical exposition in as unexpressive a way as possible, while occasionally he gets an alternate universe episode where he gets to do comedy by showing an emotion. The show has a major problem writing recurring female characters as well - they usually end up dead or insufferable (or both). Alona Tal and Samantha Ferris fared best, but then they were all but forgotten after Season 2 and then only brought back in the latest season to be offed. The less said about the snotty British con artist the better. Katie Cassidy's is-she-or-isn't-she-good demon Ruby was adequate at best, and then replaced by the laughable Genevieve Cortese in the same role. Supposedly this last season bids adieu to the rapture lunacy that has clipped the show's wings and grounded it in angst and bleakness, so it has the potential to return to some of its better days, but only time will tell."
140,"I have been watching this program without fail since the first episode, and the first 3 seasons were fantastic, but it has gradually become repeated conflict/cheesy drama between Sam and Dean, and now we have to start off the next season with Cas as GOD?! REALLY? Common sense would dictate that once you have written a script that calls for the Apocalypse, which then of course never happens, that the writers are now grasping at straws to keep the show profitable. Remember the episode about the little Fairies working for the old guy? What were they thinking? Cas as the new God is just sad, really. Fonzi has put on his water skis and leather jacket and is now heading up the ramp....."
141,"Sam character is such a volital, argumentative guy. He rants and raves about the stupidest stuff. He makes me want to quit watching the show. There are a few other things I don't care for, but this character's constant raving is too much!! If the series continues, I hope Sam grows up!"
142,"A great show that makes up for the loss of a number of greats. The TV seemed incredibly dull following the loss of x-files, Buffy, angel and dark angel. Only Charmed remained and lets face it thats really not been up to it's one brilliant standard. The supernatural (no pun intended) and sci-fi fans were running out of things to watch.Thankfully along came Supernatural.It has the x-files mystery to it , with the hot young characters of Buffy and Angel, with the emotional curiosity edge of Dark Angel all mixed together. The acting and the writing is spot on. The show has the perfect balance of supernatural and relationship elements.Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have finally escaped they're supporting roles they so brilliantly performed in Gilmore Girls and Dark Angel. They get to prove how well they can act and play the brothers brilliantly. The show has started great and will no doubt become another cult classic, lets hope it gets a number of seasons to give it the credit it deserves. It's definitely one to watch and I certainly recommend it to all fans of any of the above shows."
143,"When so many TV shows around now are either getting old and tedious, repeating story lines, and running out of ideas, or not being able to pick up the pace after a particularly bad start, Supernatural comes in as a great show to remind us of what TV should be like. It starts with a gripping Pilot, that hooks viewers easily, the brother dynamic links scenes seamlessly, and the information is never too much, and never thrust upon the viewer, it's given at a steady pace but you never feel patronized.It keeps things interesting. It easily has originality because though it uses real Urban Legends and Myths, the stories based around the basic mythology is in it's own league, such as adding more depth to the legend of Bloody Mary, and bringing forth older, more unknown legends like the Pagan Gods in episode 11, Scarecrow.Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki play the perfect on-screen brothers, and their characters Dean, and Sam balance each other out excellently. Dean follows his father's orders, and is far more into the hunt than his little brother, while Sam is the reluctant hero, struck down by grief, and on the hunt for vengeance as well as the whereabouts of their father and the demon behind their family's pain.Though it has to be toned down on the scare factor to get shown, it still manages to make you jump at times, and it's Grudge-like filming techniques only add to the effects. Kripke and the rest of the writers, really out-did themselves this time, and I'm glad for it."
144,"A lot of other shows try not to go ""too far"" with their supernatural content to stay realistic, but that only makes you notice the stuff that's completely unrealistic and harms your enjoyment. Supernatural is the kind of show that doesn't pussy-foot around its ""make-believe"" content. It takes for granted that YOU are going to believe the stuff that happens in each episode could very well be happening right now, and it's a much better show for it. This is precisely why I love the show.It jumps head-long into its supernatural themes and embraces them wholeheartedly. I've watched shows like Medium and shows similar to it, and I often find myself ""reviewing"" the episode as I watch it, rather than simply enjoying it. ""This is totally unrealistic, stuff like that would never happen."", ""Man, this psychic ghost-talking mambo jumbo is BS"", and so on. Supernatural has stumbled once or twice but NOT because of the Supernatural themes. You don't question the validity of what's going on because you're not focusing on how realistic the show is, you're focusing on the story and characters while they live their lives as hunters of the supernatural.So if you like a good horror/thriller with supernatural themes, you should be chasing up Supernatural. I know I will be, for as long as the show is on the air."
145,"This show was created with 5 season in mind by Kripke. From season 1 to season 5 it will be an awesome ride to a big finale: a story well told with a start, a development and a well thought ending. It's dark, sometimes funny but mostly the right kind of horror with some Neil Gaiman writing in mind. After that you mostly get fandom seasons, boring story arcs that will bring you nowhere, repetition of the formula you have seen before but in a less clever ways. To me is just not good writing. Single episodes can be OK, but overall it should have ended with season 5. 10/10 from s1 to s5. 6/10 from s6 to where I stop watching and caring (s9 or 10, i can't remember)."
146,"Thrilling moments, freaky visual effects, quick wit and one-liners, gripping story-line, oh-so-sexy men (drool), what's not to love about the Supernatural phenomenon that has hit full force? We follow the Winchester brothers, Sam and Dean (Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles) on their hunt of all supernatural things, their chase of their elusive father, and their quest for truth about what killed their Mum and Sam's girlfriend. It's riveting T.V, and has a massive fan base, with more getting hooked each Monday (or Tuesday, for Americans). The acting is awesome, and Jared and Jensen aren't too shabby in the looks department. Okay, I lie, Jensen is the hottest thing ever. And Jared is close behind. You truly get sucked into this world so similar to ours, yet so different in comparison. After all, haven't you ever had the feeling that some things out there aren't exactly what one would call normal? Tuesday mornings at school are bustling, everyone chatting about what happened, theories swapped, debates on who's hotter (I barrack for Jensen), discussions on small details, laughter at little one-liners that has everyone in hysterics... Supernatural really has gripped the world. Whether you watch it for the guys, for the humour, for the paranormal insight, for the laughter, for the suspense, or just for the amazing storyline, Supernatural is the best there is to see."
147,"It's such a shame what has happened to this show! It was of my favourite shows ever! I have seasons 1-7 on DVD and I still go back to my favourite eps. When I first started watching Supernatural I was blown away by how amazing it was! Really, really interesting characters, always well-acted. Really. really absorbing plots that had you gripped. Excellent ideas that never seemed stale. When all that God stuff came in I was impressed by how well it was done. Castiel a great addition to the show. Then it was like they forgot it's not just fangirls on Tumblr who watch the show. I think too much time and effort has gone into creating story lines to pander to these fangirls and some of the dialogue is so forced and unnecessary it actually makes me cringe. I feel like Jensen and Jared have stopped caring and are just in it for the bank cheque. Even the writers seem to spend more time trawling Tumblr for cringey subtext and all that magic that made the show great has been lost. It makes me sad even writing this. I haven't watched beyond season 8 so who knows it may have improved but I'm done with it. I will just continue to enjoy the delight that were the first few seasons."
148,"There are many different things that make Supernatural special. The first is the show itself. Everything, from the dialogue to the characters to the plot twists, is better than almost anything else then I have seen. Season 9 is in just two days, and this show has still managed to not jump the shark (a very impressive feat, if you ask me). The second is the cast. I mean... that CAST. Jared, Jensen, and Misha do a brilliant job in the main roles, as well as the amazing supporting roles and dead characters (we miss you), and then there are the interviews and the candy and the change in Misha and Jensen's cars and I just... well, never mind. Third is The French Mistake. I just can't say this enough: This show is so amazing that it made an episode where they come into our world and see trailers that are fake theirs. And, of course, fourth and last would have to be the wonderful community that is the SPNfamily. They help each other (and other fandoms) through every hardship (and trust me, there are a lot. If you watch this show, you WILL cry). They notice everything and come up with ideas to help the characters (holy water guns) and then, of course, there's Twist and Shout (some of you know what I mean) and the Destiel and the Sabriel and just everything about this show is perfect GO WATCH IT NOW."
149,"When i first saw Supernatural airing on AXN ('cos i live in India, and we don't get CW here), i was like, what the hell? Let me just give it a try...and boy did i love it! It's going to move into it's 5th season but it just hasn't lost its charm.The duo of Jensen and Jared ( though i must say, i prefer Jensen) are totally awesome. And Jensen just totally rocks! Kudos to the story writer who just keeps weaving awesome twists and turns in the plot (believable ones, mind you), and definite kudos to Robert Singer who's directed 80% of the episodes.Just hope it doesn't go off air.Supernatural rocks \m/"
150,"""Supernatural"" is a purely clever show with great acting and a story to keep eyes on the screen at all times.The show is about two brothers Dean and Sam Winchester who are ""Hunters"" who go around killing supernatural beings who threaten the lives of humans. We see how Sam wants a normal life but when a demon kills someone close to him he goes with Dean to find their father and kill the monster who killed his loved one. During their search they find out there's more to this than meets the eye. So now as the show progresses the two brothers have to deal with the truth of how its all connected and find someway to save their relationship before it becomes to late.One of the reasons the show works is because a key element to the show is the comedy and wit of Sam and Dean's sibling rivalry. With the combined sensitive side of Sam and the rough and sometimes annoying side of Dean they both blend in perfectly to where you could almost believe these two are actually brothers. Its not just the comedy that makes the show its also the insight of how two brothers are re-building their relationship after all the trials they go through together. With the combined elements of horror, mystery, drama, action, and the tale of two brothers, makes this show a winner in every sense of the word."
151,"I love this show! It's the only one I watch on a weekly basis and I tape it if I can't be home when it's on TV. I really hope there's a second season :-) I'm crossing my fingers...I'm curious to see if they can come up with more nifty legends and myths that actually do exist in folklore. The cinematography and special effects are believable. They've taken a bunch of local legends and myths and made them as real as they can possibly be without seeming fake. And the car...oh, the car. I want that car. And then there's the eye candy. That's wonderful too, but to be honest, I'm more into the story than I am into which young whippersnapper is hotter than the other. All in all, very cool and very well done."
152,Supernatural is one of the best shows on this season. I think its under-rated over here in Aus because they've shoved it in a later time slot and keep changing the times at the beginning.Jenesen Ackles and Jared Padalecki make a great team playing Sam (Padalecki) and Dean (Ackles) they are very believable as brothers and are both very attractive.I love how this show is based around urban Legends as I'm a big fan of the stories and I'm sure many other people are too. But this show isn't just some cheaply done no real story time filler it actually has a quest to it that of finding their dad.Over all Supernatural is a great show with great settings a great plot and hot actors.10/10
153,"Well what can I say I am addicted to this show. Its brilliant and it also helps that the two leading guys are very good looking, Jensen & Jared work very well together I do believe they are beating the TV ratings against 24! This is set around America as the men try to find their father as well as dealing Supernatural beings that they pick up on through newspapers and the internet But when those adverts say scary just got sexy they are not lying!!! Well let's just say they can come looking round my house! I am a big fan of this program, and many people that I know that watch thoroughly enjoy it to! So keep up the good work and may we raise a glass to many more enjoyable episodes of supernatural with the men looking even sexier than ever"
154,"I refer to it as ""Van Helsing brothers meet Route 66"" I love it. Anyone who remembers the old ""Route 66' series with Martin Milner and George Maharis can relate to what I say. Great story about two brothers and their differences.Since I have an older more rugged brother I love the interaction that I can personally relate to. Tracking down the Urban legends is my forte. The story within the story is what I like. With each supernatural force they meet they are closer to the real reason they exist.I hope this series lasts the 7 years that it deserves.PS I want that car. LATE Windwalker"
155,"I have seen all but one of the episodes of Supernatural, and i can say that the second i saw the first episode i loved it. I'm into the supernatural stuff and the fact that they have Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles playing the two Winchester boys just makes the series a whole lot better. The series is basically about how their mother dies a horrible death and how they are recovering from that, and how then Sam(Jared Padalecki) see's his girlfriend murdered right in front of his eyes. Then their father disappears almost suddenly and while they try to find their father they are suppose to take up where their father left off (their father and dean, together without Sam, went out getting rid of supernatural spirits and stuff)and get rid of as many ""things"" as they can and try to find their father in the process. There has also come up a few times that Sam(Jared) is started to have these weird dreams and feelings and doesn't know why, and although Sam is getting freaked out by what is mysteriously changing him and the power that is growing in him that he doesn't even know he has, Dean is starting to get worried about his brother's safety and the fact that they still haven't seen or heard their father in months. Dean(Jenson) hides the fact that he's freaked and scared and keeps up a tough boy act. Can Dean hold up the act much longer without cracking, will Sam ever come to realize what mysterious powers he holds, will they find the killer of Sam's Girlfriend(who's name is Jessica) and their mother, and will they ever be able to find their father...""alive""? I love the mystery and the little horror this series holds. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and i know that as long as the fans keep watching this series will continue showing...for many seasons."
156,"I love supernatural television from the x-files to the dresden files, so this series seemed like a natural choice for me. Unfortunately, the protagonists are truly douche bags. When the main characters are the types of people you avoid at bars.. the plot doesn't stand a chance. There is plenty of television out there where I don't care for a main character (sometimes this is intentionally portrayed by the writers), but this series really hopes you become invested in people I would rather not have a conversation with. If you are in love with Ed Hardy and take too much pride in your trans-am, this series might be a solid 8/10 for you."
157,"I initially watched this show because it looked like it would be a little mini horror movie every week, and I'm a huge horror fan. Unfortunately, the show isn't particularly scary... but it does have several things going for it. Jensen Ackles is the first thing, infusing his devil-may-care character with layers upon layers of familial loyalty, love, protectiveness and pathos, and making Dean Winchester by far one of the most entertaining characters I've watched in a while. You can feel a lot of a deeper story running through, even though the format is mostly episodic, easily wrapped up plot lines, and it's funny, sweet, tragic, and very watchable. Highly recommended. :)"
158,"Finally a scary show that does not gross you out, but gives spine shivers and plays with your mind and imagination with great writing and the stars handle comedy (refrence to other ghost TV shows currently on-air made me laugh) and the scary stuff perfectly (Seeing a shadow behind a curtain is more frightening then a million bucks worth of CGI). Supernatural is a hit for me and the members of the media I work with, its always water cooler chat the next day about Tuesday nights episode.The cast of 2 reminds me of the early episodes of the X-Files, and thats a good thing, Jensen Ackles (Dean)fits this role to a Tee, much better then on Smallville, but working with Kristin Kreuk in Vancouver must have had its positives and Jared Padalecki (Sam) from Flight of the Phoenix is such the opposite it makes interesting characters. Its a big bowl of popcorn and an hour well spent Tuesdays at 9pm (Eastern Time)BRAVO !"
159,"Hmmm... One of my favorite shows. Supernatural is superb, even to The Simpsons. Better than One Tree Hill, and yes, even Smallville. Wow. And tonight's show (HOME), well, let's just say I'm not sticking my hand down the garbage disposal soon. I like the car. Its perfect for the Horror/Mystery/Paranormal mush that this show is. Dean can be a little flat at times, but mostly he is okay. Sam is neurotic sometimes, but that fits him.Of course, the eye candy is a huge plus, but I would love the show, even if they were ugly as sin All in all, this show is amazing. Not to boring, not too complex, it creates the perfect reality in which it plays."
160,"Even though this show has only been on a few weeks, the plot of each story is well written and to the point, much of what is written is based on history and urban legends from both the US and Canada.This show is for anyone that is into the paranormal, ghost-hunting stuff. I find this show useful and entertaining as well as descriptive.Jared and Jensen do a superb job acting like two brothers though in the first episode they lacked the relationship as brothers but by this week thee acting improved.Still I have many questions pertaining to Jessica and the mother and how they died. The way the writer presents their death is fantastic and well creative."
161,"In general, our household pretty much prefers HBO programming to any of the network bilge. However, because we'd read good things, we chose to record Supernatural and give it a go. We did not expect that the quality of the show would be so high, nor that the slowly-unfolding skeletal storyline would prove so interesting. We're invested. We like the Cthulu feel of the stories, the solid acting, the quality of the production.We're heartened by the fact that the comedy / horror genre has traditionally fared well on TV and remain hopeful that Supernatural will endure a few more seasons. There is certainly a deep well of mythos, folklore and fiction to fuel the creative fires of adept writers for years to come."
162,"I enjoyed the pilot episode very much, the opening scene was very well done. It was suitably creepy and had some stunning imagery. The two leads have good chemistry. Jensen Ackles has immediately introduced a likable character, and has established from the onset what his character, Dean, is about. the other brother, Sam, is also a likable guy, and we can understand his reluctance to go with his brother on his ""missions"". The premise is also very clever, so long as it does not get stale, as could happen with a TV show like this. As long as the chemistry between the leads is maintained, and there is lots of character development, as well as ""scare-of-the-week"" stories, this show could go far. I'm definitely looking forward to coming episodes, and what other mythical creatures will be brought into the fold."
163,"Just found out season 15 is gonna be the last . i don't know what im gonna do without watching supernatural every thursday.
For everyone who hasn't watched this show yet, WATCH IT and u won't regret it
Thanks for the cast for all these amazing years"
164,"I really enjoyed the show at first and would always look forward to the next episode. Having said that, the unhealthy codepency between Sam and Dean, especially Dean who is willing to sacrifice anything and everyone so that he and Sam could continue their little adventure together, started getting old. I still watch occasionally and have enjoyed some of the characters that have come and gone, God/Chuck comes to mind as a good one and Crowley was awesome. Still, when I do watch, I find myself kinda hoping Sam and Dean get obliterated."
165,"I am writing this now because i can't believe supernatural is actually over. It has been a fantastic show , a great journey .. thanks for the brilliant writers and all the cast."
166,"Watch Supernatural! I don't think that I have to explain the whole story of Supernatural at this point. If you haven't seen the Show until now, all you need to know is, that the series about two brothers hunting the supernatural is more about family than you might think. It's incredibly funny and they even make fun of the series itself. On the other hand there is well written and played drama. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are amazing. The few other regulars and guest stars do a great job too. The writers of the show are awesome and the the crew know their job. But beyond all the demon, ghost and other supernatural stuff is family. The hunting is only the catalyst for the drama. It's not a bad thing that the greatest lesson learned from Supernatural is: Stick to your family and you can fight everything. And as a bonus: Great style and one of the coolest cars in the whole movie and TV history. And there is no better series if your favorite music is classic rock. And if you don't like rock, believe me, after Supernatural you will love it. I laughed, I cried, I got scared and went through nearly every possible emotion with the boys during the show. Yes, Supernatural is not perfect, like everything in this whole world, but definitely have the heart at the right place and when you watch Supernatural you got the feeling everybody involved like what they're doing and have fun with it. I was always interested in urban legends and ghost stories, but in my opinion to like Supernatural you don't have to. I love the epic turn of the story starting with season 4. Though I understand that not everybody is happy about how the story goes. For my part, and I know I'm not the only one, I thank Eric Kripke for creating this show and I would jump into the 67th Chevy Impala, listening to ACDC and fight the evil with Sam and Dean every time."
167,"It started out a pretty OK idea. Couple of brothers (Sam and Dean Winchester) looking for revenge following family tragedy at the hands of demons and other supernatural beings.It's all very American, all very gung-ho and more than a bit cringe-worthy in places. The relationship between the brothers is so close as to be deeply suspect to the point I am twitching with fear that one of the episodes will actually show them getting down and dirty with one another! They say ""keep it in the family"" but there is such a thing as TOO close.Most of series 1 through 8 are very much to and fro with angels and hunters against demons and other monsters, one side winning then the other getting the upper hand. Round and round it goes to the point where it has become predictable and more than a little boring (If I am brutally honest).Dean Winchester is casted very well. He is a typical beer-swilling, junk-food eating Neanderthal, but funny enough to make it work. Outrageously un-pc and like a puppy with two tails, his character is a one in a million creation.Sam Winchester on the other hand irritates me to the point of not wanting to watch him. An inveterate ""pretty boy"", this dude really needs to spend less time buffing himself up and more time in acting classes (brothers on the road 365 days a year spending all their time in a gym? Really?) Some of the other characters are blinding work however: ""Bobby"" (the Winchester brothers uncle)is one of the funniest characters on TV at the moment. A scrapyard owner, he is a typical hillbilly and you can't help wondering whether he measure underwear changes in months or years! He has very basic catch-phrases but uses them to maximum effect.""Death"" (AKA the Grim Reaper) could not have been better cast. Probably my favourite character in the entire show, this fellow gives me the willies every time he appears. He successfully creates an air of ancient wisdom, control and fear. And to see him sitting eating a hot-dog at one point, is very creepy in itself.""Castiel"" A socially awkward, well intentioned Angel. Is prone to staggeringly accurate observations of human nature but suffers from the writers inability or unwillingness to accept that there might actually be ""good"" people in the world.""Crowley"" An obnoxious demon and ""king of hell"". Cruel, sarcastic and very funny in places, you get the feeling that there is more to him but would never ever want to find out! ""Charlie Bradbury"" By far my least favourite character. Whiney, neurotic and very obviously planted by a writer that doesn't know better than to try and - crudely - leverage their lower-class political views into a show.This shows strongest points are some interesting takes on the supernatural, based on both common myth and less well known ""theory"". Wendigos, vampires, ghouls, ghosts and spirits, demons, angels, werewolves to name but a few. It shines brightest in the funniest episodes (Sam and the clowns, Dean and groundhog day) but many of the ""spoof"" episodes fail to be funny by a LONG way.Where this show suffers most is the repetition, clumsy attempts at political statements (inevitably left-wing) and the quite sad representation of angels. In a show where the brothers face different monsters every episode that then try to eat them, possess them or mash them to a pulp, there was more than enough room for some ""nice guys"". However the writers - in their ""wisdom"" decided that more of the same was the way to go. Not a good call and simply adds to the ""oh, another monster to fight"" malaise that reduces this show to less than it could be.All in all, had great potential but fails to hit the mark."
168,"As you've seen from the other reviews, seasons 1-5 are great - so I won't spend time regurgitating how much better the story arc was at one point. Unlike the other reviews, I actually enjoyed season 6 and 7. A soulless Sam was odd at first but I found some humor in many moments that worked well between him and Dean. I didn't think the leviathan story was half bad either. Let's not pretend swan song wasn't one of the saddest episodes ever written. But there are a lot of annoyances I've had in these later seasons. Character deaths mean nothing at this point. Everyone dies and comes back. Everyone. And that's frustrating. Seriously, bringing back Bobby this late in the game after ending his character in such a perfect way should result in jail time. And the mom? Why? John was a way better character than Mary ever was. Then Bobby, Charlie, and Gabriel all return soon after. It's cheap. Misha Collins (Castiel) has also become overly political outside of supernatural, which has turned me off quite a bit to his character. Part of me is glad the show is still running because I never really wanted the story to end. But a bigger part of me wishes they would have just scrapped it after season 5. Season 15 so far has been such an awkward watch that I've been breaking the episodes up into segments too watch. Feel daunting watching a full one at this point.Seasons 1-5 = 10/10Seasons 6-10 = 7/10Seasons 11-15 = 4/10"
169,"I'm 10 episodes into season 12 and just have to say it. All other seasons were well made, looked either good, bad or amazing. Season 12 is just pathetic. The English men of letter, (also saying that word is wrongful?? Seriously?? You can say stupid and made up thing like god but that is forbidden unless you add big first letter... Is this a joke?) Lucifer and mother??? I mean there were vampires, demons, angels, god and it's sister, leviathans, werewolves and many more and now it's what? Don't have any good plot so all the bad ideas were put together and well done, season 12 was here? So far i hate it. Every episode looks dull and boring. Also kind of weird thing. From all 12 seasons i have seen (also don't remember correctly) only few states that were actually big like in season 12 Los Angeles. Every other episode has some small down or village thing in them. Seems like demons can possess only commoners with low budget but all are running around in fancy suits. I hope that rest of 13 episodes might have something good in them but that is not likely thing to happen. Supernatural for me has been good but now it just seems pointless. All the good stories have been made and now it's just idiotic things. Pathetic!"
170,"Is a good show with potential to be better if given a chance. The characters definitely play well against each other, there's good chemistry there. The idea of taking urban legends and myths of small towns is well done, and with a little more effort from the writers, this show could become top notch. The actors are very good, and the scenes are pretty authentic.The story of two brothers in search of their father, in search of monsters/ghosts and things that go bump in the night, and at the same time in search of themselves is a good ploy. Not to mention, these guys haven't seen each other for years and now need to do some catch up. You can sense the different worlds they grew up in, as sometimes they have a difficult time in relating to each other. One will mention something that will totally go over the other's head. Different pasts.Supernatural is definitely not a time waster, and a heck of a lot better than most of the shows on TV right now."
171,"Don't let my rating discourage, I do... like the show, it definitely has it's moments, however that can be swung the other way. Originality is key, which this show does at times have. The part where they seem to fail for me is the repetition. Copying other shows, their own patterns... (don't get me wrong, the wayward son montages we've grown to expect and love are epicly constructed and shouldn't change) however, one of the brothers dying every season is getting old. Shocking the first time, shocking the second, but to continue the 3rd-7th time... is over-done. I'd personally like to see them change up the story telling, so that you'd have to watch every episode in the season, in order in order for the finale to actually make sense. As I said to a friend last week, the problem for this show for me is, you can literally skip almost 85% of the season and just watch 4 episodes for the storyline. (2 premiers, 2 finales) and the rest just doesn't matter. And really, stop killing people and bringing them back, it's tedious! Sam, Dean, Castiel... are they cats or something? *sigh* BTW: Castiel + Crowley ftw. >_> seriously, stop recycling your work already =/"
172,"I bought season 1 when it came out and i thought it will be good. To my my surprise, it was not. It was only 1 episode named ""Asylum"" of the 22 episodes.I gave up watching this teeny bopper show after watching all the 21 poor episodes, which i think lacked, suspense, good story, acting and so on. If more episodes was like Asylum, i think it would've been better.I will not see a episode of this show anymore. I heard this show was influenced by The X-Files. I only thing that alike was them going around solving crimes and helping people. I think this show deserves my rating 1 Awful."
173,"Oh my God! What the hell was that in the beginning?? I have never seen this before. Honestly, I thought that this scene was a commercial... at least I hoped. But it would be also pretty awful too. I think that the showrunners should stop the series before a ""monster"" kills another ""monster"" and the brothers go to hell and come back and than they repeat it and they call angels, monsters, demons, gods and the whole Bible and the boys' mother and the brother and the sister of God come back and before they kill the Death (again). Finally, I think you don't think even that the Supernatural(well that's everything but not super) is worth something. And another thing, I don't want to hurt the fans and anybody else who likes the show. It is only my opinion."
174,"This show is absolutely wonderful! It's one of the few shows I've really gotten into. The actors and guest stars are wonderful at what they do, and this show proves it. The episodes have scared me more than most movies have. Dean and Sam are an exact portray of brothers, sticking together through thick and thin, being there for each other when one is in trouble, and fighting of course. It's truly one of my favorite shows, and everything about it is amazing. The guest stars they choose are very good and the story lines are well-acted out. The scene is really terrifying as well. They make this show look so good, I never want to stop watching! I love it!"
175,"What can I say about Supernatural? It's The X-Files of the new millennium. The show, suffice to say, is about two brothers. Sam and Dean Winchester, (think of the repeating rifle,) lost their mother when they were little. Whatever killed her, pinned her to the ceiling like a moth or butterfly to a piece of cardboard. Their father became obsessed finding the creature. Then it jumped to Stanford University. Sam's planning on entering Stanford law school when his brother Dean, (an homage to Jared Padalecki's previous role on Gilmore Girls, perhaps?) shows up and tells him that their father's missing. Sam's shocked. ""Dad let you go on a hunting trip alone?"" ""Dude, I'm 26."" What made think of The X-Files was the storyline. Supernatural takes its stories from urban legends like the woman in white. That's a retelling of the spectral hitchhiker, usually a girl of about sixteen or seventeen, who appears on the side of the road asking passing drivers to take her home. When the drivers ask her where she lives, she says at the end of a road. The girl's looking for her mother. So when the driver, usually a trucker, goes to the mother's door to tell her that her daughter's in the truck, the mother says something like: ""Mister, Sarah died ten years ago. She's buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery."" Like the other reviewer, I can't wait for more. What happened to Sam's girlfriend? I'm not telling. See for yourself tomorrow night. It's going to be repeated then."
176,"I loved supernatural when it started. But look at them now, Dean and Sam are regular visitors of hell and heaven. They talk to whoever whenever they want to be it the reaper, and angel or a devil. And come-on they are unbeatable in this world full of monsters. And Dean, sometimes I guess he is an immortal. This dude already came back from hell, then what else can keep him back! The Ghosts are so obvious every time and I started to believe in salt so much that even I thought of keeping some salt with me every time in case I am stuck with any ghosts. Sometime they leave all logic and just keep the episodes running."
177,I'm just heartsick that the show is ending it has been my favorite show since day one I want to thank Jensen and Jared for a job well done I will miss you guys
178,"Have been a loyal fan of the greatest show of all time since day 1 .
I am sad that i have to see it coming to an end , thanks to the cast ,crew members and the family this amazing show has built, the show might end but family never ends.
Saving people ,hunting things , the family business"
179,"I have seen many episodes of this great show and they get better all the time. For you who have not seen many or only the Pilot, you have seen that only David Nutter is involved but there is now in every episode Kim Manners/John Shiban who were very deeply entrenched in the X-files, that is why it has that great lighting and feel about it. I am the generation that you seem to think will be left out a ""baby boomer"" and just love it, I think that a lot of us will appreciate the show more having had the X-files for years and I would love to get the DVD boxed set of the first season as it is one of those shows that you find just another thing that you missed the first time around. It will get to audience of that I am sure as the X-files first season was a slow pick up and it just went from better to the best.I am glad that they do have the two guys Dean and Sam playing off each other as that makes it a little lighter in parts, but Dean always seems to have the right comeback as one of the comments said, they made a throw away line about Mulder and Scully, I have found throughout the episodes there are quite a few lines like that, not necessarily about them but other small things that hit a nerve at the time that is why I must get the boxed set as soon as it hits the deck.The quality of the acting and lighting and also the story lines so far are far above the ""Buffy"" teenier types, as I am not in that category and look for quality and look forward to this show only improving with time. Go Dean, (Jensen Ackles) We are up to the episode Shadows and it looks great, just the right amount of mood and they get to meet their father again, it will keep you glued to your seat, as I said it only gets better."
180,"The first season of this series held my interest for a while, but an episode I watched not long ago depicted a blatant rehash of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" whilst a more recent episode had me wandering down familiar corridors of a scary hotel reminiscent of Kubricks ""The Shining"". The story-writers of this series had great aspirations earlier reminiscent of ""Night Stalker"", but have obviously come up against serious ""writers-block"" in more recent episodes! I am definitely not looking forward to next weeks installment....Are we to expect something similar to a modified version of ""Alien""? Please, oh please just don't do ""The Exorcist"" 'cos the nights are getting cooler here now and I'm planning to make some pea and ham soup that I would really like to enjoy!!"
181,"If I could write a review of Supernatural for seasons 1-5 only I would give this show a 10 star rating. The first five seasons of the show are amazing, they're strongly driven by both characters and plot, the writing is spot on, the acting is fantastic. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki live in their roles - the supporting cast is also great. Unfortunately after season 5 the show completely bombs on the writing front, the plot lines for seasons six, seven, and eight are terrible - so bad they border on being unwatchable. Seasons nine and ten are only average at best and while the acting continues to be good the lack of plot has taken all life out of the show and turned it into a supernatural soap opera. This show is a good example of a TV show that has been run into the ground by writers and directors and fans that don't understand that all stories have natural end points and there is no shame in that. It is sad that this has been done to a once awesome show."
182,"Premise: Two brothers drive across the US hunting down evil supernatural forces, while attempting to find their father and avenge the unnatural death of their mother.Supernatural is a series that entered onto the prime time scene quietly, but is quickly finding success and will at the very least become a cult TV series. It is perhaps the first TV series since The X Files that has dealt with the subject of sinister forces (i.e. ghosts, demons, witches...) and does so in a well-done manner. Granted, I wouldn't call Supernatural a 'scary' series, but it is a crisply chilling show with lots of dark atmosphere. It's a weekly TV treat for the easy-going horror fan. As with the series Smallville, Supernatural uses some terrific special FX and some occasionally bold violence which really sets it apart from the other TV dramas out there. In fact it often contains throw-backs to many old school horror movies, check out that wicked Chevy!Regular stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are highlights in the series. They make a likable, well-drawn pair of brothers and it's easy to get behind them. In short, they're perfect TV heroes.All around Supernatural is the best series from the WB in quite some time. It undoubtedly won't be for all tastes, but for those who enjoy some good chills and thrills, they might just find it to be their new favorite show!"
183,"I loved this series. When i was a kid i loved watching it. The boys dealing with the unknown. Trying to find their father, family business. I was a huge fan. I dreamed of supernatural. Wanted to have such brothers like Sam and Dean. But something happened. They didn't evolve. The plot got so lame. All the interesting characters have been killed. Then they tried to bring them back, but this never worked. Just killing and bringing back the people. It was so predictable. And the acting of Jensen and Jared got really bad. I think they got tired too. The series had to end after Season 4 or 5. The sets were awful, the music got bad. And whats up with God?? Come on. I am a theologist. Even i could have written a better script or personality for god. I still love you guys. But this isn't supernatural anymore. Enjoy your retirement after Show finale. ;)"
184,"You'd think the writers would be running out of ideas after 5 seasons of coming up with things that go bump in the night, but Supernatural just gets more and more compelling.The Two J's get better all the time and have matured into their parts wonderfully. The story lines are still as fresh, surprising and unpredictable as ever. (The episode 'Changing Channels' was one of the funniest, hippest shows I've seen anywhere). This is a show that is happy to step outside the box and it pays off.The policy of supporting players coming and going is smart and really works for this show by introducing fresh personalities and cutting out the stale players (and story lines). Getting rid of the tiresome Ruby when she had (more than) worn out her welcome was a huge boost for the show, as was the addition of the enigmatic and charismatic Castiel. Misha Collins is a master of dead-pan and has wonderful on-screen chemistry with all the other cast members. I hope he's a keeper - Finding someone like that is a rarity.If I have one qualm it would be that the guys get a bit carried away with using gruff, manly-men, Dark Knight voices when having manly-men conversations. It leaves me looking for throat lozenges by the end of an episode. But that's only a minor quibble.Kudos to Kripke and Co for bringing some good, creepy fun to TV and keeping it fresh for so long.Long may you reign!"
185,"Supernatural is truly an addictive show - a phenomenon among TV shows - its easily as addictive as shows such as Lost. Every episode is a superb horror/thriller with tension as well as lighter elements of sarcastic comedy. The script is superb and will leave you desperate for the next show.Jared Padaleki (Sam) and Jensen Ackles (Dean) are superb cast as two brothers looking for their missing father and answers to the death of their mother (and Sam's girlfriend). Their chemistry just adds to the shows brilliance.For those in the UK who cant wait for Lost to come back on air Supernatural more than fills the void. A superb show, with an excellent cast and brilliant script - An addictive show."
186,"We have to wait 4 last few eps, stop bs about some pandemia and start rollin ffs!"
187,"At beginning,you love to watch the show, personally i waited to see God. now i saw God season ago and the show still running?!!
why?why we could've seen the end of story?
there is nothing to watch!
please release the final season and put down us of this misery!!!"
188,"I wasn't expecting to like Supernmatural, or to even watch it. But, my wife's friend saw the premiere and raved so we gave it a try. I liked what I saw -- especially the end scene. I wasn't quite expecting that and it made my spine tingle.Caveats: the writers need to feel comfortable that they've established the brothers and their conflicted relationship and move on. The one-liner quip references to X-Files were humorous but will become tedious and uninspired if they continue. Using pop-culture references is always a tough sell -- very few people have done that well (Josh Whedon, Quentin Tarrantino) -- but it is not exactly taboo (In my opinion).The show has promise, but I agree with the poster who said the show needed more original ghosts. Let's get real, you can just make up a ghost because, well... it's a ghost and there are no set characteristics for a supernatural being, right? Let's see more of the brothers and a more unique spin on the whole, ""we're searching for the ghost who killed our mom"" thing. It's my opinion that the family has some kind of curse on it and that should be the focus -- or rather how they get rid of the curse."
189,"I have loved supernatural from season 1 and I love season 3 the best of them all.The great thing about season 3 is that there is more of a storyline in it with Dean going to hell and the boys coming to terms with that. In season 1 and 2 Sam and Dean were just going around to different places killing demons and spirits with not much of the storyline except the final and a few eps. In season 3 every episode has abit of a storyline to it and a better sense of pace.A lot of people didn't like the idea of Ruby and Bella coming on the show but I think they add to the story and they are not there to be Sam and Deans girlfriends (otherwise everyone would hate them). They are just there like other hunters in previous seasons, ready to lend a hand in a hunt or just talking to them on the phone for a part of the ep.Also the eps are a lot cooler with Sam and dean having to beat lots of Demons at once and the introduction of the Demon Lilith.Overall this season has been the best and I can wait to see what else happens"
190,"This has to be one of the best shows on TV. It is a relief to get away from reality TV, crime dramas and sappy soap operas and spend an hour in a world of ghosts, demons, vampires and two VERY good looking brothers! supernatural is about two (hot) brothers, who where brought up to hunt supernatural things, doing just that. They travel across America saving people and hunting 'things'. those 'things' being ghosts vampires demons etc. the story line gets even more interesting as the show progresses. Supernatural is like the X-files for teens and younger adults though some of the episodes can be down right scary. The storyline is excellent and mixes the right amount of horror, action, comedy and even a bit of romance.The two main characters Sam and Dean are the brothers in the show. Dean played by the VERY VERY hot Jensen Ackles is the older brother and bit of a cheeky bad boy with a heart of gold who would do anything for his younger brother Sam who is the sensitive good guy type. Sam is played by the also good looking Jared Padalecki. the two actors are very convincing as brothers and they obviously have a brotherly relationship off screen which translates on screen, the two were perfectly cast.Supernatural is one of my favorite shows on TV. It just keeps getting better and better with every episode. I will definitely stay a fan until the end!!!!"
191,"TV as of late has completely turned me off to watching it. Too many reality shows. Too many doctor dramas. Too many crime dramas. I was flipping through one day and caught an episode of Supernatural called ""The Benders"". Right away I was immediately sucked in. The stories are suspenseful and very character-based. They aren't hokey or cheesy as you may expect from horror or science fiction type shows. The casting couldn't have been better. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have amazing on-screen chemistry as brothers. They have the ability to emotionally charge the episodes. The overall look and detail of the sets make you feel as though you are watching a movie. This show is serious, witty, scary, and dramatic all in the same sense. Too many people are missing out on a great hour of television. I highly recommend watching Supernatural."
192,"This show is excellent. The two lead characters, Sam and Dean deal with all kinds of dark legends and supernatural elements in each episode. The episodes are well written. The direction is great with a lot of tension and creepy moments. The lighting and camera work are above average. The atmosphere of the show is much like the X-files, which is not surprising as the show is made in B.C. The classic rock songs that are featured in each episode are a real bonus. This is the closest thing to ""horror"" on TV and it contains some funny moments as well.Fans of the X-files and even Buffy or Angel will probably love this show."
193,"Having been a huge fan of Angel and Afterlife I am always on the lookout for new Supernatural mystery programmes with great stories and black humour. I watched Charmed and Ghost Whisperer but found both to be rather soft and not quite as gritty as I was hoping, then along came Supernatural, the stories are original, the chemistry and banter between Sam and Dean is totally believable of two brothers and the fact that they are both human makes it easy to watch without comparing it to other shows such as Buffy and Charmed, I also feel that this is one of the first shows of it's kind that it aimed at an older audience therefore making it more frightening and edgy than anything that has gone before. I think that it more than capable of replacing any other supernatural shows that people may be missing, and having two leading men that are both quite yummy also helps...."
194,"I absolutely love this show, It has a great mix of everything a great show needs supernatural,mystery, action, drama, family values, as well as a lot of comedy. Oh and not to forget to mention the gorgeous guys,(and the car) I think Jensen and Jarad are wonderful actors, (aswell as the other cast members) and cant imagine anyone else playing there characters, I think the writers, producers and actors(and anyone forgotten) have done an excellent job with this show.I love how each week they come up with a new storyline, a new mission for the boys but still manage to keep them with the main storyline, and not loose track of it."
195,"I personally think that this show is great. At first I was skeptical to whether or not it would be good. So I procrastinated a bit before finally deciding to watch the second season. At first I was totally lost, but I quickly caught on. I even bought the first season because I love the show so much. It has some scary parts, that had me covering my eyes and squirming. But there were other parts where I was laughing my butt off. Dean is very sarcastic, and Sam very sweet, which mixed together makes them hilarious. If I can handle some of the scary parts, then I'm sure you can, also. I wouldn't recommend this show for anyone 12 or under, though. Over-all, Supernatural truly is my favorite show, so if you want my opinion, you should totally watch this show. Hope you don't scare easily! ;-)"
196,"With the premiere of the first episode of Supernatural my friend was all excited and trilled of the Hot guys on the show, i thought to myself, (oh no, not those lack of plots boring shows again.) Though at the end of the day the eagerness of my friend got the better end of me and when i switched it on, boy was i hopelessly falling for the show, the myths, demons, childhood spooks, the amusing brother relationship and of course Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.* And all too soon was i wrapped up on the journey with them, with their witty remarks, hilarious looks and moments when being beaten up on a problem. This is the show that leaves you craving for more. And if you got sick of LOST leaving you down the hatch, don't worry, Supernatural solves things! And now that the second Season is up, i feel so energized and pumped, with a lot of fun and uproarious moments you have to be tuning into SUPERNATURAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
197,"Supernatural is a fast paced, witty, smart and engrossing show, not to be mistaken for any of the other supernatural shows that have recently aired on TV. It's gritty camera work, involving plot lines and dark humour sets it apart from other shows.The two lead actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have fantastic chemistry, and are completely believable as brothers repairing their relationship. The story lines are fresh, interesting, and very often rooted in urban myths and legends, involving monsters and demons that we have all heard about as children and adolescents. The show is tautly sewn together with witty dialogue and fast-paced action, and at the same time it pulls on the emotional heartstrings as both brothers struggle with their own inner demons.In short, do not mistake this for a Charmed, Buffy or Smallville rip-off. It is in it's own league, a fantastic show that should enjoy many more years on the air."
198,"Supernatural is like the best show in the world. It's about real legends and it has two of the hottest guys i've ever seen! Why can't all shows have hot guys like these. They are like... perfect. Enough about the guys. The show is great it shows that this family is really dedicated to killing this being that killed their mom. Even if it means getting themselves killed in the process. They've lost their mom, dad, girlfriends, and almost their lives. These two guys go through hell every time they walk outside. It show's that these people can act really well if they can do this show without basically crying. I can't wait for the next episode. Keep it up Jared and Jensen. WE LOVE YOU!"
199,"This show is beyond amazing. It's humorous, heartfelt, and sometimes, downright scary. I've been watching it since day one, and have yet to be disappointed!!! And ladies, we've got some serious eye candy!!! The downfall to the show? It's showing at the same time as Greys Anatomy, CSI, and a few other really good shows. I honestly think it's way better than Grey's and CSI, but ya know. It stars Jensen Ackles (Dark Angel) and Jared Padalecki (Gilmore Girls). They play brothers Dean (Jensen) and Sam (Jared) Winchester on a hunt for all Supernatural beings...Particularly the demon who killed their mother 23 years ago. Dean is a total smart ass, while Sam is more serious, together they make an amazing, brotherly (but not to brotherly!) team. If you're into scary movies, this is definitely the show for you. Not so much into the scary? Don't worry, PLENTY of humor!!! I seriously recommend watching it if you haven't already!!"
200,"Omg! Supernatural is like The best show ever and Sam and dean are soooooooooooo cute!!! I love the car too the black 1967 Chevy impala. My favourite character is dean but Sam is close behind. I especially love Sam in hell house with his towel when hes just come out of the shower... Well anyway I would recommend this show to anyone and Im sure if you watch it you'll love it just like me! I cant wait until the new series starts here in England. America IS SOOOO LUCKY! The new series has already started there and we have to wait till next year to see the cute guys back in action! Too bad John is gonna die.... Not!! Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this, all about my favourite show ever supernatural!!"
201,"This is probably one of the best on TV right now. I have watched every episode since it began being aired in the UK and I love it. The special effects are excellent without overshadowing the plots or the main characters. One of my favourite episodes of season one is ""Asylum"" -a great scary (and creepy) episode. I love the exploration of the relationship between the brothers, Sam and Dean, which is played out throughout the series (I can relate to Dean as I am an older sibling too). Supernatural is scary, sexy (particularly when Sam or Dean take off their shirts!), and gripping. Any fan of the paranormal/supernatural should find something to love about this fantastic show."
202,"When I first heard about ""Supernatural"" I was a little skeptic because I am really no fan of the horror-genre, but since I am a huge Jensen Ackles fan I simply had to buy the DVD's (it hasn't been on German TV so far). I fell in love with the series instantly. Interesting, amusing and often scary stories are paired with an intelligent plot that continues through all episodes. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki do an amazing job of portraying the Winchester brothers; the dialogs are well written with many references to other shows, movies and musicians that always offer little ""hey!""-moments for the viewers. I can really only recommend this show to all people who are looking for thrills, laughs and a decent hour spent in front of the TV."
203,"Its written wonderfully, its funny but has horror in it. Its great and like no other. A must watch show!!! And both Jensen and Jared are doing a great job making this show good,I don't think it would of been the same without them. I cant wait for season 2... I hope I wouldn't be disappointed and that it would be just as great as the first season. my favorite actor of the show is Jensen Ackles, his super great!!! and most of the funny lines are his, he makes the show different from all the others. When i first watched he show I thought it was going to be like ""buffy the vampire slayer"", so it surprised my to find out its a lot better=]"
204,"after watching the full series i can now give a full verdict, and that verdict is that this show is amazing! i loved it from episode one, and I'm so happy that the network has allowed it another series, as just one wouldn't have been enough. this has got to be my number one favourite programme. I'm soo into the supernatural and paranormal, and this show allowed a look into the deeper side of incantations, magic and evils throughout many ages. and i think the producers couldn't have picked better 'brothers' if they tried. the believability factor that the two are actually brothers that care so much for each other they would happily die for the other, is off the scale. plus jensen ackles and jared Padalecki are eye candy enough for any girl. jared as sam brings a reluctant hero figure to the mix, wanting just a normal life, but with a darker side to the family he cant escape. hes the perfect actor for sam, and pulls off any of the many emotions that sam is required to have, but still being able to have a lighthearted moment now and again. jensen as dean is perfect. he has the wise guy, street smart cocky swagger down to a T, but enough for people (*cough* me) to find him incredibly sexy as opposed to annoying. he can pull off any funny moment, and often has me in a fit of giggles with a random comment placed in the right area. however on the flip side, he is adept enough as an actor to be able to show the underlying vulnerability that comes with protecting and being around his baby brother. all in all there are a million and one things i could say about this programme, but i am going to let you watch it and decide for yourself, after telling you how much i LOVE this programme! happy watching XsarahX"
205,"Me and my family are totally addicted to this programme! We love it! We tune in every week to see what Sam and Dean are up to next. We are enjoying the story and are enjoying watching the adventures the two brothers are involved in each week.We are keen on stories that Supernatural covers, such as demons, ghosts etc. It has a great interest from us.Please please please make a second series!!!!!! We hope deep down that we are treat to a new series as we love it so much! Craig Moyes-Reeder, Charlotte Moyes-Reeder, Joffa Reeder, Margaret Reeder. Durham City. England."
206,"I LOVE this show. I just LOVE it i can't get enough. How the hell did i cope before Dean and Sam??!! It's scary, it's funny, i love the one liners they just throw out! and the main leads are SUPER HOT!!! what more do you need!!!! Jared Padalecki an Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean are so HOT, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as John Winchester is FAB! Hell i even LOVE the soundtrack! Sam and Dean or even Jared and Jensen! can come rescue me from the thing in my closet ANY DAY! Hey i'm not fussy! The first episode has you hooked and the last has you clinging on for more and screaming NOOOOOOOOO, How many months 'till series 2 ???!!!!! I can't wait for it to start!!!! Load up your rock salt, polish your rosary beads, this show is HOT! More of the boys!! Scary Just got Sexy.. TOO RIGHT!!!! Bring it ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
207,"When two brothers Dean Whinchester (Jensen Ackles) And Sam Whinchester's (Jarod Padelecki) mother is killed when they were young their father becomes a hunter of supernatural things and the boys get dragged into the family business but Sam leaves to live a ""NORMAL"" life and when Dean shows up at his door telling him their father has been missing for a few days and he need his help to find him they start on an adventure fighting evil supernatural creatures and trying to find their father and the creature that killed their mother. So joins these hot spunky boys on their way through the country. Cause they're fighting evil AND looking hot!!"
208,"I just want to say that this is one of my favorite new shows and I hope it comes back back for another season. It is kind of a male version of Charmed. Kind of. Anyway, I would like to see it come back and with dad being shown more often. Anyone know if Jeffrey Dean Morgan is returning with the show if it is coming back??? My husband and I tuned in every week, giving up one of our other favorite TV shows in fact, to find out what kind of ""monster"" the guys would run into that week. Also, the guys are easy on the eyes, that includes their elusive dad. I hope to see more of him in the future, especially since he was killed off of Grey's Anatomy. Now he should have more time to visit his TV sons on Supernatural, don't you think?"
209,"i think that this show is one of the best i have seen. I started watching lost and invasion, things like that but i lost interest. i only saw 1 of the supernatural episodes on TV and i think it was the hook man one and i thought it was good but i missed the first ones so I waited to buy it on DVD so i could watch it from the beginning and i thought it was brilliant. It really annoys me when people write "" it was OK but not fantastic"" or "" not too shabby"" because i think that it is great and my brother wants to watch it but i wont let him... ITS MINE!! Someone wrote that it had a bad storyline and awkward acting and i really wanted to punch em lol. I jumped once really and that was at a poofy bit, where sam was at his girlfriends grave and her hand popped out. I don't think that its really scary but some of it is freaky and weird, a lot of people said it was like the X files, i haven't seen them in a while and when i did i was quite young but the only one i an remember watching when i was a bout 4 or 5 is the one where the doll makes people die or something like that, this woman got her hair stuck in the blender and she almost get....blended. the point is i don't really think that the X files is like supernatural because.....well it just isn't. Is it just me or are them men really fit!? i haven't really heard or seen of them before but i like em! i found out that Jared padalecki was in house of wax, hes the one that first gets ""waxed"" anyway i hope you all read this and like what i wrote, if not i don't really care anyway lol. Have fun!! =D"
210,"This seriously is a fantastic series, I mean WOW. I say it's the best since Buffy because well Buffy is Buffy and I don't think that any show will ever surpass that. Supernatural has two of the hottest guys in it that warner bros could have found, I mean again WOW. I absolutely love the storyline, the episodes are original and brilliant. The on screen relationship between Jensen and Jared is fantastic and they are natural actors. The funny quips that Jensen playing Dean always comes out with are hilarious and this site does not do the quotes justice at all. There have been a few episodes that have been so scary its unbelievable, I had to have the light on anyway,lol, lets just say that. I cannot wait for a second series as I hear it has been planned, if you haven't already seen this show then I suggest you watch the reruns through the summer. I'm from the UK so the reruns will be at different times than if you are American so you will have to check your TV guide. Lastly, amazing show!!!"
211,"Okay. I have been a fan of Jensen Ackles ever since seeing him in Dark Angel five years ago. Therefore I thought that I would give Supernatural a go.I expected to like this show but this show has grown on me more than I ever imagined. It is now my favourite show on television. It is the series of the decade much like The X-Files. It shares a tone similar to that of earlier X-Files season without plagiarising it (it stands to reason because they share many of the same writers).The story lines in terms of hunting the supernatural are genuinely scary (more so towards the end of the first season) and the alpha demon of the main story arch is as terrifying as the demon from The Exorcist or Damien Thorn from The Omen.While the mains storyline is serious, the show also has a great sense of humour.What I love most is the characterisation. The family dynamic of the Winchesters is fascinating. Dean Winchester is so charming and devil-may-care on the surface but so damaged, loving and loyal underneath.If you watch the episodes 'Salvation' and 'Devil's Trap', you should see that it is a series that is no longer just for teenagers."
212,"Extremely sad about tonight's episode. I've been watching(on TNT) & the new episodes. Big fan, for several years. This is the end? Friggin wow. Nice to see Cass but Jeez(no pun intended). That episode BLEW! What are they going to do in the end? Really left wanting. I don't want to sound so bitchy but, if there are only one or two episodes left ....what? What could they possibly do for the finale? As I said, never chimed in before so don't be mean. Just reeling from the lack of closure. Love the show & most of people on it. But wow. Sucky. And after my brilliant review, they ask for ten lines in order to submit. I'm sure I've seen comments with less but, OK. That's 10 lines."
213,"This show is the best show the WB has on right now. The love of two brothers for each other, their father & the supernatural world. I can't miss an episode because it is too intense and addictive. Plus, both Jensen and Jared are really hott!! When the WB and UPN merge together, they better not get rid of Supernatural. Supernatural could have many more seasons. Many people agree with me. Jensen and Jared do a great job acting in this TV show. They look alike and act just like real brothers. This show gets me all pumped up for Tuesday nights because then I get to watch this show. For all of you that haven't seen this show, I would suggest taking the time and seeing it."
214,"When I first saw an episode of ""Supernatural"" I was surprised. Almost every episode is filled with black humor and has quite nice digs at other series like X-Files and Buffy, for example. The dialogs are solid, the SFX are great and the sound just blows me: finally a series with a (literally) ""rock solid"" soundtrack. It suits the story and helps to feel the atmosphere: ""Back in Black"" by AC/DC, ""Highway to Hell"" by AC/DC, ""Gasoline"" by The Living Daylights, ""Down South Jukin"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, ""Paranoid"" by Black Sabbath, ""Hey Man, Nice Shot"" by Filter - just to mention some artists.Spoiler: Mary Winchester, Deans and Sams mother, was killed by a powerful demon. Their father John starts a crusade to ""kill"" that demon once and for all. ""Supernatural"" tells us the story of the two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester (Quote: 'Winchester, like the rifle?' 'Like the rifle.') who hunt demons and redeem lost souls.Some episodes are weak, but hey .. show me a series without a weak spot here and there!"
215,This show is entertaining and enjoyable love it so much one of my favorite shows
216,This show has been number 1 on my DVR recording since the very first show back in 2005. Absolutely love Jensen Ackles and Jarad Padalecki. They have gotten me they many many hard times. Misha Collins is great too. In fact all the actors on this show have been wonderful. I hate the thought that this is the final season. It truly is heartbreaking. I wish them the best in future endeavors but they will be greatly missed. 😢😢😢
217,"Mostly this show has been all about fun, for me the classic rock, cute boys, scary movie and mystery/suspense blend has been utterly engaging and enjoyable.Now they're starting to get into theological questions, as much as a show like this can without being boring or over-serious. These queries into the relationship between God and the Angels are intrinsic to the biblical/theological canon of thought and should be explored. Not being as up to date on the series, I can't really comment on the quality of these explorations, but their presence on a popular and well-made show is fun, I think, and makes me feel a little less guilty about watching it. I'm not particularly religious, but I love to study the bible and its influence on our literature and culture. A little bit of Milton adds a lot of class - compare this to the dross that is largely produced and thank your deity for intelligent attempts at exploring some of the most fundamental questions about belief. There is never an answer that suits anyone, but be thankful for the exposure all are getting from this show to a meme that has dominated many cultures for the last 2000 years and longer. Bravo on a fun show that has some depth and culture to it that goes deeper than fashion, drugs, divorce and other current ""social"" issues."
218,"This show is and will always be AWESOME! It follows two brothers who fight demons and the likes. Back before it started, I saw the commercial. I have to admit I thought that this was just another boring show like ""Ghost Whisperer"". It 100% isn't. I got hooked. I watched it every week. Nonstop every time of the day, I thought of new creatures that Sam & Dean could kill. I wrote these different essays about this show and about the creatures that are in this TV-Show. It is AMAZING! Oh and don't forget you have the Incredible Metallicar! BTW: On Facebook become a member of the group "" The Metallicar is better than a Ferrari"".I have to tell you this!: WATCH IT! GET HOOKED!If you don't... You'll regret it!!!!!"
219,"This is the best television show I have ever seen. Take two 'movie actors - in quality' and put them on TV to test their relationships with people and themselves then add some great effects as well as superb writing and some great humor and you get an incredible mix of great, entertaining TV.Kudo's to the producers and writers and actors.I think these actors are ready for the big screen - maybe not in this series but in any movie I think they would be great in a film.I think the best show so far was when Sam fell in love with the women who turns into a werewolf each night - they think they have cured her but they have not and later they find out she turned again and Dean offers to kill her but Sam does it.. You here the shot go off in the background but the camera zooms into Dean's face and he lets out one tear. Excellent."
220,"I must admit I was extremely pleased by the synergy of the two main characters. Finally a fun suspense creepy show I have been waiting for since Millennium has quit. I am a big fan of the genre, but I'm not easily satisfied. But these guys deliver the job very well. I hope they will continue to do this quite a few years more. The actors are always very good, the story a legend (urban or otherwise) and the special effects are better than any fantasy show on the TV now days. The brothers are totally different from each other in their way of dealing with things, which creates lot of fun moments Slowly this show is spreading throughout the the world. I even saw it when i was on vacation in Croatia, so its doing well. Keep on trucking guys. Chapeau."
221,"I love Supernatural! It is an excellent show with a great plot! The characters (Dean and Sam Winchester) are well thought out and extremely hot!!! I definitely recommend this show to all who like scary urban legends, 2 hot guys, and one helluva good show! Each episode is one miniature horror movie, (thankyou to Jensen Ackes for that idea)it spooks me out. The season finale is scary enough to pee your pants. I loved every episode so far, but my favorites are Skin, Home, Shadow, Salvation, Devils Trap, and Faith. I get creeped out every once in a while because of their effects that are so amazing. If you love Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, then watch Supernatural. You really won't regret it!"
222,"With all the race reviews I was hoping fir something special. Nothing special here, hope it gets ALOT better"
223,"A very well-told series, With actors, actresses, directors, producers, among others of great quality and professionalism, excellent seasons and chapters (each chapter a story of chilling or mecher with your feelings and emotions, every season that ends always leaves you with Taste of Want more. Anyway, Supernatural has everything a series of quality and high standard possesses and much more complete because Supernatural is life!"
224,This show gives you everything literally! Best show on television. Gonna need extra therapy when this show ends. It's the only television show worth watching.
225,I love this show. The characters are amazing and the storyline is great. I even love the first season which some viewers do not!
226,"The show starts off great the first season or two, following Dean and Sam around taking out supernatural beings and learning more about themselves. However, then it just gets way off base when it starts adding in the heaven-hell war. It completely twists the Christian view point, and really appeases to no one except for those looking for a cheap thrill. The show gets very monotonous after about the third season, and I wish they could have just stuck with their original writing instead of twisting it crazily to make no sense. The two main actors however are great, and I hope they can get in other shows/movies but the writers really ruined this one after the second season."
227,"At the beginning, i thought this is just another stupid low-budget series with monsters, but i forced myself to watch it. And I am glad I did that, because this series is something else to me, something fricking amazing, especially since it all started to be about SAM and DEAN, i think that's when fans started to feel that too and i gotta say i still feel it whenever i see them or think about supernatural. Its really poetic, really interesting too, amazing story line...I think that anybody who loves to see some good love between two bros and see them kicking some as*es then u should watch it, u'll definitely love it:) I'm out"
228,"I'd like to say how great i think Supernatural is and i bet most people agree. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles play the parts of Sam and Dean Wichester really well and they make people like the show more and more.The creator of Supernatural has done a great job and made a show unlike any others. Supernatural is unique and you get such a thrill just watching it. The show has shown so many different things from Vengeful spirits, Vampires, Demons and Old legends and I can't wait to see whats next for Supernatural in season 3. Supernatural has many fans and i really hope it continues for a long time because i am a huge fan."
229,"I have to admit, I'm a late bloomer. This was a suggested show on Netflix for me. I started watching and never looked back. As I get closer to the series close, I'm watching the 13th season now, I am struck by the cleverness of this writing team. We all know the supernatural can get hokey. But as the shows progresses, I am constantly reminded about the continuity, creativity, and entertainment intelligence that supports this series. I truly wish the network or whomever makes these decisions, would reconsider ending the series. Surely this has the longevity to surpass the Simpsons? After all, we fell in love with characters that grew and matured ""in real time"". Why stop the excellence now?!!"
230,"Enjoyed every second of this amazing show .
Excellent acting , writing , directing .
Anything you could ever want in ONE show"
231,"Best show ever written. really brilliant writers.
thanks to the cast and crew members for this amazing journey"
232,The knowledge and fun is immense. I just love this show!
233,I was very good fan of supernatural in beginning but later the quality of the show is reduced very badly. The story cycle keeps on returning to Sam and Dean. Every season ending the same cycle follows at some point it gets irritating. Apart from that story is very good new myths each episodes different story everything is nice. Actually i came to know many things after watching the show.But in my personal opinion creators can introduce some new characters. I accept its a pure fictional but every time they are saving the world same pattern of stories it getting irritated. Up to season 9 its the best but later the story is easily predicted and it started boring. Unless the come with something better the ratings of the show would surely gonna go down.
234,"Supernatural is such a beautiful show for so many reasons.The thing about it that stands out to me the most is that every single episode is entirely different from the previous one, because every episode brothers Sam and Dean are handling an entirely different monster or entity. But all the while, as they go through all of these different things that go bump in the night, the main story is still progressing.Most TV shows have episodes that seem to begin immediately after the events of the previous episode, and it often seems like one big, extremely long episode of one series. Not for Supernatural! This is one of those shows that you would think would get old and repetitive after about the end of the second season, and that would seem right, but the contrasting personalities of the two main characters really keep this entertaining the whole way through.Sam is innocent and goodhearted, but can be vicious when his brother or other loved ones are depending on him. Dean, on the other hand, is very rebellious, yet cool and collected and seems to have little care for his own well-being. Sam is often doing all of the necessary research on whatever monster they happen to be searching for while Dean is kicked back on the couch with a beer in his hand. But despite their heavy differences from one another, the two brothers have an unbreakable bond and they will fight for each other to the death, and that's what makes them so great.There is also a ton of other allies for Sam and Dean that appear as the series progresses, as well as a slew of villains that want the two brothers dead and buried.The last thing I have to say about Supernatural is that the series starts off fast and intense, and let me tell you, it doesn't slow down. And the brothers eventually find themselves doing much more than simply hunting down demons, vampires, shapeshifters, you name it. They find themselves fighting for each other's lives, especially when all of the interesting twists come in later on in the series. And when they come, believe me when I say that you will most definitely be into it. You get attached to these characters immediately, and you find yourself rooting for them constantly.So if you're looking for a series where the episodes will all be different, yet the main story keeps moving forward, and you're interested in the paranormal or urban legends.......What am I saying? If you have a PULSE, this is the series for you."
235,"When I first heard of Supernatural-- I panned it because the first couple of reviews here on IMDb were from women squealing how HOT the co-stars were. And oh, the stories were good-- and Dean was HOT. And the dialogue was great and Sam was HOT HOT HOT.Being that as a Guy I wasn't interested in shows that profiled ""hot"" guys-- and I am ashamed to say that the squeals about HOT made me erroneously think that the female posters were ignoring the show content and judging the show with excess estrogen levels-- I passed it over.Then I downloaded an episode from iTunes and was utterly surprised.One-- the Special effects are superbly toned.Two-- When the episode goes for 'Creepifying' they hit it dead on. Three-- when the episode is serious-- it's like a miniature Creature Features (Anyone remember that?)Four-- When the episode was a little tongue in cheek-- I almost expect to see the Crypt Keeper cackling in the background.FIVE-- Until this point-- I had not realized how well the two co-stars went together. This was a show about Two Guys. They're Brothers. They're Family. They don't always Like Each other. And they deal with emotional issues, physical issues, political issues like Guyz. Sometimes they resolve issues by Decking each other, and YES Ladies, it makes sense. And it's not always a joke-- it's a resolution. If you don't have the hormones or a brother, I can't explain it to you.The show isn't being artificially cluttered up with non-stop soppy talky-talky female lovey-dovey please-hold-me-I'm-Cold infatuation. In the first season-- the purpose of the woman in the episodes was to SCREAM. And SCREAM. And SCREAM. I loved it! But then, I'm a Guy."
236,"Brilliantly explores new stories in each episode whilst building on characters at the same time, and as the two stars are so hot, you won't be able to keep your eyes off them. It gives an inside look into the ""supernatural"" in the same way a 'The X-files' and 'Buffy the Vampire slayer' only this time it's not FBI agents or a powerful vampire slayer, it's Sam & Dean two brothers with no special status or superpowers, which I think makes it all the more interesting. I definitely will never miss an episode, as its absolutely brilliant, and once you see an episode, you'll never miss one again either. Heres hoping this one stays on the air for a long time to come."
237,"Supernatural is my favorite tv show . It's just perfect in every possible way, can't believe season 15 is the last. i will miss them soooo much, can't imagine my life without Supernatural every thrusday :((((( i wish it lasted forever."
238,"Great show, highly recommended. Can't wait for the final 7 episodes, it's gonna be bittersweet."
239,I love my sci fi and supernatural shows so this one is definitely a favourite I doubt many would have a bad thing to say about this show ... Its iconic and always will be...
240,"Absolutely brilliant from the get go, story characters everything.
Couldn't recommend a better tv show"
241,"I use IMDB almost everyday just to pass the time at work and what not. A close friend got me into supernatural a few years ago and I binged it all as quick as I could. My favorite show of all time. Don't get me wrong I love GoT, ray donovan, power but being a big brother and loving supernatural stuff thai is the most amazing show of all time. I hope they come back to Phoenix soon!!! Much love guys. And peep the Boys if you haven't y'all"
242,"Supernatural is a very fun and exciting show that is constantly evolving. Starting with folklore, Supernatural heads into darker concepts as the series progresses. A show I will forever be a fan of!"
243,This show to me is one of the greatest by merging supernatural phenomenons from different cultures and civilization the story that was created is one of the most amazing stories of all time
244,Im sad to see Supernatural go I love every episode
245,This is by far the best show and my all time favorite!
246,"I've been watching supernatural since July 2013. And i gotta say, it was the best decision of my life! Now knowing they are gonna end it after 15 seasons, just breaks my heart.. but it was worth it. I'm going to miss this show so much!!! It will always have a place in my heart❤ and it's been a hell of a ride. But i knew someday it was gonna end. I will never forget this show!! 2005 - 2020 #spnfamily #spnforever"
247,One of the best shows I've ever seen. Give it a shot!
248,"I love the show, i think that it is fantasatic! i love the supernatural/horror/thriller genre and i have been waiting for a good quality TV show that fits this genre to come along and its finally here! The two brothers, the cute good boy and the hot bad boy, travel around America in search of the supernatural. trying to track down the beast that killed there mother many years ago they encounter many exciting unfathomable monsters and also come across some of the classic urban legends. The two brothers are fantastically casted to compliment each other and are a fantastic on screen pair. i would highly recommend this on the edge of your seat TV show if you have a love for the supernatural or even if you just like to watch Jared and Jenssen do there thing on screen!"
249,"This is a series that is tailor made for....just about everyone. For fans of mysteries, thrillers and especially science fiction/horror this is a series that is well worth taking a look at. Also, since it is on the WB, it is coated with eye candy for both genders.This is like the Hardy Boys and Kolchak: The Night Stalker rolled into one, with a little bit of Blade thrown in for good measure.The series follows two brothers, who when they were very young (Sam 6 months, Dean about 3 or 4) tragically lost their mother when she was killed by a supernatural being. Their dad managed to save them and he made it his life's work from that point on to hunt Supernatural beings and try to find an explanation for what had happened. He also trains his sons to do the same thing.The series picks up twenty three years later, with Sam at college and Dean still hunting. However, there dad is missing and Dean wants Sam to help him look for him."
250,"I love this show!!!!! It's the best show on television. The brothers are both so hot!!!!! I can't wait until the next show. Every week me and my friends call each other and watch it together!! Watch this show!!!! It's about these two brothers(Jensen Ackles as Dean and Jared Padalecki as Sam) who hunt supernatural beings, from urban legends. They were on a hunt to find there dad, but they couldn't find him. So now while they try to look for him, they also kill every evil being in it's path. It's a very good show, and the acting is amazing. They are so good together. Their funny and really hot!! If you get a chance, watch this show, Tuesdays at 9 on wb17."
251,"I never was a big fan of X-Files or such so, when the show was first aired I thought it would be another X-File ripoff with the only difference that characters are not called Mulder and Scully, but I was pleasantly surprised. And, seeing the other new shows that just started airing like ""Invasion"", ""Surface"" or Threshold"" this one is totally genius (if they can keep it up, of course). The way both main characters are drawn in the fight against supernatural is a bit cliché, but still believable. The refreshing moment is that there is no secret government organization(secret society whatsoever) that has been working in shadows for centuries, fighting against evils unknown to mankind (at first it was nice, but nowadays almost every mystery/sci-fi movie has it so it has become boring) it's just two brothers in their own personal war against supernatural. So, if they can keep the classic secret society, super smart mentor and girls in underwear exploring dark cellars out of this show it's going to be one of my favorites for some time."
252,"I love this show and never had an issue with any of the characters until the 10th season after a few episodes with Rowena in it. The character is way over the top, too exaggerated, irritating and annoying. I am now in the 4th episode and after watching the third episode with her in it almost makes me want to stop watching as I cannot stand her, it is just way too much and actually really aggravating. I hope you guys kill her off cause I cannot stand watching much more of her story line dragging out. Please kill her of for the sake of the show and the fans. Very unhappy fan right here"
253,"And Supernatural continues to be my favorite show, 15 years later. You just can't beat how well rounded this show is! Mystery, comedy, drama, horror, everything! It's not always perfect, but after 15 seasons, it is astounding to me how overall consistent it has been.Thank you Supernatural crew for giving me some of the best television you can watch, and characters I feel truly connected to!"
254,"The chemistry between the casts, the creativity of people behind the show is just one of the core of the show. Still going strong after 15 odd years. Gonna miss this show long after it's gone.
Hell, I have missed it even right now."
255,"This is some tipe of tv show that you grow up with. I feel like I am part of that. Like it's related to me. 14 seasons and a lot of episodes in every of them it's a lot of time.
Act is fantastic.
I like actress. Between Jansen Ackles and Jared Pedalecki i will always choose Jensen(Dean). The Dean is so perfect guy in serial and had a lot of changes over seasons. But brothers are always broders.
The relationship that Dean and Sam have in show is amazing...
Every next season is so much better then last...
So check it out"
256,"One of the best shows i have seen.
I will never regret watching this masterpiece."
257,"Intelligent writers . Amazing actors . Great story line.
Nobody can ask for more,I recommend watching this show."
258,"Supernatural is easily the best show ever created , It's just perfect in every single way!
Still can't believe season 15 is gonna be the last. You guys will be truly missed, Thanks for this great journey <3"
259,"A great tv show. will miss it when it ends
I really don't know what im gonna do when supernatural ends!
Great story line and acting, gonna miss them so much"
260,Season 14 is fantastic and a must watch! Nothing else like it!
261,"What can I say? I'm in love with this show. I've watched all of the episodes out so far and have adored every single one.The thing I appreciate most about this show is that it isn't your run in the mill teenage romantic drama. It's a show about fighting for those you love until the very end and never giving up, even if everything and everyone fails you. Constantly, Dean and Sam remind me that family ""doesn't end with blood"" and that you should be willing to do anything to protect and love yours. Dean, especially, shows us that giving up is the worst thing you can do and his love for his little brother Sam is inspiring. Not only does this show have an excellent message, but it's hilarious, with witty lines of dialogue and laugh-out-loud scenes thrown in everywhere. It's also suspenseful and intriguing, with major plot twists, high stakes, and sadistic villains. It pulls you in and creates such an emotional link to each of the characters that I've found myself crying whenever they cry and laughing whenever they laugh (and I don't cry/laugh easily with TV shows).Of course, this show is not for everyone. Several of the episodes can be viewed as too scary for younger viewers since the show itself deals with the supernatural (ghosts, ghouls, demons, etc.). Dean, of course, flirts with women consistently and often comments about their sexual appeal. There are a few homosexual reference thrown in here and there. In all the episodes that have been released, however, I've counted less than ten actual sex scenes, and they limit nudity to bare-chested males and women's bare backs. The cussing is mild, which is a plus for me. But the real problem is with the violence. People with weak stomachs probably shouldn't watch the show. Constantly we see blood splatter everywhere, people's heads chopped off, characters impaled on sharp objects, and a few scenes of torture (nothing too graphic in that area). The sound affects can be quite disgusting (though somewhat cheesy at times) also. Also, the show deals with pentagrams, spells, exorcisms, demons, angels, Satan, and such. So religious viewers may have a problem with this.In summary, I have watched so many other TV shows, all of which have been entertaining at best and terrible at worst. This series surpassed all my expectations and is easily my favorite. The performances of the main characters are superb (Jared, Jensen, and Misha SHINE in their roles) and the directing and special affects get better and better as the seasons progress. In short, you will not be disappointed. :)"
262,"This show just pulls you in, It doesn't fade out, It only gets more interesting. The first season isn't nearly as good as the proceeding and you'll find this true for every season and episode for the most part - It gets better with age.The show is centered around two boys and these two boys - Amazing. The context of the show, The acting is just brilliant, And the story line is interesting and a lot of the times quite random, Although the good kind - Which changes later on in the show to a more steady/random mix to keep it exciting. The fillers are awesome, Every part of this show is amazing. I love the characters and the actors (And every now and then actresses) put so much emotion into their work it's stunning.And... If you don't like the supernatural type of thing, I'm pretty sure this will help change your opinion. Watch it and you'll see what I mean."
263,"Hi.First time I heard of Supernatural I didn't pay much attention, it's not my kind of show...Or it wasn't. But one day, when I was bored I saw the pilot and then I become more and more curious and then I became in love with the show. Great story, characters, actors. Kripke is the master. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have chemistry and they make this show work. Here in my country SN is not aired anymore, just the first season was a year ago, but the hour was impossible, after midnight. But, since then i did everything possible to see it and hope that some network will pick this show again and air it at a decent hour so everybody can watch it. Can't wait for September to come and bring us the 4th season."
264,"I wasn't sure whether I wanted to watch this show when it started, as I'm not a big fan of horror, and a wimp when it comes to watching it.But, I gave it a go, and it's way more then a show about the supernatural.It's a show that is very much about the characters, Sam and Dean Winchester, and their relationship with their father. The back story is well plotted, both actors are fantastic, and the overriding story arc is very good.It's quickly become one of my favourite shows, and Dean is my favourite character. His combination of quick wit and smart aleck comments with his underlying vulnerability makes him a very interesting character."
265,"This is the best series I have seen on television in a very long time, the casting is great and the stories are excellent, this is the best most original series to come out since the x-files hit the screens, I have seen 11 episodes and each one has a real excitement to it...none of the sameness that you get with other series of this type, not that there are many, if any of this type, the previously mention x-files would have to be the closest...though even then only in originality...although the series has amazing effects, it does not rely on them, for a change the actual story line in each episode keeps you riveted....for those that like classic hauntings to Norse mythology...this series caters for all tastes...neither also does it rely on gore and blood for it's scares...the excellent writing and superb scripts make it heads and tails over lesser series to emerge just recently..ie Invaison (better to watch the x-files than this one) or Surface (which is quite good..but sea monsters..!!!). In summing up...this series is for people that like supernatural goings on..ie ghosts, goulies, mythology and a good storyline for their entertainment..I don't think it would appeal to the slash'em move fans that have to have tons of blood and gore to get their kicks...this is all about atmosphere and story...not just cheap thrills it makes for excellent, compulsive viewing...so far i have seen 11 episodes...I hope they are making a lot more, we could do with more of this type of series....producers please take note....this is quality...and my final note on this matter...is look out for the car in the series....totally cool."
266,"This show kicks ass. Thematically it does borrow from the X-Files and Buffy more than a bit, but it's well worth watching in its own right. Ackles and Padalecki are easy on the eyes (read: hot), and Ackles in particular is doing a great job in the acting department. These characters were written for them and it shows. There are some plot holes (some episodes are worse than others in that regard) but the dialog is sharp and funny and the overall arc dynamic and interesting. Guest stars vary from mildly annoying to excellent (Angel's Amy Acker was pretty good in the second episode, Loretta Devine was great in the ninth) but don't take away too much from the enjoyment of the show. I look forward to spending many more hours in the company of the Winchester brothers!"
267,"This is a really good show, perhaps the best of its kind since ""One Step Beyond."" Even the back story is interesting: Sam and Dean are the sons of a psychic hunter whose wife was killed by a demon. Separated from their father, the boys continue to hunt spirits. The boys look like models, and this probably sounds like a criticism, but somehow it works here, I think because the writers, for once, take the material seriously. I just finished watching the episode where Sam and Dean return to their childhood home, because Sam has had a vision of bad things happening there to a young woman and her children in a dream, and it was very well done. I hope the writers have the good sense to bring Missouri back in future episodes. My only complaint is that sometimes the lighting is so dark that I miss important details, like plugs pulling out of sockets. But, generally, I like the washed-out look of the cinematography and think it adds to the atmospherics. And the car, a '67 Chevy Impala, makes a great traveling companion."
268,"I've been a fan of Supernatural for fifteen years, seen every episode several times, suffered the frustration of British delays and switches to different channels, and allowed Sam and Dean to get under my skin in a way no other characters ever had. I've loved the series regulars like Crowley, Castielle, Bobby and the bloody fabulous Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The whole premise of Supernatural is unique and brilliant and I feel like I'm losing friends now that the show is coming to an end. If you haven't watched it yet, I'm jealous!! It's superbly cheesy, funny, sad and gripping. It has dramatic highs, fabulous season finales and brilliant outtakes (eg Dean and Eye of the Tiger!) and has never been dull in 15 glorious seasons. You'll love it. If you are female then be prepared because you'll almost certainly fall in love with one of them! (I'd take either Dean or John Winchester any day of the week!!) Just brilliant."
269,"I love this show. The actors on this show going from the main roles to small roles are amazing. You know it's a fantastic show, when actors from previous seasons come back. There is so many things about this show I could say, but it would take forever. If you have not seen this show you are missing out. Also to the writers of the episodes you are amazing as well. Thank you. Sad that this is the last season, but can't wait to watch it again from season 1."
270,It just best and addictive. It has everything. Season 6 and 7 was not that good but all the season are fantastic
271,"I love the brothers man ❤
I will recommend it.
Love love
Love
Love"
272,"Supernatural is my favorite TV series. I like so much how the story can be viewed both at the season level and at the episode level. I like the relationship and the dialogue of the two brothers (both are two balanced characters with both qualities and defects), that the characters play their role very well and that the epic thread does not become boring although many details were added during the TV series. In addition to these aspects, I liked the author's way of illustrating his vision: subtle and easy to understand. Music is also great if you're a rock'n roll or blues fan. Also, the evolution of the TV series in terms of video quality is great. It starts from the typical TV series of the 2000s, simple, easy to understand from any point of view, until now, much more professionally made, but with the same type of captivating story.
If you like police / thriller movies / TV series that have a dose of fun and drama, Supernatural is what you need."
273,"Pressed by my sisters to start watching I fin aslly started in may 2020 while being at home recovering from covid-19. I watched all 14 seasons on prime in 3 months: hooked after the first few episodes! I laughed a lot, cried sometimes and fell in love with Dean, Sam, Castiel, Crowley, Jody, Donna, Bobby and all te other great characters. So sad to know there's just one seadon left for me: The Winchesters will definitely be missed. SPN is ( to quote Dean) ""AWESOME!"""
274,I love the show so much. I started watching supernatural 3 years ago and instantly became addicted with the show. I loved every part of the show but mostly i love the relationship between sam and dean winchester. I love how the show explains their story and watching this show has been a wild ride. I'm so sad that the show is ending this year but it will always remain in my heart. I would recommend this show to everyone because it has it all.
275,"Overall the series is very nice indeed. Not worth the 9 and certainly not the 10 that many viewers have given it, but an above average fantasy show.However, now that I'm getting near the end (watching season 13 now), what is really starting to annoy me, and not a little bit, is the recurring childish behavior of the oldest(!) brother. Man, get over yourself!"
276,These Brothers are a blast! Even though it's been 15? Seasons they are still fresh. The storylines never go where expect it to. Just an awesome series! I still manage to watch 1 a day even though I've seen them all! Everyone gives a great performance and sublime experience!
277,"Where do you really begin to say how great this show was, I mean 15 seasons alone really says it all...For me I started late, season 3 is where I began and once I was in I was hooked from then on.This show really did have it all, thrills, action, great leads, good cast, heat warming moments, teary times. Honestly I could not have asked for more from a TV show.Like all things it must come to an end, I really wish it had not but for 15 years these guys and this show rocked... Thanks for the memories and for all who have not watched this yet, grab a bowl of popcorn, kick back and get ready to have some fun..."
278,No words needed but it's 15 years and still my fav show
279,"A big fan of the show, well written, characters well written and storry cool and interesting! Best 15 years of my life, watching Supernatural!"
280,"Wow! It has been a hell of a ride , thanks guys for this amazing show. i strongly recommend it"
281,"What an amazing show is all I can say , watched every single episode and i was never disappointed (The headline says it all) - CARRY ON WAYWARD SON!"
282,"Love it. Perfect stories with family things, brotherhood, faith, trust, lying, lost, lust and everything.."
283,"I love the complex paths that each character takes. And then everything still makes sense. They each work together to get to a point. Great show to watch for the action, drama, science fiction, etc. The whole premise is captivating."
284,One of my favourite shows out there! Don't miss out on this one!
285,"This show has been in my blood for past so many years- i came upon it accidentally in 2005! Being a horror fan i wanted to give this show a try and now look its 2020 and at the last epic season! I grew up with the Winchester Boys- they taught me the meaning of family, brotherhood, love, grief, trust and most importantly how to forgive! Winchester boys can give you wings!!!
The show has an amazing story- it takes you so up high that you will forever will cherish every small moment! Its funny, quirky, serious, strong and faithful! Be a part of their world and enjoy as much as we all have! SPN FOREVER"
286,"I want to start this with saying Supernatural is one of the greatest Horror, Drama, Comedy, Action show out there, you'll love the mysteries from season 1-4 then you'll invest your time through the rest, this show will never stop surprising you.I grew up watching Supernatural since 2004, 15 years of watch Supernatural and being a supporter, love the chemistry between the boys, any other actors playing their spot almost impossible, the writing is good but the actors chemistry is phenomenal, bond is like super glue.
you will love the bond and relationships that progress and develop throughout the seasons, you'll be able to empathize and truly be absorbed by the show, it has incredible nice moments.What is there else to say just an amazing overall show, that you'll laugh, cry and empathize with the whole road in."
287,"Firstly I need to say that I knew Supernatural accidently. I was watching Doctor Who and then I wanted to find some other sci-fi shows, then...here comes supernatural.
I've always like horror stuff so when I saw ""hunting monsters"" ""vampire"", That got me. I started to watch it about five years ago. I gotta say that it is fascinating. I couldn't stop watching it, though it isn't scary.
I watched a lot of shows such as Walking Dead,Fringe. I am not a guy that has patience, so most times I can't finish a show from start to the end. (I stopped watching walking Dead in season 5)
However the interesting thing is that although the last few seasons aren't that good, yet I still can't stop watching it. I was so sad when I heard that it is the last season.
So many characters in the past...Zachariah , Death, Leviathan...This show brings a very nice memory for me and it changed my life. I love supernatural all the time. I love Dean, I love Sam and Castiel too. I love every character that was shown in Supernatural. Though the show will end soon, The winchesters will still be my heroes and saving people forever."
288,Supernatural is one of my favorite shows. It's been an honor being a part of the supernatural family. We will always be one ever after the show ends!
289,I love this show so much. The characters are all amazing and the actors who portray them work so hard and you can really tell they love the characters and are trying their best. There really aren't any bad episodes or a really stand out bad season. Honestly I just love this show so much so I am a little biased but whatever.
290,"If you like Demons, Vampires, Ghosts and all things Supernatural, then you'll love this show.
I have enjoyed this Show since the beginning when Dean reminded his brother Sam that their mission was ""saving people, hunting things, the family business""
ALL YOU NEED is to watch the first 3 episodes and you are hooked.
Each Season we get to know them a little better as they travel all over the country killing Vamps, Burning Dead Bodies etc! They pick up GOOD friends who are like their Family along the way. I love some of the crazy characters who have come in and out of Supernatural over the years. You really get invested in the Stories. Although there's a MONSTER OF THE WEEK, there's also a running story that runs through the entire Season.
Each Season has a new theme that gets tied in from the previous season. I'll be sad when this final season is over. I've been watching this show a good portion of my life - 15 years! Amazing since I thought when they wrapped up Season 6 with a perfect ending that was going to be it. Glad they got picked up and went another 9 seasons."
291,I am watching supernatural like 7 years now. Its my fav tv show and always loved it. The start of the 15th seasson was the best start so far!!
292,"From Egypt, you can't believe how we love supernatural series, and how we consider the winchesters as a part of our family.
Waiting the final season."
293,"Supernatural is still one of the best shows (if not the best) even after 14-15 years!
Always gonna be my favorite <3 <3 ."
294,"It was one hell of a ride! Thanks for making this amazing show <3
I highly recommend watching it!"
295,Absolutely love this show. Of course there is one episode i always skip but other then that i have watched this multiple times
296,I dont know what im gonna do if this show ends. Its like one of the best shows ever and I grew up with it. It not just a show but a family. Only true a fan can understand this road..
297,"This is still (AAAAA) grade quality television,even after14-15 years. I will miss it 😥😥"
298,"Spoilers are minimal, about one character, Mary Winchester, the mother.In all the seasons the ongoing theme was Family. Loyalty. Loyalty to Family. This said, it truly explains all the loopholes and flaws others have complained about now and then. But there is one flaw which didn't make sense. In all the convoluted complicated plot lines from one episode to season to the next, season 12's return of their mother Mary was the one which remained an actual flaw. While the Winchesters pined to return Crowley's son to his death in the past to avoid upsetting future histories, they had no problem keeping their dead mother resurrected. Family Loyalty explains this fine. The problem is the British Men of Letters. Their characters would NEVER have allowed her life to continue. Eventually Mr. Ketch was possibly too fond of her, but the others would have ordered him to finish the job long before that could have happened.Now it is 15 seasons, and this is the ONLY unexplained flaw. I'd say that's pretty fantastic for such a complicated story. It breaks my heart that this show is ending, but all good things do. Although it has made none of the actors rich in and of show salaries alone, due to the extremely low pay compared to other networks, they were all loyal to the show in the way their characters play out Family Loyalty. And I thank them all for this.One great sci-fi/fantasy show which actually continued for as long as we wanted it to. THAT is indeed an accomplishment. Thank you Winchesters, Crowley, Castiel, Billie, Ruby, Lucifer, Bobby, Metatron, Death, Rowena, and oh sooo many others. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you."
299,"Nothing to tell simply it's really good.
Dean
Sam
Castiel
Etc."
300,"Supernatural is fantastic, exciting and will leave you on the edge of your seat. I have watched the series from season one and I'm currently waiting for the next episode of season 9. I have all the DVD's and have watched them on multiple occasions. I'm not easily impressed with Television series. The TV series has left me on the edge of my seat with it's suspenseful plots, twists and turns. This is not just another girly teen show. There are moments of horror, and twisted scenes. The production value on this show are very high as you can imagine. The cast seem to bounce off each other, and you would genuinely believe that these people are friends and have known each other for many years. For anybody out there that thinks this is just another show aimed at teenage girls, it's not. It's so far from that. If you're a fan of fantasy, drama, comedy, and horror then this is definitely the show for you. This show hasn't disappointed me so far, and I doubt it ever will."
301,"Well to be honest, Supernatural isn't just like any show! Its amazing, creative and a masterpiece! this isn't coming from a geek no its coming from a guy who watched all of the shows that are airing now! It started with bad effects but it got better and better and i never thought the storyline would be that tall and amazing.It was just building itself throughout the seasons! i though they ended the storyline in season 2 but when season 4 came then i understood everything. its not that complex but it will make you jump all day because of how you want to watch the next episode! Jensen & Jared are funny and great actors! i hope the show never ends I'm serious! its very unique and they limit their effects and stuff! they are not like Buffy with monsters and flying stuff, no! they just know how it should be done!!"
302,"---May contain spoilers--- This show has completely restored my faith in exciting, creative and innovative television. it completely surpasses shows such as Smallville, Dark Angel and even the often compared X-Files. The show's beginning is relatively simple and straightforward as two brothers Sam and Dean (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles)head out across the country obliterating demons, witches and ghosts among others in a desperate attempt to find their missing dad, who is also a hunter of supernatural beings. the show is pretty solid in setting the scene and setting a kind of routine for the viewer which is acceptable before it starts to kick off with some mind-blowing story lines. Season one is basically routine. the brothers drive into a town and fight whatever problem occurs there via fake id's, chatting up hotties and just generally kicking the ass of whoever gets in their way whilst the blasting of some amazing rock music from the 70's and 80's (much appreciated). Although, despite the mindless escapism feel of Season one, the show transcends into an ultra-creative, ultra-violent and hugely exciting show with the inclusion of some interesting characters (Azazel, Lilith, Meg, Ruby) and some exciting and fresh story lines which is a welcome aspect as the re-imagining of some of the most famous horror characters in history was assisting the show in losing its originality. The show nowadays, deals with the rising of Lucifer, the battle between angels and demons and the imminent Apocalypse which may seem very predictable and unimaginative for a show of this particular genre but the writers do a great job in delivering exciting episodes with though-provoking endings. The acting in the show is well above average. Jensen Ackles as Dean is simply first class. He delivers great humour perfectly interspersed with a kind of uncontrollable rage when it comes to personal matters. Saying that, Jared Padalecki in his portrayal of Sam, is equally as convincing and perhaps delivers a lot more intrigue, drama and emotion. the two brothers a fantastic blend and the actors work very well on-screen. as for the supporting characters, John Winchester, their father, is very good for the short time hes in the show as is Bobby Singer, who acts as a kind of semi-mentor semi-father type figure for the boys in the absence of their father. In addition, I can't help be engrossed by the brilliance in characterisation in particular, Azazel, Alistair and Lucifer. Top notch acting and writing! Overall, Supernatural is a fantastic show that deserves a lot more credit than it receives and I would highly recommend it to anyone as it has kept me captivated for the years it has been on and I assure you the same exciting adventure that I have had P.s Ignore the poor and pointless filler episodes which is a blotch on the almost flawless portfolio of Supernatural as they usually lead to ground-breaking episodes.10/10. Favourite show on television"
303,"Two brothers looking for their father across America. Sounds okay. Two brothers looking for their father across America, while he is in search of a demon which killed their mother 22 years ago and then came back to kill the younger brother's girlfriend. Yeah i'm hooked.The mysterious plot, clever dialogue and interesting characters are some of the things that will make you get hooked on this new show. ""Supernatural"" offers so much to its audiences and my cousin who will not watch anything besides MTV is now interested in this spooky series.The recurring actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki, show consistent great acting and it seems to the audience that these boys are indeed brothers. Not just in the show, but outside of it as well. Their chemistry on screen and witty dialogue helps create that realistic atmosphere and makes it believable... unlike other series where actors are cast as brothers/sisters and you know they are not brothers/sisters.The weekly episodes contain different myths/legends which the boys have to solve, while they get closer to finding their father. Season 1 had all the biggest bads of the legends and we can only expect even better ones in the next season, while the big plot continues to get confusing with the demon escaping.It was sad to see the season finale but to know that there is another season just around the corner is even better. ""Supernatural"" will definitely not disappoint viewers and is enjoyable for many.10/10"
304,"Right now, I watch TV for two reasons. Supernatural and Lost.It took them a while, but finally us sci-fi fans have got some genuinely good shows to tune into, the likes of which we haven't seen since Buffy (and lets face it, that show's quality waned towards the end - not to mention the fact that other shows only tried to imitate it).Everything about Supernatural works for me. It's formula works, the actors have a great closeness which shows on-screen, and the developments in plot and character have had me tuning in for months now.What works best about the show isn't it's special effects, chilling new ghoul every week or even those two undeniably handsome leading characters - but the dynamic that can be found when the main pairing in a show is a pair of BROTHERS.This show is NUMB3RS - horror style - with the sensitive, somewhat geeky brother and the tough, older brother who's protective streak is a major developing plot point in the series.I can only hope it get's picked up by the CW, it has a lot of potential to be a big hit."
305,"This show is absolutely excellent. Some might say that it copies ideas from popular movies(the ring, grudge), but it uses only the best ideas that viewers like and build episode on that. I have seen every episode of season 1 and although not every episode is excellent, as a whole it is an awesome show. See the whole season, trust me you won't be disappointed. The cast has been excellently chosen and fit the characters very very well. They act exactly as they should be and you actually feel each characters perspective in an issue.I just hope the show does not loose its direction or get cancelled."
306,"Supernatural is the first and only television show that had me totally engaged. I just finished watching the last show and could not believe how it ended...I'm not taken by surprise very often when it comes to TV. It's all too predictable these days. This was an awesome episode, and all I can say is....I WANT MORE! That last show really left me almost knowing the outcome, but wanting and expecting more to come. I would hope that this show does continue, as it is one of the only ones worth watching. I have to say that the special effects were well above what some movies use. I am thoroughly impressed.I would really like to learn more about the series, the writer. Of course Jensen is my favorite on the show. Again, I just have to reiterate that the ending was exceptional. I just can't get over it, and it ended 10 minutes ago!"
307,"supernatural is the best program on TV, it has good acting and fantastic special effects, and the story lines are fantastic for every episode and you don't know whats going to happen next reading about the comments on each episode it seems that it is coming to the end of the trail in episodes 21 and 22 as the main purpose is to find their mothers killer, i do hope this is not the case and they make another 10 seasons of this fantastic show, as it would be shame to loose such a good television program, as good as this, because it is very rare when a show like supernatural comes along, the show is very addictive and TV needs more programs like it."
308,"When i saw the Pilot i was immediately hooked, i was scared and i also recognised the story from when i was younger. I had been told this ghost story of this woman who would catch out drivers by appearing in the road then in their back seat. I cannot imagine going a Sunday without Supernatural now! I would recommend it to everybody who is even the slightest bit interested! It has got to be the best TV that I have seen in a long while. I continue being amazed and I know that the season finale is going to be great and I'm sure it will impress. The acting is just brilliant and the imagination of the writers is just unbelievably magnificent, above all standards! Supernatural is just what TV is about."
309,"When i first saw the advert for Supernatural, i was hooked, just one look at Jensen Ackles, i think hes great! I love the supernatural things they solve and as soon as it comes on, i'm watching, i just cant get enough! I really like watching sci-fiction programmes including charmed, invasion, surface and dark angel, which Jensen Ackles also stars in dark angel! He is lovely.i hope the series never ends, I'm hoping it is going to be running for a long time. i think it is interesting to watch, with the ghost, spirits, and i think the one that had the insects in a few weeks a go was horrible, i could not stop itching, i kept thinking there were bugs on me!I LOVE WACTHING"
310,"What can I say what you all haven't said already? Supernatural is a great combination of the surreal and reality. The narratives are unbelievable yet they are represented so strongly, that the messages about the closeness between two brothers, coming of age and family bereavements, which all relate to experiences people have keeping it from making the audience see it as far fetched. The highlight of the show is the protagonists because they are amazing they add sex appeal, humour and intense depth through personality. Both characters are extremely opposite, which is stereotypical between two brothers but is still endearing to watch because of the secrecy behind their individual persona's. The absence of a father figure leaves the audience captured and feel obligated to take this journey with these brothers, which is really effective because it involves us in the fight against the surreal. Rock On Supernatural!!! 9/10 from me for suspense, humour and the ability to keep the audience hooked."
311,"I have seen every episode religiously, this is my favorite show that is running right now. People who don't like the scary stuff, like me, can watch this show and not be spooked, it is a horror show, but it makes you laugh through the whole show. When the two brothers go at it, making jokes and pulling pranks on each other, it shows that even though they do a tough job, traveling and killing monsters most people believe to be fake, that they can have fun and they are very close. If you like to watch stuff that makes you think sometimes, or just for a thriller, this is the show for you. My family hasn't watched one episode, but if and when it comes out on DVD for the first season, which has been very long, I will be the first one in line to buy it."
312,"It's fantastic to finally have a show that delves into the lesser spoken about side of life. Although, thanks to shows such as this one, these things are becoming more and more commonplace discussions at the dinner table or parties.The fact that two hotties that are also excellent actors are the main stars doesn't hurt either.The scripting is wonderfully witty and at other times quite deep and insightful.Being Wiccan I loved the episode with the young girl wearing a pentacle. The description the boys gave was beautiful and spot on.From that point on I was a dedicated Supernatural viewer.Please, Please, Please don't let it go down the road of so many other great ideas. Eg: Charmed; great start for the first couple of seasons then it just got plain silly.I hope we see this one around for a long time. I hope Jensen and Jared don't get tired of doing it. Those guys are wonderful together and the combination of their acting ability and great scripting this show is totally fantastic in my opinion.10/10"
313,"This show is somewhat like a drug. I was addicted to another show for a long time and then came Supernatural and turned me around. The actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are really remarkable. I'm normally don't like this dark movies or shows but an Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) is able to make you forget a lot of things, like your name...or the birthday of your kids. Just joking. But he and Jared are HOT HOT HOT. What makes the show so specific???? The story maybe??? The lines, the good acting of both actors???? I think it is a mixture of many things. It's dark but somehow bright too. It's sad and witty at the same time. This show has too continue."
314,"I've only watched a few episodes, but this show shouldn't be disregarded as just another WB made-for-teen shows. Yeah it actually makes sense most of the time. The plot isn't stupid or completely outrageous and makes you want to barf all over the carpet. Sure the two main characters are extremely good looking, but the characters (while they might be a bit stereotyped) are interesting and fun to watch when they have the brother bickering going on. It has some great lines too...at least I laughed. It has some scary moments,some suspenseful ones and some just really f-ing cool ones.Yeah I definitively recommend it. It sure ain't ""normal"" teen show and thank the heavens for that. The only thing i'm worried about is if they try and make the show more appealing to the more shallow and weak little girls of our generation. I'm soooo f-ing tired of all these Mary-Sue like chick personas with flat stomachs and just begging for people to save them.I must admit the show is flawed in many ways, but the flaws aren't so apparent and the show is still excellent even with them.You! Go watch SupernaturaL RIGHT NOW!"
315,I adore this show for so many reasons. Way too many to write a short review. I wanted to write this though because IMDB did not update her credits in this show to Season 15. She just starred in episode 13!
316,"I'm writing this now, because my tears probably won't let me do it by the time the show's actually over. Man, has it been fantastic. None of the words that come to mind seem to make justice to the joy this show has brought me. Of course, it's not just about how great the show is in every department, but it's about the extraordinary people that is the Supernatural family. The J&J boys, MIsha, respect. It's amazing how you can genuinely love people even without meeting them in person.
You will always be a part of my life, a part of my heart.
THANK YOU SUPERNATURAL"
317,"And it never gets old. In fact, every season is real good. There are maybe 5 bad episodes in whole 14seasons. Highly recommended for any horror/drama fan!"
318,"I cannot stress how brilliant this show is. If you're looking at how many series' there are and wondering if it's worth your time, the answer is hell yeah! If you want to watch a bitch and a jerk (fans will understand) running around ganking bad guys and kicking ass whilst pretending they hate talking about their feelings, then this show is perfect!This is one of the first tv shows that I've really invested my time in to and paid full attention to the story because everything about it is lovable. There are some truly amazing actors/actresses in it that really capture the audience with their character (don't get too attached to any of them - you never know what might happen). I have already watched every current series through more than once and I will never stop watching it over and over again throughout my life I'm sure because it's just so likable.Jensen and Jared are perfect in their roles of Sam and Dean Winchester. I couldn't imagine anyone else doing it anywhere near as good as they are. If you haven't stopped reading this review halfway through to go and watch the series, I'm appalled.HAPPY HUNTING"
319,"Supernatural is the best show I have ever watched.. It has been going for over 14 seasons and it feels impossible to get sick of it, the storyline is still great, the characters are interesting and the plot is still captivating. Supernatural has just the right mix of comedy, drama, suspense, horror and depth. I would by far recommend supernatural, you are bound to fall in love with the characters and the storyline. The supernatural fandom is amazing, it really feels like a family and the cast is so open."
320,Im just about to finish season 13 and after all this time I still love watching it. Some parts just make me laugh. Well done and keep it up :)
321,"I watch a lot of TV shows, mostly on Netflix, or just wherever I can find them. I have never been much a a review person, but this show is definitely worth it. I am on the 14th season, watching the episodes as they come out, an I am impressed. I'll admit, the first few episodes of the series didn't quite catch my attention, but during episode 3 or 4, I knew this was going to be an incredible journey. The plot, as well as the character development was some of the best I have ever seen, and I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the paranormal, or, Supernatural, if you will."
322,This is the best series on this Planet. You will not find something better in this Century
323,"I feel I need to edit this..Every person I talk to who do not watch this show. Mostly say the same thing. ""I do not do horror."" Guess what!? I do not either..Thats how special this show is..You totally ignore labeling it..In fact you can't label it...Other reviews, are too complex for some...The bottom line is this. Supernatural is one of those once in a lifetime shows that has all the magic...It doesn't make a lot of sense at times, but the chemistry between these actors, writers, directors, and support staff is one of a kind, just like this show. No other science fiction show can say 15 seasons, its not even close..No matter if you like horror, scfi, or drama, give this show 1 season. You will see what everyone else sees. Especially season 4...I've turned senior citizens on to this show who swore they would hate it..Now they are crazy about it...This show is a perfect 10, over all...The one liners, writing, and emotions are the heart of the show...Give it a shot....I've watched this show since it began, way back in 2005. Now that its 2018 that gives you some idea how much this show is loved by so many. I don't usually do horror, but this show grabbed me for a lot of reasons. The biggest is the writing, story telling, creativity of Kripke, and the chemistry between the actors. The show did suffer a huge blow when show creator left at the end of season 5 (I think). Season 6 started out with a bitter taste IMHO, but it gained its steam back about half way through the 6th season. Kripke came back some as a creative consult. and you could really tell how much he loved this show. The writers and directors do an outstanding job and the overall chemistry on set is something you do not see everyday. This show is that once in a lifetime show that changes the game for everyone. A horror/SYFY show thats been going for 13 strong season says it all. The work they do off camera is just as important as in front of the camera. I don't care if horror isn't your bag, give this show a shot. Theres tons of comedy in this show and gripping drama. I don't know why it works so well, but it does. Once you get into a few seasons and get accustom to all the actors, please youtube search the gag reels and out takes. You will thank me"
324,"Hats off to all your past and present writers, they have done an excellent job with the dialogue and storyline. It's always a pleasure to watch this show, no matter where you catch an episode of it on the tube. Great Show!! Keep it up, and Thanks!!"
325,"Awesome series ever. especially season 2. best supernatural series ever. every charcter awesome dean, castial, sam, Crowley."
326,Love this series ao much...123456789 101 11 12 13 ❤💙💚💛💜❤💙💚💛💜💜❤💙💚💛💜❤💚💙
327,"Writing - 10
Actors - 10
Panels at conventions - 10
Getting to experience it all live - Priceless
There are some things you can rate, for everything else, there's experience.I've had wine."
328,"Okay. So. I need my profile checklist clear so i need to write a review on my own. This is going to be the worst review of all time so don't read it. I just finished season 5. And it's awesome as i said. This is the best ending of the seasons, and i know the fans want more but i think there is no need to be more episodes after that. What happens when the series need to end and they can't do a better finale than this? But i'am going to watch the other episodes too."
329,"Like any business, there has to be money to make it survive. That applies to entertainment businesses. However, some people will notice that some of them will create things that are not as great as their former glories. To me, Supernatural is the same way. Supernatural's season 1 through 5 were the former glories that Supernatural's season 6 through whatever season will not match ever again. I got tired of seeing the ""same"" things happen again as in Sam and Dean reconciling with each other, former lovers dying or rejected, and the ""good"" guys winning. I do not consider any character in this show good or bad completely in the moral sense. Dean Winchester bends his morals to protect his family, Sam Winchester becomes too emotional from time to time that can hinder him, Castiel bent his morals by killing Ripper Billie, etc."
330,"Supernatural is a TV series which i love and i can see over and over again. Although it has a lot of seasons (12) and it hasn't come to an end yet, it is very interesting and has suspense. The cast is also amazing. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have had a great job so far. The only reason i voted 9 out of 10 and not 10 out of 10 is because Supernatural has to end some day. I support all the team who wants to reach 300 episodes and i assure them that i will watch season 13, but i think i am a little tired of all these seasons. It still remains one of my favorite TV series and i recommend you to watch it, but i think it has to come to an end. I started watching it few years ago (i don't even remember when) and i can tell you i regret nothing."
331,"I don't really the type of girl who writes review on TV series or Movies. But there is always an exception right!! Always loved Horror flicks & Supernatural types series n movies. But Sam/Dean's SUPERNATURAL gave a new meaning to me n my life, ever since 2006. This Show not only give pure entertainment but also the profound bondage of these two brothers is really heart warming. As the show progressed to seasons after seasons, Supernatural totally broke all the records of crossing lines and taking exceptional risks in the history of TV Series. That was something new,which is why I so LOVE IT. Now i basically watch the series not because of horror , or angel n demons or monsters or creature (coz lets face it, there always will be these things and speculations of Good Bad Ugly) i watch this purely because of the brothers and their awesome journey and the way they fight in their life to stay alive & Help others. I mean aren't we doing the same thing fighting in this world to stay alive among the devils n angels in the form of human being, who to trust and whom not to...cuz i believe at the end it always the closest of ur family u turn to get some relief, or may be stand alone to take a difficult choice. ALL IN ALL.. SUPERNATURAL in my view is ONE of d MOST AWESOME SHOW CW gave to me and their cast Jensen , Jared , Misha, Mark etc etc are all exceptionally great actors and good human beings too. Keep up the good work. And I wish and HOPE TO SEE MORE of this Series 12, 13 14 etc etc. Predictable or not predictable storyline....i don't really care. I just wanted this Family to go on...#SPNFamily RULES."
332,"Usually i don't watch series,but I have to admit that ''Supernatural'' is much more beautiful than all the movies I've ever seen so far.The first season was wonderful, with all the adventures that makes the Winchesters to find their father.And when I saw that first season i fell in love with SUPERNATURAL.Then I began to see the second season,the boys that follow Azazel to kill him and to get revenge for their family.After,the 3rd season, Dean pact, Ruby and Lilith ,wonderful season. Season 4 continues with Dean that returns from hell, Sam's new power and Castiel ,the mysterious angel . Season 5 with Lucifer,who was freed from Hell , Season 6 with Dean having a normal life and Sam that returned from the trap of the devil. Season 7 is displayed on a new monster ,stronger and much more dangerous(LEVIATHANS). Season 8 , Dean finally escapes from Purgatory ,and the demons and angels tablets .Now i'm watching season 9 and i really like it."
333,"This show is 10 out of 10, amazing. The first season is thrilling and grasping, it really pulls you in and does not let you go. Season 2 just as good as season 1, really emotional and thrilling and has a very solid story to it. Season 3 is short but still pretty awesome. It's like a big count down, not spoiling anything but,it is pretty intense.season 4 introduces something totally new to the story which will change the show (in a good way). Season 5 is one of my favorites its got a great story line, great characters, and good amount of twist's.season 6 is pretty good, Huge twist and things will happen you will not see at all. season 7.....not the best, It is alright it just didn't have the ""Supernatural"" feel to it but, in the end I was satisfied.Season 8........Let's just say it makes season 7 look like season 1. The story was so dragged out and the episodes were boring and tacky. There was no action and i found my self disappointing almost every week bu, I have a good feeling about season 9"
334,"i absolutely love Supernatural. it has to be my favourite TV show. i have all the box sets available to buy. it is definitely a thing to give a go to watch like. its amazing :D the whole thing, the dialogue, the acting, music, cast, everything is amazing! my favourite episodes are season 4, 6,7,8,9. the way everything has a connection is awesome as well. the season finals are always fantastic. without fault they always send your emotions on a ride, up and down due to the events. dean winchester is the most beautiful character I've ever laid eyes on. bobby is an awesome 'father'. Sam needs a hair cut... the whole characters are amazing and well thought threw."
335,"I love this show, I'm addicted to it. I'm watching every episode on Netflix. Hang in there boys, I just watched the episode when Dean dies......but I the love flips and flops, the ""how did you do that?"" Always a surprise around every corner, forest, rotting body. I just love it! Watching each episode with no commercials and back to back is the best. I'm disabled so when I get things I can do around the house, I'm back at my computer and watching more episodes. Love the show and the characters. I can't believe this show has been on TV for so long and I just discovered it. Thank you for the show, I'm an avid fan now. Keep up the good work, I get so upset when I find a really good show and then it just end, I don't understand why stations do that...dumb I guess. Well, when I'm done, I'll start all over again to see what I didn't catch the first time around. I'm officially hook on this show."
336,I watched every series ever made but supernatural is definitely on my top 3 i watched this for 3 times since 2009.i thought this show is bad but after 2009 one of my friend gave me DVD's and i loved it.i watched them since then and every time the DVD's are released i buy them too.after season 5 i mean 6 and 7 and 8 it is not as good as it used to be but still i love this.i hope they bring new writers because there are 100000000000000 of new better ideas for this. but still it is freaking AWESOME i think a little more budget will do.a little more ads for this show and a marathon so people could catch up then make season 9 so awesome that IMDb give a +9 rating to it this TV show has potential demons angels ghosts vampires and everything is out there you might think this show is a fantasy part of this world but then you find out that it is a kind of a parallel universe is season 6 so funny that episode is i lived with this TV show i suggest u do too.
337,"At first when i heard about it, i didn't like it. I wasn't interested. I think i had seen a few bits from season 4.But then in 2011 i moved into a share house and my roommate loved the show. So i decided okay, i'm going to at least watch season 1. So i watched the first episode and thought this is okay. Until I watched the 2nd episode when they find killers, I WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH IT. I found it to be really funny and at the same time to be like a crime solving show. And it keeps getting better and better, the laughs just keep comingIts a show you can fall in love with. What i also love about the show is that they have main villains, but they don't always go after them, they will go and find random killings."
338,I just recently got into the show and i must say it is the best show I have seen in a very very long time. How they kept the story lines so interesting after 7 seasons is pretty amazing and having by far the best looking men EVER! as the leads of it well that helps to. Love how the one thing to expect of the show is the unexpected and how if someone dies that don't mean we have seen the last of them not to many shows are like that. I would no doubt suggest this show to any one...but would warn them that this show will be very very addictive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can not wait for season 8 i'm sure there will be a lot of twist and turns in this one like they always have and thats why we all watch by far the best part!
339,"How this show just keeps on astonishing me, I've got no idea! This show starts out very quite simple, and oh my have it grown since then!. Not until I finished the entire season one, did I get that feeling that this show is all about the ride. You know how they say ""The journey is the best part"". That's Supernatural in a nutshell, throughout every single season! I don't wanna sit here and talk about what the show is about and what exactly they are doing! That's for you to find out! It's so awesome though! Instead I'd like to share why I think this show is one of the greatest I've ever watched!Supernatural has two types of episodes. Episodes that follows the actual story, and so called ""filler episodes"" *I hate saying that!* Why? Comon, Supernatural has no such thing. I mean technically they do, but for me they are sure no filler..episodes! They should really find a new name for that. Anyhow, now you might think that these filler episodes has nothing to do with the story, but for me that have watched all seven seasons of Supernatural, they actually do. You know how I said earlier Supernatural is all about the journey. They've actually managed to make these ""filler episodes"" so meaningful, so without them there would be no journey! You people that have watched a lot of Supernatural, think about it! If you haven't already.Do not worry though, Supernatural do have a story that it follows. That's one of the great things I think the writers have done so so well! Once those episodes with the actual story shows, you just shine up like sun. They've managed to make Supernatural so exciting that the story or ""filler episode"", one without the other could be removed and still be amazing! Combine these two together and you got one hell of a show! Supernatural, don't miss out!10/10 !"
340,"Supernatural is a superb television series in which brothers Sam and Dean (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles) travel the country hunting down paranormal forces of evil. The acting is exceptional. The plot is well thought out and detailed. Elements of suspense and humor are mixed perfectly.I would recommend this series to anyone that likes Grimm or any other suspenseful paranormal series. Once you start watching Supernatural, you won't be able to stop. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen as the magnificent plot unfolds each episode. Don't skip this series thinking it is just another out there crime series. Watch Supernatural, you won't regret it."
341,"This is one of the best series ever! Just go and see. The main characters Sam and Dean are great. The series has good action and it feels natural. The story is superb 2, and with every episode you see a little bit more of the bigger picture. Stuff that happen in the beginning episodes are sometimes comeback in later episodes.The biggest catch for this series is the love for rock music. They often fake to be an FBI agent and use rockstar names. Not fake rockstars but the old school types. Like Ted Nugent and Angus Young. Every time it happens it puts a smile on my face. This is just a small and minor detail of the series but i like it! I'm not going to spoiler the storyline but it keeps you hooked! Just go out and watch it!I love this series!"
342,"I discovered this show last summer. Watching almost all the episodes, I've realized that SPN is just perfect! You know that other TV shows have lots of script mistakes, not so talented actors, a stupid story and so on. Lots of shows that are rewarded every year are, in my opinion, just boring. I will not give names, but think about a dozen of shows with and about doctors, detectives and so on. Supernatural is different. As many of the fans noticed, this show is about family, about a deep bondage between brothers, who are trying to save other people and even themselves. It's a sci fi show, with ghosts, demons and evil spirits, all portrayed in a brilliant way! I've watched lots of TV shows about aliens, demons and spirits, but none of them was so intense than Supernatural. It's a great show to watch, it has everything people like in a show, strong characters, great script, action and drama in the same time, demons and hot chicks! Too bad it's on the wrong channel."
343,"Well I'd have to say this show is one of my favorites. Its plot twists and good direction/acting make it not only interesting plot wise but also cinematography wise. As an aspiring director I find it a slight inspiration when it comes to lighting and such. I'd highly recommend it. Plus, the guys in it are really hot... always a bonus. But it keeps me and my friends (who are also die hard fans) at the edge of our seats. We hope that it'll come back for another season, because the finale is in a few days.And just so you know it's on at 9 on the WB on Thursday's. Best show ever, folks."
344,"It was summer here in Australia when I first heard that ""Supernatural"" was coming soon.Usually our ""out of ratings period"" imported TV shows from the USA are a load of rubbish, but Supernatural (along with Prison Break) are the stand outs from the rest.If you are a fan of a well written, absolutely scary script, actors playing believable roles,(it only helps that the two leads are eye candy)and a hot and heavy piece of American automobile history - a black V8 Chevy Impala, you too will going along for the ride of your (as well as Dean & Sam's) life."
345,"I think it is awesome but of course I'm not the only one who thinks that. Not to mention the two hottest smartest men in the world are in it. OK people I'm sorry but Jared Padalecki is a better person in Supernatural and in real life. Anyways I think people should watch it especially if you like scary sad movies because this would top it. Oh and for the people who don't know what time and channel it comes on its 9:00pm on Tuesdays and channel wb11. I also think you should watch it because it keeps you in suspense. There is so much more to it too. Oh and for all you Gilmore Girl fans it comes on an hour before supernatural, and I know a lot of people like Gilmore Girls and supernatural. Oh and it is so great because after the credits you get to see what's on next Tuesday and it makes you want the day to come so bad."
346,"I know a lot of people love this show and I really wanted to like it too. However, the majority of episodes have some sort of damsel in distress that needs saving by the big strong Winchester brothers and then she'll probably die anyway a couple of episodes later. At first I just tried ignoring and skipping those bits but I soon realised that there's barely any show left if you do that. I found this trope very cringy and uncomfortable to the point where I just couldn't watch anymore. If you are someone that can overlook all the sexism then I can see how you might enjoy the show but it ruined it for me. Women deserve better than being pretty, helpless, crying damsels who randomly kiss the brothers for no reason after they get saved."
347,"What the F*** is going on with this show?? This show isn't rolling downhill anymore, it's being sucked into a void of crap, i'm at the point where i just skip to the end of the episodes just to get the info i need to understand the actual plot of the season. If you had asked me 3-4 years ago about this show, i would rate it nr. 5- 6 on my top 10 list, but now, i'm now i don't even know why i watch it. Season 1-5 was good, original, got me exited and made me wanna watch more, but now you can tell the show is reaching so far and trying everything to fill out the seasons, every bit of stuff they can find, they will put it in. Bringing in old characters, old monsters, new cursed objects that kills people or make other people kill people.. yes i just watched the one with the masks, and i tormented myself into watching all of it, in case there was info i needed for the next ones. I'm sorry if i seem like a party-pooper, but when they bring in the darkness, and turns Crowley into a dad, then it's clear that they are really running out of stuff to use. If you are going to try this show out, then watch season 1-5, that's the good stuff, what comes after is starting downhill slowly, slow enough for you not too notice at first. But stop after season 10, there is no good reason to continue, pretend it's over, and have a small happy memory of the show. good luck."
348,I watched all 14 seasons on Amazon Prime and now I am impatiently waiting for season 15 to be available. I'm so sad that this is the last season. After binge watching all 14 seasons (I wouldn't watch anything else) and I miss the Winchesters and the rest of the gang. It's a well thought out show that just got better and better with each season. So glad I started watching it on a whim.10/10
349,"This is the most amazing show it has everything you want in a show romance comedy action adventure.
If you ever feel like a new watch have a binge of supernatural it will keep you occupied for a long time!!"
350,"One of the best shows I've ever watched. Great acting from all the actors and it can also get really creepy sometimes. Even though it has 15 seasons, you won't get tired of it. One of my most favorites."
351,"I watched this series when it was brand new while still in high school. I was instantly hooked! Here it is 15 years later and I still enjoy (just about) every episode ""The Winchesters"" are featured in. I'm trying to catch every episode in order as DISH airs them as re-runs.One thing IMDB is missing in Jensen's (and Jared's) list of accomplishments & events (that I know of) is the Fan Club (?🤷‍♀️) YouTube series where the guys go to ticket-only events to host meet & greets over the years. It's impromptu in nature but theres lots of personal based questions the guys field, ""inside jokes"", singing, ....just overall great times with the audience. These are publically available videos you can search for and technically should be mentioned if not linked to that fans can enjoy but they're not necessarily known about."
352,"Epic Bromance, Friendship.Supernatural never seizes to flatter with it's interesting storylines.If you are looking for horror, mystery with little bit of drama... it's your show then.."
353,"I'm not one of those fans that grew up with show. no It is not even a year since I started and finished it till the mid season 15 in 4 months. as a fantasy lover supernatural gave me everything I needed for my soul. great stories, great characters. great family to be part of. this feeling is so pure and unique that I may never experience it.
I don't know what will happen in 7 remaining episode of this epic story. I know it will be tears and sadness, but Gosh I never can be more thankful for what this show and its cast gave me."
354,"Before I sterted watching Supernatural , I pledged a lot of times that I will never watch the show. Fast forward 4 years later ,in today , I decided to give it a try. Now , I consider Supernatural my top favorite show .
It is not only a show about monsters , werewolves , vampires ,angels etc. ; it is also about the term "" family"". Supernatural shows us that a family does not stop at biological terms , but it grows through friendships and experiences with them. In Sam's , Dean's , Castiel's tears and so on, we found ourselves. We struggled with their difficulties, cried with their sadness,lauged with their funny times. and got angry with their in-between fights. We found love and a family to belong to. We felt all the emotions a person can imagine
Notwithstanding the fact that the show is ending soon enough , the family that has been created through these 15 years , will stay alive forever. Both the fandom and cast-crew , will always stay together to tell the tale. Proud to belong to Supernatural family."
355,"If you love Supernatural creatures like Werewolves, Vampires, Demons Angels. this TV show is for you!!! I really enjoyed this TV show and i'm excited to watch the ending when it comes. I will really miss this TV show just like others who will also miss it!!
I Recommend this TV show 10/10."
356,"Want to be an unstoppable binge watcher? Watch this series. I have a rule, and it's called a 6 episode rule. This entails watching the first 6 episodes of a series, even if you're not too sure about it. After 6 episodes, then decide if you want to continue.
I enjoyed this from the beginning, but I was obsessed with it starting when I continued onto season 2! Creepy, witty, suspenseful, connected, obsessed, hot brothers, and well, #1 celebrity crush being Jared Padalecki since GG.
Watch, indulge, and get hooked."
357,"Supernatural is the only show on the CW that does not feel like a CW show, even with the low budget , this is one of the best tv shows on TV to this day, one of the best shows ever made. and it indeed tops all the cw shows."
358,"My favorite show of all time. I have watched it about 8 times, and probably will do it again. It does fall on quality after season 7, but still delivers everything it is supposed to.
Best protagonists and great support characters."
359,One of the best tv show. If you are watching supernatural you will definitely fall in love with CASTIEL (misha collins).
360,"Supernatural is the best show that was made in the last two decades someone can ever watch.
Thank you Mr Kripke for creating this masterpiece.
Carry On fam!!"
361,"I wish I could wash my memory just so I could watch this entire series for the first time again.
Sam and Dean will touch you heart and soul like few fictional characters will ever do.
If you never watched it, stop wasting time and do it."
362,I've been a fan of the show since the start and there's been seasons better then others but the emotions this show will give you is like no other. Sam & Dean are just fantastic characters played by incredible actors. This show is perfect in every way. Even in its flaws its incredible. I would reccomend for anyone over the age of 10. You won't be disappointed!!!
363,"My all time favorite show! No one can ask for a better show to watch. Jensen and Jared are truly wonderful actors because they carried the show on their shoulders to get it to where it is now. thanks to all the cast for this amazing ride, you will be missed"
364,"This show is one of the best shows for its genre it has everything that makes the show one of the best like storyline heroes, villians as-well-as everything supernatural and everything to do with the supernatural."
365,"I really am going to miss this show. Been watching it for half my lifetime. I am glad it got to reach this many seasons. Whenever I hear Carry on wayward son, it always reminds me of Supernatural. This really was and is still the best show"
366,"I love Winchester brothers! Knowing that its their last season already , I am starting to watch their first season all over again, I just can't imagine that I would never see you again dean and sam! I will really miss this show! You are the best!"
367,"I absolutely love this show. One of the best and I have I alot of shows. There is only a few that grasp my attention so much and this is one of them out if like 40 shows I have watched and none of them are reality tv shows also. All of its characters are awesome and have watched it twice and it's a long show so I think that says something. I marathoned it twice. I think it was excellently made and who cant get enough of Sam, Dean and Castiel. I mean come one. Their fricken awesome as Dean likes to say on the show. I do like Dean quite alot more then Sam even though I think their both so loveable. I just like Dean more. If I had these 2 as friends or Brothers I would be ecstatic. I will be truly Sad when the show comes to a end this season but I understand. These boys have put in a great deal of effort and time along with the other characters and it's on to new chapters for them but wow what an absolutely astonishingly amazing show. I just love it. Makes me feel better everytime I watch it. I have even had dreams where the boys from Supernatural appeared. Always awesome dreams. You guys will be very much missed for sure by your true fans."
368,"I have watched this since the beginning and I still love it and I don't believe it that it will end soon, world will be empty without new Supernatural episode in my life, because I grow up with this show and I can't see the world without it."
369,"For me supernatural is not just a series it kinda become a part of my life and Sam&Dean are not just characters they are emotions I've lived this series to the fullest, it makes me sad knowing that this is about to end."
370,"This show's main story is themed around defying Heaven and He'll to embrace free will and humanity.Each season has evolved and reaffirmed this message in the brothers fights and decisions on who to Ally with.Evil is not always evil, and good is not always good... The only people you can count on is family and blood doesn't make you family.This last season drives that point home, showing that even God is just another monster with a superiority complex and once again it's up to team Free Will 3.0 to stop the newest and most dangerous apocalypse, one plotted against them by God himself.This one brings the brothers to the end of the road and as a fan from the beginning, I couldn't be happier with how the story has chosen to end it, always remaining true to it's nature."
371,"Began watching this show about 8 years ago. The first one I saw was not the first episode, I stumbled across a re-run airing on TBS. Halfway through I found myself saying repeatedly, ""How have I never seen this before?!?!"". Between the soundtrack of Classic Rock music (which is my very favorite genre) and the whole mysteriousness of the plotline, I was hooked... permanently as it has turned out. I am very firm in my religious beliefs and my faith in God is absolutely unshakable which is why I can promote the viewing of Supernatural. However, I must caution others who are NOT so devoted to their beliefs, to always remember this is a work of Fiction! The things portrayed in it are NOT something that should influence a persons reality of true and false or right and wrong. Sure, what the ""boys"" do in the show is nothing less than amazing...but still...NOT REAL! So anyone wonderin if its even worth the time to watch..or the risk..well yes it truly IS worth viewing. I recommend allowing the show to influence morally...just NOT religiously or paranormally. Once you begin, you cannot help but fall in love with the whole thing...the characters, their trials and obstacles as well as the hope, love, appreciation, support and yes even the losses that each of them encounter, endure and overcome. I truly cannot stand seeing it end after all these years but in this show one thing that stands true....nothing ever REALLY ends lol. Oh and sorry if my review sounds ridiculous...its my very first ever..and prolly my only!"
372,"Great actors and fantastic story.
Can't wait for next season."
373,"Season 15 has started and the boys are ending their journey. I have grown with Sam and Dean. We were in our 20s when they started fighting monsters and now we are in our 40s. It's time to say goodbye.
Every season wasn't perfect. I really didn't enjoy the Leviathan season. I hated Rowena when she was first introduced but grew to love her.
Notable characters. John Winchester. I wish he had more screen time. Castiel. He wasn't intended as a recurring character but that angel won our hearts. Crowley. The king of hell is probably my favourite character outside of the boys (I'm including Cas as the boys now because family don't end with blood) Jack. I'm a Winchester! Love this guy.
I don't want to give anything away. All I will say is that a show doesn't run 15 seasons for nothing. Ratings are still high and the boys wanted to go out on a high and work on new projects. Good for them. I wish them well.
Please don't Game of Thrones us Supernatural! Make the ending what we need."
374,I'm ready to dive headfirst into the fifteenth and last season!
375,"A série já está faz 15 anos no ar, e continua muito boa e com histórias renomadas, não pode acabar."
376,This show is LIFE!!!😍IN LOVE ..i have watched many shows but none could effect me as this miracalous one .. thankyou so much❤
377,"I have been watching this show since it aired in 2005 and have enjoyed watching the characters and storyline develop.Prior to the leviathan season I think the stories were easy to follow (not so many characters) with enjoyable urban legend like episodes with very good witty humour. After those, I picked up on the fact Castiel got braught back from the dead alot and it all just got confusing to follow.Although the seasons have become convoluted, with attempts to keep the show interesting (which isn't needed as the simple early shows were fun and enjoyable) I have been watching them and I preferred the episodes without the British Men of Letters, the son of Lucifer etc..Overall character development has been very good, and the new seasons are interesting, looking forward to season 14 when it's aired in the UK :)"
378,I was 11 when i started the show to watch it with my dad. After 14 seasons we still watch it together! I'm gonna miss you guys i loved every episode every joke and everything about the show!I hope Eric Kripke will make a new kind of show like this!
379,"Watch it from the beginning. The action is great, but the show is really built around the relationship between Sam and Dean. Their banter is so great that they feel like real brothers or Soldiers on a convoy in Afghanistan.You'll get so attached to them and the supporting characters, especially Bobby and Castiel, that you'll be on the edge of your seat constantly.I honestly hope this show isn't still on when the actors are 60."
380,It is probably the finest shows you can bingewatch. The supernatural element along with humor is great to watch.
381,"Honestly. Watch it now! I heard about Supernatural before, and I was not really impressed when I looked it up on IMDb's summary/synopsis. But after watching it, my predictions about the show were far from the truth. First of all, the Winchester brothers are the hottest, sexiest men you will ever meet. But not only are they wildly attractive physically, their personalities are perfect. And the bond between them is unbreakable- and they bring the meaning of family to a whole new level. Now I'm not usually a fan of ""horror"", but this- this is amazing. I love it. People that love horror must watch this. But the show isn't all about scary myths. There are many the thematic elements in the show that connect many episodes which keeps the audience on their toes. Sam and Dean Winchester are two characters that you will never stop loving or give up on. At first you'll notice their comeliness, and will obsess over their hotness. After a few more episodes you'll love them for their humorous banter. And then you'll notice their personalities and will declare your undying love for them. I'm not kidding. After watching Supernatural, I've fallen in love with them. You'll root for them every second. You'll forgive them for every action. And you'll love them for being so lovable. So take the opportunity to watch it- you don't want to miss the chance of having your lives changed forever."
382,"I get addicted to shows easily but I have never been as invested in a show as I have in this show. It has truly moved me and changed me, I think about it all the time. I didn't expect to get this addicted to it. But I did, and a part of it is the crazy online fandom. I love discussing the characters, defending them, talking about the plot. The acting is underrated and incredible. Why hasn't Jensen Ackles gotten an emmy? Easily they are the best actors ON CW and probably too good for CW, it doesn't get the support it deserves.It's one of those few shows that can truly scare me, make me laugh, cry, and be intrigued all in one episode. It makes you jump in the right places and has great Monster of the Week episodes. But what's truly special about this show are the two characters Dean and Sam Winchester and their journey and their relationship, by far the best brother relationship on screen, and they seem to play off of each other well, for being so close off screen also.This is such a rare show, one of those shows that ripens with age. It's up to the fifth season and still just as good as ever. It's the only show I know that gets to me emotionally. I am not a crier but I've cried multiple times on this show. It also takes the concept of self sacrifice, something Buffy the Vampire Slayer touched it, and brought it to a whole different level.It's such a hard show to describe, one minute it's a horror show, the next action, the next drama, the next comedy. Not all shows can combine those categories and make it work.So I suggest you give this show a chance, even the people I had watch it didn't think they'd like it but ended up LOVING it, it's a show that catches you by surprise, so go ahead! Be surprised and treat yourself to a show of a lifetime!"
383,"Supernatural is the absolute best show ever! The writers are amazing with the plot line. Two brothers searching for their father? Just that alone would catch some peoples eyes. But the fact that they're ghost hunters and looking for the thing that killed their mother is so appealing. And the thing that killed their mother also killed Sam/s girlfriend and brings him back to their job. Saving people, hunting things, the family business. And it doesn't hurt that the two main characters are totally hot! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki have great chemistry. They work so well together. It's too bad that 'Supernatural' is up against big shows such as CSI and The O.C. But Supernatural is holding its own. Hopefully CW(WB and UPN merged together) will put Supernatural back on Tuesdays. I wouldn't have to miss CSI and it would much better for everyone. But wait! Grey's Anatomy is going to be in the same time slot as CSI! Oh, crap. This poses a problem. Battle of the Best. The two most watched shows on television going head to head? Let's really hope that Supernatural gets moved back to Tuesdays!"
384,"Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are amazing. Its so easy to believe they are brothers. Dean in all his get in there, demon ass kicking, chick goggling and wise cracking is the perfect parallel to sweet-hearted younger yet strangely taller , vision getting puppy dog eyed, Sam. I am really interested in seeing how there issues with there dad will develop. The Vampire episode was good. It was interesting how both brothers at some point spoke up to there dad.Sam who is SO much taller. After speaking up they swallowed hard and I could actually believe theses were grown men still feeling like kids around dear old daddy. This show is excellent and I can not wait to see what happens next season!."
385,"1) Jared & Jensen. There just wouldn't be a show without these two actors. Some people might believe that one actor is better than the other. However, IMHO, if you didn't have one of them, the brotherly relationship just wouldn't work. Jared and Jensen both make their characters unique and three-dimensional. I can't imagine anyone else in either role. They both show emotion and depth and those who say that these two actors bring down the show really need to take a closer look at the episodes. The acting on this show is far superior to a lot of other shows.2) The story lines. Yes, they do take bits and pieces from different things...but so what? Original ideas ran out a loooooooooong time ago. It takes quite a lot of imagination to put a new spin on things, and this show does that. There always seems to be a unique spin made on an old legend, they twist it around and make it interesting (even for those who may have heard of the legends before).3) The music. While other shows use the latest popular chart hits, 'Supernatural' is using classic rock that's never gone out of fashion. In fact, it's aged extremely well. Thank god for the music on this show. It fits perfectly.4) This show also at least *attempts* to have a horror element to it. Okay, so maybe nothing has actually made you jump out of your seat, but that's hard to achieve with what they can show on TV. I just admire how atmospheric and moody this show can be. They hardly ever have any cheese factor (there is the occasional bit), but on the whole, this show is dark and gritty and that's why I love it.5) The guest stars and recurring characters/actors. It seems like 'Supernatural' often chooses some of the best actors/actresses to guest star on it. Okay, some are better than others, but usually we get a pretty good guest actor/actress. Not to mention that both male and female viewers of the show get their fill of eye-candy. For the female viewers there's Sam and Dean, and for the male viewers (like myself) there's usually a hot-random-girl-of-the-week. While other shows might just get actors/actresses for their looks and nothing more, at least this show tries to get good-looking actors/actresses who can actually *act*."
386,This Series is Amazing! Creepy With hot guys Chasing Bad Guys What More Could A Girl Want? Sam and Dean are gorgeous! the story line is perfect the season finale is tomorrow may 4th 2006 it's going to be great I Can't Wait! They Have Been Chasing This Demon Fire Demon I Should Say That Killed Their Mom When they Were Little And This Sam Demon Years After Killing Their Mom Also Killed Sam's Girlfriend Jessica So They Are All After Him And Last Episode Started It and tomorrow nights episode finishes it off their dad got taken hostage by this demon and they have to go save him Ehhh I Wish it were coming on tonight they make it look like their dads going to die but hopefully they will get there in time to save them i would recommend this show to everyone who likes a little bit of creepiness mixed with some drama
387,"How could you not love this series. Apart from having two very good (& sexy) actors, I really enjoy the plots. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are a great team. I picked the series up quite a bit of the way through and have really enjoyed it. You can watch each episode individually, but you still have the main thread to follow. I would really love to see Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) with a serious love interest though. He strikes me as being tough on the outside and very sensitive on the inside. I would like to see a woman bringing out the sensitive side in him. All in all I would recommend the series. Not just for the paranormal, but for the quality. xxxSuzexxx"
388,"The show starts great from episode one and only gets better. Sam and Dean are two brothers on a quest to find their dad and answers. Along the way they meet various people who need their help. In Pilot they were made to battle a woman in white. In that episode we were introduced to the main characters of the series and what they've been up to since the time Sam and Dean's mother died to the hands of something still unknown. The two brother's are reunited after what appears to be a long time.Dean is the cooler and more sarcastic one of the two. He's followed the path of his father in the hunt for finding his mother's killer. Sam is the brother who went to college and wanted to have a normal life.There are only two complaints I have for this show. The 1st is that the play to many re-runs. The 2nd is only the single episode of Bugs. If you can get passed these two things, I would recommend this show."
389,"Hey! I watch the show ""Supernatural"" and I love it! It's scary, suspenseful, and it includes 2 hot hunks! I discovered the show after i saw the horror ""House of Wax"". Jared Padalecki was in it and i wanted to see his other movies. I then discovered that he plays in ""Supernatural"" (as Sam). Then I saw a commercial for it and realized that it was coming on at 10:00! I watched it and was immediately hooked! Jared is SO sexy! So is Jensen Ackles (Dean)! I watched 1 episode where Sam (Jared) was getting strangled with a plug cord by an evil ghost! Another one, called Asylum, where Sam,then Dean(Jensen) get attacked by an insane doctor murderer ghost who increases one's anger even after death! But they (sam and dean) obviously don't die. Like I said before, they are SO very hot and sexy!"
390,"Get two extremely hot guys, throw in a bunch of ghosts, and voilà! you've got Supernatural.If this show goes on for a few more seasons, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles might get more leading roles. Those two are SO hot and not really bad actors, either.I would give this show a perfect 10. It's not one of those really lame shows where you can tell that all of the scary things are computer-generated. Oh, and parents, it's rated TV-14 because of violence and language( don't worry, they don't drop any f-bombs, if you know what I mean). There's no sex or nudity at all.If you get scared of the hook-man (yesterday's episode) or if you have nightmares of kids that haunt lakes, this show is definitely not for you. But if you love seeing hot guys battle supernatural beings, tune in every Tuesday night on the WB at 9:00. You won't be sorry!!"
391,"To kill Mary Winchester not once but twice and over a decade later after bringing her back into the show as a main character is absolutely Epic the guys and their father were fueled by the pain of Mary's death and to ""live"" with these characters for more than 12 seasons andgo through it again is absolutely soul crushing this show revamps itself every season and honestly could go 10 plus more years and id watch every bit of it"
392,"""I have trudged through your complete oeuvre,"" and Supernatural definitely is my all time favorite show. If sumed up in one word the show is dynamic. No one truely dies on the show forever and I hope that stands true for Mark Shepard =( This is the ultimate binge show and no need to go in any specific order I started binge watching in season 10 worked my way back and forth 10 times over. I give this show a 10 out of 10 for pure re-watch abillity because no matter how much I watch this show it never gets old. This show has got me through dark times in my life and it hurts my soul that this is the last season!"
393,Love love love it's a must watch ... oh yeah and the boys well watch it and see
394,"Finally watched the whole series during quarantine time and I can't believe how great this show is! Although some season is a bit meh, the whole story about the Winchester is still amazing and touching. It not simply just a show talking about killing cool monsters, what i love is how the two brother develop their relationship with each other, and their bonding with other character, it's so heartwarming and I think it's even better than just killing monsters."
395,"Amazing from start to finish. The headline says it all, GREATNESS."
396,"I doubt any show can deliver the same level of connect that Supernatural does. The actors have embodied characters that have grown with the show's story. Supernatural is a beautiful experience courtesy of the amazing writers, actors, stunt coordinators, and sound technicians."
397,"Supernatural is truly a masterpiece and while I'm sad it's ending I'm so proud of how far the actors have gone they are truly amazing for having done supernatural for so long, the tale of two brothers and an angel. This show never disappoints. 10/10 and I really have no idea how can someone rate lower."
398,"Truly a wonderful show. One of the best shows out there, absolutely my favorite. The best 15 years of my life, Thanks for the amazing moments and memories."
399,"I just love this show!!!! I am laid up after cancer surgery. This show, and Dean, Sam, and all the characters have become my best friends! It's entertaining, and such a wonderful aid to help heal me!! I will miss this show when I finish it all!! 😢😥"
400,"Any truly good story is about us human beings. Make it about family, you come up with some of the best T.V. shows ever written.This is a very simple story about two brothers and their ""Supernatural"" journey. You do not stay on TV these days for 15 Seasons unless you have a great writing staff and a super loyal audience. The ""Supernatural"" part of the show is and always has been background to how these two brothers handle, a little thing we call Life.This is a great show, worth your time investment. You understand why people love this show, very quickly."
401,"(I may not be very objective in this review because Supernatural is my favorite show of all time but I'll try to be as clear as possible as for the reasons why)First of all, the plot. It may feels like every episode is the same (there's obviously a pattern) but they're all different since we always get to discover new monsters or part of the stories of the main characters. Talking about them, I do not love Dean, Sam and Castiel only because they're cute but also for their strong and distinguished personalities. The further we watch, the more we know and the more complex the story is. At some point, you just feel like you know the characters so much that they are part of your family (by the way showing how good the actors are). What I love about this show is that it's not just about fantasy or science fiction, we get to discover throughout the seasons that they're more to it, real moral problems that are discussed. We get to learn a lot about subjects that are usually not taught at school, especially religion (I live in France so we don't get to have religion classes to often!)
The decors are undeniable really beautiful, in each episode there's a new location which captures the way the characters are supposed to live in the show, in a constant road trip, running away from reality but also facing it every day.. As for the music, classic rock'n'roll is really appropriate and works with the whole ambiance.
15 seasons seems a lot, but once you get into it you watch carefully each episode, knowing that it will be the end soon.. You'll get to love it !"
402,"All episodes are up to the mark, Each and every character did a terrific job. Don't know what to do after its ending. It is available on Amazon Prime and maybe also on other platforms."
403,The show is thrilling and entertaining the writing is incredible and the acting is even better.
404,"So much about thos show is great. The acting the character. Sure there have been some seasons I'm sure we all could forget about. For me its season 6,9 and 12. But the world of superman sucks you in and doesnt let you go. So sad its ending."
405,"I am a big fan of this show and enjoyed every single episode of it. I love it so much , such a great show <3"
406,This tv series never got me bored. I started watching this tv series 10 years ago and I never missed an episode. It is a combination of mythology and wonderful creative screen play. I am so glad that there are people what have so much imagination and can keep me so close to their show.
407,"I have watched Supernatural from the beginning. It grew with each episode all the way to the end. I always loved the way they did the previously on differently with the ""Then"" and ""Now"". But the last show of each season ended spectacular with the Kansas song ""Carry On Wayward Son"". No words can really describe the impact of the season finale, finales.If you are looking for a show to invest time in, this is the one, from start to end. Even though the end has not arrived yet, as I write this. I can not imagine, after just the first 3 episodes of the last season, that it will not be spectacular. I am one that will miss this show more than any I have ever watched in the past. It will leave a void for sure."
408,This is one of the greatest shows I've ever seen the headline pretty much says it all
409,Great story line and characters! You never know who is going to come back from the dead. New plot twists give an on the edge of your seat feeling.
410,"This is simply the best tv show ever made! As a tv addict for sixty years ( Yes they did have TV then !) I have never watched a better written, acted, directed, and casted show ever. I have already watched most of the seasons 7 times !!! and can see me watching them again and again."
411,"A melhor que Já série que Já Assistir, Nesse Último A Série Perdeu Um Pouco Da Qualidade Mais Continua Perfeita!!!"
412,"Another show ending!!! Just happy we got 14 amazing seasons and get one more! And a bonus the last season isn't going to be less than 20 episodes, I think I read. I understand it has been a long time on air which is going to be strange when Supernatural is not part of my weekly routine anymore, lol! I started watching it because of Jensen on Smallville as Jason Teague. Then recently last summer binge watched the Gilmore Girls and then the 4 episodes Netflix did. Anyways sad to see Supernatural end, happy we got so many years of it!!!!! I hope the last one is a GOOD one!!! So far I'm sad because soooo much is cancelled and has either last season's right now or the 2019/2020 season. So far it's Supernatural and Arrow last seasons 2019/2020 and Arrow is going to be a very short 8th. iZombie I'm very upset this is the last season coming up. I LOVE iZombie!!! Just found out that The Gifted was cancelled and Gotham has a short 5th with the season finale coming up in a week. Although I watch the other network shows on Hulu the morning after they air I still have a few Fox favs even if I watch them on Hulu the next morning. anyways too many shows are on the last season now or this spring and even the 2019/2020 season. : ( recently Vampire Diaries and The Originals ended thankful Legacies started. And was renewed."
413,"It's like family now, watched it since day 1 and has gotten to be one of the ones I look forward to every year! Hope they make some movies now"
414,This show has everything..from a bit of horror to comedy...to love..to brotherhood...this show had got something for everyone.
415,"What would one do without a dose of supernatural, watch charmed? Lucifer? Although both have thier moments..Supernatural is in its own league and always has been, I'm partly writing this review as a thanks to the 2 Winchester boys for 14 seasons of awesomeness, bad assery & pie..some seasons fall short but wow do they they always come back! Cheers boys and cas."
416,THIS HAS BEEN MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SHOW BECAUSE IT SHOWS A LOT OF EMOTIONS AND TALKS ABOUT FAMILY AND MAGIC AND SUPERNATURAL CREATURES PFFFT
417,"From Season 1 to now, this show never disappointed me, yes there were some lower quality seasons but overall there were more amazing good quality seasons with lot of fun and good story than bad ones, and this show gives you what you want, true to it's name, keep things simple ""Supernatural"".
I hope that they never end it, just keep it going, every season has new plot, lots of supernatural stuff and still keeps things interesting, always looking forward for new episode. If you are fan of action and supernatural then binge watch this show 10/10"
418,"Wer gerne Monster, Geister oder ähnliches mag, ist hier genau richtig."
419,"I consider myself a true fan of supernatural, i have watched it 6 times so far. supernatural is s01 to s05, the rest is something else. It should have ended there, it was planned to, the author made clear from the beginning that he wanted it to have 5 seasons and he had already planned the ending. All that happened until that had a purpose, fit the story to come to that end! Thats why he got out! I just don't know what to say, after season 5 the rest has no point, its all about jokes and the same dramas over and over again, above that Its about making more money, they don't care about the series, they don't care how it should end, they just keep going as long its profitable..."
420,"I am a big fan of this series.Honestly I am addicted of it.Right now I am on seventh season but I am numerable new audience.Because I have watched for two months.And I am still feeling excitement of the first day.Really a very impressive series,with them fights,scary scenes and witty plans.When I watched them,I feel like I am there.Dean's smiles,his jokes,his hunting with his brother Sam,feelings of brotherhood and great Castiel...All of this became piece of my life.Also it colored my summer holiday very much.I recommended to my friends for free times,but they became addicted too.They are thinking that,they cant live without this series like me.It is as well as,actors are amazing.They do justice to their roles,exactly!Don't stay in hesitant or Don't leave because season six is little boring.Believe me,after every episode you will say that ''Wow,awesome,perfect!'',you will say to noncontiguous ''Son of a bi..h!''.Because this series is a legend.So absolutely you must watch it.Don't worry,you don't rue."
421,"Okay so supernatural has been going on for like almost eight...nine years and when the first season started I was eight. So now I've got so much catching up to do. Only now do I understand the hype... This show is awesome, funny, dark, scary and brilliant.Sam and Dean are two of the most amazing characters to date in any series....you'll like them instantly and quickly they'll get under your skin and you won't want to let them go.The whole concept is mind-boggling. I love the whole angels and demons aspect too, gives a heavier, darker and more serious atmosphere, but hey then Dean's there to make it as funny as hell.This show has completely taken me over...my new addiction.... SUPERNATURAL RULES!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing like it!!!!"
422,"During the 90's I was a big fan of the X-Files to this day I still am. The X-Files had great stories and character development, which is needed for a great show. Supernatural has that from the very first episode. I admit that I missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but I knew exactly what happened and where the story was going. Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural. CBS's Threshold, may not live up to the X-Files, but Supernatural does. One final note, as long as the WB doesn't do any tweaking of the show this series will last for quite a few seasons."
423,"There really isn't much to say about Supernatural, other than it lives up to it's Supernatural title and the relationships, friendships and plot lines will keep you constantly guessing.You won't get bored of this season or the next, you will just keep watching. I know I'm rather addicted and can't get enough of Dean and Sam Winchester. These brother's have one of the best relationships I've seen on TV so far. It's incredible how they keep the family bound strong through everything that get's thrown their way.I highly recommend this to anyone, and if you aren't watching it yet, you truly are missing out. Go out and buy the DVD box-set, you won't be disappointed. I promise."
424,"It's perfect and so many other words. can't wait to get season 8 on DVD. so I can watch it over and over again. The way the directors and camera men have made each and every episode is amazing. it puts any other TV show I have watched seen to be only 2 out of 10. I love supernatural so much that I've watched every season I own at least three times if not more. i'm going to cry when they decide to stop making seasons :(. The actors are amazing, I love how they portray their characters. the stories and myths behind each episode is awesome. in my English class we're doing film study and I was going to do my assignment on supernatural because I know so much about the show and it fits the genre and would work out well for me but unfortunately I am not allowed to do TV shows :("
425,"Excellent acting. Out of all the CW TV shows, this is the one that has had consistently good acting throughout the entire series. Jared and Jensen show exceptional skills ranging from drama, humor, anger, and anything in between. I also have a huge amount of respect for the man who plays Bobby (I forgot his name.) All in all, this show is a must see for everyone. It's dramatic, intense, suspenseful, funny, witty, and consistent. There are never episodes that make me want to stop watching. Again, I can't stress enough how amazing the acting is. I feel like this show isn't publicized enough and it should be, because it beats all the other shows such as Gossip Girl that got twice as much and couldn't even make it past 5 seasons. LOVE THIS SHOW."
426,"I saw the previews for the show back in season one and was immediately hooked and couldn't wait to see an actual episode. I loved the Pilot episode and couldn't wait to see the next installment. This has become an all too familiar pattern as every episode leaves me wanting to know more as I share the journey of the Winchester brothers and their quest to find their father and avenge the death of their mother.For those who love a realistic sibling relationship complete with bickering and banter, the underlying family means everything theme, the fantastic music of classic rock, a show with humour and joy along with very real emotions of grief and sadness plus a healthy dose of intrigue and mystery with the unknown enemies both supernatural and human, this show WILL appeal. If your preference for TV watching is more soap based, this show may at first glance be a bit too gritty or blue collar, however give it a try and if you need to, watch it in the daylight or better yet with some friends.The show appeals to all ages and genders and did I forget to mention - the car - a beautiful black impala which is used to transport the brothers across the country. I watch TV to be entertained, this wonderful show called Supernatural does more than just entertain, it also enthralls and makes you care deeply about the characters of Dean and Sam Winchester portrayed so well by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. The chemistry between these two fine young actors enhances the brotherly bond between their characters and makes the emotions all the more real and so believable. The Season One DVD set has been replaced a couple of times already in my home as the show is one of the most re-watchable I have ever seen and many of my work colleagues are still waiting their turn to borrow the set. We are looking forward to getting Season Two within the next couple of weeks and the start of Season Three cannot come soon enough."
427,"OK so initially I wasn't interested in the show, I think maybe 2-3 epi's in the season, I got hooked, I will admit initially it was because it's a great show, but that handsome Texan Jensen Ackles did capture my attention, lol. I think there was only one episode I didn't really care for in the first season, the episode with the spirit that was bringing down planes, not my favorite, but it was funny to see ""Dean"" afraid of flying of all things, but not blood thirsty vampires, Y.E.D. or angry spirits. I really hope CW continues to pick up the show, I really hate when one my favorite shows gets cancelled. I love the banter between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, you can really tell these two get along. Not to mention the producers, directors and the whole crew. Also, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is amazing!!!! I loved him on Grey's Anatomy too."
428,"When I first saw Supernatural I was surfing the internet and my friend told me about it so I thought it would a good idea to check it out . When I watched the(Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things) episode the the show was halfway through the season and immediately I got pulled in by the good acting, amazingly good plot, fantastic music and laughs. So I watched the pilot and the storyline amazed me, I loved how the father became a hunter to hunt down his wife's killer. Up till Supernatural I've never been such a fan of horror TV series until Supernatural. Every episode has never failed to either scare me or to make me laugh. I hope that Supernatural will be able to continue on for many more years."
429,"I have to admit, when I first rented Supernatural at my local DVD place it didn't impress me at first as I only rented first disc on the first season set, and then I decide to give it another try and I immediately became a fan.Following Sam and Dean, two brothers trained in the art of hunting the creatures of the supernatural and American folk lore based origin are now in a search their missing father who is hunting the creature who murdered their mother and Sam's girlfriend, the two estranged brothers set out a quest across the U.S, encountering various bad creatures, helping those in need, all the while finding small pieces of their father's trail, eventually finding him and learning some very disturbing facts about the demon they have been hunting all their lives.The great thing about this show is it is genuinely scary at some points, having some of the dark & brooding presence of the X-files and Millennium but all while having the great sense of brotherly bickering and unspoken love (being a brother myself they got that down perfectly) and dark humor about what the brothers Winchester do for a living.Along with the humor is the emotional story about a family who has been torn apart by loss and the evil which they see on a daily basis and through their journey Sam, Dean and their father John come back to each other, realizing that only as a family can they face the darkness.Having just finished the first season, I am anticipating the release of Season 2 so I can be caught up and ready for the third chapter in this incredible story."
430,"There are only two shows about the supernatural that I love: The X-Files and Supernatural.I heard about this show from a friend back when it aired. The first episode I saw was the fourth episode of the first season and from then on I was hooked. This show is very well written especially with its portrayals of the supernatural beings such as Bloody Mary, the Wendigo, the Hook Man etc. Before this show I had never heard of a Tulpa or a Shtriga (there was a tulpa in The X-Files). The writers did their homework researching myths and legends and the special effects team is amazing the way they bring the monsters to life. Similar to The X-Files: the show is developing a mytharc revolving around the special children and the Yellow Eyed Demon.In The X-Files, it was aliens and government conspiracies and in Supernatural it's demons and possibly the Devil himself with the special children mirroring the alien/human hybrids & supersoldiers of The X-Files. The X-Files is more technical and combines ""Law & Order"" with supernatural phenomena & UFO-ology/conspiracies whereas Supernatural is about two ""renegades"" working outside the law in the shadows to fight off supernatural phenomena.Supernatural has very good actors in Jared and Jensen and the tidbits of comic relief usually provided by Jensen Ackles' characters here and there are timed very well. Two episodes of Supernatural mirror the X-Files and why wouldn't they? Serveral people who worked on the X-Files now work on Supernatural. Sam and Dean, the name of the main characters who both believe can be slightly compared to Mulder and Scully. Dean is the risk taker with a more hands on approach & a sarcastic sense of humor similar to Mulder and Sam is the researcher and the rational one with a personality similar to Scully.Overall I believe that show will be a hit. It's coming to its 3rd Season and I hope to see this show go far like the X-Files."
431,"I'm from Kansas. Pittsburg to be exact. And there is a Ghost light that orbits a creek. No lies. When the show began I noticed that because of all the story's through every city, the show would solve some issues. It has. Love the show, as well as a whole lot of people I know. Truth is that the more I watched the first season, the more I didn't want to watch the second season..........because, the first season was such a wonderful experience that I couldn't watch season two until I finished season one. And what an ending for season one. Now I have kept strong, waiting for season 2 DVD. I will be spending the weekend watching it Then go about my life until season 3 starts. Love the show. Kel"
432,"As a fan of the horror genre, I was skeptical that a TV show could give the same chills as big screen fare. What a pleasant surprise this pilot episode was. From the beginning, it offered suspense and mystery. The introduction of the Winchester family is explosive. When we are reintroduced to Sam and Dean, older and wiser, their characters immediately establish all the layers of history between brothers. The older, Dean, bound by duty and loyalty to a father and the only life he has known. The younger Sam, desperate to leave that life behind and strives for the unknown, normal. The moral lines are fuzzy. Our good guys commit crimes and lie, but it is in the fight against evil. They are protectors, hidden by the dark of night. There is a point when the writing prophetically establishes that Dean has been, and always will be there it watch out for his younger brother, and that Sam must embrace what is his destiny.I look forward to seeing what is in the dark, and having these well written and rich characters there to protect me. Plus they aren't hard on the eyes and have one heck of a car!"
433,"Not reality TV? Check! Not a cop show? Check! Not a melodramatic (generally hospital-based) soapie? Check!So straight off the bat, Supernatural was hitting all the right notes. I was looking forward to turning on the TV and not having to watch yet another Law and Order or CSI spin off! No reality TV, no melodramatic hospital-based soapies and no mindless teen drivel, aka, The OC.It's like a horror movie every week. The brothers drive into town, find the evil, hunt the evil, and nine times out of ten, kill the evil, then drive off again...in their adorable car, the black Impala, affectionately dubbed 'Metallicar' by the fandoms.They started way back when, following their demon hunting daddy John on his quest to find the thing that pinned their mum to the ceiling and burnt her alive.Dean's your average guy, happy to eat junk, drive fast, listen to loud rock, which blasts from the car stereo at every opportunity, and hunt evil, like his daddy taught him. Sam, on the other hand, left for college the first chance he got. He's smart...full ride to Stanford smart, so when Dean rocks up saying that their father, the elusive John Winchester, has gone missing on a hunt, Sam is somewhat reluctant to drive off into the night and find him, leaving behind his girlfriend, Jess.But he goes, and they kill what their dad started hunting, and they find out that he left town long before they arrived. So Dean drives Sam back to Palo Alto...where Sammy finds out that his beloved Jess pinned to the ceiling, just like their mum.So we have the motivation for Sam, and they start hunting again, Sam and Dean, hunting evil and searching for their dad.Season 1 was fresh and exciting, being introduced to a different urban legend every week and watching it's often fiery demise in the same episode. Season 2 was darker, driven by a story arc concerning Sammy and the possibility that he was evil personified, and season 3 looks to be shaping up to be the best yet.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable show, entertaining every week, whether serious or jesting, masterminded by Eric Kripke, whose love of all things horror has given us Supernatural, a horror movie every week!"
434,"If you haven't watched this show, I urge you to check it out. The simple summary is it's about urban legends. But it is so much more. It's a story about the relationship between brothers, their relationships with their father, how they feel about hunting ""evil"" and more. There are so many layers to this show.It has the best of everything and something for everyone. Great acting, great writing, incredible music and the coolest car on TV. There's humor, action, drama. It's funny, it's sad. It's thought provoking.Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are incredible as Dean & Sam Winchester. Two very talented actors.As I said before, if you haven't seen this show, watch it. You won't be disappointed."
435,"How would I describe Supernatural? It's like Hardy Boys meets X-Files meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer... It's pretty cool. It definitely fills the niche of several paranormal themed shows in the past, but it really has its own look and feel.This show has a lot of good things going for it: good cinematography, hot leads, scary monsters, urban legends come true, witty dialog (especially from Dean, God how I love him.) But a lot of crappy shows have that stuff too. There's something about this show that makes it more than just another one of its genre: This show never forgets that the monster is not the most important thing- the characters are. Sure, we want to see how they exorcise the ghost and save the damsel in distress. But what's more important is the Winchesters. The demons/monsters/ghosties on this show all serve the purpose of advancing the Winchester's story. They place them in moral dilemmas, fights with one another, and put them head to head with their old skeletons in the closet.This show also has a great balance between dialog and action. Too many shows are so action packed, you kind of forget why the characters keep hitting one another. This show has plenty of talk, but not too much. You always understand the characters, and that makes all the action scenes hit home emotionally. You know exactly what Dean means by ""shooting Casper in the face."" The chemistry between the two (and occasionally three) Winchesters is solid. Above all, this show is about a torn up family that have pretty much been through hell for and with one another. You can sense a history and a deep relationship. (I love the way Same and Dean kind of communicate and nod at each other while interviewing a witness.) But it avoids the chick-flick-ness. It's just very real. Sam and Dean will risk their neck in a second for one another; but they have absolutely no hesitation in teasing the other to death. Very brotherly.So, if you're looking for an entertaining show with good characters and interesting plots, you should definitely consider this one."
436,"The first time I saw the extremely overplayed teaser for the new series Supernatural was on the WB. Jared Padalecki (who I recognized from Gilmore Girls) was driving a car and hits a woman who then vanishes and ends up in the back seat of his car. Turns out she is a ghost. After seeing that, I thought to myself, ""No way am I ever going to watch that show. Way too creepy for me."" My friend watched it though, and absolutely loved it. Half way through the season, I watched my first episode, ""Scarecrow.""Fast-forward to today. I have watched every single episode at least three times (with the exception of ""Bugs"" which I did not like). On the day it was released, my friend and I walked from school to the local FYE and bought the DVD box set. Before the DVDs came out, I watched the episodes over and over again on YouTube. Every Thursday my friend and I watch the re-runs or new episodes together, making Thursdays our ""Supernatural Night,"" even if we have a million things to do for school.As you can tell, I love this show. Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) and Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester) are amazing actors who bring a lot to their completely lovable characters. The show perfectly blends horror (which I am now a fan of), family drama, and comedy, horror being the main genre. The lighting is gorgeous, and the boys aren't bad to look at either. =) Another great thing about this show is the wide variety of viewers it attracts. It's not like other shows which tend to attract a certain age group. Instead, it's great for people of all ages who love to be scared.Basically, it's an amazing show. 10/10 stars."
437,"Supernatural is a Really good program I am glued every time this is on. It funny ,scary and exciting. I like them been brothers and not friends because it has made it more fun to watch because they have fun and they fallout as really brothers do. I like watching this program because they goto places I never even heard of and on most episodes my hair stand up on the back of my neck which is quite scary. But the last episode Devil Trap Sam and Dean and the dad seem to be dead I hope they are not and that there is another Series to come. To find out if the demon has won or not. I really hope that Warner Bros do have another series coming. Because Warner seem to stop doing the good programs."
438,"The Supernatural Phenomenon, that is the sensational work of Eric Kripke of the WB network, entices viewers of a large variety through it's family values and obvious horrific and *supernatural* genre. Urban myths and legends are brought to life through the two main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester (Played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles respectively), who are on a hunt for all things supernatural and on a mission to find their elusive father.Acting talents, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, were both hand picked for their roles even though both come from, what some people call, melodramatically sappy backgrounds - Jensen Ackles as the heart throb Eric Brady in Days of Our Lives and Jared Padalecki, the sweetheart nice boy next door, from the Gilmore Girls. How these two excellent actors came from such a background to portraying emotionally scarred brothers quite possibly on the road trip of a lifetime and in the fight for their lives still amazes me. Kripke has definitely done some great work in that department. And this really shows their wide range in acting skills, to go from playing heart throbs to battling demons and getting bloodied up and beaten along the way is certainly a huge change.The show, cleverly entitled ""Supernatural"", deals with urban myths and legends - looking at beings such as Bloody Mary, Pagan Gods, Vampires, Hook Men and Shapeshifters. These brothers certainly have their work cut out for them. If these supernatural beings weren't enough, the Winchester Family also have to deal with a haunting family secret. When young Sam was only 6 months old, *the demon* came for him - failed - and killed his mother in the most horrific way possible. Pinned to the ceiling and dripping with blood was the way John Winchester found his lovely wife Mary, bundling Sam into Dean's arms, he rushed Dean and Sam out of the house as the ceiling burst into flames, to run back inside to do anything he could to save her. This event quite possibly ruined Sam and Dean's chance at having a normal childhood as they were constantly told to keep wary of *everything* that went bump in the night - not to mention the effect it had on their father. John Winchester was emotionally scarred and wrecked for life, left to hunt the being that killed his wife and to always be on the lookout for evil things, destroying his ability to be a good father to his children. This event has haunted the Winchester's all of their lives whether in their sleep or always in their minds. Sam relived that horror many years later when his Girlfriend Jessica died in the exact same fashion, he came home after helping his brother who had come for him, laid down on his bed and felt a drop splash on his forehead, looking up he found Jessica on the ceiling and burning in the flames that engulfed her, left screaming for her - Dean came back to drag him out of the house.So you can see how mentally scarred this family is, pitch them against the dark forces of this world and you have one heck of a show - to match one heck of a sound track! You hear the likes of Blue Oyster Cult, AC/DC and Metallica. A definite must see for ALL people though don't let little children watch unless you want to re/awaken their fear of the closet monster and boogeyman."
439,"Nicely written, stylishly filmed, borrowing from urban legend and the stock baddies of countless B and teen horror flicks.The boys themselves provide one level of tension, the straightforward sibling rivalry, uniting in the face of evil. They share a common history, obviously, but the fact that they've been apart for a while at the beginning of the series allows for their to be differences in perspective on issues etc.Like Cancerman in X-Files the father is there, in the background, keeping us wondering what his big secret is. There are hints of supernatural activity all around, just under the veneer of 'normal' that we're used to and by not having towns over run by zombies, vampires and random demons we don't have to do too much suspending of disbelief.I'm thoroughly enjoying the series and looking forward (hoping) there's a series 2. And 3. And that they don't decide to go all Buffy on us later ;)"
440,"i really enjoy this show, i wish it was two hours, it would be good big screen movies. the actors are wonderful they remind me of me and my younger brother. some of these stories have so much realism to them, they are very beleavable. i know i have lived some to certain exstent. life is weird sometimes, i am glad it is put on the screen and done in a way they do not look like nuts, thats got to be difficult doing this program to make the characters not look crazzy, i know it is all mostly fiction, but i tell you, you have to be getting some stories frome real life people,. is there a way someone can tell some things i know would make great shows for this program, i don't want a job or money, just point you to where you can get the stories yourself."
441,This show contains pretty boys and an amazing storyline. The show could not get any better at this point. It is my Tuesday night fetish along with Gilmore Girls. Supernatural is my main one. A few of my friends and I cannot wait for Tuesday to roll around thanks to this show! I can't wait for the new episode next Tuesday. I've been waiting for weeks now for it to come on. I can't wait to see what's going to happen next. My friends and I are patiently waiting until the 10th. I recommend this show to anyone and everyone who likes a bit of suspense! It keeps you on edge until the end. It explores the things that people aren't sure really exist and that is awesome!
442,"Bitc*h if those characters weren't added, the show would have been canceled in S3 like he was supposed to and we would never have had spn's s4, s5 , s8, s9, and s11 who were the best spn seasons mainly because of the added characters who added depth that spn hadn't in the first three seasons, without the added characters, the show was going to get more and more boring till cancellation , you idiots really believe spn would have lasted with two whiney brothers hunting ridiculous improbable monsters more than 4 seasons at best ?"
443,This show is the greatest love story ever! These two brothers are die hard fighters for each other and it is amazing! Im addicted :)
444,"Yes, my review may be a little far fetched to be 10/10, but I can say i've enjoyed every single episode of Supernatural. It's taken years if character and story building and each is beautiful. The dynamic between the characters grew even stronger, the stories were interesting and the sad moments grew even sadder.I adore this show and I can definitely say it's a favourite and a must watch. I have shed tears, laughed and got excited over all aspects of it. Its such a different show and I haven't found anything as like it."
445,"This is my first serial that I watched, even if it is long enough, I can say it is very good if you pay attention to each episode. I'm not saying all the episodes are good, but in almost every episode you find something new about the supernatural world, which makes me adore this series."
446,"Didn't mean to do it but was hooked after the first episode. Love the actors and the story, can't get enough of it."
447,I have been in love with this show since I saw the first episode. And it just got better with each season. I may sound byest but these characters really do their best to save the entire human race. You've got to love them for that.
448,"As everything else, it has some stuff that aren't the way I wish they were, but this show is honestly amazing and my favourite."
449,"Supernatural . Supernatural is the one and only uniquest show among the unique , the show that will take your mind off whatever you're feeling , the context , the rules of the supernaturalworld it is so realistic they actually got most of their lore from the Qur'an and the bible and even more , 14 seasons and i've watched them over and over again and i would still do if , the worst concept about the show is , you have to wait 7 days episode to episode , that is just the kind of wait you cant shake off , you're too excited to see what happens next , and they always have new content , even characters yet the classics are always there like (ofcourse) sam and dean , the legend Castiel , Bobby Singer , and ofcourse .. Crowley , which i was so pis*ed that he left , mary winchester , john , Lucifer the devil himself , Michael the Archangel , its always so tempting to watch and you never get bored , I rate this the Number 1 show on the cw , cbs and whatever else , I rate this the Number 1 show in the World , and im just sure of it , personally i hope the show never ends. I could still watch it when im 50 i could still watch it when they're 60 , doesnt matter how old they are , just matters they keep going .

450,"You've probably seen all the comments here saying how it was way better in season 1-5. As someone that's been watching this show for a long time and actively follows every new episode I can agree.
Even though it had some great seasons even after the 5th season, it has gone on for too long. They kill off every character then bring them back which defeats the purpose. I sobbed when Bobby died. The episode was so well made and it was amazing. But now out of nowhere he's back but not really? Why bring him back at all? Introduce new characters instead.
As for the horror part, this show is more like a drama with horror than having something actually scary. The oldest episodes had a more scary vibe to them. Other than that I don't think there's anything scary in there since most creatures are humanized.
Lastly, people praise a lot of characters like Castiel, even though he doesn't bring much to the story as he used to. The reason he hasn't been killed off is because a lot of fans love Misha Collins.
There are also a lot of filler episodes where almost all of them are the same. They hunt something but it's a different creature mostly.
Poor writing of female characters. Most of them come off as annoying because they try too hard to be strong or quirky. But this seems like a global thing so I look past it. Once you encounter Claire you will see what I'm talking about."
451,"Just awsome thats it
I love to watch this for ever
I dont want this serie never end"
452,"Always entertaining, always fresh love the cast.the Scooby animation show was cool very cool.JENSON AND JARED YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.LOVE THE WINCHESTER'S.. KEEP IT GOING"
453,A wonderfull show just 10/10 worth of watch 👍👍👍👍.
454,Most show good for a few seasons and you lose intrest butt this show keeps entertaining
455,One of the best shows ever made! A few episodes are weak but overall excellent!
456,"Best tv series ive ever watched , absolutely love it"
457,Wev grown with the characters over the years and each season that passes by i love them even more... i wish for infinity seasons...with the talented and great actors ... Gr8 Job
458,"Honestly, I wasn't sure I was going to like the show before I started watching it, but five minutes into the first episode, I had fallen in love with it. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are incredible actors that have kept viewers hooked for over a decade, and the addition of Misha Collins as the angel Castiel made the show more intriguing and shook things up. The show teaches about family and nevering giving up, which helped me through tough times. If your a fan of the Supernatural and paranormal, or just looking for a really great show to binge, Supernatural is definitely for you."
459,Excellent series. You will connect with the family dynamics of the Winchester's and the deep love hate relationships that spring from standing together in all things.
460,"Why is Supernatural still popular after more than a decade on air? It has everything that a fan could hope for: dashing heroes, great villains, love stories, family, great special effects, great stories, comedy, horror, drama and so much more."
461,"I love this show with all my heart and soul I watch a lot of tv and this is something I can always go back and watch
And befour I no it I'm 1-2 seasons in and it's a well spend day"
462,"I have been watching this show since the beginning and I love that it is based on two brothers trying to get their family back together, while hunting down monsters and saving people, as well, as saving the world in later seasons. I love that this show keeps you at the edge of your seat no matter what is going on, thanks to the horror and suspense part of the show. I love that it also shows that family doesn't always get along and that family isn't always blood related. I recummend this show for everyone that loves family shows/horror/suspense and great music!!!"
463,"This show remains strong in spite of its age.
Or perhaps it's having the lengthy production experience that makes it so good on a budget limited by being aired on CW.Unfortunately no spin off is (yet?) scheduled to expand the SPN universe into a second hour, but fans were promised at SDCC that the Wayward Sisters characters would be featured in the s14 eps.So many stories to tell & only 20 eps this year!!The brothers, portrayed by Jensen Ackles & Jared Padalecki, are once again joined by Misha Collins in a struggle of good over evil.
Newcomer Alex Calvert continues on as new character, Jack.
All are interesting, capable actors.Supporting cast is uniformly strong & SPN has brought back some fan favorites.Anyone who hasn't seen Supernatural yet might find jumping in at s14 a bit daunting...there is a build up of lore.
However, the fandom is welcoming & binge watching prior seasons isn't unheard of. (Yep. Even when there are that many eps every year.)Outstanding, quirky show that 
punches above its weight."
464,This show is just awesome it has a great plot and great characters
465,"Whatever night Supernatural is airing that year, it's my favorite night! I pray to God it doesn't end any time soon. Normally I'm a chicken and hate anything scary, but it grows on you quick!! Smallville used to be my favorite, but now it's a definite second. Sam and Dean or Jared and Jensen are the perfect match!! Please don't end anytime soon!!! Seriously!!"
466,"The best show in years!!! Perfect for those that like something thats different, thrilling and filled with adventure of different kinds!!"
467,"Agreed that its a very specific form of genre that some may not find interesting or understand, but its amazing for those that do!! A perfect fiction that fans wish was not!! The beauty and fun of loving characters that no one thought was possible!!"
468,"Amazing TV show, watch it :) Enjoy it :) With popcorn, cuz ya kno, popcorn is noice :) and uhhhh give it a 10/10 for effects :)"
469,I love this show and its amazing and ive gotten like 3 friends in the fandom and im watching it as i type this and wearing a trench coat

471,"The title is ""Supernatural"" (yea... that supernatural)
as most of the imagination. Featuring infinite and much more
A brief summary, ""Best TV Series Ever. Even if build to 100 season I will follow."""
472,This series is just awesome the way they develop the characters is just dope.
473,This is an amazing show and I never lose interest!
474,Awesome series!! Watched hundreds of times and never gets boring!
475,"One of the best shows which touched my heart and the emotions never going over the board.Though I was looking out for a horror flick, I ended up carried away by the Winchester Brothers .The chemistry between the brothers is just perfect. Jared and Jensen brought the characters alive. The USP of Supernatural is the writing ,characterisation and performance. None of the characters is left with a lose end. Kudos to the creator Eric Kripke.."
476,"I'm pretty critical when it comes to shows and even if I like a show there's usually several things I dislike or annoy me about that show BUT not Supernatural. 13 years now and the show is still fresh, amazing, well written, well acted, etc.The cast is wonderful and despite all the heavy tones of the show they still manage to keep it light by throwing the odd 'light' episode in there which is one of the secrets to it's long success I think. To be able to carry on a major story arc/plot line but also take time out completely from that and do something different. The Scooby Doo episode? Common! That was brilliant! Really guys - 13 years and I hope you're on for another 13 years. Was glad to hear that season 15 is most likely as good as confirmed now. Thank you for all the great shows. Supernatural rock!"
477,Loved it soooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!! Fantastic show would recommend to binge watch indefinitely on netflix!
478,"A few years ago, I watched the pilot episode and thought it's too horror-ish for me, so naturally (ironic choice of word) I didn't continue the show. However, a while after, I gave it another shot. And oh boy, am I glad I did!
I've watched a fair share of shows of all kinds of genres, but I'll have to say that this marks my top three. As the headline very subtly (note the sarcasm) gives away, I personally think Supernatural is the best TV-show about the supernatural out there thus far. Not only do I love the variety of genres and plots--the show's got a perfect balance of dark, funny and entertaining, at least in my opinion--I also really like the characters. The fact that it's on-going, with 13 seasons to this point, and I am still very much invested in the show, must be something quite special. It's one of those shows I find extremely hard to stop watching, and I've even rewatched a great handful of episodes--some more than twice. I would also like to point out the brilliant acting in the show, as well as how incredibly well the main characters, Sam and Dean, are played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles."
479,"Outstanding seasons with an outstanding cast, it doesn't even need reviews like mine, the amount of support, fans and seasons alone is enough to prove just how good this tv show really is, I've watched every single episode at least twice and now watching for a third time with my kids as they are new mini fans. An excellent, entertaining tv show"
480,I really like this show. The plots The storylines The chararctersLike Dean always says AWESOME
481,I've watched this series since the start. i love every single episode.
482,Supernatural has kept me hooked all the way from the start to now. Love it.
483,"My favorite show!! I love to watch supernatural episodes
BEST SHOW EVER"
484,"Most TV series have a better stories at the beginning and become boring at the end. Supernatural, to me, is the exact opposite. On the first season I wasn't really satisfied which is why I wanted to see more, and the more I follow the seasons, the more exciting the story is. Moreover, Supernatural does not really have a lot of coherence since it is more fantasy-based, but the author still managed to catch my eyes into Supernatural's world, to lose myself into Supernatural's world, by adding more and more suspense and exciting elements; I sometimes feel the emotions the writer wanted to show through his lines and by watching it filmed it made the emotions more authentic!"
485,"I start watch this show 1 year ago and now i am on 6th season.love it,love it.
only Boby is iritantne for me.
The show is smart,funny,sad,family
I like Dean character a lot.so pretty guy,strong and weak in same time,loyal,crazy brave.loves his brother so much,and hav soooìo much sense for humor.
Cass is my 2nd favorite,gentle,and funny with his seriosly face
Realy enoy in this show,and so happy couse i have to watch 7 season moree
love from Serbia and tnx Jansen and Jared"
486,"Love the show. However, while watching some of the convention videos on YouTube, I have to say that I wish actors would keep their political views off the stage. People care about the show itself and the characters. I think some people get the character and the actor portraying that character confused. I'm not sharing my political views or opinions with these actors and I don't care to hear theirs. Whether I agree or not with their views doesn't matter. Personally I just don't want to listen to anyone's political opinions. The interviews and the conventions are about the show so let's leave politics at the door. Will still be watching the show but I'm done with conventions and interviews with the cast."
487,I finished 9 seasons and in my opinion it's really better than the other horror shows and movies.
488,"An amazing show. I wasn't really sure about it at first and didn't like how slow it went, but at season 3 and 4 I concluded this is the best show I've ever watched, and I understood what purpose season 1 served. I absolutely love how supernatural has an actual plot unlike some other shows, and how everything comes together without a bit of disappointment. I also love that cast are close in real life. also the fact that it's more centered around family relationships and comedy instead of horror is fun to me."
489,"Love how the boys always put family first.they always look after each other and even look after some they should'nt.its always kept going with different characters and different versions of evil creatures.the special effects are always fab and you can't not love baby. it's always great that if you die there's a good chance that you won't stay dead, well that's if you're lucky enough."
490,"the best horror show ever. i mean this show is not just a show ,it is what we face in our everyday life. it is a story of brotherhood,hope,sacrifice,bravery,but above all it's a story of family i love this show and i hope that season 13 also comes and it's so difficult to wait for one episode every week i love dean(jensen ackles) sam(jared padlecki) please keep this show going on"
491,"I really like to watch for many years welcome. I always look forward to the next section. A very good days of winter recreation.The boys are always in a well. The current series brought back the atmosphere of the first seasons, and next to it there is also a long story. Overall, very well designed series. The mixing mysticism and faith is very cool."
492,"Why should you watch this show? Well, it's not only a good time waster, it's also fun and the characters will grow on you quick.Some seasons are darker and grittier than others with many likable villains, while others follow a 'monster of the week' premise.While it's difficult to get through a show with so many seasons, I guarantee you'll be entertained for weeks.Follow Dean and Sam (hunters) - who - kill, capture, exorcise various types of dark creatures.Werewolves, Witches, Vampires, Demons, Angels, Ghosts and more obscure monsters make an appearance on this show.I'm sure it has been brought up, but if none of these interest you, you'll more than likely not enjoy this show even with all it's other charms."
493,"Supernatural is one the best series ever made. It has everything you would want in a television show. Fantasy and real-life intertwined together. The characters make the show, which the acting is just right for the series. Not too gloomy or dramatic, and not too serious. It took a while for the main characters to find there footing with each other. By Season 3 you will actually believe they were actual brothers and this was real life somewhere in the world. Rooting for their victory every episode. If I were you, I would take a weekend, buy a pizza, start at Season 1 and take the crazy roller coaster ride with Sam & Dean."
494,"Two cool supernatural ghost hunter brothers riding a Chevrolet Impala car what could go wrong...? Vampires, werewolf, zombies, monsters, ghosts, demons, angels, hell, end of the world, gods and what not? Of course there are better episodes and some not so good but all in all this is one perfect show to watch on a Friday evening or when ever the hell you are watching it!WE NEED THIS! 8.6/10Perfect acting from Jared and Jensen! 10/10First episodes will brand a memory in my brain forever... It was the first TV series for me when you got to experience a duo with brothers hunting supernatural things! Epic-"
495,"SUPERNATURAL... The name is enough to make your TV world amazing.. Believe me guys if u watch it..this show is going to b part of your life..you won't b able to resist yourself... This is just the show every fantasy lover should look for... Extremely thrilled storyline.. If you want to know any fantasy ,folklore creature you will find it on SUPERNATURAL...lets talk about the characters.. Dean(Jensen) omg,he's just awesome, funny.. I mean he could b the main reason for the large fan-base this show is getting.. Then Sam (Jared) is also good.. They actually are bothers on screen or off screen... Now the next favourite character on my list is Crowley.. I mean u won't find often a villain with whom u are going to fall in love with.. His excellent way of dialogue delivery is just awesome..Dean Sam castiel best trio ever... And who could forget Bobby.. This show jus got its 11th installment.. But you will never get tired of this show... My recommendation go for it...I m sure you will enjoy it thoroughly... If u could get this message to Jensen please... ""Dean I just love the character"" u r so funny..."
496,"I have watched & re-watched every single episode of this series. This show has a massive following, and is, in my opinion, THE best show on TV. But then, it's more than just a TV show to fans like myself. The actors on the show are so warm and welcoming to the fans in real life. They are not your ""typical Hollywood type"" actors. They are down to Earth, and always kind. They are funny and loving, not to mention, very humble people. That is why Supernatural has such a huge fan-base. The show itself makes you laugh, cry, scream, get angry, but most importantly, feel love. This show captures your every emotion, and always leaves you wanting more. To me, it never disappoints! This show really delivers!"
497,"Somewhere here I read that this show had an unusual fan base for a fantasy/horror show as most of the viewers were female. That must have been written by a gay woman or a blind person. Heck, even the angel is hot. There is more fantasy going on in the heads of women watching this than there is on the actual show. However, in addition to having 2 of the hottest guys on TV, Supernatural has a lot going for it on it's own merits. Good special effects, great story telling, interesting characters and superior acting. The relationship between the brothers is very intricate. The show also has a good balance between ongoing story lines and stand alone episodes. Excellent use is made of monster mythology, folklore and even religious beliefs. My only complaint is that they should have more story lines that require Sam and Dean to take their shirts off."
498,"This is a show that until recently I followed religiously and just like any devout disciple my faith was shaken in the later seasons and unfortunately I have not watched most of season 9 or 10 (aside from the glorious musical episode) yet but I am on a re-watch of the earlier seasons so I plan to work my way up again chronologically. and at the time of writing I am currently on season 5 which all fans know is the best season of the show as it is unleashes upon us what it has been building up for the previous four seasons which is of course the apocalypse. I felt compelled to enter a review because I wished to express my feelings on what I consider to be the sharpest written show I have ever watched. First of all, this is a show filling to the brim of pop culture references some subtle and others not so much ( the groundhog day episode springs to mind in which Dean dies over and over again in an increasingly bizarre and hilarious manner) which culminates in heroin like bliss for any hard core Film & TV junkie . To further develop my fan boy enthusiasm of the show the two main characters, brothers Dean & Sam Winchester have the most compelling relationship as they rid the countryside of all manner of supernatural foe. There are many times throughout the season where they come into conflict and it is a testament of the performances of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki that the show never feels stale or contrived. Although there are weak episodes especially in the first season and later seasons particularly in the show's monster of the week episodes it is easily forgivable as this can be expected by a 22 episode per season schedule. At the end of the day it is the lovable characters and overarching story arcs that keep us from being tired of the show. Now I mentioned earlier that I was shaken by the later seasons and what I mean by that is just season 8. From what I heard from friends and colleagues is that the show improves which I am delighted to hear as I would gladly admit that this is my favourite TV show. My issue with season 8 was the stale monster of the week episodes and the storyline involving Sam in the first half is dull to say the least. Also the man of letters storyline is utter tripe as it rearranges the Winchesters family history yet again which to me is unoriginal and a sign that the show has run out of ideas. However I still would not say it's terrible as refreshing new characters such as Benny kept me watching. I look forward to my re-watch of the show as I get to catch up on all the latest adventures of Sam & Dean. I am not going to go into any detail of the plot points of the show as I could write a thesis due to the many many different story lines that pop their head up during the course of the series, however I would recommend this show to anyone whether you're a hard core film buff or a casual viewer who is looking for something to watch to unwind after a hard day at the office."
499,"This is a show more for an older audience rather than a younger audience although I started watching this when I was young. This show is a great controlled mixture of genres, you have that slight Sci-Fi/Fantasy element to it as well as a Horror element. The genre usually depends upon a certain episode (though as you can guess gore and horror is frequent!). I can't fault this show as such. I only gave a 9 because I feel that everything can be improved upon, not because I think it's bad (I don't!). I do feel that some episodes lack more than others but I never have got bored when watching. I'm in the UK and so I am behind in the series (Currently airing season 9 on e4) I also don't have Sky which is a bigger shame. So far, I really like where the story and plot is going. I think this show is a MUST watch for those who like these sorts of genres and I do feel you get hooked quite quickly with it as the first series offers different episodes which I feel caters for different people. (Don't watch if you get too scared at things!) :) Shannon"
500,"I must say supernatural is the most addictive TV series in my life. This one show contains all action,drama,fantasy,horror,emotion,COMEDY ...etc etc. I wish this show never ends. At first when i started watching it was not that interesting till second season. But after completing season 3-4 , it became kind of daily dose i was kind of addicted to it. the day i came upto the last episode air till date i.e. season 10 e15 . now i feel like without my soul, lol like sam. Dean is my fav. character, then comes castiel,bob and then sam.idont like sam much though. because he is kind of mean,selfish and arrogant.CROWLEY i must say even he made me like demons too. GOD BLESS THE SUPERNATURAL TEAM ! keep the show going always !"
501,"This is one of the few shows that Warner Bros. had created before turning into the CW and is probably one of the major reasons that this show is phenomenal. ""Supernatural"" is the epitome of the sci-fi/fantasy genre which is not something for everyone, but if you're into that genre, then you will love this show.The first few seasons are the highlights of this show and the season 5 finale leaves you breathless. The newer episodes are not as outstanding as the previous seasons, but are still great. I highly recommend this show for anyone who is looking for a good, long running series to watch because ""Supernatural"" is, in only one word, amazing."
502,I have not missed a single episode of Supernatural. I even purchased all the DVD box sets and waiting for the next season to come out.It is great seeing how the guys change as the show progresses and the vast differences between light and dark. There have been some odd and quirky episodes but at least you can never say it is boring - always changing things up a bit.The only frustrating thing is the breaks between shows during a season. There can be weeks or longer breaking up the season.So glad this show did not end at season 7 like it was originally planned. Can't wait for more.
503,"It may not have the strongest viewer numbers, but 'Supernatural' is nothing to be messed with. Anybody craving action, gore and ancient lore is in luck when they choose to watch this show! The entire series is centered around brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki), who travel the United States, fending off unholy creatures of lore and legend of every kind. From werewolves and vampires, to ghosts and ghouls, angels and demons, and even Lucifer himself, 'Supernatural' has literally done it all.The seriousness of baby brother Sam contrasts perfectly with the bad ass, care-free attitude of older brother Dean, providing a hot-and-cold, Heaven-and-Hell, good-cop, bad-cop kind of relationship. The fact that Dean is cursed to Hell early in the series sets the platform for an extraterrestrial war on a scale like the Earth has never seen before.By Season 4 Dean has been cursed to Hell, and only by the assistance of an angel by the name of Castiel (Misha Collins) does he escape. It's the absolute perfect show with a little bit of everything for everybody. Be warned, however. It is NOT a television show for young children. Nobody under the age of 15 should be permitted to see it, for the sheer terror of the plot alone."
504,I've been obsessed with this show from day 1. I absolutely love this show!!! I'm beyond excited there will be a season 11. Yes!!!!! :) <3 I'm seen all episodes. And I'm re-watching from the beginning a 3rd time. Watching this show never gets old. I hope there's 4-5 more years! I have a few favorite shows & this show is definitely my absolute top favorite show ever.I'm so grateful that this show started. It has so many different stories & twists. Many situations that no other show could even get away with. And supernatural did....and they're doing an amazing job at it!! :) <3 There's so many things I've learned from this show. Family & love is what's really important in this world.
505,"If you're a big fan of the supernatural, this show is the perfect fit for you. This series is an epic of two brothers (Sam and Dean) destined to be hunters who would do anything for each other (not excluding selling their souls).It will take you on emotional roller coaster as well as give you a slight fright if watching in the dark. Any supernatural being that you can think of is covered in this epic series from witches and ghost to vampires and shape-shifters each episode will surely keep you entertained. I would advise anyone who decides to watch this series on Netflix to have clear schedule b/c once you start watching its hard to stop!"
506,"Oh Sammy & Dean what absolute heartthrobs! When this first came out in the UK I was only young and saw a few episodes and was really scared because of that it put me off watching it (It's not really appealing to a little girl of the age off 6) however as I grew up Supernatural really grew on me and I went out on a limb and bought the entire 1-8 box set. I started watching season one and really liked it luckily I had started it in the schools time off and I literally stayed in for weeks on end watching the episodes my social life was non existent! I love Dean and Sam the chemistry they have as brothers is unreal and so believable you'd think they was brothers in real life. Each episode has a different something and is really exciting and gripping. The was always some big plot twist at the end of the seasons that made you gagging to watch the next season! If you are a fan of the paranormal, supernatural & things that go bump in the night Supernatural is definitely for you."
507,"I have fallen utterly, irrevocably in love with this television show. It's a new thing, just a few months old, this love, and I don't completely understand why it happened, but here I am. More obsessed with this show than I was with Buffy, more than I was with Highlander before that. There are bad episodes. There are entire seasons that are a bit questionable. But it's made by people who are remarkably clever and delightfully strange and I'll be arranging my life to watch the new episodes as long as they're on, and reading fanfiction and going to conventions for the rest of my life. I'm that obsessed. It's slightly alarming, but it makes me so very, very happy."
508,"Supernatural is one of, if not the best supernatural series currently airing. The series follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester in their mission to rid the world of evil creatures and bring peace to where it is needed. Along the way the brothers find themselves troubled by past problems and future risks that stack up to be something they have not faced before. All of this adds up to an emotional ride of where to go next, what to do, and tests of faith. This is the perfect series for anyone who loves the paranormal world and all of its beings. Along with that comes the amazing emotional bond the brothers have with one another and a series of stories that shows that the paranormal world can be entwined with humor, drama and depth. Along with the amazing story, comes great actors. Lead roles like Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Mischa Collins and Mark A. Shepard makes the series even more worth watching, as character depth, sarcasm and emotional depth can be felt between the cast. If you want to catch up on a series you have not watched before, this series is something everyone will love as it combines horror, drama, romance and comedy, perfectly with extremely well written stories and character interactions."
509,"Supernatural is my favorite show ever! My mom started watching it a few years ago and now we both love it (and Jensen Ackles)! I love everything about the show. The characters (and actors/actresses) are hilarious!The show can be funny, depressing, suspenseful, whatever.. it is awesome! I love all the songs in it, all the characters, all the actors/actresses, all the episodes, all the bloopers, everything.I don't know what else I should say except that I love this show, and I could watch it all day! For my birthday I am asking for a bracelet that says ""PUDDING"" on it and a girls Dean Winchester-inspired outfit that I will wear on the Supernatural anniversary!"
510,"Supernatural is, hands down, my favorite TV show of all time. I started watching it back in 2012 when someone recommended it to me, as I'm a gigantic horror fan, and although gets less scarier by the season, the amazing plot replaces it.Other reasons on why you should watch Supernatural are the characters. We'll start off with the main characters. Dean Winchester (my personal favorite) at first, seems like a cocky, bloodthirsty womanizer with a devil-may-care attitude, he's hilarious, and has amazing taste in music. In reality, he's a very kind, compassionate, and loyal man with good intentions.Sam Winchester is almost the complete opposite, he's kind, empathetic, and extremely intelligent, but sometimes shows arrogance and stubbornness, and although he sometimes makes the wrong choices, he is always stitched back together with good intentions.Castiel is introduced in season 4, and although first perceived as a fierce angel with no emotion whatsoever, turns out to be very awkward, shy, has a lack of knowledge for pop culture, and has very uncanny humor. And in spite of making the wrong choices a lot, he's very loyal to those he cares about, and eventually becoming the Winchesters' closest friend.From other recurring protagonists like Bobby Singer and the Harvelles, to the big bads like Crowley, every single character has their own special twists that are definitely worth watching.It also helps that the actors are amazing at what they do, no matter what crappy situations the writers throw their characters in, they always give a good performance no matter what.I would have given it a 10/10, but obviously, not every show is perfect, sometimes the show has stupid story arcs, boring filler episodes, and some seasons that are not as great as the others (and the horror that was the supposed spin-off), but it's a good show otherwise and you should definitely try and watch it! (Best seasons, in my opinion, are 1, 4, 5, and 8. 7 & 9? not so much. But nevertheless, I hope season 10 will be a good one, but no matter what, I'm sticking with the show anyways.)"
511,"First I have to say I am totally obsessed of this show, and even started to watch it with a knife near by me (just in case). Sam, Dean, Cas, all of them - they can't be better. And then are coming slow episodes and failures which I can't pass. First of all - pentagram in all religions is bad symbol, satanic, evil, dark. It can't be used for protection, every idiot knows that, This is the first miss. Second one - in the episode where Sam and Dean were returned to collect phoenix ash Dean was injected with adrenalin right in vain. It never, I repeat - never must me injecting in vein, that can kill the man immediately, it can make the heart literally to explode. Another thing about symbols and their meanings. I can't remember the season, but remember the episode, Cas engraved symbols on the ribs of the buys for protection against demons. First one on the top of the sternum was Satan symbol. I am not a fan of occultism but I know pretty good what is the meaning of it, and I think it's just a joke with all of us who watch to blame us on that way. OK, up there with symbols. What about the last seasons? What is that, some pensioner show? What about jokes between the two of them, what about driving with the Impala, the rock music, the thrill? With every episode I watch i feel stuffed. You are about to kill this show and the passion of it. Nobody if them meet a girl anymore, or anyone new. All of their friends are dead and nobody new is coming. It's not normal, it's not natural! In first two seasons boys only blame each others and read books. At first it takes two seasons of Sam, Dean and their father to kill one single demon, now they find the worst creatures and kill them in one episode, and go back blaming each other. Stop doing that with Supernatural, if there's nothing more to say - just keep silence and leave it with good memories. Don't ruin something that so many people (including me) love."
512,"I don't really know where to begin with this show. I would say this is probably one of the best made shows on television, definitely in my top 5. The fact that they can produce 25 episode seasons is freaking insane. Considering the quality of each episode and the fact that there's only 32 weeks a year means they must be working some serious mojo just to keep on the air. As a visual effects artist myself i can say post production takes sometimes months, even years, so the fact that they cover both production AND post in less than 2 weeks is astounding.Despite the fact that it airs on the CW, supernatural is NOT your typical CW show. There is no cheesy drawn out clichés, no failed attempts at sex appeal and they don't try to make it all gushy and relatable for a female audience or mindlessly butcher it just to make it appealing for a certain demographic. Maybe the only thing about this show that seems remotely CW-esque is the hot actresses, but unlike the rest of CW, they can actually act. (thank god) Sam and Dean do have their fair share of swooning fangirls, but i don't blame em, they are pretty bada$$.The story lines for this show are awesome. It gets REALLY good right around the 4th and 5th season and the show gradually changes from episodic to plot rich continuous rising action. The 1st and second season are mostly exposition, introducing the universe Sam and Dean live in and the kinds of monsters they'll be facing for the rest of the show. By the end of the 3rd season, it becomes a hell of a lot more than just monsters and supernatural crap, you see a lot more of the ""bigger plan"" and there's a lot less discovery of the supernatural food chain and a lot more disruption of it. In seasons 1 and 2 they're just beginning to meet demons, but by the 3rd season they're gearing up for an all out war.What i love about this show is its complex but well realized mythology, and the fact that its not just coming out and saying ""all the stories are true"" but instead ""here are all the stories, now we have to find out which ones are true, and which ones are just fiction"". Oftentimes Sam and Dean have to figure out which spells or Latin incantations work, whats going to kill a monster and whats just going to tick them off. Its also got a well developed continuity, they don't change the monsters just because its convenient to the plot.There are some really well made ""monster politics"" as i like to call it, not all of them get along, some are elitist, some of them feed on each other and some of them team up to kill each other. Monsters mostly stay hidden because otherwise hunters will find them and kill them, demigods either hate humans because they stopped worshiping them or are OK with the new regime, everyone is terrified of angels but they mostly leave humans alone and each group has their own leaders who are usually just more powerful versions of their underlings, which they can obey or not. Its basically a giant petri dish of all gods volatile creations, who basically just up and vanished and left them to bicker amongst themselves. The visual effects are awesome and i love watching the special features because its some pretty great inspiration for my own effects. They patented the black eyed demon look thats been copied by many shows and movies, and they've got a different stylization for every supernatural entity they come across. They use a combination of CG and makeup effects, which ends up much more convincing then if they had just used one or the other.The soundtrack is very good, using some great classic rock to set the mood, and they usually use Kansas' ""carry on my wayward son"" to paint a pretty epic recap before the season finale.This show peaks around season six or seven, but even in season nine i would say it has not ""gotten old"". Mark Shepards performance in the last season finale was honestly some of the best acting i've seen in a long time. They've even invented their own creatures like the leviathan (ill described by the bible) or the ""jefferson starships"" (hybrid creatures ridiculously named by Dean). The show starts out with a lot of the villains being terrifying or downright creepy, but gets less scary as it goes on mostly because the creatures get easier to kill. This show would make a great video game because its constantly introducing more badåss, more challenging villains, leaving the old ones easier to beat as just lowly foot soldiers. I've been re-watching the earlier seasons and it seems i forgot how hard it was just to kill one stinking demon back in season 2.My favorite episodes are undoubtedly the trickster episodes (may he rest in peace) and even with its darker tone the show knows how to have fun. The TV land episode was pretty much like an episode of children's hospital and the wishing well episode... well lets face it, a giant manically depressed teddy bear is pretty friggin hilarious.The one thing i would change about this show is the constant heart to hearts between Dean and Sam, they get a little old but they seem a lot more genuine than other shows that have tried it. There's definitely a chemistry between the cast and especially the boys and Bobby, who i've grown to love as if he were my own uncle and not just a fictional TV character.Basically, keep on doing what you're doing, and don't let the folks over at CW change you. You know they'll just butcher your show if they got the chance."
513,"First of all,I would like to note that the very first time I watched Supernatural,I was overwhelmed by how complex the action and the storyline was.Despite being a little bit disappointed that the first few episodes did not relate very much one to another,I watched it further.The most exciting thing about the series is the mysterious death of Sam and Dean's mother,and this is the main reason I watched the show,to see how chasing her killer would end. In my opinion,each character is individualized carefully,with dean being, in my vision,the stereotypical American,as he eats a lot of junk food, loves doing nothing but hunting and repairing his precious car. While Dean dropped out of school intentionally, Sam was rather hesitant in doing it, and this results in Sam appearing to be more rational and intelligent.Not only once were the two brothers mistook for a couple, fact that bothers both of them equally. As I stated earlier, the initial plot is catchy, and what I am going to write further may contain some spoilers, because otherwise it would be hard for me to state exactly what I think. As their father hides from them for their good being, Dean is very protective of Sam, and a family friend, Bobby acts like a father for them, and likes to call himself their uncle. The world of hunters is very diverse, consisting of both men and women of all kinds, and so is the world of monsters.While some of the creatures are said to have existed in our world (werewolves, vampires, zombies, dragons) there are also some that at least I have not heard of before, like a shape shifter or leviathan. To my mind, the way those monsters are presented, hunted, and the fact that some of them may be killed only in certain ways is a new and very exciting concept. The plot thickens later on, and all I want to say is that it becomes more and more exiting and addictive, I just cannot wait to seeing the next episode, which was postponed after the new year eve. Were I to draw a conclusion, Supernatural is a series that surpasses all its predecessors, with a complicated but easy to understand plot, and more important, very realistic characters and events. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is not bothered by seeing a little blood."
514,"I really miss Bobby's character. He pulled the show together. Stood between the two protagonists. Leveled the playing field. Settled things when Sam and Dean reached impasses. He's sorely missed.Sam's a bit melodramatic this season. He needs to get back in the saddle quickly. Dean's right. He can't give up or give in, as it were.Lots of Deities all over the place. Everyone's on a first name basis, which is fine as long as the audience doesn't fall off the wagon. It's still a supernatural drama , and as such, should remain faithful to the intense, the unexpected and the truly frightening.Highly recommended."
515,"This is an awesome show! I don't know if Kripke ever reads these reviews, but if he does: I think a lot of people would really enjoy an appearance of the 12 Olympian Gods (Aphrodite, Hera, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Hermes, Poseidon, Zeus, and Apollo) in the show. It's clear in the show that the Winchesters deal with mythical creatures from all different cultures across the world, but we haven't seen any Greek Gods so far and I believe it would add a powerful show of diversity in the outline of their world. Especially since the show has already incorporated the personifications of multiple different gods; Norse, Hindu, and Pagan just for starters. The presence of all twelve Olympian gods together could make for a very interesting and flexible turn of events."
516,"We love Supies!!!! The show wouldn't be the same without Jensen Ackles - Jared Padelecki we could live without.. I would recommend to anyone. WHY DOES SAM NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING. seriously. Dean saves him EVERY TIME. I like old man Bobby Jenkins. He's a good hunter. I like him better than the dad. Even though Jeffrey Dean Morgan is amazing. Anyway. Serious time, though. This is really a great show. It is vaguely reminiscent of Buffy and Charmed - in a really good way - but with much better looking leading men. The phrase ""there is (insert monster) lore in every culture"" is used way too often, though. Also, I had never heard of the word ""wasted"" being used to mean killed before. But still GREAT. I carry a torch for this show. If you know what I mean."
517,"I've been watching Supernatural since it began. I am thrilled the show has gone from strength to strength with intelligent story lines, action, comedy and some scares along the way. Dean and Sam Winchester, two brothers in search of their missing father and we learn when Dean tells his younger brother, Dad's on a hunting trip and hasn't been home in days' that the 'hunting' isn't the kind of hunting one would automatically assume!The cast are amazing - from Season 1-3 Jensen Ackles(Dean)and Jared Padalecki(Sam) have been awe-inspiring as they tackled all kinds of stories with their constantly battling brothers in search of the monster responsible for the death of their mother. They have both died, and come back - Sam's death at the tail end of season two was short lived, Dean's deal with a crossroads demon meant he would have only 1 year and as promised, despite many twists and turns during a shortened S3 due to the writers strike - he ended up as a 'hell hounds chew toy'. Enter another spectrum to this multifaceted Supernatural world - Angelic and much swooned over, Castiel, played brilliantly by Misha Collins. Since the introduction of Collins (much like James Marsters in Buffy) this character has become a cast regular and a firm fan favourite. There is little doubt that Collins, Ackles and Padalecki are all VERY attractive, but none of them rest on those laurels. Each has a superb grasp of dismantling idolatry and acting their way through. A shout for Bobby Singer played with absolute brilliance by one Jim Beaver. Bobby provides some much needed grounding for both Dean and Sam Winchester, and often utilises his favourite word 'ejit' for both. Other notable performances and cameos - Stephen Williams as Rufus, Alona Tal, playing Jo and Samantha Ferris playing her mother, Ellen. Traci Dinwiddie as Pamela is amazing - whilst Mark Sheppard who enters the show in Season 5 is also very adept at his role. Season six is a masterpiece - the show always had a five year arc - but so successful had it been that Season 6 was inevitable and so it has turned out to be. Without giving too much away, the boys and their motley crew have averted the apocalypse, and the aftermath is proving some incredibly interesting fodder for the writers. The last episode watched 'The French Mistake' was a masterpiece - no it was really. I have yet to see one bad review and I've been looking. We're talking the boys being flung through a portal into another dimension and finding themselves in a television show called... yep! Supernatural. Inspired, brilliant, Sera Gamble is doing a fine job as show runner, with our Kripke-nite in the background. Season 8...9...10 would be a brilliant, please CW!"
518,"Supernatural has to be one of the most thrilling and entertaining shows on the Tivo. Starring Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the older take no prisoners brother with a comic wit, and Jared Padalecki, the younger more compassionate brother.If you are a fan of urban legends, freaky monsters, and gruesome yet awesome special effects then you will enjoy this show. Not only are the guys easy on the eyes, but the acting is phenomenal and the plot never ceases to disappoint. I've been watching this show for years and not once have I found an episode that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The combination of brotherly love, hilarious moments, scary monsters, and deep thought; makes this show truly one of a kind.I've personally introduced this show to guys and gals alike and every one of them are hooked. If that doesn't give you an urge to watch Supernatural, then you'd clearly have to lack the curiosity every other faithful viewer possesses."
519,"By the time i'm writing this review supernatural is already mid-way through its 6th season, and i can't express how much i'm missing this show right now. I watched one episode of this show from season 4 on my TV network and i was completely unknown about this great show. So i started downloading this TV sitcom from Season 1 and the rest is history.Supernatural is one of the best Horror mixed Action & Comedy TV sitcoms out-there. I haven't missed a single episode of this Sitcom and since its beginning.On the Acting corner, Jensen Ackels is perfect for the role of DEAN and Jared is Perfect for SAM. The chemistry between them is simply mind blowing with a Special touch of their Hunter friend BOBBY & A Retired Angel CASTIEL, The shows gets more better.The Dark and grey Cinematography fits perfectly with the Horror genre of the show. There are some moments in the season 1 & 2 which are really spooky. McG and Robert Singer has done their job well to create a perfect TV Sitcom with a Mixture of Horror, Emotions, Comedy & Action. Supernatural is definitely a Hit with its never ending story of Apocalypse"
520,"This show is not perfect. Nothing is. But it is about as near as you can get...all through the first season we had Sam and Dean-who both play difficult parts and do it pretty damn well- and the whole monster of the week storyline which set the scene and I think really worked. It showed them dealing equally with the monsters and their own feelings, as well as the family saga idea. The plots thickened in the second season where we had the sense of a real epic battle coming, far fewer monster of the week episodes and those that were there were usually connected somehow. I have to say I didn't like season 3 so much, through an old prejudice that it didn't feature Sam so much although it was a really good season, but in season 4 the old spooky horror stuff was widened into a huge field of good vs evil, angel and devils and none of that angels are unconditionally good rubbish-I'm a Christian and I can still say that. In season 5 we went into the apocalypse which wasn't that well done but you can see why-they were still in its early days and there was still a chance to stop it, effectively. The thing that got me about this season was how all the plot lines were tied up and even just Sam and Dean's brotherly relationship was put into the context of the age old Michael-Lucifer battle. I call that the end of a story and started again with season 6...which I will reserve judgement on for now. Basically the makers of Supernatural have mixed horror, emotion, the awesomeness of the epic apocalypse struggle, and based it all around two characters who by this point ARE their roles and perfect for them. They weren't chosen for looks-Jared Padalecki portrays 'college- boy, sweet kid with an evil destiny turned harder and desperate by the pain of his world' Sam Winchester to the point of perfection, and Jensen Ackles is great as Dean too though I'm not going to obsess over him-sorry, Deangirls. Looking back at season 1 in the context of all that has happened since is amazing. This show has become a really big part of my life and I don't get how people that are OK with horror and sci-fi can think it lacking. It has everything. The original idea was fascinating, dark and creepy, and they blew it all up into something absolutely mind blowing. How can you go from ghosts and demons to the rise of the devil? It's not something just anyone could do. Looking at it objectively it is an amazing piece of film and storytelling and it's like nothing I have ever seen before."
521,"Supernatural is one of those shows that comes around every 20 to 30 years and is a true hit and has a real cult following. And for very good reason. The story arc throughout the seasons and for every season individually is very strong and intelligent. It has great writing and has awesome views on the popular monsters of our culture, Vampires, Wearwolves and such. The two leads, Sam and Dean Winchester are great characters, really well-written and outstandingly acted by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was perfect casting for their father John Winchester. I don't want to give too many details away for the viewers coming into the show but Sam and Dean are brothers who were raised in the life of hunting monsters and evil creatures because their mother was killed by a demon when they were very young. The show starts out with Sam out of hunting and at college, it doesn't last long though as Dean comes to him and tells him their father has gone missing on a hunting mission and he needs help finding him. There are many twists and turns throughout the course of the series, the relationship between Sam and Dean is the true highlight of the show. There's also plenty of great action and suspense as well as hilarious humor. If you haven't seen the show yet, please pick it up and give it a shot, you will not be disappointed. The show is a well deserved 10 out of 10 because it has all the ingredients and making of a great show."
522,"I'll start reviewing the title by saying that, until Supernatural, I wasn't what people would call ""a fan of the type"", but rather the opposite. And perhaps this is the only ghost story that I will ever watch with such a great interest. First thing that caught my eye, since I'm a girl, was, obviously, Dean Winchester, whose looks can't let anyone down. So the premise was: pretty brothers get back together driven by the same motive, although their personalities are completely mismatch. Pump it up with some action, ghost busting kind of thing, and you get a show, regular, the kind of thing you would watch when you get bored. But it wasn't the case, and what came, I didn't expect. I watched through the first season, and as the plot developed, I saw I had my premises wrong. Very wrong. The characters are likable and quite realistic, and I soon came to realize that, leaving aside the adrenaline-pumped action, it was a story that went deeper than just that. Their motives are one unique feature. While most characters have ""heroic"" reasons, like responsibillity, duty, Sam and his father are driven by revenge, while Dean is the so called ""perfect soldier"", whose main motives are to keep his family safe. At some points the story is so impressive that it literally brings tears to your eyes. Then there are the witty replies and funny moments that break off the tension, as if the show itself told you not to take it too seriously. At this chapter is worth mentioning Dean's funny monologue in the episode ""Yellow Fever"". Although this may sound incredible, but I found certain similarities between Supernatural and another show I really enjoy: House M.D. They both are basically about solving cases; both of them have similar structure: they start off by showing what's wrong and where, the intro, then the ""team"" that tries to solve the case. But Supernatural brings an extra sense of humanity,that I have rarely see in the movie industry. All in all, I give this a whole-heartedly 10, and that's only because they made the scale go so little."
523,"I wasn't able to watch this series when it came out as my schedule didn't leave much time for TV. Then I recently bought the complete first 3 seasons after I heard about the good reviews.I was incredibly surprised as I didn't think it would be as good as the X-Files. In some ways Supernatural is the better series overall as the running plot gets more interesting and doesn't drag aspects of the storyline to the point of tedium or confusion.I'm intrigued by the twists and alternate view on angels and demons, which I didn't expect from a TV show. The other sub-plots are downright entertaining and I like how the producers of the show don't take things so seriously sometimes.I only just started watching volume one of season 5 and so far it does not disappoint. Go Sam and Dean... and Bobby... oh, and Castiel!"
524,"*****************SPOILERS******************The title I chose for this short review is not a blasphemous statement as many religious groups have hit out as this show...I feel the need to make that clear.But anyone who has watched this show must confess this is the most original take on a really really old story we have seen in years. Great character development in Ruby Azazel Alistair Castiel Meg Lucifer Gabriel/Trickster and their interaction with the main characters is sufficient to let us forget about Jared's absolutely horrible acting. All in all the only thing comparable to this show in true impact of the share magnitude of the story told, on Television in our life time was BSG. X-Files was close but as Supernatural has developed it has eclipsed X files. The truly original take on the fall happening now with Uriel instead of in time before, Gabriel himself turning his back on heaven, Angels and Demons needing human vessels and Lucifer and Michael/Jesus being brothers and God's first born for anyone who knows the Bible this is the most interesting and well told story in existence right now. But from a pure objective look. BSG is probably better written and Jared's ridiculous attempts at acting take Supernatural down a notch. But being someone who understands the Bible or at least has knowledge of the scriptures this is a personal favorite. Truly great story and absolutely original take on a very old story. The first episodes in season one and two very few are honestly important a few are but most are pointless after Supernatural really gets going. My advice watch Supernatural with the advice of someone who knows the story. Start from the Episode ""All hell breaks loose Part One"" at the end of Season two."
525,"I started watching this show when I accidentally downloaded it and had a feeling this could turn out to be a Buffy or Angel like show (shows I absolutely dislike).Boy, was I wrong! This show stunned me from the first episode! GREAT acting and sfx, that sums my feeling about this show up. The stories are mostly pacey, short horror stories involving anything from ghosts to demons. What this show does very well actually is to incorporate the emotions of the main characters, without making it a teen drama.I love the visuals and the music is great as well. Eric Kripke obviously loves the 80's soft-rock (Styx, Asia etc), but uses it in a very effective way to emphasize certain emotions; very well done.Overall I recommend this show to everyone that loves horror and action."
526,"This show is for everyone who enjoy good urban legend stories and suspense genre.I watched all the seasons in a month (they were that interesting) and i can say the following -the FIRST SEASON - was introducing !! (it was focused more on classic horror stories with some family theme in the background )-->recommend episode ""Provenance"" -the SECOND SEASON - was amazing !! (it put an accent on the family the unconditional love and passion for the job )--> recommend episode ""Tall Tales"",""what is and what should never be"",and ""All hell breaks loose1,2""(this whole season is perfect) -the THIRD SEASON - was intriguing !! (showed me more aspects of life,courage and dedication )---> recommend episode ""Mystery Spot"" -the FOURTH SEASON - was weird !! (here the things got a little strange,unusual even a little nervous )--->""In the beginning"",""Yellow Fever"",""After School Special"",""the monsters at the end of this book"" -the FIFTH SEASON - so far is anxious (it can blow you from side to side,and won't ever do anything you expect )-->recommend episode ""The End""(so far :))) )It is strange how the brothers bond is much more stronger than sisters (at least in this show). Every character will surprise you,will make you love him/her,hate him/her and forgive or stay mad at him/her in the end. You might notice that every episode i recommended is different from the others.They are special and they offer something that breaks the monotony in the show.The humor is awesome,the music is great !! Lets pray for a season 6 !!!"
527,"I have seen 24, Prison Break, Sopranos, Lost, The Shield, Dexter and all the great TV shows but for me Supernatural is the most consistent of them all. Anyone who likes any type of horror movies should watch this show and even if you don't still watch it. It's so good on so many levels. First of all, there are tributes to basically every horror movie you've ever seen. Candyman to Dracula, it's all here. It's dark scary and realistically done. There is an on-going story line but every episode is like a mini movie.The characters have great evolution and the acting is first class. I'm a brother myself and you feel so much for the two of them and you really feel what they go through. Every season becomes a little darker but the really gem in Supernatural is the comic value. Some episodes are like dark comedies and as you get in to the characters you really appreciate the humor. Both the main characters are superbly acted, the scripts are fresh and original and the show is both funny, heart breaking and heart warming. Watch this cause it is the best TV show around."
528,"The way you will see this TV show depends much from you're expectations. If you expect it to be scary, you better not waste you're time with it, you wont like it at all. I saw a lot of horror film and probably less then a dozen of then were scary even if they all tried. This is no exception, but the difference between the wanttobescary movies and Supernatural is that Supernatural isn't made to be scary. Its made to be entertaining and funny. All the episodes are based on books, movies, myths, so don't even expect it to be original. Its more like a big story-book with a background story and a lot of myths. All of the episodes are entertaining, and thats all that a TV show needs. Thats there only mission:entertainment.10/10"
529,"It is a series that had been missing from TV for quite a while now and was needed pretty much like the desert needs the rain. The classics, in this day and age, have gone by with a cloud of dust still lingering, and it truthfully makes me yearn for those good old days. Classic bare-knuckle Rock, muscle cars, road trips, an old fashion brawl, a couple of beers, the long walk of the victorious central characters in the fake backdrop sunset in the middle of a set in Hollywood, a couple more beers, hot chicks, more brawls, more beer, and a good time, and a bad time, all this 'cause our time here is short and no one should have regrets.Brotherly Love, which is written all over this TV series, is central as a theme, which is not something that was always there. The one brother, Dean, sticks with the father, for the sake of everyone else, and the other brother, Sam, goes his own way, mad at the father, because he always gave him grief, one way or another. And the family business is nothing else than Hunting. Hunting every single evil supernatural entity or being, kicking their ass and taking names. Dean is united with Sam, because Father is missing. Then trouble gets really sticky and the brothers have no other choice but to go at it together, from one side mainly for revenge, from the other, just because if they don't do it, no one else will do the right thing. The storyline is quite well structured and it progresses quite smoothly. The characters are very well drawn, each one with complex layers, which give the viewer the opportunity to approve or disprove of the actions of each character, depending on the moment. But what i found particularly attractive in this series is the fact that you can never hold a grudge at either of the two brothers. Always in the scope of truth and justice, each brother might act differently, allowing the story to take a different turn for each one of the viewers out there, but at the same time, all roads lead to Rome. Both brothers do what they do because it is the right thing to do, despite the fact that they do different things.Dean is the rugged, macho, the man's man, kind of guy, with an impenetrable exterior and a soft chewy center. Sam is the cuddly, ever-so-conscious ethicist, that kills evil supernatural beings, and understands the rest that have been misunderstood, no matter what his brother says. The two brothers ate The Ying and Yang of paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi brother-buddy TV Series. Where one lacks the other compensates, beautifully, not to mention that the transition from one character to the other is seamless, making it ever so easy for the viewer to bond with both characters, and leave them wanting more and more. The supporting crew compliment the main characters with an almost poetic progression, from what is needed, to what needs to be done. Between the father, his friends and the friends that Sam and Dean make along the way, there is this unseen understanding, which dictates that after you find out that there are really things that go bump in the night, you REALLY have to bump back harder than ever.The amount of detail, historical accuracy, and research done on each episode is mind boggling. Each one of the creatures and entities, is supported with an immense amount of info that is relayed to the viewer with such ease and clarity, it makes the whole process so easy to comprehend, it puts the viewer smack in the middle of the action, without questioning anything. The viewer is considered to be knowledgeable, yet anything new is introduced in such a way, that doesn't make the viewer feel like a student in a lecture, like the X-Files used to do. I was a great fan of Mulder and Scully, but every time i sat down to watch the show i felt like i did not read the required material the day before. And the delivery is done in such a confident way, which has nothing to fear from other shows. In a scene, Dean is teasing Sam. At the time Sam had recently discovered his psychic abilities, and Dean asks his brother which psychic he considers the hottest, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Patricia Arquette, or himself. A subtle way to say that Supernatural has nothing to fear from Ghost whisperer or Medium, two series that I personally consider levels lower than Supernatural, both in content, characters, storyline and consistency.Last but not least, i have to comment on the random comedy and sly comments Dean makes, along with the astounding soundtrack of the series. Classic Rock makes my skin go all bumpy and I remember my early years. Each song played so far in the series has brought back so many memories, all in my first car, a Mustang 1989 GT 5.0 with one of the first CD players on it. Top down, going God knows how fast with the musings of Led Zeppelin, CCR, and Lynyrd Skynyrd blasting from the stereo. Sam's Shevvy is a testament to the true American Classic Rock, and his rugged hide jokes and comedy is closely weaved with the image of the bad boy which everyone that was once young loved and adored.I cannot wait to see what the next season brings, and i sincerely hope that the series goes on for many, many seasons to come."
530,"As someone who doesn't like American television shows I just happen to come across an episode of this series one night just before going to bed. I watched it for a few minutes thinking this is the usual pile of rubbish imported for late night viewing. I was impressed. In fact I was looking at the television page wondering what the hell I have been missing. I am hard to please when it come to good quality television. This show (I am not keen on Horror genre) is brilliant. There are so many twists and turns that you can not predict the plot. There is always a surprise. And the love between the two brother has me in tears. I confess I am now a fan of this show and I am don't like any old rubbish on television. If you have not seen it then please watch one episode. I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
531,"Supernatural delivers great entertainment in so many ways.Firstly there is the horror/suspense side, which is spooky without being unsuitable for any non horror fans. The ideas are well thought out and there s clearly much imagination being employed in developing a wide base of supernatural foes for our main characters to fight.Secondy there is some well placed humour. I've seen humour used in other films/TV and it hasn't always worked. In Supernatural it's always just right. The story can move between humour to suspense to seriousness without ever feeling like they were just trying to cram in some unused funny lines. There are proper laugh out loud moments but it's never at the expense of any other part of the show.Thirdly the acting, direction, soundtrack and all the sets/locations are all first class. The right ingredients are well used to develop each show in it's own right but also to develop the characters and storyline. Each episode can stand on it's own merits and doesn't automatically require you to have seen the previous episodes. I like that about a lot of US shows. Each episode has it's own story, it's own set and a different spooky/scary thing, be it a ghost, monster or whatever.Fourthly there is a little but not too much eye candy. Women are attracted to the two main characters. My wife likes the show partly for this reason. There are some attractive females on the show too but at no point is there any full nudity. The show doesn't need it and I am happy for my 14 year old son to watch the show with me. I also like the fact that they have kept swearing down to a real minimum. Again the show doesn't need it. Scary, fun, funny, entertaining, thrilling etc etc does not mean there has to be lots of swearing and nudity and this show proves it can be done.Fifthly there is a great soundtrack. A bit like the film School of Rock, this film is making mullet rock popular again. There is a good combination of modern and older songs whose titles and/or lyrics often fit the story...Don't Fear The Reaper! There is more I could say. Everyone I have shown an episode of Supernatural to so far has become hooked. Male and Female, from about 14 to 50 years, they've all thought it was really good. All I can say is if you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the best shows on TV in the last 30 years."
532,"I have never been one who enjoys the supernatural genre. But this show has a certain grace about it. The brothers are perfectly cast in their roles. Jensen Ackles is hilarious as Dean Winchester, and Jared Padalecki is good for the more dramatic portion of the show. The writing is phenomenal with story after story of good plots and arcs. It's hard to say what I like most about the show. But I guess it's because they aren't trying to be another run of the mill freak show. Buffy was always painful, but not quite as bad as Charmed. I can't say that X-files was bad, I just never got into it. My point is, this is a great show and I know you'll enjoy it when you give it a chance."
533,"I haven't't missed any episode of Supernatural and I won't miss!I think I'm addicted to this movie because I frequent all the sites on the Internet to find out more and more and more about supernatural(especially about jared padalecki)!It's so cool that I think I'v made an obsession.I have a Supernatural theme on my cell,I have a Supernatural wallpaper on my desktop and I use on messenger a Supernatural avatar.By the way my id is ema4_u3 if you wanna talk with me about the film and share opinions.So I was saying that I love the movie and hope desperately it doesn't stop to season 3...that's all for now.Don't forget : ema4_u3 :)"
534,"It would be easy for Supernatural to come off as hokey or ridiculous, and I wasn't even sold on the entire premise in the beginning, but I kept watching because the subject was interesting and I wanted to see where the writers were going to take us.I'm glad I kept watching. What makes this a stand out is the actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. They take what the writer's churn out and turn it into two very believable snapshots in the lives of two bothers living a life of unspeakable horror and loss. Mother killed by demons. Father sacrifices himself to a demon for the sake of his son, Dean. Dean in turn sacrifices himself for his brother Sam and has 1 year to live before becoming a demon, the very thing he hates and hunts. Still, even with what could become a complete downer of a show, they manage to inject a sense of humor and adventure. And their roles as brothers are very believable.Every week I turn in eagerly for what I feel is arguably the best hour of genre TV each week. The writing is always top-notch even when the story itself is uneven, and even then, Ackles and Padalecki pull it off.I'm surprised this show is not more of a hit."
535,"This is a very good series that I have never seen since years. I am in love with the series and I haven't miss it since. It is made simple, but and dark and scary. There is one thing that makes this series also interesting is that the matter of fact that there is this 80's music always been played in the background - reminding me of scary movie where serial killers played the 80's music at the background. So, psychotic really and very scary. But at the same time it does matched the series better. Both of the actors are good and that is a compliment. The first scene where their mother got killed and nailed on the ceiling is the first thing that did makes your heart beats faster and keep staring at the screen and waiting for something to jump out from a dark corner and swing a sword or an Axe. That did make you jump - especially when one cannot see into the dark or when there is no music played except the silence of the darkness. Pretty scary though!"
536,"When I first came across this series I didn't think I would love it as much as I do. I'd been looking for something to be addicted to again for the longest time and Supernatural was completely from the left field for me. The plot is extremely well done, there are no flat, boring moments at all, it's very well-researched, there's a lot of attention to detail in most scenes, and the chemistry in the cast is perfect. I did a marathon on the first two seasons from the moment I got my hands on the DVDs. The sleep deprivation and consequent headache is worth the 40+ something hours. I do suggest that you watch the series with a friend or anyone else for company. I watched the first season by myself and after a certain episode I was starting to get bothered by random sights and sounds. For some people the series as a whole may not be as freaky as some horror classics, but after a prolonged period of exposure you'll get into the frame of mind to be scared, so have a buddy/boyfriend/brother close by in view of that."
537,"One of the best TV series i have seen on exorcism well directed ,with the tinges of humor in between.Both the actors have played their part beautifully to perfection .Sam and Dean the two main protagonist are the hunters, 'hunters that hunt ghosts '.There is one main plot involving winchester family (Sam and Dean Winchester's family).Every episode has a new story ,each being equally intriguing and exciting as the previous one.After the mysterious death of Sam's girlfriend ,sam is compelled to join family business which is hunting ghost saving people .The 2 brother are excellent in their job and does it to perfection .they have mastered the art of conning along with the devil hunting Awesome must watch series thrilling and exciting."
538,"Supernatural is Well written, well acted and the casting is really great. Also the story lines are not predictable and something that hasn't really been seen in other programs. This show would be recommended for people who are into horror and supernatural (Obviously) programs.Also the way that the actors (Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki) argue like real siblings would, it just makes the program seem realistic, even though most of the time it is about things that aren't realistic.Also the actors show that they have a softer side when it comes to the welfare of their family. That's what makes the show even more great.If you have never watched it you are missing out on something that is great and something that i hope is around for a long time."
539,"I absolutely love this show! The dark colors and the use of real myths and legends, teamed with brilliantly talented actors who are absolutely gorgeous too... pure genius. Although our episodes are quite behind here is Australia - about 8 episodes i think (because apparently my birthday isn't special enough for my favorite show to air) i still feel connected, and trying to figure out what happens next. I don't want to read spoilers for this, as the anticipation of each episode alone drives me insane, and there's nothing better than the feeling of watching supernatural.did that make any sense?"
540,"I think that Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV. I have seen it since the first episode, an excellent episode. Supernatural is best the series of condition than to published Warner Channel and a outspent show that keep you int he chair by all one hour. They are very few shows that produces as much adrenalin to you as this, since each episode introduces to us in a world unknown by many and feared for others. The constant turns of the chapters maintain patch to the television set, asking to yourself why, how, who and when of each thing that happened. I had the luck to obtain the original package of the series in DVD. Single I am going to say that to true fans (as me)who knows each corner histories, the biography of the actors and until the dialogs of memory, the DVD's are an excellent opportunity to enjoy all that in the comfort of your homes.What I can more say, good actors and good histories, cannot more be requested. A series that has everything for the fanatics of the unknown things and the mysterious things, SUPERNATURAL things!!!!!!!!"
541,"What can I say but, ""Supernatural"" is the best show on television. It's on Thursday night at 9:00 against some fierce competition. However the actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. get along with each other very well. The writers and directors also work hard on preparing for the Urban Myths and Ledgens that this show is based upon. I love the characters Dean and Sam. They are so true to life. The guys are really hot to look at. They put their heart and soul into everything they do. They film in Canada which for much of the show is pretty cold to work in. The two actors don't let you see just how cold it really is. The stories or episodes are great. Most of the time they can get scary, but sometimes it 's just like reading a good book. I wish and hope 'Supernatural will live on and on. I just love the show so mucc."
542,"I love shows that have scary moments, drama, fantasy, and humor, this show has it all. The first time i saw a preview i was all like, ""What a stupid looking show,"" then my mom started watching it. One night i came down and asked what she was watching and she said this new show called supernatural. That episode was bloody mary and i was automatically hooked. I then had to get the first season on DVD and have seen each episode at least ten times. I love this show. I give this show a ten out of ten and would recommend it to anyone. Not only does it have a great plot but it also has some hot actors playin sam and dean. Can't wait for the next episode and the next season DVD. I will definitely get it. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
543,"This is the best show EVER!!! It's got funny parts between Dean and Sam, and still it has it's scary parts! It's not like any other program, it's never boring and it's always great to watch, whatever mood your in! It certainly is frightening, but it's not like a wannabe horror program, if I can call it that... It's seriously the BEST program on earth, if you like scary movies and can't get enough of it, this is the program for you!! Not to mention my two hot Winchester brothers!=D I first saw Jensen Ackles's talent in Smallville and I thought ""I want to see more of this guy!"" Because he's such an amazing actor, and he seems like a great guy!! In the show he's kind of a bad boy, while his brother Sam is more of a ""softy"" but he has his outrages sometimes too, it so cool because those two kinda balance each other. And the whole story is great too! Excellent show!!!!!"
544,"Supernatural is probably the best series i have seen with otherworldly stuff in it, such as werewolfs and vampires and demons, that have NOT been reduced to some halfass parody of what it was intended. I LOVE IT The story begins when the father of the Winchester family goes missing. This family is not the ordinary kind, this family hunts above said creatures, and kills them, for a living. The family also has a VERY dark past which comes back to haunt them, quite literally. If you like suspense dark scenery and evil plots come undone you, as I, will love this series.ps. (for the actors) the acting is good too! =)"
545,"I think it is a awesome show, I watch it ever Thursday, the fact Sam and his father have both being possessed make it all the more exciting and it's really getting good. I love this show, and if you like scary movie that make a thousand turns than you will like the movie CRY WOLF Sam plays in it to.Super natural is not just about hunting and killing demons,it's about finding out about whats going to happen to Sam and and how he blames him self ever time he can't save someone and starts to beat himself up.Dean on the other hand (who is the older brother and shorter one)who is trying his hardest to protected Sam without having to fallow his dads orders of killing Sam (if he can't save him)."
546,"This show is excellent it has all the right elements, humor, drama, horror, great music, an excellent script and the best cast and crew you could hope for.It's doesn't become boring since there is always new elements to add in, if your a fan of the supernatural, of urban legends this show is going to just right for you.Now the acting is superb, the actors really seem to know what the're doing and they really get in touch with the characters they are portraying, so you don't have to worry about bad acting.The crew, writers, director, producers, etc. have really done their homework so you don't get these half baked plots, instead you get the full experience of what these things that the brothers hunt are like and what are they do to defeat the, and it also makes sense so you're not left in the clouds wondering ""what just happened"".All in all the show is great, the acting is great, the music is awesome, and the special effects woo out of this world."
547,"I really love this series so much, and frankly it's better than Smallville. The actors play well and they are the greatest ghost busters ever. You'll find great relationship between Dean and Sam Winchester, although they really didn't know where to find their father, and they have found her mom died. They are so patient and strong. They are brave and plucky! I salute these character so much. This story tells you about evil spirits and how they can destroy the demons and evils using their abilities, but no one could do that so. It is a fantasy but you got to believe it with your eyes, or someday you may experience it. I admit that I want to watch the seasons everyday, I could not miss it. But what totally makes me weird is, how could Sam killed his own girlfriend? That sounds weird, so anyway, just watch the seasons."
548,Just to start off with this show is one of the best that I have ever watched in my life. The show always leaves you with some kind of mystery of what will happen next. The best parts are the parts right before the commercial and as soon as you see the major stuff you hear a boom and there is the commerical and as soon as you come back they are in the same spot at the same moment that they left. Now others shows give you a commercial and then they may be a thousand miles away from where they were. Now back to the scary stuff they always try to make you jump when you see the killer or whatever that weeks thing is. Now the only problem with Supernatural is that it is only a one hour show. Other than that the whole show is nothing but scares and coolness.
549,"this is a awesome show. It's about two Brothers Dean(Jensen Ackles) is the oldest brother, who is a bad ass, and loves his little brother too death, and would do anything for him. Sam(Jared Padalecki) is the younger brother, who also loves his older brother too death, he can be a bad ass sometimes, but he's also a real sweetheart. One day Sam and Dean go on a hunting trip to find their dad and the demon that killed their mother, and they fight other supernatural demons along the way. this show is on the CW on Thursdays at 9:00 pm. I love this show, it's scary, it has hot men. This show is like a male version of Charmed. Sam and Dean have awesome Chemistry in this show, they have a good brother relationship, they will protect each other, no matter what happens. Dean is more protective of Sam, than Sam is with him."
550,"This is the BEST show I've ever seen. Its the only one i rush home for and refuse to miss. The storyline and what they do is awesome. I mean, killing demons and poltergeists and all sorts of other evil creatures and things and the methods they use for destroying them like the demon circles and the exorcists and burning the bones and things. And you cant forget their cool weapons and things that they use to keep the spirits away. The ride is pretty sweet too. It has to be the coolest car on television. And you cant leave out those two guys. Super hot and sexy and the attitudes that they have make them the perfect pair. And did i mention they were HOT? But even without them it would still be a freakin good show. Its definitely the best"
551,"i think it's the best on t.v. it has so many twist and turns, and it tells the story of two brothers, and their ""supernatural"" life, all the creatures they will come up against and what's behind Sam's visions...i get so mad if i miss an episode...i stop to watch it even if i had plans to do something it's that interesting...and the endings are just cruel, it makes you wait till the next episode or season...but i love it and i rate it 10, Jared Padalecki, and Jensen Ackles are awesome actors and play the part very well... I am just waiting to find out what happens next...every new episode gets better and better...and i'm going to say that both Jared and Jensen are my favorite. :)"
552,"Supernatural is a spooky master-piece. It should been seen by everyone who loves supernatural programmes. It also has the bonus of having two incredibly sexy actors to play the lead roles. They portray these roles with confidence, and they are fantastic.The stories for the episode are great and you are always kept guessing. The series is about two brothers who fight the supernatural after their mother is killed by a demon when they were kids. The last episode in the first series is very trilling and leaves you wanting the second series to be out straight after.Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles are fantastic as the roles of Sam and Dean, they are sexy but spooky. The programme is a must see for people who like TV shows such as Buffy and Angel.Watch it, it is brilliant!"
553,"It's a genius blend of the X-Files, Rout 66, and every classic horror movie you've ever seen. Urban legends are dissected using myth and fact bringing to life mini movies that make you wish they were longer then just one hour. Two charismatic brothers start out on a journey to find their father who is out on a hunting trip. Hunting what? Things that go bump in the night, and revenge on the demon that killed his wife. That's how John Winchester was introduced into this world of the Supernatural and he raised his two sons, Dean and Sam as best he could. Giving them the knowledge and skills to abolish all evil, bringing them up to follow in his footsteps. This is already the second season, so much has happened in just the first 22 episodes. New friends have been made, old friends have been lost and enemies have been revealed. Season 1 is on the shelves and is captivating as all get out but you don't need to have watched all of season 1 to get into this show. You may need some insight here and there but you have me to ask if you have a question on anything.Sam and Dean are on the road trip of their lives, stopping here and there at Podunk gas stations to fill up Dean's '67 Chevy Impala. (Christened by the fans as Metallicar) She purrs under the hood like a fat cat and roars down any road Dean takes her; all the while listening to what Sam has dubbed ""the best of mullet rock"". Although that's isn't entirely true, you will hear a steady stream of classic rock dipping in with a few choice hair metal bands and songs from the early to mid 80's.The brothers are played by Jared Padalecki (Sam) and Jensen Ackles (Dean) who may already be a couple of familiar faces. Jared is well know for his role of Dean in ""Gilmore Girls"" as well as Wade in ""House of Wax"" (the 2005 remake) or even Tom in ""Cry Wolf"". A talented actor who's chemistry with on screen brother Jensen Ackles is nothing short of a good chemical reaction. Jensen is a somewhat less familiar face but if you know where to look back you just may remember him as Eric Brady, Sammy's twin brother on ""The Days of our Lives"" or more recently as Jason, Lana Lang's old love interest on ""Smallville"". Needless to say you can tell that these boys get along well off screen just by the way they act on camera, they play off each other and are so believable as brothers some times you forget you are actually watching something that's not real.Eric Kripke, the creator of ""Supernatural"" does his best to bring you a one-hour mini horror movie each week. Filled with effects, comic relief and at times a glimpse into the life of these two young men that will make you wish each episode were longer. By the time next Thursday comes around you'll be dying for the next show and Kripke never ceases to amaze."
554,I've been watching Supernatural since the very first episode and I love this show. The use of great music is right on with the feel of the show. I thought the show would be really good from the previews of it. I just didn't know how good. The writing is excellent. The cast is stellar. The story lines are really cool.If you enjoyed The X Files as much as I did you'll enjoy this show. At first it looked liked just a freak of the week type of show. Like it would only be about what the Winchester boys were hunting. It turned out to have an excellent central story line that looks like it could go on for a while. The show also has a great sense of humor that is much in-tune with my own sense of humor. So I highly recommend this show to anyone.
555,"At first my friend urged me to watch Supernatural. I said it looks interesting but I'm not into it. Know I'm so hooked, its hard not to look away. So far Supernatural has been one of the best shows running on t.v. well for me anyways. It's scary and funny at the same time. You really don't get a lot of those. The main actors are awesome. Their good at their job and now how to do it right. The point of the story lines are clear and something new. You don't see shows about demons...vampires and spirits all together. They pack a lot of action and adventure into 45 min. of the show. Each episode just gets better and better every time!"
556,"I didn't know what the show was about entirely but it interested me so I decided to watch it. I absolutely loved it. I though that it was creative and original. I also thought that the cast chosen to play these unique roles were the perfect picks. I wanted everyone to know about the show because I loved it so much so I put it on my myspace page. I made sure to include time, channel, and the day it appears on. I hardly ever watch TV but that show really makes me want to wait all day by the remote until it comes on. Please bring it back for future seasons. I hope that you guys get a lot of ratings so you have a reason to bring it back. I tell everyone about the show because I like it so much. I have already gotten all of my friends hooked. I also told my brother in Florida to watch the show and tell his friends to watch it too."
557,"I started watching Supernatural last year, the promo's looked so awesome I just said to myself ""You HAVE to see that"", and so I did and I haven't missed an episode since then. I remember how I stood by the edge of my seat during the whole Pilot, it was awesome, I've always liked things involving horror and scary stories so this show was like heaven sent, but don't get it wrong either Supernatural does have the scary factor but it also includes a lot about families and the problems that they go through, it has drama and even humor, let's just say it has a little bit for everyone.Supernatural is an awesome show that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat during an entire hour every week, horror, cute boys, rock and a kick ass car, how not to love it?"
558,"My husband actually got me hooked on this show - it's excellent though! Kind of a dark, twisty story with a hope of a happy ending - or as close as it can get to happy. Truly one of the best written I've seen in a long time! This show takes you to places most people couldn't imagine on a hunt for one killer but ""taking care"" of all they come across. Great story lines, great conflicts, great interests! I recommend this show for viewers who like scary movies, but don't need all the gore that comes with them so often these days. And of course, not for kids. =)This is also a show that doesn't deter off of the main objectives of his characters - they stay true regardless of the situation. I've really got to hand it to the writers for this - a great combination of good actors and good writing."
559,"We follow Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) following their fathers footsteps in the hunt for whatever that killed their mother when they were kids. This journey takes the boys through known myths like ""hook man"", ""bloody Mary"", ""Vampires"" and many more.Dean pick up Sam at Stanford U. wanting him to help find their dad John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who has been out of touch for a while. The more we see of the story, the boys past, their life reveals itself little by little making the viewers wanting more! A great show for those who liked shows like Buffy, Angel, X-files and other shows like that!"
560,...or I never would have found this gem! This is what Nightstalker SHOULD have been. All my favorite horror movies + two hot guys + great special effects + genuine scares + kick ass rock and roll = one fine show.I rented the first three discs of season 1 and had to run out and buy the whole thing. Good thing I caught it too...season 2 starts September 28th...can't wait! The best way to sum it up for people who are thinking to watch it or not is...The X Files - with two Mulders - minus the aliens - plus the buddy duo from Psych...and you've pretty much got Supernatural. :D
561,"With all of the reality shows on TV, it is nice to see a few shows that still rely on good story telling. This is Supernatural, great story telling, especially if it is a ghost story! This show is filled with fantastic effects, frightening imagery (Provenance - watch this episode and you'll see what I mean)and great tales to be told. You find yourself helping the Winchester brothers from your own safe seat at home. The writers have done their research on their monsters and weave such frightening tales. Did I mention that it is a good time and some of these stories are down right terrifying? - and this is coming from a hard core horror fan. This show is well worth its time!!!"
562,"Good show....actually really good show. One of the few reasons I still enjoy network TV. My wife gets all happy when it comes on...it must be a Dean and Sam thing. It kind of has a X Files / Tru Calling feel. Nice wheels too, no rice burners on this show. I like the ""dark"" look and feel of the show and the sarcasm and witty remarks. I'm glad it's on the WB and NOT Fox, WB will ride it out, Fox would have canceled it prematurely like so many other new Fox shows. Got the season 1 box set today, kind of wished it had surround sound, maybe season 2 will be in surround.Enjoy."
563,i think supernatural i a great show with fresh new (Hot) faces. Jensen is a great actor as the older brother he keeps everything in check he's handsome and funny give the show a spark. Jared is the young brother and is also very handsome he feels drawn to having a normal life but feels he has a duty to his brother and father to keep fighting the demon that killed his mother. i think this show is great it takes you beyond a normal train of thought it makes you think outside of the box and gives different explanations for why things happen. it pulls you away from real life and gives you a different point of view if only for an hour. so i hope that this show stays on for many more seasons to come and i give it a perfect 10.
564,"I have never missed an episode of this show. I myself, am a horror buff. I can't live without horror movies. They are air to me. But this show is freaky. I couldn't sleep after watching some of the episodes and each episode has a chilling climax. Gimore Girl's Jared Padalecki and Smallville's Jensen Ackles act well on this show. There are two brothers, Dean and Sam who want to find out what happened to dad. They encounter different Urban Legends in some of the towns. I really enjoy this show and I cant live without watching it.The characters they meet on the way become friends to Dean and Sam. They do find their father,,,finally! I just cant wait till season 2 airs on the CW. Its gonna be great. ITs a great show! Enjoy!"
565,"Clever witty and full of action, this is the best in its genre that I have seen. Oooohh and the boys are the hottest. The big brother Dean is of course my favorite, protecting everyone he can and never really thinking about himself. Sam also hits a soft spot as the kid brother you want to take home and keep safe. The story lines are gripping, the insane asylum scenes almost gave me a heart attach. But the best part is the drama behind the story, the family that tries to stay together while the world tears them apart."
566,"I watched this show for 2 reason Jensen Ackles and the fact that it is written by the same folks who wrote X-files. I watched X-Files until it ended and the scripts in this show are just as well written and all 3 male leads are very attractive. The shows are fast paced and have just enough actual supernatural background to give it that intellectual twist. I hope this show lasts half as long as the files did. The only problem we ever had with the X-FIles is the sub plot with the cigarette smoking man, there for season or two that was all you heard about. It is OK to bring it up once every 3 or 4 episodes but the harping on the conspiracy got a little old. Let's hope they keep up the good work with this show and give us lots of good of good scares. All we can say is so far so good"
567,"This show started off very strong and got me hooked after the first few episodes. It got a bit repetitive in the middle of the season from around the episode 9 to 14 mark, but after that it just blew me away. I would have to say the final two episodes of the season are probably the best television to come out of 2006 so far. The acting of Jensen ackles and Jeffrey dean Morgan are especially superb, they have great interactions. Also the dialog between Jensen and Jared is excellent. I am glad that the CW network is going to bring this back for another season. If you haven't watched it before, get the episodes somehow and catch up otherwise you are missing out on an awesome show."
568,"OK all I gotta say is SuperNatural is the best TV show ever!!! Lol!! It VERY well done! The graphics, the stunts, the make-up, etc. are brilliant!! Its scary, Very funny, sassy, sad, full of drama & full of suspense! Its perfect! Its got everything people like to see all in one show! Jared Padalecki & Jensen Ackles are a great team in this ""Supernatural"" show! & both are very hot!!! Thats what makes the show even better to watch! So all who love Jared, Jensen & all the cool stuff i listed up above would absolutely love this show!!SuperNaturally Obsessed!! :D R.C"
569,"This is the best show in the whole world! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padaleki are the hottest guys on television! They are even hotter then Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp! Jensen and Jared are great together and are great actors as you actually believe they are brothers, like in the episode where they always played pranks on each other. This show is not only about fighting supernatural but about bonds of brotherhood! I can not wait for the next season and the season DVD's to come out. Out of the 6 shows I cant miss (all of them from the WB) this is by far my favorite. I refuse to do anything on Thursday nights so i wont miss this show even if its a repeat. Every Friday during school my friends and i would discuss the episode that happened last night and reflect on the show (pretty much oh my gosh did u see when Jensen (dean) didn't have his shirt on or i was so excited when Jared (sam) came out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel around his waist) So in Summery I LOve this show its amazing and I am so glad the The CW chose it for there new line up!"
570,"Okay where do i start?...awesome cast, absolutely breathtaking story,an out of this world soundtrack,suspense,thrill, drama....this show has it all. Ever since Buffy, Angel, and Dark Angel left our screens I have been looking for an answer to my t.v viewing fantasies...And you have near hit it on the head ( no offense )...You just need just a little femininity..not too much,but just a little more than you already do. Suggestion you ask? ( ha ha ha )well maybe just bring in a chick that's just as fascinated, about the boys lives as she is the supernatural..anyway now I'm blabbingJust like to add...Jenson you are a legend, and the industry needs more people like you. Lots'o'love from planet OZ, Australia LOOOOOOOVE THE SHOW, KEEP 'EM COMING."
571,"Supernatural was definitely the hit new TV show in Australia for 2005. I loved the mixture of horror, comedy and drama within the show. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Paladecki played their roles well, and I have to say my favorites part of the show was not just the great Supernatural threats they faced each episode but rather watching their relationship as brothers and as young men play out. Dean, the seemingly 'flaky' one is seen growing through the series as simply a vulnerable young man seeking approval from his father. Sam is the more rebellious son who is more like his father than Dean is and unlike Dean isn't afraid to question his Dad about what's going on. You can tell that everything John has done is for the good of his son's, yet at the same time he was selfishly motivated to seek revenge on the demon that killed his wife. Because of this motivation, his parenting skills probably aren't as ...healthy as they could have been. Overall this is just an awesome show. I've read about the season two story lines and I cannot wait until we get them here in Australia."
572,"i love the show, and first saw the show i remember in November i saw the episode Home and after that i was hooked i haven't been able to stop talking about it, the show is awesome and i can't wait for all of the new episodes i think the second season is going to be the greatest. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are perfect for these characters they make it look so real they are great actors and hot and the brotherly love is so sweet and it's funny. this show has anything you could ever want in a series,drama,horror,fantasy,comedy,romance etc and can't forget the hot guys. i love it.... it is the greatest show ever created ugh i love it"
573,"PLot: Sam, Gilmore Girls'Jared Padelackie, is a college student heading to law school. His brother, a Mr. Jensen Ackles from Smallville or Dark Angel, Dean comes to find him to find their father who has gone missing on a ""hunting trip."" Well, turns out Dean and their father hunt supernatural beings because their mom was killed by one when they were young. Sam ran away to college but now has to help find dad. He goes home after a job and finds his girlfriend to be killed just like his mom. Sam joins Dean on a revenge quest to destroy all evil beings throughout the country.Characters:Sam is kind of whiny and basically has this complex of being unwanted because he left for college. He decently acted and somewhat good looking. Jared has a huge following from Gilmore girls. He'll probably be more liked because his character is believable. Dean is played in this tough guy act. Ackles does well with one liners so they over saturated his character with it. He seems too willing and too much of a perfect hero. Not realistic. That's sad, because the man can act. Watch the DarkAngel episode where he played Ben. He has the ability to be a real actor. The show doesn't do that. All in all, the have good chemistry. They seem like brothers. Maybe it's because they're both from Texas.Thoughts: The show is not suppose to be some great innovation. It has some cool urban legends and people fighting them. I mean, we all love the story of Bloody Marry and the evil demons. I especially liked the preacher's wife that made a deal with death. People want to see an innocent but hot chick be given as human sacrifice. They want hot men to be heroes. This show is fun to watch. Don't take it too seriously. Just go for a ride and take this as it is, A really cool complication of campfire stories that have a connecting story. The shadow effects used are pretty cool too. I vote 7/10. Just needs to be less corny."
574,"I was'nt sweatin TV shows as a pre-teen/tenn-ager but I cant help but say this show though it has a MILLION things to pick apart from the supernatural to the kick-a$$ car(big fan of,had one in H.S.)and all pts in between.BUT I will say this show is the only reason I get up before noon (9:00am 3 eps go on)and thats nothing to brag about seeing I'm 41 y.o.yet its a cool show and I cant help but find Dean hilarious,bitter and cynical like myself even the faces he makes make me wonder how I am perceived for my traits though I laugh more at him than I EVER did at any comedy TV movie or otherwise,sad huh?I felt like I needed to give the show some props for the one of a very few TV shows I totally enjoy watching,I do enjoy other characters other than Dean only,Crowley is too much and Bobby is great but the ""idjit""catch phrase attempt turns me off a bit,Cas is cool and one never knows when he's gonna flake out(nice touch)one thing does bother me I missed the episode when the 68 chevy got traded in for the dodge AGHHHHH!How could they ?Anyways thanks for reading and enjoy the show for what it is(and is'nt) A.Nuzzo"
575,"In recent years I've cut down how much TV for a couple reasons; 1.) I don't want to waste my day in front of a screen and 2.) There's not much on these days worth watching. There's only a couple shows I watch on a constant basis and usually I just DVR them so I can watch them later.However Supernatural is possibly the one exception, Ever since I started watching around season 3 I have not been able to wait until the next episode. After every season finale I'm usually a little annoyed because they have a tendency of having a cliff hanger.The cast is great, not just Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles but the entire supporting cast even ones that are only in a episode or two (such as Death) it seems they take there time with every episode to ensure a great episode. One thing that I enjoy that seems more thanks to Jared and Jenson is that the characters seem very realistic, which can be attributed to the humor that is present throughout the series.Every season is different and the same in the sense that it progresses the show without losing it's roots. Also if you re-watch earlier episodes you can see little hints of what is coming in the near or even far future of the show.Of the supporting cast my two favorites are Bobby and Castiel. Bobby seems like the guy you would meet at a bar and he would be the one to sit in a corner muttering ""dumb*ss"" at every one while drinking his beer. Castiel is the friend you have that didn't discover alcohol until he was 25 and went on a bender when he found out what he was missing.I fully enjoy this show and I enjoy when they through in episodes that really have nothing to do with the plot of the season but are just fun to watch like ""Monster Movie"" that are just fun to watch.If you have not started this series I'd recommend trying to catch up before the seventh season starts up this fall. And yet again I'm curious to find out what is going to happen after the finale last season."
576,"Imagine there's another world where all of your childhood nightmares exist, and the only thing stopping them from getting you is the presence of hunters in this world. Everything from wendigos to dragons to real-life fairy tales are present in this place, and anything is possible. There are demons and angels, but God is absent and no longer cares, and the angels are intent on doing whatever the hell they want - which includes jump-starting judgment day. The only thing left to keep the world intact are two boys, an old drunk, and a fallen angel. Supernatural is the story of these people.Ever seen a show where you loved everything about it? Well, for me this is that show. It has awesome casting, amazing songs, brilliant writers who aren't afraid to go that extra insane mile, cool story lines, heroic and wonderful characters, and last but certainly not least - a gorgeous Impala. There are plenty more reasons to love it, but they are much too numerous to name. Though most of them are entire episodes.I actually stumbled upon it on accident, as one day as I'm watching television, I see a promo for Supernatural. So I make a mental note to check out the show, but with my memory I forget about it for two weeks. Then, finally, I watch the episode Bedtime Stories, and absolutely kick myself for not hearing of this show sooner, as I find it to be brilliant. I don't understand what the whole ""demon deal"" is about, but I understand enough about the show to know that it's something I'd love to see more of. It's funny, it's well-written, it has great characters and actors... Based on that episode alone, I went out and bought the first three seasons, and Supernatural has since become my favorite show of all time.I realize all of this might sound a little bit biased. Sure, there have been a few (very few) times when I wasn't quite as impressed with the show as I usually am. But for the most part, I really do find it to be an amazing and unique show. After all, where else can you watch an angel unsink the Titanic, a shape-shifter that likes to be all the great monsters from the old movies, or two characters playing the roles of their real-life personas acting as their character selves? (You might have to think about that last one if you haven't watched the show).For anyone reading this who has never watched this show, go out and give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't."
577,"don't hope they cancel this show. Really good show. i love supernatural. i hope this show will be on TV for a long time. or one more season, i hope. it is the best show on the TV. I love the horror and the comedy in supernatural. every episode is excellent. this show gets better every time. i love especially Dean he is funny and raw. he kick ass every time. and i liked when Sam had superpowers. i hope Sam not turn bad. but like to see Sam get superpowers a again. Sam is sensitive but raw,just like Dean but he is more funny. i am a fan of this and funny dark fantasy show.i hope it will be a season 7 or more. This review may contain spoilers"
578,"When people around me used to rave about this new thing called, 'Supernatural', I was sceptical to the point of biased. I was the Buffy generation - nothing was ever going to beat Buffy, no matter who these two ""Really Hot Brothers"" were. A year ago, I gave in and decided to give it a try.And there ended my social life.Supernatural should be a clichéd, easy to dismiss phenomenon...but it isn't. Indeed, I didn't know from the very first episode how much it was going to take over my life. Far from it, the first few episodes almost lost me completely. It was nothing I hadn't seen before, save for the brother relationship and as I've previously said - the jaded Buffy generation are immune to most shocks and scares TV can rustle up.But I stayed with it and I fell into it completely.Now then, I could easily ramble here about the show's astoundingly great writing, the twisting addictive plots, the brilliant and unexpectedly original supernatural lore...but I won't. Because that's not why I fell passionately in love with SPN.It is the characters that set SPN apart from all other shows. More accurately, it's Sam and Dean. I read somewhere once that an idea for the show would have completely discounted the idea of the two brothers; instead having a travelling journalist documenting the supernatural phenomena. What a grave mistake that would have been.The two brothers weave the tale of family and everything that comes with it seamlessly in the middle of the darkness they know and fight - and boy do they fight. These boys are the only thing standing between us and whatever apocalypse is creeping around the corner and they'll redefine the meaning of the word sacrifice by the time they're done. Sam and Dean are two of the most compelling, heartbreaking characters I've ever seen grace the screen. Even in a climate where brother relationships are common enough in TV shows, i.e. Prison Break and Heroes, there is something about Sam and Dean that sets them apart and it is this element that brings Supernatural to it's fullest potential, thus making it my all time favourite TV show ever. You want the greatest soundtrack ever? Hot girls? Plot twists? Black comedy? Tears, sacrifice, brotherly-insults, demons, ghosts, a smokin' 1967 Chevvy Impala, Ghostfacers and a few apocalypses thrown in for good measure? Look no further, 'cos it's all right here."
579,"I absolutely love this show. Two extremely good looking guys who battle evil on every episode. Sam (Jared Padalecki)and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) inherited the occupation of hunters from their father (they later discover that it was their mother's side who were the hunters). During each episode they battle evil and, in a few episodes, good in the form of the angels. Sam and Dean, when they are investigating, take on fake identities with the names of well known rock band members. In one episode, they were Officers Tyler and Perry, an homage to Aerosmith. In another, they were DeYoung and Shaw, who were members of Styx. The actors are very well cast. Sam is level-headed and soulful. Dean is comedic and fearless. Eventually, we are introduced to Castiel, the angel who is a sidekick of sorts. Castiel is their guide from the higher angels who rescues Dean from Hell at the beginning of the fourth season. Wonderful acting by Misha Collins, BTW. There is also Ruby, the demon who on occasion assists them. She ends up as the traitor at the end of Season Four and the fiancé of Jared Padalecki (oh, darn). There are some recognizable faces (Christopher Hayerdahl, Marcus of New Moon fame for example). There is also great classic rock music like Blue Oyster Cult. All in all this is an entertaining series and I'm glad to hear it will be back for Season Six. Keep up the good work, Eric Kripke. :)"
580,"Honestly, I used to think Supernatural was the WB's attempt to cash in on their new found ""Sci-fi"" genre. I used to watch Smallville and then leave when Supernatural came on. One day, however, I turned watched Supernatural because my friend has recommended it to me. Painfully I watched it, but as I did, I began to realize how wrong I was. While it was the WB attempting to go with the flow on the genre, I was wrong at the content. Supernatural soon became the second half of my Sci-fi Thursday night cocktail, a night once occupied by shows like Angel and Buffy. Mixed with Smallville Thursday nights where, and still are, my favorite night on TV. And, as the inevitable decline of Smallville occurred, Supernatural began to spice things up with the Apocalypse, soul-deals and such. Where as I used to regret missing Smallville and watching Supernatural as filler instead, I now make certain Supernatural is always recording on my TiVo and if Smallville falls behind because some better show is on at the same time slot, I honestly don't care.Supernatural's novel-like story line, witty humor, and action scenes rivaling the intensity of Hollywood movies, make me wish that the world really was ending so I could hop into an old muscle-car, listen to classic rock and journey across America looking for some ""evil sons of bitches"" to kill."
581,From The first episode I new this is something great!!! Main actors Sam and Dean are the best young actors in the world. Stories are well written with a lot of humor. Beautiful babes in every episode makes man horny and their girls happy. Grab some snacks and some drinks and prepare yourself for a pure pleasure!!! Last ten years I waited to see something this good. Dialouges between Sam and Dean are something that touches brothers heart. Arguing about favorite Rock and Metal bands and awesome music are just just one plus in ocean of pluses. Not one minus.I will be short on this. This is a must see for everyone!!! Even if you do not like to watch TV and prefer reading books you MUST see this one!!! One of the best series of all time!!!The purest 10 on IMDb.
582,"I have watched this show from the Pilot episode....and am still hooked!!!...this is without doubt the only show that has made me tune in each week and still 4 years down the line am I still hooked!!!! Each season finale tops the previous and leaves you wanting more!!! Now I am not usually a fan of this kinda genre, but you can't help but love this show...from the brothers chemistry and banter, witty lines to intriguing story lines!! Although the show kinda started off with monsters of the week, they do have continual plots and the show is realistic (to a sense) to interpret the brothers emotions to current situations instead of them forgetting about it the following week (a pet hate of mine of other shows) If you are new to the show I would definitely suggest watching right from the beginning, not only to follow the brothers story, but to also see how Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles' acting abilities have grown from strength to strength...they deserve all the credit along with the writers and production team on this fantastic show...if rumours are true that season 5 is the last...then I have every faith it will end on a high and will be a classic!!!!!"
583,"I remember watching the first season trailer for the pilot episode of Supernatural and thinking just one word: wow. Since then, I've been completely addicted to the show. The enticing plot, the characters, the bond between the brothers, the music, the metallicar, EVERYTHING just adds up so wonderfully that I just want to garnish it with a bow. When I was forced to move to Beijing for 2 years, I flipped out because I knew I wouldn't be able to get my Supernatural fix. But thanks to iTunes, I survived my deprivation of weekly happiness. I'm fourteen now, and I still maintain my gigantic crush on the two brothers. Supernatural MUST continue on - because my love for it will never rest."
584,"As I wrote in the summary, this show is spectacular.I really love spending my time watching Dean Winchester's face LOL. Justkidding. I just love everything about this show! Maybe this word can describe all about this show, AWESOME.With a exciting story in every episode and a hilarious fight between the Winchester brothers, it fits perfectly and makes me addicted to this show. To tell you the truth, I just can't stand to miss this show. To describe it shortly, all of the flavors we need in one show are in Supernatural. They did a very great job.Well, if you miss this, you'll make a big mistake."
585,"Supernatural is an absolutely amazing TV show. One of the best on TV right now,Its my favorite show besides One Tree Hill. It started off with 2 brothers, Sam and Dean and they're dad who hunts and kills the supernatural. After They're mother was brutally killed by something when they were just children, they're father would stop at nothing to find and kill the thing that killed her. If you like creepy yet very entertaining and interesting shows that have some twists, then this is the show for you. Also doesn't hurt that the two main characters are gorgeous. If you haven't watched this show, give it a try i'm SURE you'll love it as much as I do!"
586,"I am going to keep my review short and simple.Supernatural is an excellent television series. As stated by other reviewers below me, the cast is all excellent, especially the two main leads.I have seen all of the episodes for the first three seasons, and I can verily say that every episode has been entertaining and fun; the main leads, as well as the supporting cast, bring a lot of enthusiasm to their roles. To be sure, what makes the show stand out head and above other shows is the chemistry between the two main leads; they are the coolest and the hippest television characters I have seen in some time...they know how to bring to their roles in equal measures the intensity and humor with such natural grace and ease that it is a pleasure to watch. Likewise, all of the supporting cast and guests are all interesting and very good.Also, the production value is excellent: check out the sets and special effects in every episode...one can clearly appreciate the fact that much care and love went into the creation of each and every episode.Finally, the writing is excellent: smart plots and dialogue. One can clearly tell that the creators of this excellent show are fans of not just the horror genre, but all genres.In short, my highest recommendation possible."
587,"There are many supernatural programmes that are just plain bad, and make you want to be violently ill because the plot lines are inexcusably terrible and the acting is abysmal. This programme, thank God, is not one of those!Supernatural rises above all expectations and makes you want to jump for joy because the lead actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, are absolutely natural the entire time; not to mention very nice to look at. The first season of the show was sort of a rip off period where they showed all the usual legends etc. but as the seasons wore on the plots got exceptionally good, and Dean seemed to get funny while Sam definitely got moodier.Everything in this programme is fantastic, it captures humour, sensitivity and creativity in one nice package that both thrills you and terrifies you, and with its ""homage-to-mullet-rock"" soundtrack, it just keeps getting better!"
588,"This comment is clearly very late in the game, as supernatural is already almost four years old, and is well into season 4 as I'm writing this. However, I feel it very necessary to voice my personal opinion on the Brothers Winchester.Supernatural follows the story of the aforementioned Brothers Winchester hailing from Lawerence, Kansas: Sam (played by Jared Padalecki) and Dean (played by wisecracking Jensen Ackles) on their journey to find their father and destroy any of the meddling supernatural occurrences that may plague the people of America. (At least, this is the premise of season 1). Their journeys take them all across America, hunting down creatures such as Ghosts, Reapers, Shtriga (vampiric witches), Shapeshifters, and even several urban legends! And that's all just in Season 1. Seasons 2 and 3 are packed with even more baddies for the Brothers to hunt down and slay, with season 4 heating up the action with a coming war between Heaven and Hell... things are just getting started for the Winchesters.So tune in and ride along in their cherry '67 Chevy Impala, and join the world of Supernatural."
589,Def. one of the BEST horror/sci-fi/etc. shows I have seen. This show reminds of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I loved that show. Being extremely bored one day and trying to watch some media...I stumbled on a ad for Supernatural. Decided to check out either this or Smallville. Rating a whopping 9.1 I decided to hit this up.I became hooked. Sam and Dean are very great characters. Two brothers just fighting evil. This show seems to focus on other things (as in creatures) at the beginning while reminding you of the entire plot. Showing us bits and pieces until the end of the season where they go full force into it.
590,"For the past 3 and a half seasons, Supernatural has kept me at the edge of my seat. Each episode is like a puzzle to a greater Supernatural Mystery. One of the things I love the most about the show is the camaraderie between actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki who's real life friendship translates into a superbly believable brotherly love on screen. The series mixes Supernatural horror (and I do mean horror) with a sense of humor now and then. The funniest of course comes from Ackles' smart ass Dean Winchester. The down to Earth drama is brought on by Padalecki's Sam Winchester. These two actors put me in tears when their dad died and later when Sam was killed (momentarily in season 2) and later in season 3 when Dean was killed. Recently Dean confessed to his brother that he hacked into people's souls while in hell working for the dark side. The acting was so incredible and the emotion so heartfelt that it melted any fan of this show's heart. If you haven't watched it, go buy the DVD sets. I've probably gone through season 1 and 2 twice."
591,"Supernatural can be watched from a multitude of perspectives, but I like to boil it down to two things: 1. Horror, thrills, action, it's often been characterized as a mini-horror movie per episode. 2. Family-drama & brotherly love.It's in some ways a male-version of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", except not wholly. Because this show goes beyond one town. It travels the whole of the United States, and seems to focus on the Midwest. Which I think is awesome! Not simply because I live in Chicago, but because so many TV-shows seem to forget about all that country that lies between the West and East coasts!I can't properly express why I love this show so much. Maybe because it covers a that spectrum from horror, to drama, to comedy? Maybe because I do love the whole myths, lore, fantasy, etc stuff?! Perhaps it's the amazing chemistry between the brothers and actors Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki)? This show is simply fantastic, the best, awesome, and I really hope the CW feels the fans' love - because it would be a tragedy if this show was forced to halt before Eric Kripke (the creator) intends it to!"
592,"When Supernatural first came out in '05, I was intrigued, but I decided against watching it. I'm not a scary movie person (just the commercials for The Grudge gave me nightmares for weeks) and it came on late, so I just kind of gave up. Besides, the main draw at the time was Jared Padalecki as a star, since I'd learned to love him on Gilmore Girls.Then, just this summer ('08), my best friend Corri shows up at school ranting about this AMAZING new show called Supernatural and how I HAVE to watch it. After weeks of coaxing, she slept over at my house and we started watching her first season box set.I screamed, I clutched her arm, and I buried my head in her shoulder several times. Yes, the show is scary, but nothing was so bad that I couldn't knock out later, so I took it as a good sign. Besides, it was a good show - funny, definitely entertaining, and kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat!...well, futon, anyway.The first season, I admit, wasn't anything super-special as far as plot. Most of the episodes were pretty much stand-alones, with only ever a few minutes of important or necessary dialogue, but I didn't care. What had captured my interest (and Corri's) was the relationship between the characters.Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have THE best chemistry of any two actors I have ever seen. They play estranged brothers who grew up with nothing but social barriers and only each other. The raw emotion that pours from them both - especially in their scenes together but in their solo scenes as well - is downright haunting (definitely more so than any spirit they vanquish! *silence* yeah, I really should stop trying to be funny...). They start off seeming like very simple characters in a very simple show, but it becomes apparent very quickly that they are anything but. The layers they reveal as time goes on - like I said, haunting! If you have watched some of the first season and were disappointed at all, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and keep going. If you get into the second season and you still aren't enjoying yourself, please seek immediate medical attention (just not at the Roosevelt Asylum ^^...it's a first season episode joke, sorry). If nothing else, pick things up at the end of second season and treat yourself to the third. That season, while hilarious and heartwarming at times, is also downright chilling.Now, go settle in with your favorite blankie, spread some salt around your doors and windows, and enjoy some of the greatest hours you'll ever spend in front of the TV. Oh, and you had better be eating pie! ^^ ~ Alex Starr, ardent Supernatural supporter and Wincest Fan ^^ I love you, Jensen Ackles O-O"
593,This is the best show on TV right now and I read that this is going to go up to Season 7 or something like that and I hope it's true because I don't know what i'll do if this show ends.. I hardly watch TV but this is one show that I will watch constantly. This show just basically started and it's to early to end it.. People are just starting to know that the show exist.. You can't end it now when people are getting into it.. I hope that the writers read these comments and realize how much we want this show to go on because this is a show that you can't miss if your into that whole thing.. So please don't make this the final season and keep it going.. It's just getting good and the actors are amazing.
594,"Up to 4 days ago I had never seen a single episode of Supernatural, I had not even seen a trailer or any footage of it whatsoever. I had heard of it, but that was it. I was in my a DVD shop and they were having a closing down sale, i saw the Supernatural box-set containing the ""Complete 3 Seasons"" for just 40 dollars.I have since watched the first season and WOW what a series. Ever since the X-Files ended in 2002 there had been something missing from my weekly TV and this has now filled that space. I can't believe I have all 3 seasons sitting on my shelf waiting to be seen. If you have not seen Supernatural before, then go out and get it, it's sorta like X-Files meets Millennium, i have not seen a bad episode yet, and the acting is top notch."
595,"I have to say that this is the best TV show on right now. Every episode is like a thrilling roller-coaster ride. It combines brilliant action scenes with awesome special effects and a great storyline, making it a masterpiece. Anyone who likes fantasy will love this show. It has demons, summonings, magic, a huge range of supernatural beings taken from mythology all over the world and as the show progresses, the methods of killing become more brutal and filled with cool special effects. The genre itself is a mixture of fantasy and a bit of horror....but its not really frightening - more of a thriller actually.Besides the action, its filled with witty banter between the two brothers which can often be hilarious. Dean especially is filled with sarcastic, smart alec comments which just crack me up all the time.The first half of the first season is not as great as the later episodes but trust me it improves a lot. In approximately the first 10 episodes of Season 1, the show follows a kind of set formula, with the brothers investigating different monsters each episode and killing them. These episodes are still quite entertaining, but its after this that the story really starts to develop, and if you continue to watch it, you will be hooked.Basically, people who liked shows like Smallville, Moonlight or the 4400 (shows involving special abilities) will be addicted to Supernatural."
596,"I used to be a huge fan of shows like Buffy, Angel, Charmed, and Freakylinks. Obviously three of those four are no longer on the air, and I can't stand Rose McGowan's constant idiocy. But all that aside, Supernatural is a great show. Although I was a little skeptic myself coming into the show, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki's chemistry makes for very funny and/or awkward moments.For those of you at home who see this show as ""ripping off"" some other movie or using some old fiction novel... Take a moment to realize that is a big part of what the show is supposed to be about. All of those things that aren't real and go ""bump"" in the night are real."
597,"If You Have Not Seen This Show Buy All The Seasons From 1 And Get Caught Up On This Show..Trust Me You'll Love It!!! If You Don't I Don't Know What To Say It Follows Urban Legends ""True Things People Claim To Think Is Real"" Great Actors Jensen And Jered Work Great Together A Great Special Effects Team For A Television Show Great Directors And So On. It Just Going To Get Better So You Better Get Into Before It's Over And Hopefully Not For Like 8 - 10 Seasons, This Show Can Not Go Dull Never Has A Down Point Because When It Starts It Just Pickup Big Time Right There Or In The Beginning To The End Of The Show, FOX Is Trying To Match This Show With Their New Series Fringe It's Good Don't Get Me Wrong But Supernatural Blows Mostly Everything Out The Water!!!"
598,"Without a doubt - 10/10. Supernatural is one of the BEST films I have ever seen. The 'cases' are believable, as are the characters - some of the 'cases' are actually scary. I'm still having nightmares after the thing that feeds off children and poses as a doctor *shudder*. Supernatural is an utter joy to watch, I have no problems sitting and watching the box sets for hours! The pure amount of research that must have gone into the fiends that surround the cases shows and makes the reader more interested and satisfied. The only problem I have with Supernatural is that some of the 'cases' are solved too quickly or easily and not many do this, but for the ones that do, it slightly ruins it. I strongly recommend this show to anyone - it has a scary side, a truthful side, a plot line running throughout...all whilst maintaining realism."
599,"Supernatural is the show is back to talking about horror being also funny, as only Buffy did. I will council in a spasmodic way, but you feel, that you like the horror, is not particularly bloody (sure, some scene not save), but to those who do not like the genre I do not think will affect. Dean and Sam Winchester are my new two heroes,and I can not stay longer without knowing what happens to them. And then, then...there is Dean!! Jensen Ackles is absolutely fantastic in the role that suits most of all, more than Smallville and Dawson's creek: he is so cute, funny, but brave and strong at the same time...Maybe he is the reason why I watch supernatural? No, i assure you:) Watch it and i will understand me."
600,"That song is from Styx. See the lyrics at http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/styx/renegade.html. They picked a song that was SOOOOOOOOO right on. Agreed that this was a wonderful script and acting. This show just keeps getting better.What's scariest, I think, is that there's an FBI agent and his team that are making getting these two's arrest their mission and have done WAY more investigation on Dean and Sam than the boys could have imagined. So where can they go from there?So the next episodes (up to the 100-episode mark when it's best marketable in syndication) needs to build on not just the pursuit of the supernatural and the expansion of Sam's ""power,"" but also on evasion. To do that, I think, they need to be able to build better alliances with people who can help them or support them in ways like their father and his friends did. And if the FBI joins them, then it starts looking too much like X-Files (which was also filed in Vancouver for awhile)."
601,"I usually check IMDb for episode cast list, just to see who everyone is each episode. I did notice that IMDb is listing Summer Glau as Angela in Episode 4 of Season 2 and it's NOT correct. The girl who plays Angela is some new actress called Tamara Feldman. I want to know how to contact IMDb to correct it. And also to fill up 10 lines of writing I must add how AMAZING Supernatural is. Everyone on that show,whether it's cast, crew, writers, etc are so talented. It's difficult to find this caliber of show on TV. Jensen and Jared are outstanding and brilliant to watch. They are both extremely talented and not too bad on the eyes, I must say(Jensen, you are BEAUTIFUL!) I think thats 10 lines."
602,"This show had as much potential as any monster-of-the-week series that preceded it. Namely, The X-Files (early seasons), Night Stalker, Night Gallery, etc. Supernatural, however, is written in such a way as to make it nearly impossible to watch without getting the overwhelming urge to change the channel. The show moves along too slowly and somehow lacks the suspense needed to carry a drama like this. Only the supernaturally gorgeous Jensen Ackles makes this show so popular and watchable. I have to admit that I only leave it on in the background so I can admire the actor, but the dialog and story lines are insufferable. The acting for the most part is decent; the actors just need better material to work with."
603,"This is just a really good show, first season is absolutely brilliant, then as the seasons go on, more depth around seasons 7 and 8 it started to flag, but from season 9 it got damn good.Jared and Jensen make the perfect duo their characters are just different to other tv characters, more loving and damn cool, misha is a real good angel, he plays Cas and hard to believe he was meant to be a few episodes onlyJim beaver is a Brilliant character actor who took the boy in as a father figure.The real star is Chevy impala 'Baby' no more needs to be said about her.
Sad it's due to end.Supernatural will always'Carry On'"
604,I just love this show I love how there is gore horror different creatures and more. This show is my top one you will love this show it the best
605,"I have seen far too many 10/10 reviews for this show, which is really sad considering once upon a time it was a 10 out of 10 show. But its been a decade since those days. I consider myself a true fan of the show, someone who was there since the beginning, all the way back in 2005, I truly loved this show & the family dynamic woven thoughout the early seasons with a compelling over arching story & characters who weren't at this time parodies of themselves,The show unarguably peaked in season 5 with the finale Swan Song, being a fitting send off for the characters we have spent 5 years with. Then season 6 came along, Admittedly I still watched & partially enjoyed season 6 but found myself thinking, How do you top throwing down with the Devil himself? That was easy you don't. That was one of the major problems with the show, You can't get a bigger big bad then Lucifer. One of the problems, more on that later.The other major problems is mortality of the characters (Or immortality I should say) There is no feeling or need to worry about the characters safety or death, as ALL of the central cast have died & came back so many times its been played out so many times that ""death"" the biggest threat for any shows character is now a minor inconvenience rather than a fate. Back in the days of season 2 I remember how shocked & upset I was when Sam was mortally wounded in the penultimate episode of season 2, Season 3 should have been a sign when Dean was killed repeatedly in a throw away but hilarious episode Mystery Spot. Cut to Season 7 because I don't want to carry on with this rant I know the main characters have died & come back throughout those seasons, but another major character supposedly dies & this seemed legit. Shocking? Yes! Sad? A little! Should I have been? No because he came back (As a ghost that same damned season)That is one of the biggest problems with the show when death is used as a plot device rather than a threat it takes away from the characters, when they're in peril its just a set back to be killed on this show when you got an angel in your back pocket.Enough about that lets start on the biggest problem with the show. Toxic fans! You know who I am talking about? You're typical basement dweller who spends their time on message boards & forums whining about who their ""favourite"" character should be with, I saw a comic-con awhile back on YouTube where Jenson Ackles is visibly angry with these parasites & shook my head thinking. Your why I don't bother this show anymore. I legit despise these kind of fans as they have played a major part in ruining this shows credibility too, with their entitlement, Back in the day a fan watches a show & either enjoys it or doesn't with Supernatural they can b#tch & moan until they get their way. like a child stomping their feet, this behavior is rewarded with Supernatural for years now as fans have basically become glorified writers for the show with their slash fic fantasies played out on the small screen.I haven't bothered with the show for a few years now as I have stated above but I did witness them bringing back old villains most notably Lucifer as they retread old ground, I do have a friend who still watches the show while even she admits its quality has diminished she still insists I give it another shot.I very nearly did until she told me who the big bad was the final season. God himself. I nearly fell down laughing, asking Chuck??? A hack writer is the ""big bad""? I rolled my eyes when I came across some fan going crazy about how amazing & foreshadowed Chuck being evil was. No it was not. it wasn't even remotely hinted at. Its just a desperate move by writers who have written themselves into a corner so they insist ""Oh this guy's the biggest threat evers"" Sigh this is exhausting & sad at the same time as I said this show was once great & ended fittingly in season 5. It was almost the perfect finale & one of the best I personally had ever seen. Now if I was to watch this season i can say without the shadow of a doubt it WILL NOT have the same impact as it did 10 years ago. Diminishing returns play a part in finales too look at Lost for example. The finale won't end with a bang, nor a whimper. It'll be a fart on the breeze & that is truly sad."
606,FULL pretentious social justice warriors and. Dean kept them both alive on poker whole of their lives an sam wins when TV comes on it ??? touche.one good show. Dont kill it to prove libchuts are better. Who is writing the script i wanna know the name and who is she sleeping with . will clear most of the junk once you clean the trash.
607,"Thanks to all the cast and crew and everyone who made this masterpiece possible, words will never describe how much good this show and this fandom have done in this world, it's not just a fandom, It's family.
#SPNfamily"
608,The first 5 seasons are a masterpiece. The two main actors are very talented.
609,"I love, no I adore this show. It has everything you need and more... Suggesting it to everyone 😍"
610,"Supernatural is AMAZING!!!
The best TV show I have ever watched. I am obsessed."
611,I have watched this show multiple times I can not get enough I wish it wasn't ending
612,I watched it 2 years ago and it's still so good! I remember how I watched it during my work breaks hahah
613,Every season just keeps getting better and better. Every situation these two brothers come across keeps everyone on their toes. Never gets boring! I've watched every season twice now and do not plan on stopping there. Would absolutely recommend!!!!!!
614,"Even after 15 years this show still blows my mind with unexpected twists and amazing brotherly moments. Well acted , written and directed and i am so sad that it's ending , The End of an Era! I hope we see more of them in the future :("
615,"I Started watching this show 4 years ago i remember i binged watched all the 10 seasons in only one month that's mean almost 8 episodes a day... I know i have no life lol but damn you will get hooked after the first episode even tho i hate scary or jump scary stuff but the brilliant stories and the different kind of monsters and the relationship between the two brothers you feel like you're a part of this family and the show and believe me i watched ton of Series(Got,TWD,Breaking Bad,Stranger things etc,,,) but Supernatural have a special place in my heart and to this date I wait every Thursday to watch this awesome and amazing Tv show."
616,"I don't care what anyone says, this show is and will always be a top favorite for me. Yes, the ending could have been better, however, with quarantine and lockdown, there was only so much that could be done. I think it's the best ending with what they had to work with. Also, whether you liked the ending or not, it should not make you suddenly hate the last 15 years of the show. Still an amazing show!! STILL A FAVORITE!!!"
617,"I am a very big fan of Supernatural. I started watching it one year ago, and there were times where I would watch an entire season in day or two. The topic is obviously supernatural, and it all starts with two brothers trying to find out what killed their mother. First 5 seasons are brilliant. It was scary like it should be considering this is a horror series, it had suspense, the plot was very interesting and it was really a show I loved. It had a lot of typical monsters like ghosts, demons, angels and vampires, but it also had some legendary monsters from mythology and folklore like Bloody Mary. Also, the comedy in the show was brilliant. But after five excellent seasons, I feel like the show has been going downhill. There were some funny episodes, but my problem with this show is that it has lost all the scary suspense it has had. I am still watching it though, because I do want some closure to all of this. So, if you are new to this and haven't seen it, take a look. You won't be sorry, and who knows? Maybe you will even like the seasons 6- 10 more than I do."
618,"Love Dean so much, it's sad seeing it ends. Had been following this since I was young"
619,"This show is amazing,I just love it.I do not really watch T.V shows and I have never been obsessed with any of them.But I love Supernatural,it is epic.If you like horror flicks and sci-fi you are going to enjoy it.It is by a margin the greatest tv series I have ever seen."
620,"As a 10 years fan of this show, I can tell that Supernatural is the best tv show in the past decade and a half. Incredible acting/writing/directing. 10/10"
621,"Supernatural is one of those shows that can just fall into your lap and end up becoming a favorite series to watch and binge. Thats exactly what happened to me one day while i was browsing Direct tvs terrible and extremely repetative lineups when for really no reason i stopped on this show called Supernatural on TNT playing the re-runs. It did not take long to intrigue and before i knew it, I was going through seasons like crazy, like i said, falls into your lap like a cute puppy!
So basically Supernatural brings the paranormal, folklore, and urban legends all together in one show and to real life, and the only protectors of innocents are flesh and blood humans called ""Hunters"". No one knows for sure how many hunters their really are, but we do learn that the number of demons heavilly outnumber hunters, and the hunters numbers continue to be fewer and fewer with every death by the demon army.
Thus enter our hunter heroes of the show, the Winchesters. Brothers Sam and Dean were expertly trained by their former marine dad, John Winchester played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The brothers personallities could not be more different, Dean the oldest is mostly emotionless when it comes to killing members of the occult seeing it as his job and duty, Sam on the otherhand is more rational and tries harder to save those who want to change and not be evil anymore this results in the brothers butting heads often but we soon learn their greatest weakness is the extreme brotherly love they have for eachother.
*My last note: I dont normally fall for a show so quickly but Supernatural has quickly become one of my favorites and i pondered why that is. My conclusion, with all due respect to the entire cast(especially Jensen and Padelcki) is i feel the show gets great acting performances from these actors that are not greatly known. Jensen and Padelcki are very believable and have great range from seriousness to comediac relief and of course there is Bobby(Jim Beaver) who i think does a spectacular job of acting in this show and is like the boys 2nd father; thanks for reading and hope you liked the review!"
622,"This show reminds me of Are You Afraid of the Dark but for the older crowd. I love how each episode isn't over complicated while still being interesting. Some of the episodes are actually quite scary/creepy. I generally don't binge watch TV series, but this one always traps me and I have to watch at least 4 episodes if I turn it on."
623,"Never ending action, but... How many pages of script is filled with Sam's panting?
Im doing a rerun of all seasons and this panting has become an issue."
624,"This tv show/boxset is absolutly amazing, after 3 episodes i was hooked, and its great that its lasted so long, now waiting for the 15th season.I dont normally write reviews, but felt i had to for this. Its exciting, really good bits of humour (castielle in the show is hilarious) , and the show will give u a few jumps too. Lots of twists and turns.Dont be put off by the slow start, as the main storyline takes a few episodes to build. You will be rewarded if u stick with :) , i promise !!"
625,"I agree season 15 should be the end. It has become repetitious and a wee bit tiring to see one set of ethics for the Winchesters who don't allow the same set for anyone else, although I know this is one of the themes, after this many years people evolve and they haven't.SPOILERS for instance, in season 14, Jack is suddenly bad because he sent the snake to heaven and killed Nick. I would have killed Nick, too. Not only was he a killer of many innocent people, he was never going to stop trying to raise Lucifer, and we already learned he knew how to do this successfully. Yes, he needed to die just like any other monster. But... only Winchester's can kill monsters ethically.Hunts were all rehashes of other hunts, and ethics were selective and the way the plots are acted out in season 14, it appears the Winchesters pushed Jack into thinking he was bad, instead of being supportive and nurturing. Tired of talks that aren't really talks and etc. So, yes time to end. But is was a very very good ride."
626,What can I say but not damn. Nothing like hot guys trying to save the world by getting rid of the supernatural.
627,"This is honestly one of the best shows I've seen in a while, even though it has 15 seasons (or will have anyways) it doesnt get old or boring AT ALL. I cant count the number of times I have cried or laughed with this boys.
This review is just to say I love this show, and you all should give it a chance! You wont regret it.P.S is there someplace where I can give Mary Winchester -10stars??"
628,"I've never absences with a show until I started watching Supernatural. This show has everything...excitement, danger, scary moments that get turned into humor, it will leave u constantly laughing. I have rewatched every season at least 12 times. It never gets old. I love it..."
629,"I started watching this show and have taken a break but always come back because I love the story, I love seeing the U.S. its small towns, Canada, I love the characters, I love this show. It's one of a kind and so many other shows have used this show and created off-shoots. This show is like the database of Supernatural, the music is good, the two main characters are perfect and it's made in the U.S.A & Canada."
630,You guys rock. Don't ever stop. Every season is better and I love the quirky episodes you thrown in also.
631,I honestly find that some people are too picky every show has its bad seasons and yes supernatural has had a few but it's also had some pretty frickin amazing ones too. This show is so addicting and it's easy to fall in love with. Like syfi? Don't want a ton of love drama? Then unnatural is the show for you! ;)
632,"I watch this in the morning and it's mostly reruns. I've seen some of the nightly episodes so I know some of what's going on in the show now. I can't wait to catch up on the episodes I missed! The show pulls you in right at the start by doing the ""then"" and the ""now."" It's a fascinating show and I love it!"
633,"This is the best show I've ever seen in my entire life... the brothers, the bond, the hunting, the family, the love.... Best show in the world"
634,ITS AMAZING AND SUPER FUN! Dean and Sam are great characters and the show has awesome storylines
635,This series is worth watching and is great. Acting is perfect and story.
636,I only started watching last year and have watched seasons 1-13 two times already
637,Supernatural is my favourite show I've ever watched. The brotherhood relationship is what makes the show so unique.
638,"Best tv show ever, I've never seen anything like this before
Great actors
Best cast"
639,Thats potion brew that makes me love this show forever.
640,"Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, along with the whole cast and crew, skillfully give the audience the perfect escape from everyday life. Each season maintains the necessary balance between what we came to love and new concepts. The chemistry amidst the whole production shines through the screen creating one of the best shows out there. It's funny, thrilling, and downright lovable. It's no wonder they are on there 14th season and I wish them many more."
641,"I know nothing good last forever but I'll make an exception when it comes to supper natural. Even when this show is bad, It's soo good at it that it ends up being good. I just love it simple as an American hot pie with ice cream on top. If that makes sense."
642,I absolutely loving this series since my childhood. The writers did an amazing job with the casting. I haven't seen such an amazing series in years! Sam and Dean were absolutely made for their roles. This series is interesting and emotionally too.
643,Watch as Sam and Dean kill monsters this is the meaning of life ;)
644,"I never thought after 14 years that a show like this would still be good. The main cast and supporting cast only get better as the show goes on, and while seasons 1 thru 5 are arguably the best, the cast in later seasons become even more charming and funny. I never get tired of the sam/dean/castiel dynamic. Can't wait for more! Do thankful the cast have been happy to stick it out for so long!"
645,"Great series, love it. The commradery between the brothers and in the later series between other lead characters is awesome. The only real disappointment is when they brought Mary Winchester into play. Sorry Mary, but you ruin a lot of the episodes... luckily Dean,Sam,Cass,Crowly and even Lucifer, cancel out your bad role and sorry to say, bad acting. Again such a great series if you're into the supernatural genre"
646,Love this series ao much...123456789 101 11 12 13 ❤💙💚💛💜❤💙💚💛💜💜❤💙💚💛💜❤💚💙
647,So many fight good and bad hell unbelieve never has book of supernatural stuff.. better the grimm the brother slayer hunter..
648,"This is a great show, as it is always interesting and entertaining!"
649,"Absolutely favorite show EVER, hands down. Don't know what I will do when they decide to end it. Thank you to Jared, Jensen, Misha, Mark and the rest of the amazing cast, for making one of the most Incredible shows of all time!"
650,One of my all time favourite shows. Cannot recommend this enough!!! Do it and join the SPN Family. Team free will!

652,"I've been watching first episode since it aired. Never missed a who and re watched it so many times. Strong and hilarious chemistry between the trio. 
 After the last season with the British men of letters I thought this show was at its end. didn't really think much of it and though they had truly run out of ideas. It isn't as comedic as the some of the other seasons. But season 13 was AWESEOME! The best ever so far!!!. I can't wait and I hope it never ends. The new kid Jack fits in perfectly."
653,"I stumbled across this brilliant show by accident. I like ghost stories & stories about monsters, also I like classic cars. The title caught my attention, then I saw that 67 Impala. That was all it took, I was hooked. These two brothers & their adventures together have really made a huge impression in my life. I had breast cancer & need a distraction & this amazing little show did that for me. And after seeing all the things the characters were going through I thought, if they can do it so can I. Keep fighting that is. I will watch this show & it's motely crew until the very end & then I will be so sad that it had to end."
654,"Well, to those wanting a series that has it all, Supernatural is surely your pick. I've been watching it for 13 years and, quite frankly, I just can't get enough. The show has terror, humor, real life based lore, it teaches us valuable life lessons, and also has an awesome plot, not mentioning the awesome actors.
I remember the first episode i saw, it glued me to the screen straight away, and i still feel like it 13 seasons later. Some people say it should end because it has been on air for too long... i have to disagree. Until the writers have awesome stories, until the fans keep loving the episodes, and until the actors continue putting their hearts into the show, i think it will still have the same glory as keeps on having since day 1, in 2005.
Watch it, you wont regret it! :D"
655,"I grow up with this show,i love it with all my heart"
656,Amazing series seen it over and over again love every season and episode of it. I highly recommend this to watch it's amazing !
657,"I first started watching Supernatural in 2012 because my new roommate told me it was a good show to get into.
Even though I was interested after the first two episodes, it took me until the third season to really get into the show and now I am addicted to the show.
Jared, Jensen and Misha are a great team of actors, I really enjoy and appreciate their work, but I do have other favorites. Mark Sheppard and Ruth Connell, I love the way they hate and love each other. I hope Mark Shepard is somehow back in the show,. Jim Beaver, Osric Chau, Kim Rhodes, Mark Pelligrino, Rob Benedict, Richard Speight Jr., Julian Richings, are just a few who have all done spectacular work. There are too many actors to name who have made this show so good, but my favorite characters so far are Andrew Wheeler (Alastair) so much suspense and Briana Buckmaster (Sheriff Donna Hanscum) she always makes me laugh.
Thank you to all actors and writers for putting your time and effort into this great show. Please, keep up the great work!
I hope to have the chance to meet you all at one of the Supernatural Conventions."
658,"My favorite character is Dean Winchester & Jensen Ackles is the perfect fit. Jared Padalacki did justice to his role as Dean's younger brother. Both of them really make us feel they're brothers for real. No excess brotherly emotions yet their love is expressed perfectly. Mark Sheppard is another excellent character on the show. I liked the name Crowley ,named after Alistair Crowley-""Book of Lies"" guy. Misha Collins was a good fit to play Castiel. Overall the cast of this show is really good. I can watch another 10 seasons of Supernatural. This stuff doesn't get old. Probably the only Supernatural genre TV show to run for this long. Wonder why Emmy hasn't been given to this show yet! Supernatural deserves at least 5 Emmy Awards."
659,"I am going to start this review by saying that I love Supernatural. We all have ""that one show"" we think is the best show in the world and Supernatural is that show to me. Why? Because I love how the directors have created two amazing characters and found the best possible actors to fill in the roles. I have to say that Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are doing more than amazing job in playing Dean and Sam Winchester! Now let's focus more on the show itself. Supernatural is the show that showed me many things, but mainly - it showed me that ""family doesn't end with blood""! Everyone, no matter if they watched it or not, who have heard anything about Supernatural, knows that the main thing here (or at least in my opinion) is the strong connection between Sam and Dean. Connection, that shows how much it means to have a sibling, who you love more than everything. Connection, stronger than everything else. This made me think about some things in life, made me rethink some of my points of view, made me look at the world with different eyes. I was going through some rough times and Supernatural was the only thing that kept me going. I've looked deeper in Jensen Ackles' character (Dean Winchester) and I saw how much we have in common, so to speak. I saw he was dealing with life and with all the problems (despite the monsters), and this gave me the strength I needed to keep going, to keep fighting. To face every problem, no matter how bad the situation is, no matter how much it hurts, no matter how afraid I am ... as long as I keep fighting - the battle is not over, not until I either win or die.I strongly recommend this show to everyone, no matter if you like drama, horror, action, comedy, sarcasm, fantasy ... we have them all, just give Supernatural a chance and thank me later."
660,"Christo, the utterance used in episode 1 that was supposed to make Demons show their black eyes. This is the first show I've ever binge watched. I am now just caught up on season 11. It has taken me a couple years to get here. At one point this was THE BEST show I have ever seen and would watch it over anything else of the time. Sam and Dean are fun and outside of the show, Misha/Jenson/Jared are amazing guys to hang out with. GISHWES is a fun event too every year. They really took time in delivering every single biblical, folklore, urban legend, monster story that has ever been told in a fresh exciting way. Dean is someone I would aspire to be. Good clean show, though I don't know if kids younger than teens should be watching it."
661,"Probably the only review i will ever write. This is my favourite series of all time. So much fun to re-watch too. A Chevy Impala, 2 fantastic lead actors and an amazing soundtrack. I love the variety of episodes and although the first 6 seasons are the very best, every episode continues to keep you interested and pushes boundaries you can't believe can be pushed any further. I love the attitude and the way this reminds me of how i actually relate and banter with my own little brother. The main event, the showstopper of all shows, the most electrifying event of the century. This is without a shadow of a doubt THE show to watch above all others. I hope they keep going for many years to come!"
662,"Although some people say that Supernatural contains a lot of scary episodes, I believe that most of us can handle the scary parts even if we're not big fans of scary movies. The actors, the plot, the scenery, everything contributes to this amazing TV show. The chemistry between the actors is one of the greatest factors that this TV show goes so well. Over the years they've bonded and they give their best performance in every single episode. What makes Supernatural so interesting is that it's not only fantasy and horror but also drama, comedy and many other kinds that attract a lot of people to watch. One more thing that makes this show so fun to watch is that it even offers many reliable information and facts about mythic creatures and not only. For me, it's one of the best TV series (maybe the best) out of the 12 series I've been watching so far and I'm not even considered to be a fantasy/horror lover. I highly recommend it!"
663,"The SPNFamily is amazing. It deserves more recognition. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are amazing. They can go from kicking ass to being hilarious. There's also a great balance between action and emotional moments. It's great that this show focuses on the importance of family which many shows today lack. I think the fact that this show has survived for over ten years and is going into the 12th season shows how wonderful the cast, crew, and writers are. There have been some tough seasons, but they have also survived a transition from the WB to the CW and a number of presidents, which I think shows the resilience of the show and the talent of the actors and writers. This show deserves 10/10 and as Jared would say #AlwaysKeepFighting"
664,I don't say this ever about a supporting actor but Curtis Armstrong (aka Gods Scribe) should win an Emmy for a part in Season 11 Episode 20 when he is telling Chuck (aka God) that humans are better then him (god) because they never give up. Great acting an Emmy worthy performance and very moving. I put my vote in for best supporting actor roll in a TV series 2016 for this Episode. This performance got me off balance because it is done with a great amount of passion and great acting. It is also not a short take. Curtis puts out there you rarely see from a supporting actor that makes you wish he was allowed bigger roles in acting. A great highlight for his career. You have to see this Episode. He deserves an Emmy!
665,"First of all, I have seen so many of these reviews comparing Supernatural to X Files. Duh they are 2 different shows and never really claiming to be the same.... and 2... the similarities are founded since the producer/director finished the X Files and came over Supernatural (prior to his death which the boys have said many times hit them very hard)! Now... as far as all those saying the show has jumped the shark... I myself have thought that maybe it had gone off the rails. But after a few more episodes to bring things back into focus, I get back on board. They really do their homework when it comes to ""religious history"" and obscure references and do so without advocating any sort of religion and many times have the boys even questioning their own ""faith"".They usually have a couple of emotionally heavy episodes then sorta interject something lighter so that you are not always drained. Maybe because I am an ""older"" fan (not your typical 25 and under fangirl being almost 50) I can say that there is more to being a fan. I am not one to be into ComicCons or conventions but I am attending my first Supernatural Con this year to show my gratitude and support. As cheesy as it my sound they helped me deal with my sister's murder. Their fandom is devoted and their dedication to worthy causes is beyond contention. I will watch til they take it off"
666,"A television show nearly extinguished has become truly distinguished, not only breaking ground but forever defining TV. Supernatural continues to be both astounding and mesmerizing as true talent ignites from a brilliant cast and crew, and with intensity are we still captivated along intricate lines of the Winchester boys. Granted, we know that all good things must come to an end, but legacy will forever be left behind, feeding the beast of intense need for all things that go bump in the night and opening the door for television shows such as Grimm, Sleepy Hollow, and even iZombie. We might still be terrorized by the hell hounds of Reality TV, but the Supernatural lives on."
667,"Supernatural... what can i say about it... it's the most incredible, awesome,amazing horror/drama/fantasy TV series ever!I loved it from the beginning. The episodes are brilliant and i love (mostly)Dean(Jensen Ackles) and Sam(Jared Padalecki). They act like real life brothers and you can't imagine their chemistry!I love it because Dean and Sam make me laugh,relax, the action is amazing and every episode it's sort of a mystery because the brothers have to deal with evil creatures/monsters.But another thing that makes me adore ""Supernatural"" is the fraternal love of Dean and Sam that can tackle everything... you will understand what i'm saying when you watch it... I don't know what else to say... definitely a 10 because...it's SUPERNATURAL!! and i mean 10 seasons...it has to be really good!!!"
668,"(Minor Spoilers) This show is so fantastic in so many ways. I have watched every episode, and it very rarely doesn't fully deliver. This show is under no way a family show. It has gore, violence, uncountable wincest references, sexual inuendo, alcohol, and swearing. But this show has the perfect mixture of humour (Cass' inability to understand human's behavior), drama (the brother occasionally rocky relation), and horror (windino episode still scares me). This is a show that you should watch by yourself or with good friends. The first episode gets you hooked, and slowly pulls you into the rich mythos and characters10/10. A must watch for anybody that loves cult TV.(season 1-8 are on Netflix if you need to know)"
669,"Where can you even begin with a show that has been on the air this long, has a fan base this wide, and a scope this encompassing? It's nearly impossible, so I want to give a nod to all the people who have reviewed it before me.I want to start by saying that I know the show has its flaws. There are accusations of fan-baiting, more than one shark has been jumped, and do not even get me started on the lack of living women on the show. I know all of this. I've read the social justice blogs and I have participated in the fan debates. I'm not here to talk about those things.I'm here to talk about the fact that a woman who died decades before the start of the show is the driving force behind making these boys do what they do for, at the very least, the nine years it has been on the air. I'm here to talk about the strength in every woman that has ever come on the show, even if it was showcasing the strength to love a man as damaged as Dean Winchester, and then the strength to know when she had to walk away. I'm here to talk about the amazing love between two brothers, who don't let the world's idea that men shouldn't be so close to another get in the way of their bond. Yes, Wincest abounds, but that is NOT what I am talking about. I am referring to the fact that these brothers have literally moved heaven, hell, and everything in between to save each other again and again. The writers pull off the inevitable melodrama with a deep understanding of why it's there, and they balance it almost perfectly with irreverent humor that that are more than willing to aim back at themselves, their actors, and the show itself. The actors involved are all down to earth, well-rounded people who know that their fans have made them what they are, and are not afraid to show their love for the people who support them. The cast has been together so long that even actors whose characters have been killed off come to cons to talk with fans.My biggest concern is where the show is going to go next. They've faced down their father's death, Satan and Michael, the Four Horseman, the demon that killed their mother, the loss of (almost) their entire support network, their own deaths (repeatedly), Leviathan, Lillith, Eve, and a hotel full of Pagan Gods. I can not even imagine what they have left to fight, unless they end the series with God's reappearance."
670,"I have been watching Supernatural since it's Pilot in 2005. I was hooked from the get go. Sam and Dean have a magnificent chemistry that allows them to walk from set to real life and back without missing a beat. Now with the next season coming up, I have to wait for 2 months which will be hard, no doubt, but will be worth it because 8 seasons have come and gone and I still live for whatever night this fabulous show comes on. Good job, Supernatural- writers, cast members, everyone involved in the show. I've dealt with a lot of personal stuff throughout my life and this show makes it all seem like no big deal. It's so spiritual to me, it's ridiculous. As a Christian, I study it- the words, the acting, the Enochian information- everything and I have nothing negative to say whatsoever. Fan-Tas-Tic!"
671,"Supernatural is Super AWESOME. Two brothers (Dean and Sam) travel the country investigating supernatural type cases. The show has been on since 2005 and started with Dean requesting Sam's help with finding their father (John) who had gone missing. Sam had left the life of a ""hunter"" to focus on school and to be ""normal""; whereas Dean stuck close to dad in the family business. The show changes throughout the years, but I still love to watch. I love the classic rock music. The rock references they use when posing as federal agents.From yellow eye demands to Lucifer and the King of Hell to Castile ""an angel of the lord""; this show delivers. I will hate to see it end because no matter what you can enjoy beer drinking, cheese burger eating, car driving, joke making awesomeness of Dean Winchester and Sam's salad eating, conscious struggling, also beer drinking, sasquatch walking ways.If you like Shows like Buffy, check this out. You will not be disappointed."
672,"The story is about two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles). It begins when a demon kills their mother. Their father and them turn into hunters who kill supernatural things like monsters or ghosts. There is a scene where Dean says ""Saving people, hunting things... The family business"". Supernatural began being shot in 2004. Main Characters: Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki), Castiel (Misha Collins), Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), Ruby (Katie Cassidy/Genevieve Cortese).Until now there are 8 seasons. On the first one, the father of the boys is killed by the yellow eye demon named Azazel, the same demon who killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend.On the second season, Sam and Dean hunt this demon, besides other supernatural monsters. This time, and old friend of the family named Bobby Singer began to help the brothers on their hunting.Our group thinks that supernatural is an amazing show, because there is comedy, horror, adventure and, sometimes, drama. Also the songs that are played on this TV show are awesome. There are musical groups like Ac/DC and Asia."
673,"Supernatural on its own is my all-time favourite TV series. From the sassy attitude of Dean Winchester, to Sam Winchester's tear-filled emotional states, to Castiel, the angel of Thursday's blunt attitude and sarcasm issues, the characters in this series develop and grow into people that you could really believe exist, or could exist. They talk to people, dealing with the supernatural, but also problems that we go through in our everyday lives.Let us not forget that the imagination behind all of the episodes is amazing, making you want to watch them over and over, to see the next one, not able to wait another week for a new episode.I have to say, out of all of the seasons, Season 1 still remains my favourite. Meeting all of the characters for the first time is breathtaking. But this season, Season 5, is mind blowing in the ideas that they managed to come up with. Anyone with a passion for the unknown, mystery, hot guys, hot cars, or myths, will be sure to love this TV series."
674,"After 7 seasons the Supernatural series had some great moments that every fan of the show will remember.All begins when Dean's and Sam's father,John Winchester has been away for a ""hunting"" trip.The two brothers quickly get into the game and start searching for their missing father.At the beginning of season 2,their father dies and that's when all the fun starts.From season 3 to 7 Dean has gone to hell,Sam has gone to hell too,Dean and Sam find out that Sam has supernatural powers and after Sam's return from hell his soul has gone missing,generally,there are o lot of twists to the plot,and,there are not hard to follow,especially if you're a fan of the show.A lot of crazy things have happened during these 7 seasons and I believe that it would be wrong to reveal everything for those who haven't watched the show.Personally,I believe that the show is well-directed,has great sound and visual effects and the spooky atmosphere combined with the creatures that these two brothers fight is what makes this show special.Let's face it,it's a show that horror fans will love,it's content is unique.When was the last time that you watched ghosts,angels,demons and other evil creatures into one show?Never!It is also worth mentioning that the show has fun elements combined with classic rock music.The show has used some great old rock hits,like ACDC's Back in Black and Kansas' Carry on my wayward son.On January 12, 2012, the series won the two awards at the People's Choice Awards, which includes Best Sci-Fi TV Series and Best Drama TV Series.The show had many nominations through out the years and has won many remarkable awards.Finally,the show has been renewed for 3 more season,which means that the show will continue up to the 9th season."
675,"Supernatural is a brilliant TV show. Sam and Dean are as different as can be yet somehow they get along so well and their relationship is beautiful. Sam and Dean's undying love and loyalty for each other is something to envy. This show explores so many themes-- love, loss, bravery, loyalty, betrayal, addiction, fear, etc. But don't get the impression that Supernatural is all seriousness, it can be HILARIOUS as well. I would say that Castiel provides much comic relief, but Sam and Dean often mess with each other which is entertaining as well. Supernatural has made me cry and laugh many times. My only complaint for the show would be that it is beginning to become a little repetitive: Dean goes to hell and comes back right away, Sam goes to hell and comes back right away, then Dean goes to Purgatory. Also, more recent seasons are made up of one long ongoing theme while the first seasons used to be more about the individual cases. Oher than this, Supernatural is AMAZING and if you give it a chance, you will love it."
676,"No words,seriously no words. The most amazing TV show ever. Plenty of twists,awesome climaxes , brilliant supporting characters like Cass, bobby etc. Most of all really kick ass performance from leads Sam n dean. Especially Jensen ,he is mind blowing,i hope he gets a good future in movies too. 5th season was really the best,n i thought the series ended after it,but they restarted it,6th season was little bit a disappointment but what to say they came with a bang in the season 7. Hope season 8 is better. Really looking forward to the purgatory. I wish Cass will be back like he was earlier,i liked that Cass better. I wish that next season will really rock."
677,"1st of all would like to say to 'peace 63' and his/her comments. Whats with the Dean hating? Either you fancy Jared like mad or Jensen knocked you back or something? Seriously I doubt the North Koreans hate the South Koreans quite as much. This show is one of the best out there. How many shows have the original 'ending' by the creator but are moving into a third additional season following that ending?As for Sam and Dean apparently having no chemistry together, that's one of the reasons why the show has such a large gay and female following, 'coz the chemistry is strong between 'em. They even play on the gay 'bromance' themselves throughout each season (especially in their gag reels).The supporting cast throughout each season has been great, but season 7 was so good because it went back to mainly being about Sam and Dean again.Best episode? Season 6, episode 15 'The French Mistake'. Great fun seeing them jump into a universe where they're just normal Jared and Jensen in a TV show, and how ridiculous they find their 'normal' lives. That was neat. Can't wait for Season 8 in Purgatory!"
678,"I have to admit that I am a late bloomer regarding this show. It has been on the air since 2005, and I first was introduced right before the start of season 7, in 2011. It did not take me long to get hooked! As a fan of ghost stories and other things paranormal, I am honestly surprised that I didn't look into this show sooner! Supernatural is about brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, raised in a life of ""hunting"", namely all things supernatural, trained by their ex-marine father following the tragic death of their mother. The series begins with a MOTW (monster of the week) format, in which the brothers hunt down the urban legends we hear about at sleepovers or summer camp: Bloody Mary, the Hook Man, etc., as well as other seemingly typical ghost stories, such as the haunted hotel, ghost highways, etc. As the show progresses and the characters evolve, the viewer is introduced to the show's more ongoing theme of sacrifice (tune in to find out more!), the importance of free will, and even a Biblical storyline featuring angels and demons. All this as the viewer is treated to a classic rock soundtrack featuring AC/DC and Sabbath, to name a few, an amazing, jet black 1967 Chevy Impala, plenty of eye candy for the gals (I know, superficial, but just wait till you see Jensen Ackles ladies!)and a perfect blend of angst, tears, and humour. The writing is excellent (though season 7 was, admittedly, weaker), the acting is incredible, and the creepy cases (namely from the earlier seasons) keep you wanting more. This is not your typical paranormal show, but much more! Excellent show, and hoping for more seasons to come!"
679,"I have loved this show since it started, in 2005 and have been a fan ever since! Though there were some aspects that were intense and graphic. Borderline on disturbing , I still watch it ! I mean it has everything a good paranormal show requires! Ghosts , demons vampires the battle between good and evil! Devils and angels , anthe eternal battle within oneself. But the highlight of all this doom and damnation! Is the two lead characters, Sam and Dean Winchester and all of the barriers, grief they have endured. For seven seasonsit as been on the air. Due to violent and somewhat demonic content this show might not be for everyone. But for ones who enjoy a good demon butt kicking once in a while! Then this is the show to see!"
680,"I finally decided to check out this show because people had been telling me to watch it for a while. I'm a huge fan of Buffy, as well as the X-Files. I was a little worried about the 2 male leads because I tend to favor strong female leads, and when you get 2 males together there is potential for rampant sexism. Well, I can tell you now, I had nothing to worry about. This is one of the best series I've ever seen.This is an exciting, suspenseful show about 2 brothers who were raised as demon hunters, and are on a search to find their father who goes missing during a ""hunting"" trip. The characters of Sam and Dean may be just a bit shaky at first, but now in the series 7th season, they have developed wonderfully.If you are a fan of supernatural dramas such as Buffy, Angel, Reaper, The X-Files and/or Charmed, you will fall in love with this show."
681,"I mean,it's really impressive for this people. Because it's giving you everything about ghost stories, spirit, angels, devils. If you like these you're gonna love it! Like me. I am watching this serial for years. My favourite character is Sam! Because he is very clever and strong. He always makes right choices. My another favourite character is Castiel after Sam. I'm not gonna explain this because it's can be explained with one word: Angel! Because he is angel. He is stronger than every devil and every character. By the way, Castiel and Dean are very good friends. I love dean too because he always protects his brother. Even Sam doesn't like this. I don't know how can explain this movie how is awesome. I am thinking every person who loves ghost stories, angels, magic and like this subjects, you have to watch Supernatural."
682,"I am absolutely obsessed with this show. My mom has been watching it since the first season, but her love of it came nowhere near my obsession once i got into it. These characters are some of the most screwed up, heroically deep guys I've ever seen, although they do have their awkward, borderline- gay moments every now and then. The only character I never liked was their dad, mostly because he basically screws his children over future-wise. There's no way to undo the terrible parenting, and I hate that the boys still harbor a protective love of him. Meg is also extremely annoying, and loves to hear herself talk. Anyways, I would honestly tell anyone to watch this show, unless slightly cheesy ghosts scare you. Somehow, this show has never scared me, and I hate horror movies. But really, if you like super hot guys battling less-than-human classic horror monsters, you'll love Supernatural."
683,"OK as i always say don't listen to the critics they never like anything anyway always watch yourself and make up your own mind.I have been watching this show since it started 7 years ago and each series is better than the next,the characters/the plots/the running story's are superb the mix of horror and fantasy will keep you on the edge of your seat and waiting for the next episode.For anyone who likes this kind of thing this is not to be missed.there are many TV series on TV that are similar to this show but have not hit the mark like supernatural has it has been running for 7 seasons and has potential for many more.So if you like fantasy,horror,a bit of humour then this show should not be missed."
684,"I really enjoyed this series, with few exceptions (some episodes were just drawing out the time, going astray from the main story that kept you hooked). The 4th and fifth seasons were particularly awesome. Now with the last episode from the fifth season they had completed the story and made it round, perfect. I had a definite sense of closure, everything added up just great. Then they had to give in to ratings and all that and renew the series. Consequently they managed to turn it into a worthless, repetitive, indigestible, even laughable piece of work. I don't know what's with these American producers, they just don't know when to stop! I guess it's all about the money..."
685,"I am in the seventh season of this epic TV Series. From the first season to this it has only been a ride to hell and back and back to hell. IT WAS WILD. Great acting Great SCRIPT Great DIRECTING what more do you want. It is the best series on the TV yet and its still growing in glory. I still find myself going back to the first seasons and working my way back up to the seventh as a week is way too long to wait for the worlds best horror show. It is the best show on the TV in general. Im not saying that it is the only good show as i like the vampire diaries Chuck(still healing from the fact that it finished), all I'm saying is that if YOU never watched it i totally recommend it. I almost forgot it makes use of some great songs. 10/10"
686,"Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki Great Actors! Jensen's jerk personality on the show really contributes to the thrill of the show! The show deserved the People's Choice Awards! Really well thought out concept don't ever end the show! I just began watching the show and literally haven't been able to put my computer down. I am now on season 4 and have been hooked since the pilot.Jared's character and Jensen's go hand in hand and work really well together. They are both really great actors and will hopefully eventually win Emmy awards. All of the different characters and concepts to each show make sense and are riveting. This is a must watch show, even if you don't like supernatural ideas, it will still hook you with the personality's of the characters and the way they react with each other."
687,"I saw the first show and was hooked.There have been many TV series that have tried to capture the recipe but most have failed and none have done so well. The story follows two brother's Sam and Dean and over the years up to series 7 they have grown these two characters exceedingly well. They have a formula for standard episodes that works very well and is well worth watching but they are careful to mix this up with quirky episodes and also episodes that concentrate on the larger plots that they develop in the back ground of each series.As your guess from the title we are in the realms of demons and ghouls, which when done well (as this is) leads to a show that contains: Excitement, laughter, edginess and thrills – along with the occasional big breasted girls! Also the writers are smart enough to include a back story that can span over two series to stop the formula from becoming stale. The two brothers have been shot, stabbed, ripped apart and had their skin peeled from their bodies. They both have died several times over but God likes the Winchester boys and keeps bringing them back, although Dean would love to hunt God down and kill him himself.Season 7 is currently running, unfortunately due to UK TV scheduling what it is we in the UK are going to be 9 MONTHS behind the US. I can see this running for maybe another 1 or 2 seasons at best before actors gain too much fame and decide to move on or the writers decide to change genre.All good things must come to an end .But until then I will enjoy and hope it lasts as long as possible!!!"
688,"Not only have I watched all six seasons and caught myself up because I remember watching the first episode when the show premiered.... thinking back.... why did I never get into that show? The very first episode stuck with me long enough for me to get myself enthralled with Supernatural!Don't be fooled by the CWTV title... this show has promised action, drama and comedy from the very beginning!Of course, the choice of Jensen and Jared to look at every week was a keen choice of cast! Every show has something new, and when it's not the first supernatural entity is creepier than the last!Sam and Dean are awesome... keep the episode coming Bobby Singer and Sera Gamble!!"
689,"My summary says it all, its the best show ever, I watched the first 5 seasons in the space of 3 weeks, this was before season 6 came out, now I am excited for season 7 coming out on the 22nd of September.I am going to keep it short, if you haven't watched it I don't know what you are doing with your life. It has a gripping and growing storyline from season 1-6 and the characters are so well thought out and also grow through every season.SAY NO MORE10 OUT OF 10LOVE IT!!"
690,"Are you or are you not? You better watch this TV show because is got everything:horror,comedy,action and great story.From 2 boys who just try to find they're father and killing monsters is going to be a great story adventure that includes the apocalypse,back from the dead,God,angels and much more.This is by far one of the 3 best TV shows from over 10 years.Today 10.08.2011 i'm waiting very very much for the new season and i expect to be still very very good.Go go go Winchesters brothers :)and will see if Castiel is going to be evil or not because the end of the last season was great and i think the new season will be the best and i hope that this season will not be the last.Go watch the show if you did not watch it and you will not regret this.10 from 10 for Supernatural! Excuse my English please :P :)"
691,"A fault is hard to find in a show that is well done. And everything is well done in this show.The story lines are captivating. The characters are people you can relate to and want to be. There's the corny 'goodie good' type for the Sam fans and the kick ass antihero Dean.It takes serious dilemmas that are more supernatural versions of decisions and life lessons that people go through to in their own life.But it also has a witty yet blunt type of humor that is immature and fun which relieves that serious side well.Season 1 was a fantastic lead in with season 2 having a ending suitable for a main storyline.season 3 was great, taking a good idea and playing it out well. But in my view season 4 and 5 have taken TV to a new level.Taking the final book of the bible and turning it into an action packed, apocalyptic driven story that you cant help but watch and be in awe of. So creative.Its exactly what I've wanted in a show for so long that its just so awesome to finally see it in action. Also for me the icing on the cake is the music.Classic rock still lives.I cant help picture Dean kicking Justin Beibers ass with AC/DC playing in the background.EPIC.This show is a testosterone filled blast that is perfect for any true blooded male. Not being sexist, its got the goods for girls as well. Any girl who appreciates TV as entertaining as this is marriage material in my view.Watch it and embrace its perfection..."
692,"I got into this show when the show itself was well into its 2nd season, just because I thought the theme of the show was going to end up being lame and childish. CW producing the show didn't help its first impression either, but after watching the pilot, I was hooked. Well written scripts and very natural dialogues, well acted and thought out scenes has kept Supernatural on my ""To Watch"" list for few years now. Two brilliant Texan actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, has matured into true actors throughout the show, and unlike any other prime time television series, it has kept its original character chemistry and plot depth all these years, if not gotten better. Hope 'Supernatural' can continue the success its had so far."
693,"Definitely the best supernatural show i've ever seen. It combines humor, horror, suspense with perfect measure, in an unique way which i come to admire straight away. What makes it so good? Simple.The 2 lead actors are 2 charismatic but strangely different personalities, although they share the same blood (they're brothers). Dean(Jansen Ackles) is the playboy type, always looking for BBD (bigger better deal), a funny, 80's music maniac, with a thing for violence and impulsive action. Sam (Jared Padalecki), has a darker personality. He's not as near as opened as Dean, he doesn't even talk as much as him, but shows intelligence and calm. They have two things in common, they're both good looking, and they share the same unusual job, or as they say it in the show, the same unusual way of life: they're hunters. Another thing for which i find this show attractive, is the clever plot, sustained by a great story-line which gives ""Supernatural"" the exact amount of surprise"
694,I could say so much about this show its suspenseful but yet has emotion in it its like a balance of everything.. I Just started watching it like 6 months ago but i have bought all the seasons and to this day still watch them over and over and still watch Cw every Thurday at 9.The winchester brothers is a very good example of the love for your brother or sister and what a person would do for the people they love at whatever the consequences.In fact when it comes to the emotions of everyday life is well pertained.But in my opinion This has to be the one of the best TV show i Have seen in a very long time!!! I recommend everybody to watch this show!!
695,Supernatural has that something special that i have with only one other series TV. The main characters are just awesome and every episode has its own charm.I love it!! Just watch a few episodes and judge for yourself. You wont get disappointed.if you like the X-files you will love SupernaturalIm very curious about season 5 just saw the first episode after 4 months of supernatural rehab! I want to thank all of the supernatural crew for this terrific show.
696,"Supernatural is an amazing show, check out episodes at SupernaturalSeason4.comJensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki star as Dean and Sam Winchester, two brothers searching for the meaning behind their mother's death at the hand of a demon, and their father's mysterious disappearanceThings are heating up over at Supernatural. We've already heard news that Adrianne Palicki will return as Sam's dead girlfriend from the Pilot and news that Lucifer has been cast, but now comes more news that makes season 5 sound like it's getting back to basics.Meg is coming back, or rather, the demon that possessed Meg will return for Supernatural season 5. Eric Kripke told TV Guide Magazine that he's been curious about what happened to the missing demon, and it seems he's finally come up with a way to bring her back. However, she won't be quite the same.The old Meg Nicki Aycox is busy on the new TNT drama Dark Blue, so when the Meg demon returns, she'll be played by Rachel Miner, who received a Daytime Emmy nomination for her work on Guiding Light and was briefly married to actor Macauley Culkin.With Meg and Jessica both returning, it feels as though Eric Kripke is still treating this like a final season, using symmetry to bring back a lot of elements from the very beginning. The premiere of Supernatural season 5 is still more than two months away, but with all this news, the excitement is building."
697,"My comment is for the Season Four premiere-Lazarus Rising was such a fine episode, not just for a season opener, but in the entire series. It was not as action packed as The Magnificent Seven, but it sure was epic. It felt as if it was confident in itself. Unlike TM7, it had great editing, gorgeous lighting, fine pacing, better writing, and it had a certain 'tone' to it that made it feel different than it ever was before(in a good way). It did a perfect job of introducing Dean all over again, and it was perfect in the aspect that it actually puts us into another cliff hanger, the whole 'Angel/God' aspect. Let me tell you, such a different path, but such a great one. It also set up many new plots. Examples are how Sam has mastered some new abilities that make him stronger, and how we still are left in hiding as to how it happened, as well as how Ruby got back with him, when, why? And of course, the last scene with Dean and Castiel was so perfectly acted, and the lighting definitely was on my eye! I noticed how it had a certain dull, blue, creepy, yet gloomy lighting, which makes sense. The actor who played Castiel acted realistically how an angel would, and I cannot wait to find out his plan for Dean(any ideas on this?) On a downside, I found the actress who plays Ruby sort of dull, expressionless, and I know she got a lot of hate last season, but I found Katie Cassidy better, though, however, I hope it changes. I hope we find out what Sam and Ruby will do next? What will Dean's plan be?All in all, one of Supernatural's most perfect episodes, right up there with In My Time of Dying"
698,"Supernatural offers Comedy, Horror, Drama, and Suspense. The story is of 2 brothers who are ""hunters"" involved with of kicking supernatural ass. The first season starts off with Dean, the older brother, finding his brother to tell him there father is missing and he wants help. Sam, the younger brother, who left the life of hunting to lead a normal life, agreed but needed to get back for a law school interview, and from there nothing is the same for Sam and Dean. Over the course of the 3 seasons I've noticed very few things to say I dislike. You definitely need to see all the seasons to understand the characters and you never know what epic moment you could miss. The 3rd season seemed somewhat off though of the other 2 seasons. It was darker, and had different comedy and the characters seemed to change as well. But I can't blame them it gets pretty crazy. Still very enjoyable, I can't wait to see what happens in Season 4. The story is about the 2 main characters fighting anything evil and supernatural, though as you watch the story goes deeper into Good and Evil and the lives of the 2 brothers.I recommend this to anyone. Especially people who love the horror genre."
699,"Supernatural has become an important part of my life. These guys drive me crazy, and there in no episode that makes you get bored. They are cute, lovely and super handsome. It has made me learn a lot about urban legends and mystical creatures that I never even knew exist. It is a great show, and I hope they keep it forever. Tha last season keeps you at the edge of your seat, trying to find a way to save Dean, and sometimes, it makes you cry for the relationship they have as brothers. Who doesn't want brothers like those? The first 3 or 4 episodes were a little funny, and made me laugh a lot, I think they should try to keep some more humor, like that episode in which Sam looses his bunny foot and stumbles against anything."
700,I love this show I just want to see a season four.I saw the end of season 3 and wow excellent ending to season three. Every episode I saw so far I liked.This show needs to keep running. No rest for the wicked I Would give it a 9 out of ten it was just incredible.The way Sam and Dean always have arguments with each other keeps the show good.The way their dad died was interesting. This show is sometimes full of heart which is what every show should have.I can't wait till season four. Sam is good at acting out everything on this series. I always remember when I saw a trailer to this and said I have got to see this and got hooked from the first episode. This is a show of Horror that will live in everyone's heart forever.I like Jensen Ackles he is truly amazing. Rock on Supernatural. You are one of my best.
701,"This show is hands down the best show on the airwaves, In my opinion. It was like it was tailor made just for me and things I find interesting. I just pray that the CW doesn't even think about the ""C"" word to this series or I would be go ballistic. I love the brotherly love (even though Dean would never say it) and their constant joking around is great. Also the music is stellar and fits the show to a T. The big unknown powers that Sam has is an interesting twist given to him by God or a Demon not really sure. It makes me want to call my bro and hit the road to all the haunted houses in America. Awesome show, I would recommend this show to anyone over 12. No parents would get any sleep then...ha-ha."
702,"I've been watching this series from the beginning, so I think I can talk a little here. ""Supernatural"" started strong with great shocks, but was extremely self-conscious, to the extent that the aside-jokes seemed like a forced element, the actors looking pained in their characterizations of hard-boiled cynics with sharp wit. In fact, this was my only complaint against the show, but it became more overbearing as time went on: the interminable wise-cracks, the ridiculous impersonations of law enforcement - repetitive and annoying.Then, something great happened. Actually, three great things happened. First, the show found its mythos. Dean's impending death is a much better attention-grabber than the missing-father angle, or the odd-couple-brothers tradeoff. Although we feel that we know that Dean must survive, we also have a creepy feeling that to do so would compromise the show's integrity. It would have to be REALLY clever for Dean to escape his contract, and not disappoint fans of spooky genre. Of course, Jensen Ackles fans don't really care HOW it's done, as long as the actor remains on the show, but a certain intellectual consistency needs to be maintained also, if the creative minds care at all.Second, the self-consciousness of the brothers' impersonations and barbs has reached epic proportions so that those moments have become a little comedic expectation unto itself. No more do I dread the eventual charade of Dean and Sammy playing phone-company representative, or forensic specialist. The writers seem to have left behind the ""please excuse us for adding this tired plot device"" to ""did you notice how we've exaggerated it to the point of lunacy?"" I have, and I think it's great.Third, the shocks and plotting have really improved. Now that the acting has found its stride, the writers have broadened the range of emotions and thought processes that they allow Dean and Sam. We still see Sammy tense his jaw muscles when he's upset, but his dialogue is less stilted, with more subtlety and feeling. This makes me like Sam so much more- he's no longer the naive one from series start. In fact, we're not really sure WHAT he is anymore, are we? Dean has grown also, and his fear of Hell seems very real. Combining these standard themes of monster-of-the-week with mythos, and a growing artistic talent, ""Supernatural"" is starting to approach the tension and belief levels of pre-shark-jumping ""X-files."""
703,"I really hated on one show/movie (I can't remember what) but they started out w/two really good characters (both male) and then ruined it by adding a female character who went off on them w/their adventure.I just don't like that the two males would always fight over the female, who had nothing really to add. Does anybody think the WB is going to give Dean and Sam a female sidekick? Although, I don't think I would want them to get a male sidekick, either. They should just keep it as Dean and Sam as the main characters and not add another.""Wade, what was that?"" ""It was just the serial killers.""-Jared Padalecki, HOUSE OF WAX"
704,Best show ever. At some point the characters stops being characters and becomes your family.
705,"This tv show isn't just an ""show"" the fans just see it's a live for them alot of people now like more than family and friends for a long 15 years this show is motivated them made them cry for alost and made them believe that their is a good things in this world that they don't even know about but they knew it's there"
706,"I first started watching this show in August and Boy, it blew me away. I loved every moment of it. I am officially an SPN fan--No, let me rephrase...I'm a whole air conditioner lol.Dean and Sam are truly role models for siblings. This show has everything I enjoy. Especially Family. The love they shared between brothers was everything!The last episode broke my heart and made me happy at the same time. I cried like a baby! I can't believe it's finished.15 Seasons of awesomeness. I recommend supernatural 100%Jensen, Jared, and Misha! You guys are freaking amazing. Thank you for such great acting."
707,"Bravo 👏👏👏!!! I am so proud to be a fan of this show as well as the entire cast and crew!💕💓💘Thank you all for such a beautiful performance and for all of your hard work and dedication!! The end was done beautifully because it showed their mortality. After everything they went through. Dying and coming back. This time it was real. I think that's one reason why so many people are upset. Endings are hard in every aspect of life. To see our heroes die and not come back, that's where reality is setting in for some. They can't accept it. So they react with petty hate. Yet, they fail to realize that no matter what you guys will always live on in some of our hearts because of how you inspired us. In the end, you guys are immortal. I'll always watch your show because it brings me joy personally. Even the hard parts. I love you guys!!!👏👏💘💓💕"
708,"Super Natural is the best show on TV today. Nice to see low budget reality TV fade away, and even worse Jerry Springer over the top style shows. I love the super bad car, and love the relationship of the one sensitive brother who is balanced with the macho/cool brother. The plots very, with interesting spooky stories mixed with humor. The characters and the stories have believability to them, which creates a levity for the show. No social messages or hidden meanings, just normal people and towns with strange happenings. My wife noticed one of the guys is from Days of are lives. I can see the actor going to the big screen one day. 10 out of 10. Get your VCRs warmed up and tape the show if you work nights like I do. Unfortunately, there are only 8 episodes. Hopefully, they will continue and make more for next season."
709,"The last 15 years, going through the ups and downs with Sam and Dean have been a rollercoaster ride. Gonna miss it. Family don't end with blood"
710,"It ended the way it probably should have, fitting in with the characters, and even left wiggle room for the movie we're going to insist they make some day. But damn, I hate crying. Great acting."
711,"I'm on season 4 and this is my peeve: how come after all this time, these hunters are constantly being caught unawares unarmed and at the mercy of these evil beings? ESP season 4 episode 2 when hunters all over are getting killed, Bobby has to pick up a fireplace poker when he should have already been prepared. I get you want to make a story flow but have more sense please"
712,"When this show first came out I didn't think it would be good. I thought that it was so stupid and had no point at all. I mean, what GREAT series only has two main characters? It just doesn't happen. This also added to my 'What kind of idiot would actually watch this.' mood. Then one day I was over my friend's house and she was watching Supernatural. After that I was hooked. I couldn't believe that I had just judged the show without even watching it. Yes, there is a lot of cursing and about three people die every episode, but it's still the best TV show I have seen in a long time. Dean is the funny guy while Sam takes thing so seriously. That's the final touch to make this show perfect."
713,"I've liked these series a long time. But I saw quickly a re-peating thing, come and come again. NOW, in the 14th season !!! I'm falling asleep more and more. It's getting time to WRAP this CRAP up !!!!! TO much is TO much !!! BORING AFTER 14 seasons. THIS SEASON = IT SHOULD STOP !!!!! LET DEAN DIE !!!!!!!!!!! We have so far seen a lot of action in Season 14. So PLEASE LET IT END NOW !!!!!!!! DEAN has a perfect reason, to END THIS SERIES !!!!!!!!!! He gives his life to SAVE THE EARTH !!! What a better FINALE do you want ??!!! STOP IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!"
714,"Been watching this show from the beginning. The oldest seasons are perfection and the last season is similar to the originals. The show makes you feel like one big, screwed up family. This show will be missed like no other."
715,"i heard of ""Supernatural"" a few times but i never actually watched it. i just started watching it a few weeks ago and i must say i was hooked. Jared Padalecki (Sam Wincester) and Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) are great in this show. It kinda reminded of old school ""Charmed"" mixed with the ""X-Files"". Whats great about that show is that its also in ways easy to catch up because there's really only two main characters its easy to get into. It has non-stop action and mystery and it just gets you hooked. The acting is great and the characters have so much depth and history. This is a great show and i hope it lasts a lot more seasons. i give it a 9/10."
716,"This is my first serial that I watched, even if it is long enough, I can say it is very good if you pay attention to each episode. I'm not saying all the episodes are good, but in almost every episode you find something new about the supernatural world, which makes me adore this series."
717,"Watched this show multiple times over the years, does not get old"
718,"Man I hate to see this show end
I've been watching it since I was 6 years old at the end of the second season this show is the best one of my childhood I would rate it a 10 any day"
719,"Loved the Series since day one!
I remember years ago on one occasion that right after a Superbowl, I had my entire family gathered.
I played SUPERNATURAL. They were in awe of it & I made new fans out of the show.Love My Native Texan Gents"
720,"I ignored this show for so long, simply labelling it as a 'Buffy and Angel' copy and then I sat and watched an episode called 'Monster Movie', beautifully directed and acted, with great comedy timing...I was in love. So I watched the first season, second season, third and then the fourth, and now avidly watching the fifth and final season of this amazing show.Dean and Sam Winchester are trained to kill demons, wherever they find it. That's the basic plot for season one, season two takes a darker turn and it keeps getting darker as we meet more Demons and then eventually Angels. The show focuses on family...I am simply astounded by the shows writing and how two characters hold together an entire show on their own...it's chemistry and these guys have it in bunches. The dark cinematography is simply spell-binding as we take a walk into this terrifying world, while the writing is the key to its success, there is also the songs that come along rejuvenating a drained audience but more importantly it's the cast...Jensen Ackles and Jared Padallecki; fine actors who make the roles their own. Their are other actors who come along and define the mythology of Supernatural, like Mischa, Katie Cassidy, Genevieve..But mainly its the Winchester brothers.Certain episodes like 'Jus in Bello, Monster Movie,All hell breaks loose part 2 , After school special, The real Ghostbusters' simply amazing because of the directing, writing and acting. I also hate it when the brothers fight...But some brilliantly choreographed fight scenes.But one of the great moments of show is the arrival of Castiel, when he's around you feel safe...although he seems he get his 'rear' handed to him, quite often...But his presence is enough to scare the things in the dark..The presence of Angel's kind of seems boring, but here they're much more darker..Lucifer's introduction kind of made me think...that's a bit too much, but I'm liking were the show is heading...Simply spellbinding."
721,"Hand's down a once in a lifetime show, there is no other series like it out there.
Supernatural draws you in to make you feel like a part of their family, to never give up, to always keep fighting.
The writer's have done an awesome job through & through!
Thank you to the entire SPN Family.
I don't know where the 15 years went, but it was surely a ""Hell of a Ride"" with a lot of hard work & dedication, certainly helped us to keep on fighting in our own lives!
Don't change a single thing.
Cheers & Thank you"
722,"So crazy sad for a final episode but so so good! For them to play characters so well for so long they feel like family, so in turn it hurts so much to say goodbye! 😭❤ I will miss them deeply!"
723,Simply amaaaazing and Dean is a perfect to attach with it!
724,"I never write reviews. Ironic really, since I'm a writer by trade. But having watched Supernatural since its pilot episode in 2005 (was it really that long ago?!) I felt I owed it to this frankly epic show that's been a solid presence in my life for 15 years to write a review following the arrival of the final half of the 15th season.Sam, Dean, Castiel, Bobby, Mary, John, Ellen, Joe, Garth, Charlie, The Ghostfacers, Crowley, Meg, and so many, many other loved characters have been and gone throughout the past 15 years. I've watched the entire 14 seasons twice, and some favourite episodes dozens of times.Throughout the last 15 seasons this show has been a constant part of my life - at times it's been the only constant thing. Today I'm loving a very different life, in a different place to where I was in 2005 but turn on a Supernatural episode and take off on a monster hunting ghost trip with my two favourite boys and it's like nothing has changed.It's with a heavy heart that I look forward to the second half of the final season, as I don't know what TV show could ever come close to filling the hole Supernatural will leave behind.To everyone involved in the creation of this show, a million thank yous. It will never be forgotten - and hopefully there may even be a reunion episode/spin off one day.In the words of Castiel, ""Hey, Assbutt!""
In the words of Dean, ""Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.""
And in my own words - Thanks, Supernatural. I'll miss you! 😓❤❤❤❤"
725,"I just started watching supernatural in September, binged watched all the episodes. I loved it! Sorry to see it end. I think the fact the cast is so fan friendly and the episodes are always a surprise makes it a great show. My favorite TV show."
726,"I love this show, the ending was AWFUL, but I still love this show, and would die for tfw 2.0"
727,"Supernatural may have started out as a weekly horror story. A new monster every week. But it became more than that. Sam and Dean became more than just brothers. They became the guys to go to for anything. No matter what they faced, the did it together. The show became about family. And what you would do for your family. Then Cas shows up. And he learned how to be human from Sam and Dean. The show is amazing. It's an experience that is unlike any other show. This show hits all the feels. Happy, funny, sad, angry, hurt, loss....everything. And you really feel and connect with the story and the characters. The ending is beyond sad. But it ends good. You feel heartbroken and at peace too. If anyone that hasn't watched Supernatural, definitely should. Will not regret it."
728,"Have been a loyal fan of this show for the last 15 years. Really feeling quite sad now that it is all over. In my opinion the best show of it's genre ever created. Going to be hard pressed to find anything new to fill the void left from the ending of the show. Unlike many series that I have watched it just kept getting better rather than losing my interest a few seasons in. And well done to the team for the final 2 episodes, i thought it was a fitting end to wrap everything up."
729,"If you're going to start this show, you will love it. Not just the plot but also the characters. This show has been so much and impacted so many lives, but the writers didn't end it good. They didn't even do the bare minimum. They freaking pulled a 'How I Met Your Mother'So don't watch 15x20. Just end it at 15x19 😊"
730,"First of all, great plot. The monsters are interesting and the range of them is huge. Every kind of creature including angels, demons, ghosts, werewolves, vampires and what not are seen.The chemistry between all the actors is really good. Seems like Jensen and Jared are real life brothers. Great acting from everyone as well. Cool and interesting side characters that will make you attached to them. Few funny scenes are also included which can make anyone laugh. People give this show a pass because of it's enormous runtime but, if you start watching it once, you won't stop till you finish."
731,"I'm deeply saddened by the idea of this show leaving after these 15 wonderful years. Here's my tiny, insignificant parting gift: a 10/10 review. You will be missed, Supernatural"
732,The best show on the planet love love love this show
733,"It's my favorite television show of all time. Everything after the season 5 finale(perfect)is a bonus. Sure....with 350+ episodes, one's bound to find the consecutive storyline boring at time but every season has at minimal 2-3 episodes that stand alone with perfect, creative and original writing...mainly based around humor and the shows ability to make fun of itself just enough."
734,"I have watched all 15 1/2 seasons more then a couple of times.
I love the monsters, I love Dean And Sam! It's so sad there are only 4 episodes left."
735,"If a show has been around for 12 years and is still continuing, the show has to be good. Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)is a bad ass who listens to classic rock and drives a 67' Impala. He has a brother Sam (Jared Padelecki)who is also a bad ass. The two brothers travel to kill the monsters of the night (Demons, vampires, werewolves, leviathans {you will learn what a leviathan is in seasons 7, 8, or 9}, some angles, literally the devil himself, and god's evil sister.) The brothers also have a friend, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) who is very good friends with their father John Winchester (Jeffery Dean Morgan.) In Season 4, Dean is dragged out of hell by an angel, named Castiel (Misha Collins.) Crowley (Mark Sheppard), the king of the Crossroads/King of Hell is also a huge antagonist AND protagonist (sometimes he's a good guy, sometimes he's not.) A lot of exciting events take place, including Dean being saved from hell by an Angel named Castiel, the apocalypse, Sam being stuck in the devil's cage because he had to let the devil posses him in order to throw the devil in the cage, Sam losing his soul after he returns, Dean being trapped in Purgatory, Dean gaining the mark of Cain and it take over him, Dean getting rid of the Mark of Cain but in doing so, summons Amara (Emily Swallow), who is God's evil sister A.K.A. The Darkness, The British Men of Letters trying to kill all American hunters, also Lucifer escaping his cage, and where we are left off (Season 12, Episode 23) they are trying to get him back in the cage that God condemned him to. This show is highly recommended for everyone ages 10+."
736,"I loved this show from it's first episode.The story is excellent,especially why both brothers were raised as hunters(their mother killed by a demon).This Show covers all types of supernatural beings ranging from ghosts to creatures such as vampires,werewolves etc to Gods of different mythologies.From Season 4 it includes Angels and Demons,All the Biblical Figures and their stories are beautifully incorporated in the show.Roles Played by Jensen Ackles(Dean),Jared Padalecki(Sam) and Misha Collins(Castiel) are awesome.This is one of the shows where I didn't get bored for even one moment.Brothers are on Roadtrip traveling across U.S in their impala,scenes range from suburbs to buildings in cities,which blend perfectly in the story.They have special methods to deal with every single monster.Sometimes there is a little bit of comedy too, And I love the attitude of Dean.The best thing about this show is that after all seasons they have maintained quality."
737,"-The spoiler warning is on just in case there's something in the following that may 'spoil' what the show has in stored for anyone who would want to check it out-So I had actually never heard of this show until i surfed the channels and discovered it myself. I can see why this show isn't advertised a lot -as it should be- because of the theme 'demons-are-amongst-us'. But i gotta say instead of the old cliché of 'crosses-being-stabbed-in-demons-heart' or the old 'spray-holy-water', the main characters kick ass the fun way with super powers and good old fashion hand guns. A must see show that i'm surprised not many are reviewing. -then again, the theme of it all isn't all too inspiring.- The show's very entertaining in a 'devilish' sense, and the episodes are never a let-down. Fast-paced, great action sequences, and moments that keep you wanting to see more. 9/10 cause there are few things here and there like annoyance of characters. Other than that, watch the show and keep in mind it's all 'make-believe'."
738,Excellent fantasy horror drama with a gripping plot that has stood the test of time. I have seen every episode to date and it's still as good as it always was. 10/10
739,"This is the show. THE SHOW.
I'll be fair, it's not the best show - but that's not what i mean when i say it is ""THE SHOW""This show has flaws, but a show without flaws are near impossible to find. An example of shows without flaws in my opinion is the first six seasons of Game of Thrones, and Breaking Bad. But Supernatural, is better.Did this get confusing? Let me explain. Supernatural isn't better because it's the better show. But it is the show that will easily take the number 1 spot on your list ahead of Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, because - it will be your favorite.And that's what i mean. If you watch the entire show, or half of it - it's guaranteed to be your favorite show.
It doesn't matter that it's not perfect, because this show will drag you in like no other.You will feel for the Brothers. The love, connection and chemistry of these 2 Brothers and incredibly skillfull actors, is what's going to hook you for the entire road.You watch as they face unbelievable challenges, and they grow stronger and closer together.
Supernatural is a show that takes unexpected turns at unexpected times. And they are all brilliant. The story flourishes and you will never get bored of it!
A long the road new characters get introduced, bad or good, but they are alle unique and you can appriciate them in their own way.Finally i will say, you might get the wrong taste from episode 2 and up in the first season. But i guarantee you, finish season 1 and this will be your show.Paranormal, horror, biblical, romance, love, friendship, comedy, loss, death, character progression, captivating story. It has it all !!
(if i forgot something it probably has that too)A huge thanks to Eric Kripke for creating this show. A huge thanks to Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins for the excellent job of playing these extraordinary characters.We as the supernatural fandom will never let this one die. (i feel like golum rn)
THIS IS THE SHOW. GO WATCH IT."
740,"The series are really good ´till season 5 but after that there´s no point to continue. Yeah, there was a few seasons afterwards too with some great episodes but overall the plot starts to repeat itself. character development is zero and whole storyline is just bland with nothing new and interesting to give.
Season 15 is the worst. There was only one episode in the entire thing i enjoyed. The characters and plot are just incredibly boring and i´m watching it only to see how pointless and awful the ending will be."
741,The brothers journey is what makes it perfect. The viewer grows along with Sam and Dean on one hell of a journey
742,"It was great then ending perfectly made
Hope we get a revival but even if not I'll still watch all the time rip sam and dean"
743,After 15 years of carrying on; their is finally peace for the Winchester brothers. The series finale was poignant and beautifully acted.
744,"First seasons were great and very funny up to season 5. Then the show is getting worse, not better. I understand the writer wanted to finish the series in season 5 and well thats kind of obvious, as it goes downhill from that point. Also the fact that every female character hero or villain is killed is a bit annoying. As for this season more of the same.. Season 10 was the worse yet.. plus very dull in comparison to others.. mainly filler episodes that weren't even funny.. Winchesters are by definition insane.. ""Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" - Albert Einstein.. oh and Dean was right, Sam is evil, he knowingly unleashed Darkness and the end of the world to save Dean (who will eventually die as he is part of the world).. Insane.. plus he was all over Deans case when he did it for him last season.. Insane.. SuperInsanity.."
745,"I was reluctant to watch this for an awfully long time. I constantly watched shows I know I loved over and over. But lately I've wanted to try a marathon of many new shows to add to my list of favourites. I avoided this show for years mainly because episode five, 'Bloody Mary', terrified me as a child. However, this was the first to go on my new list due to many suggestions towards it and its Internet fame.Enough with the background. My point is that I avoided this show, and now I regret it so much. This is one of TV's gems, up there with the likes of Doctor Who, Breaking Bad, Merlin and the short-lived Firefly. After a while you completely fall into the unique show and can't stop watching. At first I wasn't a big fan, but as time went on I began to fall in love with the different characters and ideas and story lines. It went from being rather ordinary to becoming an unmissable TV series.The original five season plan was perfect and the storyline just got more and more massive. Because of this, I was obviously scared of how season six would work out, it certainly felt different, but the show was still there and gradually everything fell into place. Even now, in series nine, it still feels special in its own way and completely unique unlike most shows on TV.If you have not watched this series yet, I definitely advise you too. It's quite perfect from start to finish, from the characters to the huge plot lines. This series is one of the still running TV gems - don't miss out."
746,"I have to admit that I was a late entry to the Supernatural universe, put off partly by the fact that my much younger sister loved it, and that it starred a couple of 'pretty boys' with dubious acting credentials. Boy did I put my foot in it. I began watching it completely by accident and I was snagged, hook, line and sinker, after exactly fifteen minutes. The heart of the show lies in a truly fantastic relationship between the brothers, played to perfection by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Add to that well-researched plots, and intelligent scripting, and the show is a winner.Supernatural is sensible enough to scrap superfluous romantic baggage (an apparent staple for most shows), and concentrate on its fascinating universe of folklore, urban legends and demonic mayhem. It also has a surprising sense of humor, a grasp of rock music (and how to use it effectively), and a line of truly talented guest stars, who add to the plot rather than detracting from it.Supernatural's only real problem lies in the fact that sooner or later, it will run out of fuel, given the limitations of its theme, as well as the problem of how much can be done with two characters. Thankfully, that's a juncture that hasn't been reached yet, and hopefully the guys on top know how to fix this minor snag so that the show can either end on a high or continue with new and improved dimensions"
747,"I have to say off the bat that I am a sci-fi/""other worldly"" show junkie. I was obsessed with Buffy, Angel, Firefly, and about the first half of the series of Charmed.""Supernatural"" is one of the best shows that I've seen in a long time. The dialogue is wonderful, the chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles is genuine and the audience gets the feel that they could be brothers, and the legends are all legends that most of us grew up knowing (ex. Bloody Mary, The Hook Man). Even though this is a paranormal-centric show, it seems that this could really be happening, if it was possible.The storyline between Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) and his brother Dean (Jensen Ackles) is well acted by both male leads. Though it seems that Padalecki is supposed to have more of story revolve around him, Ackles steals a lot of the scenes and isn't due to poor acting or better acting on either part of the two guys, simply the dialogue. Ackles seems to get through better as the ""concerned/protective big brother"". However, Padalecki does have his fair share of shining moments as the soft, ""misunderstood"" younger brother. Both Ackles and Padalecki's acting is stepped up a notch when Jeffrey Dean Morgan (John Winchester; Sam and Dean's father) is in the scene. A perfect example is that of the Season 1 finale. All three actors hit it out of the ballpark with the intensity and emotion that was oozing out of them for the entire episode.This was said a few times on the DVD extras that Supernatural is written like a one hour mini-movie every week and it truly is; only with an on-going storyline for the plot of the series. Most of the time, it doesn't work for a series. It actually works in favor for Supernatural.The whole ""classic rock"" music throughout the series is a perfect fit for the show and I for one, am glad that the latest hot band isn't playing on the show. It would take away from the feel of the show, and make it just like every other show on TV.Personally, when I started watching this show, I couldn't stop watching it, and that hasn't happened to me since I started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer back in '01. I've had a few that I've liked A LOT, but this just blew them ALL away.If anyone out there likes a paranormal storyline, with some major mysteries, twists and anticipating drama, this show is for YOU!"
748,"The actors make this show work. Period. Jensen Ackles' and Jared Padalecki's chemistry is golden. Althugh I enjoy the ghosts and ghoulies, I also appreciate the fact that Supernatural has changed from a series about two ghostbusters who happen to be brothers into a series about two brothers who happen to be ghostbusters. The difference between the first and second halves of the first season is like night and day; the quality improved immensely after an entertaining but slightly shaky start. The brothers' relationship is the focus and it works. These brothers are two complex individuals about whom the audience discovers more and more during each episode. They're fascinating, as is their emotionally dysfunctional father portrayed by the wonderful Jeffrey Dean Morgan. A big thumbs up for this surprisingly sweet, emotional spook fest."
749,"I love this show!!!!! The story lines are great and the acting is too.If you like your horror you will probably enjoy the first few seasons more but in all honesty, once you are 'in' you'll enjoy even the comedy ones (which are equally good).I have not yet seen any of season 12, but if it's anywhere near as good as any of the others I won't be disappointed. The best season by far (in my opinion) is season 3 and the best cliffhanger being at the end of season 1.Treat yourself and watch this, you won't be disappointed."
750,"I remember really looking forward to watching Supernatural when it was first advertised on Australian TV. Unfortunately, the week before it started I got a new job that required me to work nights, so I missed it. Much to my regret, I did not tape it, and by the time I finished up at that job a couple of years later, I had pretty much forgotten about Supernatural.About two years after that I came home fairly late from work one night, and while flicking channels came across Supernatural. The particular episode I had happened upon was 'Lucifer's Rising', from season four. Usually I would not have left it on as I hate coming into a series after it has started, but for some reason, this time I did.Half an hour later I was hooked. I subsequently went about obtaining copies of all the previous episodes, which I finished watching the day prior to the next episode airing. It was a marathon session of Supernatural. 80 odd episodes in less than a week. Yet when I had finished I still hadn't gotten enough. I couldn't wait for the next episode. Five years later and I still look forward to watching the next episode of Supernatural. For any that have not watched the show before, Supernatural centers around two brothers – Sam and Dean Winchester (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles), who as the title of the show somewhat suggest, hunt down, banish, or kill supernatural beings that threaten the mundane among us. The boys were raised to be 'hunters' by their father, after he discovers their mother - who died when Sam was still a baby - and Dean about five, was killed by a demon. Although Dean is enthusiastic about the 'family business', Sam wants a normal life, and is at college studying law when the series kicks off.However Dean shows up unexpectedly with news their father has gone missing. Sam reluctantly agrees to help him for a few days, but upon his return to college, his girlfriend is killed in the same way as their mother. Sam quits college, and he and Dean continue the search for both their father, and the demon responsible for the two deaths.Unable at first to find either their father, or the demon, the two brothers continue to hunt down other supernatural creatures. While in the first season these are mainly spirits, ghosts and some minor demons, with each new season the boys become aware of, and battle more powerful creatures of lore. Over the next nine years they face all manner of supernatural beings including angels, demons, witches, ghosts, vampires, reapers, demigods and leviathan. They square off against Lucifer. Meet and better Death on more than one occasion (even earning his respect in the process), and they even save the world from the apocalypse. Along the way many new characters are introduced, both good and evil. Some become regulars, while others, although memorable, make only one or two appearances. There are also some, such as the previously mentioned - Death, who continue to make the odd appearance from season to season. As Sam and Dean's knowledge and experience grow, the lines between good and evil become less black and white. Creatures who they once would have killed, sometimes become necessary allies, and occasionally even friends. They make bargains, some small, but others with far reaching consequences, and they learn more about the parts they personally play in the great scheme of things. Even though many of the episodes stand alone, Supernatural is a continuing story, and that may put some new viewers off. However it shouldn't, as the central theme changes from season to season, and enough references are given to explain what is going on at any given time. Of course, if the show hooks you in as it did me, you can always watch previous seasons. Although given that this review is written between the ninth and tenth seasons, you might want to give yourself more than a week! The main constant throughout the show though, is Sam and Dean. The series while of course concentrating on the supernatural, also follows the relationship between the two brothers. Although apart from the odd moment, this is done subtly, so that the obvious love the boys feel for each other is not pushed down the viewer's throat. However it is a vital part of the show, as although either one would die for the other in an instant, either one will also make deals with far reaching consequences to keep the other alive - or to bring him back from the dead. This is particularly true of Dean, who believes that protecting Sam is his main reason for being. Another constant about Supernatural is Dean's car, a black Chevy Impala. Although it does get smashed up from time to time, and even occasionally completely wrecked, it always somehow manages to get repaired, and this too is important. For really, at its heart, Supernatural is basically a story about two brothers on a very long road trip, that just happens to have a lot of nasty creatures involved. And if you're going to go on an almost decade long road trip, you may as well do it in a cool car. 9/10"
751,"Seriously, have you ever seen so many good-looking people in one show? Or laughed so hard at a set of blooper reels? As others have been saying, you will never sleep again if you watch the first series of this show with headphones on. In the dark. By yourself. Near a mirror or air vent. I never knew there were so many things to be scared of.Then you get to the second series, and the characters have your heart in the palm of their hand. They could crush it. Like a grape. I mean, whenever Dean cries, I cry. It's like the opposite of ""Lost,"" where I'd just laugh. (Poor Jack.)The only weakness I've found in ""Supernatural"" is its total disdain for reality. Come on, do you think those credit card scams would really work? And Sam gets wifi EVERYWHERE. How!? ....Then again, this is a show about catchin' demons, savin' people, and enjoyin' badass classic rock music, so it doesn't bother me too much that the writers leave some of the more, how shall we say, real-life factual details unaddressed.But anyway, it's a great show. Hell, I haven't even gotten to Castiel yet and I'm already in love with Misha Collins."
752,"I had to write a review because I have truly enjoyed watching this series.I must say that after watching the first episode only half way, I was never going to watch it because I don't believe in supernatural events and spirits and all that jazz but somehow the second one had me hooked because I enjoyed character development in the show.What I have followed is a series that is extremely well written using witty dialog that incorporates the pop culture and sci-fi vocabulary such as alternate-universe, angels, vampires, shape-shifters, clones, spirits, hell, heaven, immortality as well as more earthly issues like corporate power, politics and overeating and more using wit and humor.The series does not take itself seriously but somehow manages to incorporate action and a trilling stories that make you care about the characters.The series uses many movie and TV classics as inspiration for various episodes but with a different twist while incorporates current pop-culture.What I find most interesting is the series take on angels, prophets, demons and monster that parallel corporate culture as well as world of fiction itself."
753,"In my humble opinion, this TV show is very close to being perfect, but there's always something standing in a way of that. If you're into this genre I am pretty sure you'll enjoy it but before diving into it you have to know a few things. Seasons 1 & 2 follow a strict pattern of 'monster per episode'. There's the main plot development, of course, but it's a bit slow ( at least it was for me )and if there wasn't for people who encouraged me to continue watching I would probably abandon it somewhere along the way. However, from season 3 you can sense that something big is coming. And it does. As details reveal themselves you feel like you can't miss next episode. Plot is much thicker, characters are deeper and you have that feeling that you MUST see the next episode. The best part of it is that it lasts.At times you won't be sure if you're watching a horror TV show, a comedy, drama, fantasy... The fact that it's all there makes this show one of my all time favorites. Now, the flaws: 1. writers seem to be very eager to show ""family"" drama on screen that they do it too often occasionally. It's never ""out of the characters"" so to speak, but you might have the feeling that they are over-reacting sometimes. 2. I don't like the general idea of the season 7, but maybe that's just me. They seem to have done some redeeming at the end of it and I really hope the next season brings the show back to its former glory. 3. A big letdown for people who are expecting these kind of things. Guys, no girls allowed. No serious romance action has been seen yet and it's logical in a way, considering the 'nature of the job'. It comes down to recurring female characters and something is always almost happening, but it never really does. That doesn't mean that the brother- brother and father-sons relationships, friendships and other, family- like connections with secondary cast aren't more than enjoyable and fulfilling regarding the emotional side of the story. All in all it's a great show with interesting twists, good sense of humor, awesome characters and an interesting exploration of urban legends and myths of different cultures and religions. Highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars from me."
754,"I didn't watch Supernatural at first. I dismissed it as yet another WB series; a show that would be decent, but unexceptional. That, friends, was a huge mistake. Supernatural is not just exceptional, but is probably one of the best shows out there.The world of the series is our own, just a little darker. Ghosts, life-draining monsters and all manner of aberrant horrors lurk in the shadows, and the weapons we know are useless against them. Enter the Winchester brothers: Dean and Sam. They travel the country, hunting down the paranormal horrors that decimated their family twenty-two years ago, and hoping to spare others the same tragedy.Every episode is mysterious and suspenseful, and the scripts are well-written and thought-out. However, the best attribute of the series by far is the back-and-forth between the two stars. Ackles and Padalecki have the kind of chemistry that siblings everywhere will recognize. They trade one-liners during their adventures, argue fiercely at times, and are willing to do anything to protect each other.The special effects, set design and (as I mentioned before) writing are all top notch, the creatures are frightening and brilliantly accomplished, and the laid-back attitude of the two heroes keeps you amused throughout the show. The only thing that kept me from awarding the series 10 out of 10 is that the darker tone of some of the episodes sometimes takes away from the characters just being brothers. That having been said, 9 out of 10 ain't bad at all. Supernatural is well worth your viewing time."
755,"I'm a big horror film fan and I have to say that every episode of this show has made me jump. The fact that out of 22 shows there's not a single dud in there is amazing. For those of you who haven't seen the any program yet, each episode is essentially based on an urban legend with two brothers hunting evil wherever it lurks. It's true that it's not terribly original, with nods to Carrie, I know what you did last summer, the Ring, Candyman, Jeepers Creepers... in fact almost every modern horror film you can think of. There's a decent amount of blood but it's mostly geared for shock value - and with the lights off and the tension mounting, there's certainly plenty of that! I'm really looking forward to Season 2 when it comes out and I only hope they don't run out of ideas. If you're a horror film buff, you really shouldn't be missing this, In a word - awesome!"
756,"Since 'Angel' was cancelled prematurely in 2004, there has been nothing to fill the horror/supernatural slot in the world of TV (nothing of worth, anyway). So, it was like a breath of fresh air to fans of the paranormal when 'Supernatural' came along with the potential to rival even old favourites 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel'.The show centres on Dean and Sam Winchester, brothers who lost their mother in demonic circumstances when they were aged four years old and six months old respectively and lost their childhoods to their father's determination to pursue supernatural forces even if that meant raising his sons like warriors rather than children. Twenty-two years on, Dean continues his father's fight while Sam has opted for a 'normal' life at university. However, the supernatural is not finished with the Winchester family and when the brothers' father disappears, they go searching for him, hunting down any demon/paranormal creature they bump into along the way.Jensen Ackles is cast as Dean, the elder brother who may sport a cocky, devil-may-care attitude outwardly but beneath the surface is very needy and emotionally vulnerable thanks to his almost neglectful upbringing and precarious bond with his father while Jared Padalecki plays younger brother Sam, depicting the character's determination for both normality and revenge as well as his deep love for his elder brother who practically raised him. Both young men are excellent in portraying the deeper nuances to their roles so the characters are solid and three-dimensional but they also provide some nice eye candy for female fans!One of the strongest points about 'Supernatural' is it walks a nice balance between showing one-off episodes, covering story lines than range from quirky to rather dark and moody, and depicting episodes that begin to develop a mythology to the show so it becomes apparent to more discerning viewers that it was no coincidence the Winchester mother was murdered. It reminds me very much of 'The X-Files' in the earlier seasons before it become bogged down with boring conspiracies (hopefully, 'Supernatural' will avoid that pitfall).Given the quality of the show even from its first season, I imagine it will hopefully be on our screens for a good few years to come. It's definitely a must for those who love being spooked as well as fans of urban legends and ghost stories as well as those who wish to relive the good old days of 'Buffy' and 'Angel'."
757,"I love the plot and the way they express the story with their professional acting skills. However, the storyline gets repetitive sometimes. It gets a bit dull sometimes I had to fast forward the episode. It does worth the time watching the series as I like supernatural events."
758,"I have recently started watching Supernatural and quickly binged all the seasons on Netflix. At first I didn't find it enjoyable. Finish season one before you leave this show behind. This show has become one of my favorites. I don't usually enjoy sci-fi or super hero movies or anything of the sort, but this show has so much more than that at its core, the most prevalent being family. This show has helped me become a better person, sister, and friend, and I will forever be grateful! Plus, it's still on, and there's already 13 seasons to catch up on!"
759,I hope Dean kills catch that would be awesome I'm really good fight
760,"I love love love this show. I love every character. Castiels a godsend adorable dummy, sam is a big adorable smarty, and dean is a cunning verocious fighter."
761,"Why pay to watch the show when it's on Netflix? I can't explain how happy this makes me so all I can say is ""I love it!"". ""I worship it!"". I don't know what makes me more happy, my family, or this, seriously. I will love this until the day I die, it just always makes my day. I don't need to do one of those really long, explaining why I love Supernatural comments, I just really love and I can't explain why. I just... do. And it is not because Castiel, Dean, and Sam are so sexy/hot (lol), it's just because... I love it, and cannot explain why. I also LOVE Destiel, it always makes my day."
762,"SUPERNATURAL more than a Show , Seriously This show is incredible , 11Season = 11 years of The hard work ,From 2005 until 2016 They had done Great job and They're deserve more attention They're Really WORTH IT more than anyone Every single season they Had different ways to surprise us The way the show start from small Things Like Ghosts and spirits To Simple Things Like Werewolf and Vampires To Miraculous Things Like Angel and God Himself !! You can't guess what is coming next and this is the most Perfect thing in this show Every detail in the series are distinctive and innovative This is The Most Beautiful Show in the History of The TV World ! This Show has Huge fans and a lot of supporters but as I say They Deserve more than this ! They deserve some appreciation for this huge effort Maybe Season12 will be the End for The Supernatural But this Show will be always in our Mind .. Thanks To all The cast Of SPN Family For making this Incredible Show !! We All Appreciate that .. Supernatural Carry On you will always Remember ♥"
763,"I do not know where to start with supernatural, I mean these guys have truly touched my heart and soul. The relationship between Sam and dean is co dependent definitely, also made me wish I had a brother. Although, I kind of feel like Sam and dean are my older brothers! I have been there since the first episode and haven't missed one yet ! I have literally watched every season 8 times ... And every time I watch it I love it and can't get enough! I was so happy to see Misha Collins a regular cast member , Misha is such an amazing actor and also an amazing person in real life! I follow him on Twitter and social media he is something else! I would love to see this go on for years to come , and even though it wouldn't be as good I think a spin off, eventually, would be a good show to watch. keep up the good work mousse and squirrel ! Sammie and dean !"
764,"I watch this series on Netflix, and I'm on the second run through. I notice a lot that I missed on the first time through, some scenes go by pretty quick! The brothers, Sam and Dean, are mismatched almost perfectly. Juxtaposed against each other but yet inextricably connected. The talent of the actors Jared and Jensen as well as Misha Collins are clearly above the ""T.V."" level. Very good acting skills, humor, sadness, anger, anxiety and more acted out so that it glues me to my Macintosh! Mark Sheppard (who I've always admired as an actor) nicely balances out Misha, I love the way he can go from 0 - 60 when he's tossing a line in a script! Ya wanna love Crowley, but ya know you'll pay a heavy price to do it. Cass, the way the producers put his character together was masterful. Sorta half Jesus half Lucifer (another I really liked!). The things he goes thru as an angel - being 'lost', thinking for yourself, doubting beliefs, freedom, choice and the consequences of having the privilege to make those choices - these are things us ""hairless apes"" face every day. It was interesting to me to see Misha's character as an angel wrestle with these issues that humans normally consider easy to overcome or deal with. There was a scene with Cass sitting on a bench telling his story and he asked God for a sign, to verify if he was making the right decision. No answer. I thought that was perfect, God wouldn't answer because the ability to make independent choices comes with consequences, and we each have to find that on our own. It was sorta like a learning experience God let Cass go thru for his own good. But by far and away my favorite stand in was the archangel Gabriel. The things he put those boys thru, I laughed so hard I thought I was gonna pee my pants!! The nutcracker game....OMG.....""No pretty boy angels""......ha!! I can't wait for season 10 and I wish many more seasons for the entire crew. Well done, and that's something lots of shows cannot say in today's markets!"
765,"I watched this show from the beginning. It is not particularly great show if you verify special effects, but it is very involving show - there is interesting and witty script (at least for 8 seasons), the chemistry and some kind honesty between two main characters. I liked very much first 8 seasons, but pity - 9th season wasn't that interesting, and in 10th season Supernatural became family drama with a small glimpse of adventures. Castiels daughter issues, Crowleys mother? No no no... give me back ghosts, werewolves, vampires, give me back king of hell and not the ""lost boy, who didn't get love from his mommy"", give me back two brothers against evil - ""You know, saving people, hunting things. The family business."""
766,"This is the best TV show ever, it is all i do and think about. My room and my cloths are all supernatural. The universe of supernatural is so cool because there is so many possibilities on what the monster could be because it could be a one that you already know or a completely different monster all together. i could even see a spin off of different character in the same universe, because different countries have different monster legends they can explore. The writing is fantastic and they always change it up. All the actors are great and they always surprise you at every corner. The storytelling is my favourite part, the way they get real legends to make new monsters is really really cool and I would recommend this to anyone. SO GOOD! -Andrew"
767,"I started watching Supernatural from the beginning, and thought of it quite like Ex-Files. I still wasn't sure of it, but then the storyline grew thicker and it actually stuck to it! I am a very detailed person when I watch movies/shows (don't know why), for example, in Scandal it seems that everyone changes clothes 3 times a day in a 8hr work period??? Anyway, the storyline will also go back to previous seasons and bring up old shiot that was not completed or not done very well or when an old friend seems to pop up. I think that is the main reason I love this show so much, and b/c it does go by the stories from the bible, but has its own twist on the unknown. So the episode where Dean and Sam are in the future, and Sam is evil and Dean is good along with Castiel; I always look for meanings/clues if it will happen or who did they destroy to change the future. One of the reasons that I knew Castiel did not die during and with the leviathans. But I am glad they kept it that way, then it would not make any sense anymore."
768,"Wow...what a season (09) so far...i m in the front seat again as i was 05 years back when the season 05 aired... it was a very big worry for me since the recent seasons (06 & 07) of the show was not up to the standard set by the previous mind-blowing seasons (03,04 &05). But now i am so happy and very excited cz season 09 so far...Awesome and exciting as the season 05 of the show... enjoying to the maxxxx... thank you very very very much show runners for bringing the Genius Eric Kripke back to the show... and hope this will run at-least for another 05 or 06 years..... i can not post this unless i have some more to say so..am gonna say whatever i found in internet about the show...excellent...awesome...mind- blowing...very much exciting...so much fun.."
769,"I have been following this show through all the season and all the time been wondering ""HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH THIS?"", the story has developed from ordinary ghost hunt to the weirdest epic battle against heaven and hell........... and it has felt totally natural to watch.Good story writing with the right quantities of serious to funny, great characters.... yes and they are also handsome so my girlfriend likes to Watch the show with me though the ""horrow/supenatual"" ain't her thing.This show is Great and I cant wait to see what will be going on for the end of this season!10 out of 10 stars and hoping this show will never end"
770,"Supernatural is a show about two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, who go around saving people from the monsters that you thought were under your bed. Dean has been a hunter and will always be a hunter, but Sam is a different story. He just wants to go to college, but loves his family too much to let them down when their father goes missing. Sam and Dean's dad are all they've got. So Sam and Dean go off on a wild goose chase looking for their dad. They get tangled up with demons, wendigos, djinns, angels, and everything else you thought couldn't possibly be real. Supernatural isn't just a thriller, though. The writers of this show are geniuses and add hints of comedy in every episode. Also, Dean and Sam have one weakness: they love each other too much. The Winchester brothers would literally sell their souls for each other. In Supernatural you'll witness how Sam and Dean's brotherly love keeps them from doing their important job. Also, if you love classic rock, you'll love this show. Rock is the only music you hear through the whole show. Even if you don't love rock and roll, you will. Trust me. But here's my warning, if you start watching this show, you'll be hooked. So when you're ready to watch this kick-butt thriller-drama-comedy, make sure you're ready to be watching it at all hours."
771,"if u are not interested in SF/monsters/etc/ movies than there is Always a problem, but without looking at that: Its has it all: Almost every season a great story, great brothers, funny, lost of action, not boring/slow (and not too fast either), not many goofs/mistakesWhat i really like is the extra effort they took: (examples) - Every last episode ""carry on wayward son"" - the special Christmas episode - the eye of the tiger thingy <3Im Always looking forward to see the next episode, its not getting boring. It doesn't feel like ages before a next season comes out (like with game of thrones)"
772,"i'm a fan since 2005. Dean's smile in episode one captured my soul (everyone agrees, right?) The character development is great. Every season you see new sides so Sam and Dean. With Bobby you learn all the truth (during his greatest episode yet *ugly sobbing*) Even the characters with the smallest parts make a huge impact. Like Samandriel (he was in only 2 episodes) Or even like Charlie, her latest episode (Pac-man fever) you got to see a side of her like that almost killed me. I can't wait for season 9. I hope to see more of Castiel, maybe even see more of his emotions (although angels aren't good with emotion) I also hope to see more of the Winchesters life."
773,"I rated this a 9 because nothing is perfect but this show is coming damn close. The plot is refreshing and intriguing with a fresh twist next week. New ideas around Vampires, Werewolves and other mythological creatures. It has a a lot of supernatural but set in with reality so much that it could be real.The characters Sam, Dean and Castiel give off exhilarating chemistry in their acting due to their off set friendships which makes the show enjoyable to watch.8 season and still kicking... Let's make it to 10. I absolutely adore this show and encourage others to give it a go. it is not everybody's cup of tea but if it is then there is no doubt you will be hooked."
774,"I just love Supernatural !! The pilot are already putting the mouth watering and we already fall in love of Dean and Sam .The season one talk about the two brothers who hunting monsters ans who try to found they're father.The others seasons,it's more complex.All the actors play they're characters very well .Sam is very kind but who has a dark side.I love it.Dean too but he's very protective with everyone he love,and behind his face without emotions,he is very sensible.They're relationship is earnest.Castiel is very funny and cute.The others characters like Crowley,Balthazar,or Gabriel put a little touch. Humor is very well mixed with the horror.It's the only show that i like all the characters,same Lucifer! Every season finale is amazing,in each you want to scream !The plot in each season is very tightly structured with the demons, angels,hell,paradise,and others creatures.No too bloody,nor too fluffy,the horror is perfectly integrated. I just a bit dislike the season 8,it's look like Sam and Dean become depressive.Some episodes are unnecessary.So... To summarize,Supernatural is necessary to see!You didn't will regret it.For me,it's the best SciFi show !"
775,"I hope supernatural never ends!!!!XD Dean I love plus hes a hot tee with a body!!!! Great taste in music and cars!! Love that car!!!!XD Man do I want that car!!XD Sam is awesome too!!! if you hadn't got that far in season sorry ill I gonna say is that The angel..Cass....awesome!kinda losing his mind but yet he didn't seems like he did though, not all there...am I right?.. at least that's I thought in the last episode I watched but LOVE it awesome Don't ever end then I wont have NOTHING to watch!!!!XD I'm on the beginning of season 8 now love love this show!!! So please don't decide to stop making ever!!!XD well only if you REALLY Absolutely have to I would and do recommend this show to EVERYONE I no!!XDr they are coming out w season 9?deffentally right & 10? any more?!!"
776,"I have watched Supernatural from day one. It is one of my favorite TV show. It has everything that makes a show great, that it has lasted 8 season and have been picked up for a 9th, that alone should show how great of a show this is. I am a 35 yr-old mom of 3 and I'm like a obsessed teenager(no offense) when it comes to watching Supernatural. The actors, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins are a great team and work so well together, as well as other cast members.I will always be a fan, I still watch re-runs every morning. I hope one day they will make a movie, I bet it will be a box office hit! Please think about it! Thank you, Patti."
777,"Hello, I'm a fan of Supernatural.I was scared when I first started this series. But I got used to seeing scary creatures like ghost, dead, vampires and wolf man. My favorite character is Dean because He is a brave, fearless, funny, and actually a very emotional. He does everything for his brother and his father. If you think to start this series, you will not regret.A week ago I started the third season. I really liked the second season finale. They killed the devil tried to kill for years because the demon killed their mother since Sam and Dean was a child. Then Demon killed their father. They haven't got a normal life. They are doing fraud because they don't get paid for killing creatures. Save the people important to them. I love this series."
778,Come on man....This show is awesome!!!So many year have passed and this is still my favorite 1.The X file was a good show but i can tell u this after watching this show the x file will be your 2nd choice.This show is not only about ghosts or supernatural activity but its also about the true bond between two brother who got each others back.They sacrifice everything for each other.Action....its actions are amazing!!The brothers are like western cowboys but only in our time.The combination of supernatural activity with modernization will hit your brain.It is most popular show on earth and i am damn proud to be a fan of it.U guys who haven't seen it yet go and collect your copy of supernatural DVDs. so long amigos..... :)
779,"To begin, I so so love this show. I've been watching it since the beginning and am an absolute hardcore fan. This review is extremely biased, but as truthful as possible. I'll break this review down into three sections so I don't fangirl out all in one crazy paragraph:Section 1: Actors Lets begin with Jensen, since he has the strangest name(and he's the best looking). Jensen Ackles portrays Dean Winchester, the rough and tough brother who does most of the unremorseful killing. Jensen is absolutely brilliant. He seems to be really in his element here, much more so than Smallville or My Bloody Valentine(let's not go into that one, shall we?). He's the type of actor who makes you cry with him, laugh at all of his cheesy jokes, and understand his angle of everything, even if he's wrong. He's definitely the best actor on the show. Next up, Jared Padalecki. Besides being heart-breakingly puppy adorable and about eight feet tall, Jared does a really good job of playing a nerd. He's believable, though a little too sweet to be true at times. Though I suppose TV characters aren't always true to life. His character is a little underrated at times in the first couple of seasons. He's always the sentimental brother who does really stupid things, and Jensen's character has to come save him. Though if you enjoy sweet geeky boys that make you wish they were real(well, until they lose their soul), you'll adore Jared as Sam. Misha Collins. Where can we begin with our rugged angel? Other reviews may tell you that Misha is the lifeless rock in the series, but I have to say, that's the point! His character is utterly unemotional and dryly hilarious, and Misha delivers his not-jokes very well. He's not the best actor in the series, but he's a lovable pet rock. Section 2: Storyline It has its holes. Like when(*spoilers)Pamela the psychic gets stabbed, and then later tells Dean in heaven that she was shot, that's a big one. I could name a few others, but that's what the goofs section is for people! Anyways, here's the story.Sam and Dean Winchester are formerly estranged brothers who band together when their father goes missing to find him. But there's a twist here...their father is a monster hunter! And so are they! So begins the epic saga of the Winchesters, kicking butt, taking names, and occasionally dying here and there. That's the first season. I'm not going to give you the whole plot, but that's basically how it starts off. The whole show is centered around what family means, even in a family as strange as the Winchesters. The whole thing is really quite touching, once you get past the monsters.Section 3: Monsters This is not a family show, unless you want your kids to be weird. Seriously though, it gets inappropriate. Dean is a vapid ladies man, and some of his scenes get kind of racy, though I can't recall any nudity. It also gets bloody. Gore is a core element of Supernatural. It is, after all, a ""horror"" show. I put horror in quotations because this show has never scared me. Jumpy? Yes, but it's not sleep-with-a-nightlight-and-nightmares scary. The only person I know who has been legibly scared by it is my grandmother. So look out for blood, but don't expect lifetime mental scarring or anything. In overview, this is an excellent example of modern television, with a great cast and not too many scares along the way. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
780,"I just recently started to watch the series and now I am at the newest Episode from season 8.I find it very interesting that a series is getting 22 Episodes per season even today. Still, while I love the main story, Im sure the series could very well be cut in half. What I want to say is there is a lot of filler material.That aside, the first 5 seasons simply are top notch, all of the characters are believable, every choice they made, no matter what character, fits the role perfectly. To bad it went a bit downhill after season 5. But what can you expect? The brothers beat the devil and angels and stopped the apocalypse. Everything builded up from episode 1 came to a conclusion.Its hard to top that but its still a decent show. Especially season 7 wasn't that good but i have my hopes up for season 8 since it seems all to be heaven and hell related which i like a lot."
781,"I really like the show but why do they insist of making the two main characters show the extremes of their personalities every other episode. Dean and Sam are opposites in a lot of way - we get it. Stop alternating having one of them overacting like a complete idiot every couple of episodes. Dean especially, by the end of Season 3 I wanted to kill him myself. Other than that - awesome show. Original writing and great directing. ""Roadkill"" and ""Heart"" were some of the best TV show episodes I've ever seen. Hopefully it stays the course and cut down on the brothers doing completely out of character, moronic things. How many times can they get each other killed and then saved without it seeming ridiculous? Oh, wait - already too late... Yet despite that, so far the show has been getting better. Keep it going."
782,"Sam and Dean are raised to hunt everything that ""goes bump in the night"". And Dean and his father does, until their father disappears breaking up that pair, and Sams girlfriend is murdered in the same was as the brothers mother was. Throwing Sam and Dean together into a ""monster killing duo"".If this is all the series is about then I wouldn't blame you if you think it would become very repetitive very quickly. It's not. It's about father-son and family relations, friendship and everything that makes us human. All set in a supernatural, monster killing scenario - like X Files meets Freddy Krueger or something the like.The series really picks up during season 2, in my opinion, using the whole of series 1 to set the stage for the later developments. If you don't get hooked on series 1 try to endure until series 2 and then go back for a rerun of series 1."
783,"*** This comment may contain spoilers *** I just wanted to say that the father was not declared dead , but missing. The older brother goes to his younger brother to tell him that there father went searching for the demon who killed there mother, is now missing and asks him for help. The younger brother agrees to do it and they solves a mystery on the way. After the job was done, he finds that his girlfriend meeting the same death as his mother. With revenge in his heart, the brothers are searching for their father...and using his journal as a map to find out where his destinations have been, in hopes of finding him, just missing him in the process...but it has never implied he was dead...I thought I would bring this to your attention."
784,"Thank you for a wonderful final season. I cried along with the Winchester boys. Loved this show from the very first season. You gave us the perfect ending to a great, consistent show."
785,"Maybe it's just me, I hope not, but Dean is a straight up dickhead this season, annoying to watch. I know, he's always been difficult, hard to reason with, but this season he's self-righteous, arrogant and pissy all the time, hope it changes, it's no fun to watch, getting old quick. That is all."
786,"Supernatural didn't have a cult following until after season 5. it then had a cartoon and another show spin off... but still, where is ""Young Sammie and Dean-o-mac""? Yes, i know ""Dean-o-mac"" wasn't an actual nickname, but they did watch TV as a kid and Dean enjoyed wrestling lol! How was it really for them while their dad was on a job?"
787,"Padalecki is not featured in a lot of movies and it's mostly the same kind so it's hard to declare if he is a good actor or not. But that man is awesome at playing the nice guy with heavy problems.In Supernatural, I discovered he had real acting skills when he played the ""bad guy"" (possessed, soulless, etc.) and I go more with Dean's boldness but my heart aches every time I see ""little Sammy"" with all that devilish crap falling on him, trying to resist while knowing he's pretty much alone to understand what he's going through (think S7 ep17 for ex.).It's kind of a ""Jesus-like"" fate, and J.P. knows really well how to carry that ; he gets me every time, though I'm normally tired real quick with endless drama. It also makes it more important when we (rarely) see him smile or have fun.Bravo, Padalecki..."
788,The episode no rest for the wicked is sad because dean goes to hell later in season 4 in the episode Lazarus rising dean rises from the grave later in that season dean and Sam both encounter Alastair Alastair used hand power it worked on dean but not Sam because he was hooked on demon blood from a demon chick named ruby Alastair dies later on in the season because killed by using his amazing powers which killed him then in the season finale in season 4 we find out that white eyed demon Lilith was the final seal Sam didn't listen until it was too late Sam killed Lilith which caused Lucifer the arc angel to rise out of hell later in season 5 they find out that Cass is dead but then god rose him up from the dead no one knew where god is but Raphael believed that god was dead
789,"I have been watching this series on and off since it began but could never stay with it due to other engagements or work or class, etc. So this year I decided to watch a full season and I love the reruns on TNT. It's the one thing I like waking up to in the morning when I don't have class.THE SHOW: It's great, angels, demons. . .Castiel. This show is super natural at it's best. It's unreal but realistic. Funny but serious. Scary and emotional. I like that I have been able to jump in on the show whenever and still kind of know what's going on. Now I need to start from the beginning because there are some things that I just don't know. All in all. . this is a show worth watching from the beginning or now."
790,"Okey Dokey, another groupie here. I admit to being a Dean girl, not a Sam girl or a Dean/Sam girl (am I the only one who that phrase throws up certain 'images' for?) Although I do think that season six lost some of its 'feel'.The weekly episodes just didn't seem to have that usual kick. Don't get me wrong, there was still a few memorable ones and the dialogue is still classic (Dean being abducted by aliens 'THEY'RE AFTER ME!' Sam 'Third kind already? Better run man, I think the fourth kind is a butt thing') But I do admit to feeling apprehensive to the way the story line is progressing.Castiel god? Can't really top that fight. And with two more seasons being picked up by the network, hmmmmmmmmmmmm........ certainly will be interesting to see where it goes. (Mind you, is he really THE God, we already know about the existence of lesser gods - season five 'Hammer of the Gods') And what about some of the loose ends? i.e Chuck, Fairies, Jesse?My one biggest fear is that the whole of Supernatural will end by fizzing out - loosing it's oomph and ideas. I hope I'm wrong, but I think we got a slight taste of that in series six. Supernatural is a series that deserves to end on a high, give the fans what they wan't, and for god's sake, let Sam and Dean have some peace!"
791,"Hi this show is amazing i was just wondering if any1 knew if there is going to be another season. I think there should do another season me and my wife love the show. I can't get enough of the show i've got every episodes from Season 1 to Season 4 but i'm going to buy all of them on original DVD when they are all DVD. But i'd love to know if there's going to be another season because of the way season 4 episodes 22 finished, Sam killing Lilith and dean not getting to Sam to stop him killing her, and with Lucifer about to come in to the room with them it finished. I thought there was more than that, They can't leave it like that."
792,"Move over Buffy and watch out Charmed. There are new ghoolie ghoul hunters in town and they are hot. For those of you not living under a rock you know what I am talking about. The CW's hit series Supernatural, staring Jared Padalecki (formally of Gilmore Girls), and Jensen Ackles (formally of Smallville). What could have easily been just another show about ghosts and other things that go bump in the night has now become a stand alone smash. Not only has the show used creatures that most people have heard about, (I.E. The Woman In White and Bloody Mary) but the creator and other writers have brought to light lesser known evils, (I.E. Wendigo and Shtriga).The series and session starter, simply title Pilot, grips you and refuses to let go. It starts simply enough, loving family ripped from their normal life by the un-natural death of their mother, played beautifully by Samantha Smith. Flash-forward a few years and the youngest son, Sam is in collage, has a stunning girlfriend and a seemingly normal life. Enter the wayward brother, and yes that is a hint at the great songs to be used. Dean informs his brother that their father has gone missing on a 'hunting' trip. It's Sam flipped remark about his fathers 'hunting' companions Jack, Jim and Jose that gives the viewers a good idea that John has gone missing before. Needless to say, a few memorable smart alex comments and some great sibling bantering later and Dean has convinced Sam to join him on the hunt for their missing parent.What is great about this episode is that the writer, Eric Kripke, who happens to be the shows creator, used such a well-known legend that there was no need to focus on the myth itself. The Pilot jumped right into the dynamics of the relationship between the brothers, including the point where Dean feels Sam has insulted the memory of their mother and shoves him roughly against steel beam. For just a beat there is the tension of how differently they both feel about the life they were forced to live. Where Dean seems to fall so easily into the role of 'good little solider', Sam is the stereotypical rebellious brother/son. Which is odd, plot wise, seeing as he is rebelling to have a normal life.There is little reviled regarding John, their father (portrayed by Jeffery Dean Morgan of Grays Anatomy], and the only glimpse we have of Mary, their mother, is in the beginning where she walks in on a stranger in Baby Sam's room. It is the unanswered questions that will keep viewers coming back each week to learn more of the story between Sam and this unknown guest.Bottom line, the Supernatural Pilot hooks you with the great story and keeps you wanting more with all the questions. This is one show to watch for and it will only get better with time."
793,"Don't let the 1 star reviews fool you. Those particular fans were not happy that they didn't get the ending they demanded. The story begins and ends with Sam and Dean, as it should be."
794,"Thank you for this show.
Supernatural forever on my heart."
795,"I have been a fan from day. I have never felt it necessary to write a rewieiw as this was my show. I watched it for me, I grew old with this show, now 65, my kids are more or less the same age as Sam and Dean, my daughter got married on the same day as Jensen and Danneel. There has not been a tv series that has given me so much excitement, fun, love, great characters, beautiful people and most of all the feeling of being a part of something, without actually being there. I know sounds a little crazy. Looking at the last 2 episodes I will always remember the tears I cried having to say goodbye, to these 2 boys, for that is always what they will be to me, and all the others
I wish to say thank you to everyone who made this show, from the lowest to the highest I am eternally greatful .I'll be watching them over and over, they will never get boring, they'll keep making me laugh. I wish everyone a wonderful future."
796,Thank you so much for these years to entertain us.
797,"...really, I was crazy about it, this was my favorite TV show of all and I watched it a lot. Fantastic stories, episodes but they should stop it after Season 5. I was happy at first when I saw they are going on with the show, but after a first few episodes I was so disappointed with the story that I stopped to watch it. I have only good memories about Supernatural and I wanted to keep it that way. Now I saw that I am not the only one who is thinking like that. Too bad, really too bad to ruin such a fantastic show. The atmosphere, story, music, characters - it was fantastic. From Season 6 - absolute disaster....I hope they will improve, but I had to let them know that they lost one disappointed viewer..."
798,"Loved this show with all that I am and took these characters to heart and home. I'm thankful for all that they have done over these 15yrs. The series finale broke my heart for Dean but that is what are does.. it emotes a reaction, it makes us feel something if we're lucky.... I TV hate the writers right now but will always LOVE and support them for the rest of their great work. My boys never disappoint!"
799,"I want to Thank Everyone, Cast & Crew, for an absolute blessing of a show. I got into watching it because one of my sons was into it, but then I went through some stuff and kind of forgot about it, until I was staying with my little sister and found out that she had gotten into it, so we started from the beginning and watched it together, for the past 6/7 years we have continued watching it, even when not together. I have met some wonderful people through this show's fandom. One such person has become my best friend and we are now roommates. I don't know where I would be today without this show, the Boys, and the Fandom. Thank you Jensen, Jared, Misha, & all the rest for a wonderful journey.Now to discuss the ending.
At first I was like WTH, Dean taken out by a piece of rebar ??, but after a couple of days reflecting on it, I am happy with the ending. I do agree with everyone on one very specific point, and that is that it would have been nice to see everyone together at the end, (in heaven), but we also need to remember that there is a pandemic going on, and some of the cast & crew could not afford to be exposed so openly. Just a thought peeps.Sincerely, Teresa Jo"
800,I began watching from the pilot and continued till the end. It has been one hell of a ride and I've never once been disappointed. Thank you for always holding a special place in my heart.
801,"If you want the top notch Supernatural experience just watch all the seasons and stop at season 15 episode 19.Episode 19 was the real finale.Episode 20 had the dumbest death for Dean of all time.Just don't watch 15 episode 20 and enjoy the rest.All things considered this is one of my favorites of all time. Because of the plots. The humor. The action. The acting. And in the end the depiction of brotherly love. Which one of us doesn't want a brother like Sam or Dean? We all do.This show has comforted and entertained me throughout the years and I am grateful to it.I am grateful to the crew. Grateful to Jensen, Jared, Misha, and the gang. Grateful to the writers. Grateful to the directors.Thank you for your Labor of love. It has been a pleasure to watch your journey and come along for the ride in the back of the ImpalaBecause it's about the journey and what the open road might bring, not about the destination.So shed a single man tear for the end of this epic ballad of brothers. And head out on the highway looking for adventure.*Cracks a cold one*- here's to you Supernatural."
802,"This is my first series(english) and what can i say i really love it
The emotions the fun all they had
And we can watch the whole america in this series and offcourse all type of monsters ghosts etc for sure"
803,"Seriously i cant find any Tv Series that enjoy to watch after 14 Season and every season comes more excitingI Love Sam , Dean and Cas just like my BrotherI think i will be cry at the end of Season 15 cause i never love to see this Tv Series EndThanks for make good time for us , never forget Supernatural"
804,"Seriously good show, well drawn characters and ""out there"" plot lines with a running story that doesn't get in the way of the fun. The pilot episode was a humdinger, with a couple of shaky episodes to follow. But it appears to have settled well and is building nicely (Mind you, I'm in Australia and about 6 episodes behind the pace - last one I saw, two nights ago, was Nightmare). The interaction between the two brothers is a joy to watch, without the all too common ""we're family and we love each other"" schmaltz. I look forward to each episode with keen anticipation, and sincerely hope it will return for several seasons in the future."
805,"I will admit that I wanted nothing to do with this show before seeing it and I lost a bet and had to watch the first 2 seasons. I have never been so glad to lose a bet. I have been a fan ever since. I am not going to go into the awesome job that the Winchesters and the supporting actors do every time they step up to the plate, or the way that the storylines just seem to hold you to your seat every week or the way they took a subject matter like supernatural subject matter and turned on its head and kicked its ass, because I could not do it justice. Check for yourselves. If you are not hooked to binge watch every episode after the first two seasons, then the only excuse is that you must be in a hospital room somewhere on life-support.Give it a go. You will thank me!"
806,"15 years. I was a teeanger when the show started, now im 31. Never missed a single episode. Time flies when you're having fun. Truely in my top-3 best shows ever. 10/10."
807,"I love this tv show since I watched first episode , so nervous due the series ended:("
808,"The show is 15 seasons big, and the reason is just simple. The characters of this show have come so long yet they haven't find their peace. In my opinion, that is the most human thing. They have some amazing characters and it has induced the longevity. They have great story lines, probably their lucifer arc is the best. But they again gained momentum after introducing men of letters and the 15th season is a blockbuster."
809,"Just started watching season 14 and it's as great as season 1, how are they able to do this I have no idea, great to see some characters return. Still missing Crowley but the show is just class. Show is just so fresh it's amazing the actors are just amazing, love this show👍"
810,Funny. Serious. Engaging. You would love the witty Dean. Awesome !
811,"""it's o.k"" would be a good summery. it's always the same and it's getting old. not many surprises, you never feel completely satisfied.. it's like almost getting there but then no. it has potential but it just doesn't get there. for one why dose the ""supernatural"" ""logo"" always suck?? i mean come on guys it's one of the first things you see! it kinds hints on the quality and whats waiting ahead.. next the ""action"". when they finally meet the monsters they always pass out!wake up and pathetically get it over with with a sorry excuse of a ""fight"" it's like the writers aren't interested in that part! but it's supposed to be a major climax point that the story builds to..after half an hour of story we want to see the sucker go down in style and fire works not practically handing the knife and pointing where to stick it! the characters are good it's just to bad they are not properly used. like a beautiful vase with the wrong roses."
812,"It's one of those series that splits apart from all the stuff you see everyday on TV. When I first started watching it I thought: ""cool some paranormal stuff"" but as the story continues you get sucked into it. Most episodes tell a story of their own, almost all of those are enjoyable and provide a little diversion from the main storyline, but ultimately you'll recognize that the the main plot is not just decoration but the driving force behind actions. And that plot will make you addicted to it, even though it loses a little of it's thrill in the second season. The characters are mysterious and always appear to hide something from each other, but they are well played and trustworthy. Free up your Thursday evening and watch Supernatural, beforehand you should grab the DVD of the first season to apply to the main plot, and get to know the characters. 8 out of 10 because there are little ways to spend a better Thursday evening then watching Supernatural."
813,"I watched this show from the very first episode because its premise caught my attention and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it turned out to be. The two actors who play the Winchester brothers play very well off of one another and have great chemistry. Jensen Ackles, who plays the older brother is really the break out star of this show as his performances are outstanding. On the surface he appears to be little more than the smart ass big brother who simply wants to hunt down and destroy any supernatural creature he possibly can. It doesn't take long for us to see that Sam (the youngest) is not the only compassionate brother. They both want to find their father and avenge their mother's death as well as help others along the way. Add the character of the father to the mix and things get even more interesting. This show is not just about two demon-hunting brothers. It also skillfully explores the complicated relationship not only between the brothers, but between the brothers and their father as well. Supernatural only gets better and better as the season progresses and has become much more than just a monster of the week show. Every episode has wonderful, witty dialogue and unlike some other 'generic' horror/sci-fi shows targeted at younger audiences, Supernatural purposely tries to be different and to stand out from the crowd (and succeeds). By the end of this first season, I was completely enthralled by the story lines and looked forward to the show every week. The action only gets better and better until the season finale that leaves you wondering, what are the Winchesters going to do next and how will they possibly top this in season 2?"
814,Supernatural has and will always be one of the best television series to be on TV. The cast crew and writers are incredible.
815,"No matter what the ending the journey is what defined the show and made it one of the best . I will always love Sam, Dean, Baby and Castiel. I will always love JP and JA.
I will cherish this show and respect the whole SPN FAMILY and the Cast and Crew for this wonderful show. Although i watched the show only for 3 years it feels like i have watched from the past 15 years. Although we didn't get the ending we deserved we as fans should respect the writers and Eric Kripke because without them we wouldn't have had the pleasure of watching Supernatural in the first place. And im sure all the fans will never stop loving the show. Im ready to watch this epic journey of the Winchester brothers again and again because it will never stop being one of the best"
816,You would love Dean Winchester. He is hell of a character
817,"It's the last season which makes sense but is still saddening. I have watched this show since the start. At first a fan of Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and a bit of Jared, and now a fan of Jensen and Misha.This is the first show to really pay homage to a brotherly bond. Most shows such as bones or castle have a male/female lead, or charmed with a sisterly bond feel, and vampire diaries/the originals that tote out the group casts. This show however focused (at least for most of the beginning seasons) on just two brothers. I laughed with them, cried with them, and shook my head in exasperation at deans play boy ways. Despite the number of seasons this show always delivered and had the most likable characters throughout ( you know, not like walking dead where I was praying that a cast member would be bit, or game of thrones where I rooted for some of them to get killed off).The best part about this show is as this series comes to a close they have wrapped most plot holes up....I may have missed the one where they figure out whatever happened to the little boy who changes Castile into a toy (season 5 ep. 6 I believe). I know he disappeared to all points nowhere but he seemed like a possible strong alliance opportunity in the face of losing Jack and fighting god...Anywho, This is a truly great show especially for those who enjoy supernatural/horror genres.."
818,"Much as I liked Buffy, and Angel, and Smallville, and XFiles, I like Supernatural for a few simple reasons, specifically because I've watched the other shows. The main characters aren't in high school for one thing. Most of the characteristics I like can be drawn back to that one fairly easily.The fact they're 22 & 26, and male, means that these characters can swear. They can get laid. Not every girl they see has ""first kiss"" lovey-dovey built in. They can go to jail without their parents being called. They don't have deadlines in assignments to meet. They can drive. They can drink. And they can get hurt without hiding the fact from all their friends.Halleluja! If I wanted to see more of the same, there's 7 seasons of Buffy, 5 of Angel, 5 of Smallville, and dozens of other examples I could go to. This is new, with the action I'd expect, without the XFile's restrictive regulations imposed on the characters due to their jobs. (Which I also like - but who doesn't?) Throw caution to the wind!I like that it's two brothers driving around, not girls being insightful or oh-so-smart or chick-flicky or even empowered Buffy-style. I like action films, and thrillers, and sci-fi, and horror, and comedy, and this show's got a little bit of everything. Don't expect high art here, it's just a bit of good fun, entertaining. And I dunno about you, but I'm watching these shows to be entertained, not find out the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. (42 by the way ;] ) I'd suggest you sit back, watch a few episodes, and see if you agree. If not, don't watch anymore :P"
819,"This has been the most amazing show.I could go into an extended in-depth analysis of the 300+ episode series, but really, you'll need to see for yourself.I was one of those people who listened to the description (Two brothers who fight monsters) and never bothered to give this series the chance it truly deserved. Boy was that a mistake.When I finally gained some sense, I binged 14 seasons (307ep) in less than 2½mo.Put it on, buckle up!
You will not regret it.To Kripke, Singer, Padalecki, Ackles, and the cast and crew: Thanks for this unbelievably incredible ride."
820,It's great tv show to get into it two brothers going around hunting supernatural beings but the show just gets better and better as it goes on
821,Well for me the biggest regret is that I started watching this show after so many years. This lockdown period I binge watched almost all the season and loved it... Completely!Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles compliment each other so beautifully throughout the season. However it gets repititive in the mid of the season but still keeps you glued even in the 14th and 15th season. This is actually an achievement for this show to have such run.
822,"I've loved this show, I've watched it from day one, a real shame it's about to end, but the writing of the last few season has been lacking & running thin. I've stuck with the show because of my love for the boys. I'm going to miss them and a lot of great characters I've loved a long the way, such as Ellen & Jo, Bobby, Charlie, Crowley, original Death, Lucifer just to name a few. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end & it was time. I just hope Jared & Jensen find work on other show/s or movie soon. Anyway as the song goes with each final episode: ""Carry on my wayward son""...Peace out..."
823,"Re-watching the series again because they are ending after 15 seasons. The writers for me have an excellent sense of humor combined with the chemistry and flow the actors bring, it is saying goodbye to old friends. Except for Mary...the mother that never should have come back. Terrible soulles actress aswell as the role is poor. She is pulling down the show. Also when she is with the rest on comicon, she bring this uninterested energy.
For the rest, i'm gonna miss yall."
824,"My teen girls love this show. so do I. solid writing, just good entertainment."
825,"I've been watching this show since day 1. But for the last few years I'm not enjoying it that much. The story has become dull especially between S10-S14. They've run out of ideas. It was much much better when each episode was independent (one episode, one case).I'll keep watching till it's finished just out of curiosity. The last episode of S14 was a huge disappointement, since the Winchester brothers broke their own oath and rule - 'Saving people'. Sam sacrificed humanity just because God was playing them, at the end they put themselves above everyone and everything and I couldn't believe that the writers chose this as an end.I really hope the writers will give Sam, Dean and Cash a proper ending. They deserve it. I hope they won't bring back Jack, their mother or any other characters, apart from Crawley. I think the story should end with the original cast."
826,The final episode of season 14 is epic. I forgive you for giving me crappy boring 19 episodes because the last one is pure genius. Well played writers.
827,"Unlike other CW shows , this show never turned into soapy drama like OTH , it stayed the same even if the first seasons were better it's still very good , i don't know if you haven't watched it and want to watch 14 seasons is a good idea or not but for us who have watched it for years , it's become a main part of our lives , i am 17 , i started watching it on tv when i was 8 with my family then as i grew older i started watching it alone on netflix and other stuff so it's part of my life and even if it's not as good it will always be one of my favourites."
828,"I was first recommend this show a few years ago and I tried to watch it, and got 10 mins in before turning it off 'cause I hated it. I ended up watching ""Scoobynatural"" & loving. I soon ended up binging it. Watch it."
829,"This show is just non stop good, good stories and great actors. The show has continued for thirteen season because they keep the show interesting which almost never happens"
830,This one of my best series ever i love this show i love how he have the gfx i love the story
831,"Sometimes you hear rumors about ""an awesome New show is landed on a channel Somewhere"" since my streaming adventure started with Game of Thrones there were a couple of wishes on my TBW list
1. True blood (because I heard it was a badass vampire show, and hell was It true)
2 Power Rangers angers mighty Morphin to RPM
And this one Im just 11 episodes In and OMG what a awesome script is this one. It is a culmination of my favorite genres in film, urban legends, family drama and fast pased. Watching through Amazon hope i get to the 237 episode I should say carry on my wayward son, with the Winchester brothers cruising around kanses learning more about the dark side of this world see you at the end of the Journey, hopefully."
832,"Last night I watched the last episode of season 14, I enjoyed it thoroughly and cannot wait to see how things in season 5 are picked up and (probably) come to a close, since word is that season 15 will be the last. I'm a big fan from S1E1 on, and after a possible closure I of course will miss Dean and Sam terribly, but maybe 15 seasons is already over-stretching the limits of how long a show can keep on being fresh and surprising. The foremost seasons I really had the feeling things slipped away in more and more chaotic storylines and repetitiveness: angels going in and out (and in and out again) of human vessels, characters (including main characters like Sam and Dean themselves) getting killed and coming back again, characters long dead out of the blue re-appearing and an endless train of old acquaintances popping up, as if the writers had a tough time inventing something new.But this season distinguished itself by more sober, surveyable and inventive storylines and fortunately with many episodes where we got to see Sam and Dean in their most appealing line of work: hunting crazy creatures. The story about Jack got more and more interesting with some genuine psychological insights as to his relationship with Dean, Sam and Castiel and to Jack loosing his soul. As ever, the special effects are awesome, the pace is high and the humor is great, the latter being always a big part of the fun of this show.The acting is also great, not only by the main characters (Padalecki and Ackles are so familiar with each other and the series that they don't seem to act at all) but even by the many side-characters. And I especially want to mention Mark Pellegrino as Nick (or Lucifer), he does a terrific job and is hair-raisingly scary in his creepy, condescending attitude. And Alexander Calvert, he's very convincing in the totally innocent and endearing (but dangerous) Jack. My only reservation concerns Padalecki's nervous tics; maybe by this the direction wants to emphasize the difference between sensitive and intellectual Sam with down-to-earth Dean, but after 20 episodes of stammering, twitching, and cheeks quivering it does get a bit on ones nerves.Anyway, still a great show, looking forward to the next (last??) season."
833,"Any sound review begins with a lackluster resume. The program constantly referred to in this essay tells the story of two brothers seeking answers through a never ending road trip across the USA. Their job? To hunt down monsters. Their paychecks? Stolen credit cards.Supernatural is a show that, thanks to its unending run and overall inconsistency, becomes almost impossible to rate. At best, Supernatural is a show with surprisingly good direction. A show with a thrilling story. So great, in fact, that it fooled the uniformed into thinking it had been planned from day one. It is not uncommon for TV shows to improvise, the problem arised once this TV show's staff started to slowly cripple over the years. Whichever advantage it gained from its unpredictability has now been largely outweighed by its downsides.The first seasons of Supernatural tend to be surprisingly underrated. While its episodic nature mostly took over any form of over-arching storytelling, the main characters are at their best. The gruesome deaths, the heavy shadows and the broken nature of the protagonists created a somber experience that was unique when it first aired. It would seem strange to defend those as being the best years of Supernatural, especially considering the rather many obvious flaws. Yet, there's is nothing out there that quite compares as a compelling episodic horror TV show. At this time, Supernatural had the best advantage: Being recent.Most fans would likely argue that the following years, up to season 5, would be Supernatural's prime. Finally putting aside its filler content to let its story become the meat of a season, the thrill reaches an all time height. It is a TV show that does not shy away from breaking down the foundation under its character's foot, which can turn out to be repetitive or idiotic at worst. Still, it makes for the best turn of events, with an unpredictable story that builds upon the previously established universe beautifully. After a lackluster season 3, the last two seasons of the show's first arc were the perfect ending to a TV show such as Supernatural. Possibly never enough to be considered a masterpiece, but enough to be great.Season 6, is yet again, a season unfairly criticized. After its intended five season run, Supernatural had to reboot itself. Problem being, in its deepest core, in its genre and themes, the show was not the same as the one presented within its first seasons. The renewed format that had been such a marvelous advantage during the previous two seasons turned out to be a living nightmare. How is it possible to continue a TV show that now used the story-line as its foundation when the tale had already been told? Still, season 6 tried to turn the tables, clear the board and expand on what needed to be expanded. Some of Supernatural's most memorable characters were built during this season.Unfortunately, ever since, Supernatural has found itself deeper than the pits of hell. Its inconsistent directing, acting and writing now suffered from issues much more concerning than inconsistency. From shoving political agendas down the viewers throat to constant retconning, without forgetting the frequent overused genre-breaking episodes, the last few seasons have been a time looped train-wreck. Its overarching story barely holds together and the filler content has lost its horror elements. On top of that, Supernatural's only strength that made it stand out was lost: Its charm. There is nothing else to thank than the poor editing, lazy direction, horrible color grading and an aperture setting set higher than the Tokyo Tower. With now fifteen seasons, ten of which should have never happened, never had a television program been run down so much into the ground.Who are you?Me, I was an impressionable teen that spent his nights watching Supernatural alone. My TV screen was the lonely's room only light source, and my heart's only interest. At nighttime, I would stay awake for hours, wondering what would happen next as I followed the tale of the brothers' travels. Today, my heart has aged and I am left hoping it will all finally end."
834,"The show isn't bad. It's certainly entertaining and has a lot of humor in it. The actors are great as well. I didn't see many miscast in the whole show (except for the returning of Meg which was terrible) So, what's the problem ?The writing is very lazy, not only in a way that makes the show very predictable, but they also rip off other great shows like the X-Files by copying out either entire episodes or scenes. In the season 11 for instance, the telekinetic baby is a whole scene ripped off from William's episode of X-Files.The worst thing about the show is clearly the plot. It is ALWAYS the same : One brother dies / gets tormented by a terrible curse / has to endure an ordeal. The other brother tries to save him at all costs and against the will of his brother, often by unleashing a worst evil leading to the next season. Note that there's often a ""superweapon"" involved that's needed to kill a ""supervilain"" which conveniently falls out of fashion next season even though it's ""all powerful"".Some things also don't make any sense. At the beginning of the show, they were all trying to save people and got really afflicted with each innocent's death. For instance, they would always carefully exorcise demons to try to save it's host. But, after some point, they stopped doing that out of nowhere and started blasting demons with a ceremonial knife and thus killing it's host. Worst thing about this is they felt no remorse, and the writers didn't bother to explain the psychological event that lead to this drastic change of mindset."
835,"This show is the best horror show I've ever seen. And the family bonds and arguments are surely something that could happen in real life. The love Sam and Dean have for each other as brothers is adorable. There's is some sad stuff also but as long as they are together they will always live to fight another day. With Cas and Jack the family has expanded even more and all hunters are family. I'm really sad that the show ends . But then again nothing really ends, does it?"
836,"Watched this when it first came out years ago but only got through I think 5 seasons. And was unable to watch the rest. But now I am I've gone back to it rewatching from being into season 11 now Love it I swear Jensen just gets hotter with age!! Tbh I crush on both Winchesters & castiel. So this show is definitely some good eye candy for the ladies.. the acting great and stories on fire from season one. It can get tedious keep seeing them killing a ghost. And they are also quite selfish and 2 faced characters the more the shows go on. I mean come on they had the chance to close the gates of hell forever. Then there's Dean that never keeps a deal. But in spite of this you still cant help but love them, and they're human after all so we all make errors. You even cant help and feel sorry for the King of hell. Anyway after spending the night dreaming about Dean Winchester I'm a leave my review at that and go watch me some more Supernatural!!!"
837,"This is a perfect show for anyone into ghosts, demons, and Dean and Same kicking ass. For me, the storyline these brothers have are unforgettably amazing. Nothing like a good, funny, sarcastic, horror series"
838,"Let me preface by saying ""Supernatural"" is by all means not flawless. Over the course of fourteen, going on fifteen, years, there are bound to be some inconsistencies. However, from start to its forseeable finish, it remains true to its core about the series creator Kripke's central theme: ""family is hell"".For someone who is into occult and biblical mysteries, with a bit of urban legends and folklore, ""Supernatural"" is an essential experience. It is worthy of its title as it keeps the supernatural aspects front and center--integral to the story and not just an added quirk (as many shows in the genre tend to do). Ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves, angels, and, even gods, all come to play and test the amazing brotherhood of Sam and Dean Winchester.""Supernatural"" borrows from its predecessors ""The X-Files"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" but builds up on its own mythos and identity to set itself apart.Monster-of-the-week cases feature villains that either parallel certain hardships of the main characters (such the monster Rugaru or the half-demon Cambion who were both destined to a dark path being used as effective parallel to Sam's future) or symbolizes their inner conflicts or desires (such as when a Djinn taps into Dean's inner desire of a peaceful life free of monsters and hunting). An overarching plot drives the story deeper into the supernatural world while remaining grounded about familial challenges. A latter addition of a central character Castiel is when the show fully steps out of the shadow of its influences and solidifies its own mythology. A decade after Castiel reveals his wings, and ""Supernatural"" easily still has the best depiction of angels in live-action television.Meta and unique episodes also keep the show fresh and innovative. Even the iconic 1967 Chevy Impala arguably becomes its own character and is heavily featured in an episode that revolves around it in season eleven. The muscle car, combined with classic rock and small town, blue-collar American backroads paint an aesthetic and build vibes that are distinctly ""Supernatural"". Come season thirteen, and this long-running show about monsters and ghosts crosses over in an animated episode with ""Scooby-Doo"", another long-running show about monsters and ghosts.Originally written for just first five seasons (it has become an inside joke to many fans that somebody made a crossroads deal to extend the show for another ten years), ""Supernatural"" is slated to end in its fifteenth season. While the first five seasons (also known as the Kripke era) remain the best years, the latter seasons (eleven onwards) are shaping up to be very good additions. The middle years unfortunately have been weakened by a change of showrunners, which left the transition weak due to fractured and self-contained story arcs as opposed to a gradual build up of coherent arcs that the first five had. Answers among the fans will vary on which one is the weakest season. I personally enjoyed season six and seven (Gamble era), due to their attempt to expand the mythos without muddling the established lore, as opposed to season eight to nine (early Carver era), which had more retcons that hurt the overall narrative, and, repetitive arcs. However, season ten and eleven (latter Carver era) were significant improvement. Seasons twelve to fifteen (the Dabb-Singer era) had conflicts that are gradually built up and are often tied to the previous seasons, which make the overall narrative of the series stronger once more.Aside from the theme of family, the show tackles a number of interesting topics such as morality, addiction, forgiveness and redemption. It is not a perfect show, but it is relatable on many levels, and the scope and scale of the show will surely satisfy fans of the genre."
839,"The show consists of series long arks interspersed with increasingly meta episodes. Jared and jensen bounce off each other in a way that most shows can only dream of. Eric kripke does a fantastic job for the series he's showrunner and cannonically dies in a season 7 episode. Misha and jensens off screen friendship is evident in their screen time together.
About five or so years ago I was with this girl who tried to get me to watch supernatural, for whatever reason I didn't get round to it until about 6 months ago. I only just finished season 13 and as I'm in the UK season 14 isn't easy to get hold of. I was sceptical as to how much I would enjoy an overly macho CW show about ghosts, oh boy was I in for a surprise. I do feel it's a shame the show went of for as long as it did, with the three stars announcing season 15 would be the last just a week before I wrote this.
The first five seasons are some of the best American television I've ever watched and the odd episode after that point was very enjoyable"
840,"I remember the first day I was told about this show and I thought to myself ... Monster hunters ??? First i was skeptic about it because i was raise to believe that angels where good and monsters are bad ... and at first i was ok i can watch this without having to invest on it ... but the first season got me good and I felt compel to continued to watch ... and after so many good memories and episodes I felt in love with the characters and the people involved in this epic serie !!!
now after so many years of drama and action and mysteries and betrayal I've learn that this show has so much potential and getting better by the season and I know some people don't see it and you just need to be open minded to the possibilities that this show has to offer and i love that there are not afraid to make bold choices ... I've learn so much through the year and this show gave me one of my best lessons ... Keep doing what are doing and never stop making bold choicesI know is not a long review but its mine and the show speaks for it self ...
and best for last stay humble and be grateful for everything even if just the little things ..."
841,"A series well known and cherished among all kinds of viewers and without doubt brilliant and breathtaking, yet seems to be getting a little sloppy at the last seasons. It is a common belief that the inspiration source of the series has outlived it's purpose, thus leaving the series in an endless, boring, repeating loop of events and characters. While that may well be the case, it seems that it is somehow kept afloat. Nevertheless totally worth the time, but perhaps not all of it."
842,"Seasons 1-5 are a definite 10 stars, a roller coaster of episodes, no two alike the show provides a perfect mix of drama, horror, humor, suspense, thriller, comedy, silly, believable and more. A mix of all the good tv shows in one. I love the brother duo, it is a refreshing change and provides really good dynamics. Beautiful troubled Sam always wrestling with himself and beautiful, self sacrificing, badass, lovable, selfless, resilient Dean, two amazing characters that evolve develop and change over time. Dean Winchester is definitely on my list of the top 5 fictional characters (TV and movie) ever. A great underlying story that provides a great climax at the end of season 5 with smaller stories dotted along the way. The show is not without its shortcomings and plot holes but as long as you do not take it too seriously, overall it is well worth watching.
Season 6,7 and 8 reduce to 9 stars ( 7 for the angels), some good story lines and some bad story lines with some really strong drama and a change of pace and style in season 7 that was very different but pretty good. They have started to introduce more and more of the angels that provide a really boring story and bring the tone of supernatural down.Season 9 and 10 get 9 stars for the mark of Cain story line (although I expected so much more from this) and 4 stars for the angel story. Beginning to feel like more attention being paid to fan conventions rather than the viewers. Not happy with the long long overdrawn angel saga that has taken these majestic and all powerful beings to a really low level. In order to keep Castiel in the story they have introduced him and the angel story independently to the Winchester brothers and it really does not work for me. It ruins the pace and the tone and has a weak and boring story. If I wanted angels I would have watched lucifer or angel or so many other shows. 
Season 11 is very different to the others, a very different Dean and it gets quite weird. Jury still out on this one.Season 12 gets a score of 1 star for the angels/castiel/demon and 6 for the rest (Sam and Dean save a bit of this season). Season 13 no stars- horrific. The show has really lost its way on these seasons, difficult to watch, tedious, boring and turning into quite a comedy with all the resurrections and bringing back all the middle aged (or younger) oldies. No strong story lines, no new monsters, no new characters, the brothers are spending too much time saving each other rather than the world or people, too much time cleaning up each others messes or Castiel's who by the way is the worst monster of all. And what is it with American writers and their mothers? Oedipus complex??? The Greeks invented and the American writers perfected? The best way to kill brother chemistry and man power....bring back mum, dear old mum. Oh dear. Skipped through most of the episodes in season 13 to tell the truth they were so boring. Too many people, too much talking no action, no substance, no monsters, no hunts. Episodes that remind me of a long running soap opera rather than a supernatural show. What a pity. I am leaving my overall rating of the show at 9 only to do justice to everyone that contributed to the production of seasons 1-5 and the team that put it together!!!!"
843,"Some seasons are better than others but they are all pretty good. If you haven't watched supernatural before, you are missing out on a great piece.
If a show has been around for 12 years and is still continuing, the show has to be good. Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)is a bad ass who listens to classic rock and drives a 67' Impala. He has a brother Sam (Jared Padelecki)who is also a bad ass. The two brothers travel to kill the monsters of the night (Demons, vampires, werewolves, leviathans {you will learn what a leviathan is in seasons 7, 8, or 9}, some angles, literally the devil himself, and god's evil sister.) The brothers also have a friend, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) who is very good friends with their father John Winchester (Jeffery Dean Morgan.) In Season 4, Dean is dragged out of hell by an angel, named Castiel (Misha Collins.) Crowley (Mark Sheppard), the king of the Crossroads/King of Hell is also a huge antagonist AND protagonist (sometimes he's a good guy, sometimes he's not.)"
844,"Supernatural is a show which is hard to review because it is so much up and down it becomes hard to give it a final score. The first two seasons are the best, I could give those a week 9, but then the show starts digging too far into religions, angels, Lucifer, God, and lately even God's Sister(sic!). As long as the two brothers do X-file stuff, roaming the countryside saving people and hunting things, the show is great entertainment and very good, but as soon as they get off that ride, then the show is more average. The score of individual episodes, for me, go from 5 to 8 to 6 to 7 to 5 and up on the occasional 9. Very up and down. With that said I still care. After 12 seasons I still care what happens to Sam and Dean, so I do follow the show, but not like a slave like I used to do. The God-Angels-religious-stuff is what I do not like so much, and when one Brother dies for the 2986th time, it is hard to take everything so serious. Is there a threat to the Winchester boys? At all? If Luficer, shotgun blasts, witches, demons, angels and other beings cannot kill them, then what can? FBI, the Police and every agency in the U.S. is looking for them for countless of crimes, but still they can go into a diner and have a bacon burger for 25min without ever getting arrested. Yes, it is a show about supernatural things and ghosts so we need to give it some space, but a bit of reality would be good... Although I might sound a bit negative, this is good enough to follow and I do recommend that you watch if you haven't already. Each season do produce enough great episodes and great entertainment even if you do not always buy the premise. I ended up giving the show a 7, but it could also be a 6 or 5, maybe 8. Never below 5 though and seldom above 8. Good, fun, entertaining. Check it out."
845,"OK, this is a kind of a mashed-up review of the ""old"" Supernatural, from about 2005-10, and the ""newer"" Supernatural, from 2010-current, because my opinions on the two are considerably different.First off, if you are new to the show and are planning on watching the series from the beginning or the earliest seasons, I do recommend it as a pretty enjoyable watch. The premise is simple, as many fans of the show love to imitate in their best deep Dean Winchester voice: ""Dad's on a hunting trip...and he hasn't been home in a few days."" This leads to the somewhat obvious direction of the show: Brothers Sam and Dean traversing the country hunting the paranormal menace while searching for their father. The first two seasons are perhaps actually most true to this statement, as it becomes more clear there's a ""bigger"" story in the works. The show plays on the typical dark ambiance of horror and supernatural genre, all the while maintaining the subtle yet unsettling circumstance of the dad's disappearance. There are all the usual ""monsters-of-the-week"", like vampires, ghosts, and demons. The actors are actually pretty phenomenal, with many also very connected and passionate about the show, and even while it was obvious this was a low-budget spooky show, it was still pretty fun to watch.However, I'd say Supernatural really kicked off at Season Three, which takes place AFTER the main story arc for the first two seasons. It is here that the plot becomes more of an actual story, and characters begin to develop. While Sam and Dean certainly develop through their back-story as we learn about their childhood difficulties, only when the brothers are confronted with not a worldly problem but a personal one is when we see the multi-faceted personalities break through; suddenly, each one has an opinion, a view on hope, despair, or patience. To me, the show became much more intriguing, inviting genuine closeness to the protagonists instead of mere mild interest. Dean's internal struggles to accept or fight his hell-bound fate and Sam's helplessness both created a really powerful and relatable story, supernatural aside.It was also in this season that Supernatural found its, erm, style. While the show certainly continued to recycle monster lore and other horror clichés, Supernatural steered towards drama, adventure, even its own weird comedy. One of the strangest things certainly is how close the show actually has ties with its fandom, as it certainly acknowledges its existence in several episodes. While you don't have to be that ""avid fan"" to enjoy those, Supernatural takes time to poke fun at itself, acknowledging everything from its drama clichés between Sam and Dean to noting how hardcore fans of the show write fan fiction pairing different characters as couples.However, as with all good things, they must--in some shape or form--come to an end. While Supernatural certainly became an intriguing and interesting show, especially with newly added lore from various religions and a sort of ""final showdown"" situation emerged between factions of angels and literally Satan, the series ended at the season finale of Season Five. Or at least...it should have. In a sense, it was obvious. Many strings were tied, with each character plucked and placed in the right time and place, and it seemed like the perfect ending...because it was meant to be. However, despite this very nice ending to a enjoyable show, Supernatural was renewed for a new season.This era, which I dubbed ""New Supernatural"", has a considerably different opinion than does the old one, although I won't say much on this. I should first mention that I actually DO still watch the show, even in its ELEVENTH season coming soon. After 2010, Supernatural writers of course had to scramble to find something else to write about, even though the story was supposed to end at season five. With each new season, the writers are forced to invent a new storyline, a new ""big bad"", and of course, when this happens, loose ends appear. Characters get separated or written wrong, the plot sort of flips around as holes appear or are hastily covered up. This is how Supernatural actually became my ""guilty pleasure"", because while it's enough to watch this show for its somewhat sappy or cheesy premise, it becomes another factor when the show itself has devolved in quality. But because it's a guilty pleasure, I just can't stop watching. So bravo, Supernatural. I guess I still can't escape your snare.Overall, this show is quite good, and if you have the time to plow through all (or most) of the episodes, you should."
846,"I'll probably shed a tear or two when all is said and done. Only one season left, supposedly, but we can always hope for more.Season 1 had lots of Monster of the Week, but good MOTW type stuff. Excellent horror. Somewhat like mini Horror movies, but good ones. The plot intensive episodes are awesome, and the last third of the season is quite outstanding. Season 2 and 3 get better at it, incorporating pieces of the story here and there, with a lot less MOTW stuff. Season 4 has almost been pure story from beginning to end. Definitely should get into. For now, pickup the first season on DVD or digitally download it.My grades for the seasons:Season 1: B Season 2: A- Season 3: B- Season 4: A+"
847,"I only really got into Supernatural recently. I discovered it quite by accident after complaining to a mate that there wasn't anything exciting on TV anymore, and he wigged out about 'Supernatural: it's so awesome!' So, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I'm now an addict. I think I got through season 1 in a week, and season 2 I had to force myself to slow down. I love it! Yes, it has it's problems, but the charisma (not to mention impressive physique) of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, combined with the cheesy, sometimes quite freaky, 'monster of the week' plot lines, make it almost compulsive viewing. I was raised on monster movies, so it's great to find a TV show that riffs on that. The dialogue is fun and loaded with pop-culture references, and the action is gung-ho and fast paced. Also, the soundtrack is like someone stole my i-pod! Classic rock all round! By the end of the second season, it' like the writers were writing to AC DC. I have to approve.And then there's the car. You gotta love the car.So if you ever pine for the days of Buffy and co, then this show should be right up your ally. If you like zombies, vampires and the odd cursed ghost thrown in for good measure, this show is for you. If you have an i-pod full of Blue Oyster Cult, Kansas, Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or even Spinal Tap (made me soooo happy!) then turn this on! And if you don't, well, come for the Winchester brothers - two engaging and interesting lead characters you can't help but fall in love with (and who are pretty easy on the eye to boot!)This show is my favourite thing on TV at the moment. I think it's a crime more people aren't watching it. OK, so I got to it a little late, but at least I got there! You should too. It's fun, action packed, and there are a couple of scares in there along the way. The writing is enthralling, the performances are good, and did I mention the car? Go watch now!"
848,"if you think you are going to watch something in the calibre of the x files then forget it...it will be more like Buffy the Vampire slayer..... I am a Buffy fan, so it is not an insult to the show, but I would say it is more on the lighter side of the Genre. The X files is dark and witty, and that is not what supernatural is, so to those who are comparing the 2 shows, I would say, stop right there. The show is about two young brothers in desperate pursuit of their father, they both had a traumatizing experience as kids when their mom was killed by a mysterious force. The show starts naive and the acting a bit sloppy, but as it goes on they get better(just like Buffy), but since I am sucker for the supernatural I can watch all this, I don't know about the rest of the viewers. As every horror show it plays on famous urban legends and puts a bit of a twist to it, as I said before no complicated plots or conspiracies like the X files or Millennium. It is still a good watch and definitely better than other shoes on TV now. The humor is sometimes forced, but Dean grows on you really ( the older brother ), Sam is sometimes too annoying taking brooding to a higher level, but he can never pull an 'Angel' (from Buffy ).Enjoy the show if you enjoy supernatural stuff"
849,"Recently i had given up with TV, but i heard about this and my hopes shot up. Being the keen movie fan that i am i have watched a vast collection of horror films and this most certainly live up to the genres well deserved name.The story is about two brothers who hunt supernatural creatures, this pretty basic plot line allows for a vast variety of things that are able to happen within the programme. Each episode, apart from the odd few, has a new creature for the boys to deal with (althought there is a continuous plot running underneath). This allows for new scenery, characters and problems to be introduced meaning that you'll never be bored. The actors and actresses play their parts perfectly and each monster is designed carefully down to the smallest detail so that it seems very realistic. i would recommend this to any horror fans or people who are looking for a quality piece of television."
