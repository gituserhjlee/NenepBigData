0,"While everybody complains about the lousy action, the terrible state of Cage, I want to point out another reason NOT to see this movie. The camerawork, it's awful, then there is shaky cam (a lot of it), then they glued the camera to the guns, then unnecessary closeups, it's terrible."
1,"NO amount of alcohol can make this movie good..I assumed. Reminds me of my home movies the I was 7 years old....I wouldn't even watch that. Its a generic predator rip off/ comic book/ first person shooter/ mid 1980s effects? With no continuity, acting or actual decide story... if that sounds confusing its because it is. It like click bait because of the actors names and that all( and they don't even act)... I failed to watch the whole movie and think I got about 10mins in(open credits).Otherwise its a great movie if you want to torture someone"
2,"Writer's ""inspiration"" was Alien, Ninja Turtles, Mortal Kombat, Guyver. However, for some twisted reason, he decide to put all that into one movie. There is no story line, no motivation for main characters' actions, no cinematography.
The only beautiful shot was when two of the characters were walking across a field, shot from above. No acting, despite Cage's honorable attempts.I would forgive all of the above, if, atleast there was real Jiu Jitsu. As the name states, this movei is about the martial art. However, most of the fighting was the regular, Holywood style, flashy fighting. Here and there there were some Jiu Jitsu specific moves and that it.Please avoid wasting your time."
3,"The effects are ridiculous, the story disjointed and making no sense, the acting is horrible. I mean, I would love to be able to say ""except Nicholas Cage"", but he is also really bad. And the cast is filled with actors you've seen before and respected for their work: Cage, Rick Yune, Tony Jaa, Frank Grillo, Juju Chan. I mean, they were never Shakespearean thespians, but they did action well. Guess what: the fight scenes are bad! I mean, this is like someone made efforts to mess this movie up! The only way one can enjoy this is being drunk out of their minds and laughing all the time."
4,"I don't mind hokey, contrived plots if the action's good. But the action isn't good.This movie is a complete waste of time. Go watch some old Jackie Chan movies if you want great fights, or old John Woo flicks for brilliant, original fight choreography. Don't waste your time on this garbage."
5,.. I'm still waitingI can disregard the lame sci-fi and Predator look-alike stuff.I can live with the lousy sound and scoreI'm okay with the blood being painted on afterwardsI just want to see some nice well choreographed Jiu Jitsu.But alas - the camera crew has apparently never filmed martial arts before. And - the stunt choreographer didn't get the memo that the style should be Jiu-Jitsu.
6,"One of the worst movies ever!!! We all know Cage´s movies are a straight-to-DVD and this is just another cheap Cage movie. I couldn´t give it a zero rating because there is no choice for that. I wanted to see it because of Tony Jaa´s martial arts talents but the movie does not let you enjoy Jaa´s fights unlike his own movies like Ong-Bak or Tom Yum Goong (a.k.a. The Protector).
This movie also reminded me of another awful movie ""Beyond Skyline"" which I also wanted to watch because Iko Uwais´martial arts talents but these two movies have the same bad script, bad acting (Frank Grillo in both,btw),bad cinematography,bad sound, etc.
You better stick to Tony Jaa´s and Iko Uwais´ previous movies (The Raid 1 &2) which are awesomely choreographed."
7,I don't believe Nicolas Cage would be starring in this truly awful movie. Seriously wasted 2 hours of my time. I hope the rest of you guys won't repeat my mistake.
8,"When I decided to watch this movie I knew it was going to be bad, but I thought the script/story would be bad, not the action and cgi as well. This looked like a low budget, ""fanmade"" cgi. The action scenes, besides being unrealistic and excessively long, gets boring to the point where you actually want to skip them. I couldn't finish the movie, is that bad."
9,I would not recommend this movie. The story line and the SGI are not enough to hide the cheesy acting and bad directing
10,"Some of Nicholas Cage's movies are so weird that they are worth watching (like ""Color out of Space"") this is not one of them. It is weird but almost to the point where there was no though behind it at all. Aliens? Video Game? Comic-book heroes? I'm not sure, but the result is laughable. Nothing here for martial arts fans, nothing for sci-fi lovers absolute facepalm this one. It's cringe from start titles to end credits. Bad acting, fights choreography is horrid, story? non-existent. I don't think you'd even get a good laugh out of it, I sure didn't.Don't waste your time on this one. Exact score: 32 / 100"
11,"Jiu Jitsu (2020), not surprisingly, offers a lot of scenes of martial arts combat which are well choreographed and well executed by performers who are experts in their own right, including Tony Jaa, Alain Moussi, and JuJu Chan. However, it does not deliver on what Blake Snyder would have called the promise of the premise. It feels more like a cinematic version of a video game than a martial arts film. No novice acquires skills under the tutelage of a martial arts master, as in films ranging from The Karate Kid to Kill Bill. The protagonist doesn't really use jiu jitsu to defeat the villain. Many confrontations are not one-on-one or hand-to-hand. There is no real discussion of the philosophical or spiritual aspects. Nobody spends much time training. None of the characters seem to grow. The romantic B-story is flimsy and unconvincing.Instead, we are given a team of elite martial arts experts, each of whom uses a different weapon: tonfa, sword, nunchaku, shuriken, staff, throwing knives, et cetera, except for the protagonist, who occasionally uses an opponent's firearm or other weapon, but quickly discards it.The movie has aliens, space portals, a CIA plot, radiation levels, and an alien with some sort of Predator-like cloaking. However, the plot is somewhere between incoherent and nonexistent. Production values are more than adequate. The actors do as well as can be expected with the roles and dialogue they're given. The fight choreography is good and boosted by exemplary execution. Yet the film is not very satisfying and certainly not cathartic."
12,"This is a step up from the normal straight-to-DVD sci fi schlock I was expecting. It's not great by any means, but my popcorn certainly tasted better while I was watching it.Nic Cage was a supporting role, and really toned down while still being Cage enough to meet some expectations.I did like the premise, but it borrowed a lot from movies that have come before it. Enough of its own thing not to be insulting, but not original enough to disguise the stolen bits."
13,"Nicolas Cage and Frank Grillo are in this movie, but it ain't a guarantee this is a good movie. In fact, this is a bad one! DO NOT waste your time watching this movie!"
14,"Being a massive Nicholas Cage fan, I was sincerely looking forward to this movie. But I cannot tell how bad this movie was. I was waiting for 39 minutes through the movie telling myself that it might turn out to be okay when Cage appears but there was nothing redeeming this movie from its extremely bad direction. Don't get me wrong here. I still love Nicholas Cage but this just isn't my favorite one of his.Despite having a great pool of cast members, this movie goes on to show that every element of a production is important to make a successful movie.1. The action scenes were way too amateurish.
2. I've seen better CG done by tiktokers.
3. The pauses were way too long.
4. The bgm is basically the same throughout the entire movie and sounded like it was from the 60s.
5. The story cuts were seriously disconnected and hard (""boring"") to follow.
6. The camera angles for some action shots were all wrong.I would have given this 0 stars if I could. Still can't believe I've watched this in 2020."
15,"Cage is again stuck in a crappy film .
His acting is good but the script directing cgi all suck
And a list of no name actors to boot
If your going to hire Nick Cage make it worth the audience's time !"
16,"I don't know why Nick Cage keeps doing these cheezy movie roles... this is the worst on yet... Hope he works on getting his quality up... no more national tresure or face off 2, con-air 2? he used to be my favorite actor... good thing Bruce Wills didn't do it... Up your game Nick! Get Uncle Francis to help you!"
17,"You know those b-movies of the old, like Bad Taste? Which are so tacky and bad they are entertaining? This is not such a movie. It's just straight out bad and even the outlandish theme can't save it.The acting is bad. It's not entertainingly awkward bad, it's just bad with dialogue that has no pacing, makes no sense and leaves you wonder if it's a college student's first attempt at writing.The camera work tries something new by at times mixing hand-held with static and sometimes even first person, leaving just a confused impression.And the effects.. They are in that uncanny valley of looking too bad for realistic effects, but looking too good to be goofy.There's no redemption to this movie, it is just straight out boredom."
18,"To chevolek: way too harsh and this film is no way a 1* effort. You're just mad for some reason or you simply haven't seen enough actual trash 1* films.This movie is at least a competently executed popcorn guilty pleasure romp.Yes, excessive stylized comic book martial arts.Yes, cheesy but not vomit-inducing CGI.Yes, there are about a million better martial arts or sci fi films out there.But really...how many actual sci-fi/martial arts mashups? The One? Timecop? The Golden Child? The Last Dragon? Big Trouble In Little China?OK, those last few are more fantasy/martial arts, but still....Nice to see Nic, Grillo, Jaa and Yune all the same.Arnie's not sweating but this one is digestable fare with the right mindset.An OK 6....YMMV...."
19,I don't know were to start with this. Horrible writing. Laughable script and a plot you would expect from a juvenile film maker. This was green lighted because Nicolas Cage was in it.
20,As an action movie it is ok. As a martial arts movie in 2020 it is no good especially compared to hongkong movies like jackie chan and jet li movies. It is like a fight scene in 1970s movies. Full of slow motion which doesnt help because it exploits that the antagonists are just waiting to be hit by the protagonists.
21,"The huge problem with the movie is the title there is at max 1min of jujitsu, lots of Kung fu and even sword fighting.
The title drew me in, the low budget alien and terrible story that has no reference to the title and terrible acting settled this as a bad movie.
Nicholas Cage is one dimensional and honestly an actor getting worse with age.
I love Frank Grillo such ashame he signed on for this movie, no doubt from the promise of good fight scenes. Those scene lacked real world style and took more From Asain stylisted fighting.
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
22,"So 'The Predator', dressed in 'Necromonger' garms dukes it out with 'The Assassins Creed', every 6 years in a 'Battle Royale' for the 'fate of the world'. The 'Last man standing' is a 'Kickboxer'. Sound familiar?"
23,"Theres nothing positive about this movie
Story, fights, the music.. all was really badIt's really a bad plot, nothing makes senseI dont give it 1 for the sci of the alien guy"
24,"So much potential. I mean Tony Jaa which was awesome in Ong Bak, The Protector,in this movie, his talent is wasted.
With a title like Jiu Jitsu, the choreography of the fights should have been close to perfection. Well... far from that. The fights don't have impact, don't have fluidity, don't have any intensity. The fx are extremely bad (why would you add fx blood, if is not needed!?!) There's Nick Cage playing this crazy\ excentric martial arts master. ( I ve read all theses articles that say Nick Cage can fight ; in this movie, his fighting skill are atrocious).
If you want to watch a really good martial arts movie stick to : The Raid, Blood and Bone, Legendary Assassin."
25,"Safe yourself from 2 hours of pain. I love Sci-Fi, but this movie has absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Horrible acting - like............ I thought the lead was mentally handicapped until he spoke about 10 minutes into the movie. Seriously.I have NO IDEA why the alien comes to Earth - they never explained any of the backstory so it's basically confusing throughout.Stay away from this movie."
26,"Can't get worst than this....
Graphics- 3rd class
Acting- like not interested
Choreography- like they want it to be a flop
Plot- Predator, mortal Kombat and many more are with same story but better movies."
27,"Only watched it for Marie Avgeropoulos, but there was no point to her character and then she was just killed off. The first half of the movie implied that she would be a main character and then she died a background character death. Also everything else was trash and made no sense."
28,"Camera work shocking, holes in the so called story. Watched due to Tony jaa being in it but that was disappointing. Shame"
29,"OmG there is not even a single thing good about this film .terrible story ,worst direction even a bunch of worst actors along with Nicolas cage who again proved that he is becoming worst actor day by day.Tony Jaa what a waste .terrible screen presence, terrible action .maybe the issue with the direction but still .come on man how can you be so dumb an actor
Please don't waste your time or money on this film .not at all recommended"
30,"I achieved to watch for half an hour...Couldnt swatch it any more,its bad and it obvious..."
31,"I don't like reviewing any movie that I haven't watched fully, but this one was just too awful to stick with, I think it was 10-15 mins before I had to turn it off.Felt like the budget was blown on the actors and they didn't have any money left for the multiple takes to get a scene right or a proper special effects team (looks like it was done by a couple of high schoolers). The issues were further magnified by some odd/experimental camera work choices that did little to hide mistakes."
32,"Jiu Jitsu is the worst film I've seen in a long time. It completely rips off the plot of Predator and tries to be clever by adding a time portal subplot. The point of view shots of the Alien stalking these people in the woods clearly steals from Predator too (there is nothing original in this garbage)When I watched the trailer I was hoping for a Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter style film, but it takes itself too seriously. The sound effects are loud and over the top and the music score is repetitive rubbish that belongs in a Sharknado film.
The 'acting' is awful from everyone but it's no surprise as most of these people are clearly fighters of some kind. Frank Grillo and Tony Jaa have had acting experience in previous movies but they were completely wasted here. I DO NOT know why Nicholas Cage was in this... He's in it for 30 minutes and his action scenes were clearly performed by stunt doubles. This man just says yes to anything these days, I suppose a man's gotta eat though.It's not a long film, it's just over 90 minutes but I had to pause it for 30 minutes and take a nap because it literally bored me. I don't usually take naps and I've sat through much longer films. It didn't engage me much at all. The only redeeming thing in this film is one or two fight scenes at the start which had good choreography (particularly from Tony Jaa) It didn't feel like a film though, it felt like a showcase for stuntmen to show off their skills.All in all it has a boring plot. Forgettable repetitive action scenes which were clearly stagged. Terrible camera work. Uneven tone. Sloppy pace. Rubbish CGI blood splatters. Lightning that makes the whole film look dull. I've made better movies in school. I don't know who wrote the script for this but it wasn't an adult, it was probably written by a 9 year old with a crayon."
33,"I have wasted valuable time that can not be returned.. I am a fan of Cage movies but this is Bad... The acting, the dialog hell they even managed to mess up the scenery."
34,"Predictable storyline,
Messy editing, Terrible direction and no real story.
In short, it's 100 minutes of my life that I will never get back."
35,This is a movie where all the costs including cast and marketing did not exceed 1$ as a budget. It is so bad to the point that in one fighting scene they started punching the camera man and shoot him with fake bullets.
36,"Gave it 20 mins and had to turn it off.Seems to me that any Cage film these days is this way, no plot or character building. simply a waste of time. DO NOT BOTHER!"
37,I can't understand why anyone would take the trouble to make such a terrible movie. The acting is bad the story is worse and there is no logic in dialogues at all. Don't waste your time.
38,"I love martial arts films, but this was the pits!
Every single fight had cheesy slo-mo shots every few moves!
Story line was choppy, not strung along very well at all & left you with more questions than were answered by the story line.
Acting was bad & after 15 minutes of starting the movie I started to skip though but it didn't get any better!"
39,"If it was 1986, this would have been fine, hell, Even if 1991, definitely would fit in with all the cheesy martial arts films of that area. but in 2020, wow. The ""special"" effects are hilarious.
And the big name cast too? surprising."
40,"33 minutes in and it still fails to captivate me.
This is NOT an A or a B movie... hell it's not even in the A - G category.
Disappointing and a waste of time/money, that's all i can say!"
41,"This is the worst movie of all times, I don't know why Nicolas Cage doesn't just give it up and find something else to do that would be good for him. What I hated the most was that Frank Grillo was in it, such a great actor brought down like that and to drag him into it to make it better was really a low and a cheap move from the director whomever he is."
42,"A shoddy storyline, with useless script, delivered poorly and acted terribly.
I wasn't expecting much from this film, with Nicholas Cage as one of its ""stars"" and I definitely wasn't disappointed. From start to finish you're hoping for some sort of drive to keep watching, but with the action scenes so obviously choreographed and weak, you're never going to get your reward.
How films like this get the production costs is beyond me.
Maybe on paper this looked like a good idea, but surely someone saw this post production and thought, good god this is awful. Even Tony Jaa couldn't safe this utter pile of crap."
43,"Can someone explain how the first 15 minutes of this film contain 6 hours of fight sequences?Couldn't take any more, switched off after about 20 minutes...way too much fighting!One for the die hard fans of whoever these MMA stars were."
44,"Aside from the horrible acting by Alain Moussi as Jake, that constant dumbfounded ""duhhh"" facial expression he had, was the same face I had throughout this film.This film is basically Predator meets Mortal Kombat, but without the budget or imagination of either, and seemingly written and directed by an amateur filmmaker. For starters, the screenplay was atrocious. It's not like this is Logothetis' first rodeo, but a 5th grader could've written a better screenplay. It was convoluted with plot and technical issues, dragged out scenes, and choppy editing. The 102 min runtime felt like 3 plus hours with terrible pacing and too much filler for the little substance this film had. These errors could've so easily been rectified if Logothetis had consulted with a seasoned writer - or at least watched the entire film with a few friends before releasing it to see how terribly it was put together.What I did like, was the score, which was surprisingly fitting and not loud and obnoxious like most B films. The cinematography was great as was the S/VFX. Some of the choreography for the fight and action scenes were awesome, especially in the beginning with the POV shots. Casting was good with mostly decent performances, especially from Nicolas Cage, who was his usually awesome crazy self that stole the show. It was great to see Tony Jaa, Frank Grillo, and Eddie Steeples, who was a hoot.If you enjoy non stop fights and action scenes with excellent visuals, but without a great store, you'll enjoy this one. It's no 10/10, but certainly not worthy of any 1's and 2's. It's a 5/10 from me."
45,"How can you go about making an entire movie called ""Jiu Jitsu"" without actually knowing what jiu jitsu is..."
46,Try storylines of which are not stereotypical and perpetuating divisive racial motives! Where is your honour in real life! I can only imagine the type of individual that enjoys this lacking....
47,"Oh Nick Nick Nick, bruh, how low can you go?
I can almost forgive the crappy CG, wooden acting and long pauses between spoken lines almost had me pulling my hairs out. Yikes! this is really really bad, even for Nick's recent movies. LOL. Where is Cher when you need her. Nick (HAND SLAP), snap out of it Nick!"
48,"I really understand they're tryin to make kind of martial art as a maincourse, but heading a bunch of special forces with barehand, in a daylight, unless you're bullletprof, just dont get my logic. even i cant stand watching more than the first 10 minutes. poor script, wasting a lot of good stars"
49,"From fake fighting scenes to visible padding of stunt men to fake uniforms to nonsense let's use fists instead of guns to bad camerawork.
The script is 1/10. If they adjusted the script to make it more realistic, it would've propelled the movie to a better review and a better script just needed some common sense in some areas, like the beginning of the movie as an example. (no spoiler) translator scene didn't make any sense. A US army base of all white men with no translators yet when it came to fighting, they were all Asian men... Where's common sense? Why was it so hard to adjust the story just a tiny bit?!
Then the horrible shaky camerawork in most fighting scenes. You know, my 4 year old camera can do much better. Ever heard of steadycam? Nobody like a shaky camera during intense scenes, gee, after a minute, you just want to vomit of all the motion sickness. 1/10 for directing!!I had low exceptions and just wanted some Mortal combat fights and little story, but the movie just failed it. Even the fighting was so fake, I was literally laughing during a number of scenes. If you like WWE WWF fake wrestling fighting, you may like this movie.It almost looks like a few people got together, put some money in and decided to make a movie to see where it bring them, All money went to set and stunts and little to everything else. The editing of the movie is actually not bad. Bad CGI would've been ok if the script was at least somewhat decent."
50,"This movie is Predator soaked in dusky clouds of marijuana, gagging on mouthfuls of hash brownies gumming up the dialogue, floating face-down in the light-leak swimming pool of a cesspool plot."
51,"This film start with a man ""Jake"" running away from the comets shooting at him, he fell into the water, and hitting his head at a rock scene! As turnout, this film is about Jake need to defeat the alien warrior ""Brax"", who appear every six years, to save his world and his comrade! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the treatment scene, overuse of the slow motion somersault scene, overuse if the spinning scene, overuse of the changing POV scene, and overuse of the heat detector view scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, shaky, and messy! Make the film dizzy to watch! At the end, Jake put a grenade inside Brax body and kick him into the portal to kill him! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
52,"This movie is just bad really really bad.
What ever happened to Tony jaa? Goes from 'ong bak' and 'warrior king' to america and goes completely down hill.
Has some good actors that I actually like naming Frank grillo as one, but wow this is just laughable bad."
53,"Was ready and excited to watch a film with Nic Cage and Tony Jaa,
Unfortunately after 25 minutes I realised it was low budget and wasn't 'grabbing' whatsoever.
I sat through til the end and I wouldn't advise anyone watching this."
54,"Yup, CRAP!
A cheap, stupid clone of Predator, with a ""Jiu jitsu"" twist.
What can i say more.
Watch it only if you belive that an unarmed man cat beat the crap out of 10-15 men ARMED with firearms."
55,"I was out after 20 minutes, when I saw guy outrunning automatic rifle bullets, and fake punches so bad that it's the first time in a movie that I have seen them that bad."
56,"Since the days of Predator, they are coming with any genre for fight against aliens. Nic Cage has caged himself with so many budget flicks (must be desperate for $) to make himself c rate actors. plot and actions are so boring.....hard to keep it interested in finishing it. Where is that 6 pack I ordered?"
57,"This was bad, oh it was bad.Initially I must admit that given the fact that Tony Jaa was in the movie, then I had hoped for a semi-adequate action movie at least, even with the likes of Nicolas Cage on the cast list. But ""Jiu Jitsu"" was not a good movie, not even a half-decent action and martial arts movie. Not in the least.The storyline was just a blatant rip off of the ""Predator"" story, except it was lacking the Yautja (predator) creature, and it was also lacking a proper storyline. In fact, ""Jiu Jitsu"" was fully and completely devoid of anything even resembling a storyline. It was just people running around fighting, dodging bullets and shooting at one another. And get this, because it gets better. The martial arts and action sequences were so poorly choreographed and executed that it made the early 1980s ninja movies look good.""Jiu Jitsu"" is a blemish on Tony Jaa's otherwise fairly good track record of proper action and martial arts movies. But it was, as expected, just another mass-produced run-of-the-mill movie for Nicolas Cage.The special effects in ""Jiu Jitsu"" were, actually, not all that bad, though having special effects of that kind hardly mattered in the movie, because of the horrible action sequences and the total lack of storyline. The movie was just a sinking pile.My rating of ""Jiu Jitsu"" lands on a more than generous three out of ten stars. This movie is one that you shouldn't really bother with, don't waste your time, money and effort on this one. Some of us did, so you don't have to."
58,"I am generous with a 5 for some good action, Frank Grillo n Nic Cage.
But utterly disappointed to see Grillo get less screen footage n the missing Cage Rage.The lead actor's facial expression is terrible. They shud have taken Scott Adkins.
Ther was no need for Tony Jaa's character n he is jus added n his character goes on n off but survives while other characters perish.
The action gets tedious aft a while cos its the same stuff again n again.
The film is devoid of tension n the end is a piece of cake.
The acting is terrible, the dialogues r atrocious, ther ain't enuff brutal deaths but the good aspect is most of the film is shot in good lightings."
59,The acting was just brutal to watch. Everyone was super stiff and the storyline went nowhere. It tried to be a Predators/Fighting Action movie/RomCom all in one. Pick your lane! If they really wanted to be Predator Lite and failed miserably. The red flags were there when I saw Nicholas Cage was in it. You know there are just red flags that you know a film will be bad. Nick Cage if one of those flags!!! What of waste of martial arts talent in Tony Jaa.
60,"Which is a crying shame since since Jiu Jitsu was a uniquely modified form of judo that Japan popularized after WW2, and it would have been nice to finally give it a movie all its own. Speaking of missing things, ditto for the plot, the acting, the audience interest and the entertainment value. Nice to see that Tony Jaa is still working, though."
61,"No story ,full of fight scenes, poor acting .I expected much from this movie and i was disappointed"
62,"Dire acting.
Worse CGI effects
Stupid story (forgivable if everything else was fun)
Too much slow-motion.
Shaky cameraThis film is an embarrassment and not even Nic Cage in a less crazy ""mode"" than normal can save this. It is simply atrocious."
63,"I'll start by saying it was awful for martial arts movie fans , i felt like i was dying when i watched it , full of garbage fight scenes , terrible acting , poor directing and bad cinematography. I don't even think that pot or booze will help you go through it . This movie hurt my eyes"
64,"How did this movie suck... let me count the ways.
To infinity and beyond
It was all bad... Stunts, acting, camera angles, choreography music score. cheap ass comic book page throw ins. I gave it 15 minutes and winced the whole time. This is what fever dreams are made of. Wait.. i was wrong, fever dreams are better."
65,"For the scenes involving Cage - he simply looks bored. When bothering to act he reverts to the manic face he has used so many times before.
From the premise - aliens come to our world to fight the best fighter and if the best fighter looses we all loose -- to the lack of even basic acting capabilities of the fighters (including the lead) this is a very bad production.
It is rare in movies of this kind that the fight scenes are poor -- in this case you can see the planned ""missed"" hits and the faked reaction of those supposedly hit.
Yes money was spent on special effects - but these do not matter if the plt is weak and the acting appalling. However, I agree with other reviewers the DP and his crew did a poor job -- making the whole thing very far from believable.
For the bulk of his career Alain Moussi has been a stunt guy -- perhaps we would all have been better served if he had stayed in that role.
While Marie Avgeropoulos is more than pretty enough, she too comes from a stunt background and adds little to this poor film."
66,"Full, of clichés, poor timing, horrible dialog, mediocre fighting and a paper thin storyline. I'm embarrassed for Nicolas Cage sake."
67,"I do avoid nic cage movies but after seeing a couple of decent reviews for some of his latest goings decided to give this a go as it was a action martial arts with Tony jaa. Oh boy, definitely new low for cage and really unwatchable, terrible acting, but for me the camera work was the last straw after the second fight scene, just unwatchable."
68,"Awful movie, tried to watch this as it was a martial arts action movie with Tony Jaa. Normally avoid nic cage movies but I read a few of his recent films got okay reviews so tried this one and definitely a new low for him. Couldn't last 15 minutes."
69,"The trailer looked good but don't be fooled by that, this movie is a lame predator look alike rip off and they keep talking about having jiu jitsu but don't explain what it is and and make it out to just be martial arts but even people that dont have jiu jitsu have martial arts. They couldn't decied how to film the movie they kept filming in first person then going back to the camera sitting still and the having the camera fallow the action it was just jarring. The choreographer seemed like they never seen any martial arts movie before cause the fights seemed like they were between preschoolers and the fight between the alien and the humans could of ended in the first 30 mins of the movie cause they noticed it took some time for the alien to heal after taking a life ending wound but they just stood there and let the alien heal instead of cutting his head off, they also said the alien wanted to have a honorable fight but since he could heal from any wound even when the fighter defeated him in a fair fight he would just heal and use a cheap move to kill the human and win the fight that way."
70,"....it's picking the right projects he lacks education in. Sometimes he sides on the Eric Roberts, Val Kilmer, Michael Madsen side. Then he becomes the real Nic Cage once in a while in films like Mandy and Color Out Of Space. He's a conundrum. This movie is not. All I can say is it's a cash grab. All that does is make you look worse. Do another Lovecraftian film or something mainstream (ugh!)
I suggest you skip this one. It's worse than bad."
71,Agreed with the last reviewer. Total waste of time. Not expected from a movie that had Nick Cage in it.
72,Its just 1st Predator movie scripted little longer on a chinese version. Predator vs Kungfu fighters. Even The same predator scanning methods are used
73,"No, really. Who was drunk when this idea came up?Cage and some Jason Bourne wannabe (watch the 1st 5 minutes) battle some Predator knockoff...Filled with typical Cage-esque moments. Even a slight Face-Off reference.All in all it reminded me of 10thbgrade Drama class. But with better martial arts."
74,Wow this film rips off or pay too much homage to Predator but with hand to hand combat. Nicholas cage gives his usual neurotic Nicholas Cage's performance. He is watchable as ever. The fight scenes (pov) are the highlight of this film but the plotline is stolen and cannot rate this higher than what I gave it. Ps I do agree with the reviewer that wrote this is best watched under the influence of alcohol.
