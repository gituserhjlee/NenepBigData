0,"The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out. Get ready for a slow descent into disturbing madness. This is one for the ages."
1,"Okay Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan and harry Melling acted great in this movie. The story was unlike anything I'd ever seen personally, it was messy but also satisfying. I was interested in what was going to happen throughout the movie and it just kept going. The ending won't work for everyone but it worked for me. I give this movie an 8/10 for acting and how they told the story in a new way."
2,"Wow. I thought I was in for something else. I didn't think this movie would be in such a high level on artistic grounds. Great story and the director shot with a correct pace which would not bore us. The casting was excellent and all did great. The music is other impressive thing in this movie. I'm happy that Netflix is delivering some content driven good movies nowadays. Overall, I recommend this movie because it's crazy and worth your time."
3,"From the start, you realize it will be a long movie, with already being more than two hours long. It's a slow-burn movie, with a great story, great acting from actors that we love for their roles in other movies. Here we see they can be more, they took the risk and made something great and worth watching. Netflix as usual gives as every month a new movie to talk about, but this one we will remember for a while."
4,"I will make this very quick. This movie is a breath of fresh air for Netflix originals. This acting is superb, everyone brings their A game. The story is dark, but trust me it's not as dark as people say. If you have ever seen ""The Road"", that is very dark. This is just kinda f'd up. The story is complex but easy to follow, and it just get's you invested. Also a very good script with some lines that I will remember for awhile. The cinematography is very good too. Honestly, nothing really bothered me or stood out as bad. A very good experience, and I would recommend."
5,"If you want to loose trust in humanity, watch it. It has plenty of bad persons that like to do things I've never ever thought about. Religion is a thing that can drive you crazy. I love the grain and unsettling feeling I get from this movie. But I'm happy that I've great people around me after watching this."
6,"Some of the best acting I've seen in 2020. It's not for everyone, but I highly recommend it."
7,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix has been able to deliver films with all-star casts pretty regularly. Whether people like the movie or not, that's a whole other subject, but as a convincing argument to make people want to watch a film, this type of casting is perfect. Almost every actor in The Devil All The Time is a fan-favorite due to their presence in cinematic universes, iconic sagas, or Oscar-winning flicks, so it's no surprise if this aspect alone gets audiences to sit in their couches for a movie with an almost two-hour-and-a-half runtime. This is my first time watching an Antonio Campos' film, and my expectations were moderately high, having in mind the synopsis and the genre itself.I didn't know what the movie was really about since the synopsis doesn't really shine a light on what the main narrative truly addresses. I only watch the first official trailer *after* I watch the film (so I know what I can write in my reviews), and to be honest, it's a bit misleading when it comes to the time certain actors are actually on-screen (Holland only shows up after forty-five minutes, for example). So, for the first hour-and-a-half, I found myself struggling to understand where the story was going. There are more than a handful of relevant characters and storylines, being this my main issue with the flick, but I'll get there.I'll start with the cast and their characters. The former group is impeccable, as expected. Tom Holland is undoubtedly the biggest surprise by delivering a part of him that no one had seen so far. Arvin's personality is shaped based on his traumatic, tragic, violent childhood. Transitioning from the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to such a haunted character is not an easy task, but Holland finds a way of dealing with the emotionally overwhelming, dark path that Arvin walks. However, this is a long movie where every character has an important role to play, even those who barely impact the story until the last few minutes.Bill Skarsgård plays Holland's father, seamlessly incorporating a man whose blind faith in religion sets not only a horrible chain of events, but it also establishes the overall theme for the film. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke play a weird couple with a disturbing modus operandi, but the former is genuinely impressive. She's becoming quite an interesting actress by picking unique roles in unconventional movies. Everyone else is great, Robert Pattinson, Eliza Scanlen, Sebastian Stan, you name it, but Holland, Skarsgård, and Keough are my absolute standouts, as well as their characters. They're definitely most developed across the runtime than the others, which takes me to one of my negatives.With so many characters, the balance between the numerous storylines fails to be consistent enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire runtime. Antonio and Paulo Campos offer every character a good chunk of time, giving the viewer opportunity to understand the motivations behind said characters and connect with their story. Excellent storytelling method, no doubt about it. However, by the end of the film, some characters have close to zero impact on the narrative in retrospect. Contrasting with my standouts, a few characters feel one-dimensional, used merely either as a plot device to make the story go forward or as an object for gratuitous, gory, bloody killing.That last aspect might be a no-go for tons of viewers. There are dozens of sequences where a character is brutally shot or beat close to death, so you have my warning. It can go from entertaining to excessively gruesome in a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, the thing I love the most about The Devil All The Time will be the exact same many viewers will definitely hate: its take on religion. Similarly to Darren Aronofsky's mother!, this is a movie that doesn't shy away from depicting how blind faith in hardcore religiousness can be dark, somber, sinful, and take people through the most terrible of paths. It's the overall theme that connects every storyline.Throughout the film, almost every character's decision is made based on their religious beliefs in some shape or form. If they believe praying is the solution to cancer, they'll pray for days in a row and make sacrifices. If they believe God is giving them supernatural powers, they'll do everything to test his will. If they believe God is telling them to make the most illogical decisions, perform inhuman actions, and sin in the most awful way possible, they'll do it in the blink of an eye. This religious manipulation is depicted in such a realistic manner that it transforms The Devil All The Time into a pretty tricky viewing. For me, it felt so authentic that I can easily connect it to the state of the real world.From the moment I realized this underlying theme, the second half of the movie became much more interesting. Character arcs start to intertwine, previous questions being to receive their respective answers, and everything falls into place in the last thirty to forty-five minutes. However, the runtime still feels way too long and even though Antonio and Paulo Campos do a remarkable job by coherently joining the several storylines, some of these simply don't add anything to the narrative or to the protagonist's arc. Technically impressive across the board, standouts being Lol Crawley's lingering cinematography and the sweet score from Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.The Devil All The Time is destined to be incredibly divisive. Antonio Campos and Paulo Campos conjured up a somber, dark, extremely violent screenplay, packed with numerous storylines and an underlying theme that's going to cause some controversy. With such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to have outstanding performances. The entire cast is impeccable, but Tom Holland (the absolute standout), Riley Keough, and Bill Skarsgård deserve the shoutout due to their genuinely impressive displays. However, the high number of characters and their respective arcs unnecessarily overextend the runtime. Too much time is given to characters who, in retrospect, barely have an impact in the narrative or in the protagonist. Some are used as mere plot devices or kill targets for the sake of entertainment. Nevertheless, the narrative's focus on religion is bold and audacious, showing how blind faith can negatively influence people's lives, taking them and others through the most painful paths. Depending on each person's view on religion, on how open the mind can be and the sensibility to bloody violence, I leave my warning that this film might not be for everyone. But, if it is for you, it will be hard to forget.Rating: B+"
8,"When i first saw Tom Holland he was a great addition to spiderman. But my god he had much more to give and this film just shows it. We know bill skarsgard is an amazing acting anyway but also robert pattinson gives a brilliant performance.
Back to Tom Holland. He is incredible in this. I never thought he'd go beyond marvel and into 18+ films. He suits it so much more and that lad is TALENTED! His performance is impeccable.
This is one of the greatest films of the year."
9,"I never read the book ""The Devil All the Time"" so I didn't know what to expect but I really enjoyed this movie. Tom Holland & Robert Pattinson lead an All-Star cast that are all at the top of their game here. Pattinson is amazing as usual. He's quickly become one of the better actors around and Holland? Wow, this is such a dramatic role that shows how good of an actor he really is."
10,"The place beyond the pines + No country for old men.
Good job netflix"
11,"Good movie, great cast. I really don't know how two English boys can do a great southern accent, both so good."
12,"António Campos should be really proud of this one. Usually I don't care for a narrator during this movie but when is Pollock telling the story everything gets better. Pollock gives an excellent narrative full of opinions and insults for each character. The story is well written, even with the cross between storylines witch is always difficult to do. The cast is superb! Everyone one is so memorable. My surprise was Herry Melling! He was great in every scene speacialy the one with the spiders"
13,"The acting in this movie is exemplary and should be used more often. The lack of a true main character for the story to revolve around quickly becomes to its advantage. It's a very slow burn movie (and by no means for all people) and revolving between characters every so often helps the story not become stale. Kind of like Magnolia. I'm about to go into spoilers so I suggest you stop reading if you're considering watching this movie. The movie beautifully shows how religious beliefs can corrupt the mind and make people delusional or be used for corrupt purposes like convincing young girls to have sex. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie is used to set up our characters and rightfully so. We are going to spend the next hour and a half with them after all let's give them backstory. Those 30 minutes are tastefully used to show us the backstory instead of having some throwaway line about how Arvin's Dad committed suicide and killed the dog. The Bible Belt accents of characters were done very well and not distracting. One of the only issues I have with this movie is that the narrator continually pops in. At one point it takes me out of the movie completely when he says Robert Pattinson's character only became a preacher because he enjoys the power over people. That took me out of the movie a bit. But the narrator was used appropriately when he says that she stopped asking him to come to her mother's grave. All in all kind of a love-hate relationship just wished they would have shown some of the things he says instead of just telling us them. I understand not wanting to tack on extra scenes to an already long movie but 30 seconds to show he enjoys the attention people give him when speaking shouldn't have been that big an issue. This movie also has one of the best lines in a film I've seen from this year (albeit the selection is limited) when sheriff Bodack is in the squad car talking to young Arvin and says ""some people were meant to be buried""."" Almost gave me chills. The ending of the movie was well set up as I mentioned before it's a very slow burn but the climax was well set up by it. It's one of the most tense scenes I've seen in a while. Overall I'm gonna give this one a 9/10 not quite an instant classic but it will not be forgotten soon."
14,"So there's this new film on Netflix where Spider-Man, Batman and the Winter Soldier make up only a few of the oddball characters in the bleak and unforgiving crime thriller, The Devil All the Time, from Antonio Campos. Now, I'm going to stop right there and tell you that is a ridiculous way to approach this film yet it seems some just aren't ready to relate the actors in this film to anything other than the superhero films they've either already graced or about to. The three respective actors are only a small part of an ensemble cast that may just be the most imipressive of the year.Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) is a young man devoted to protecting the ones he loves in a postwar backwoods town in Ohio but when a number of sinister characters converge around him, he faces a true test against corruption and brutality.Our lives can be shaped by a number of varying aspects at such a young age, whether it be through how we are raised by our parents or what we see in the outside world. Amidst the backdrop of a small backwoods town in postwar America, The Devil All the Time is set when both family and religion had a major imprint on people, Arvin Russell in particular being exposed to a childhood of violence carried out by his father on others.Antonio Campos' film is quite an experience, taking time to settle into its surroundings and many characters but it warrants being a bit of a slow burner with a neatly woven narrative that doesn't shy away from violence, catching me off guard a few times throughout. It's an important part of the narrative though as Arvin struggles with finding a path in life that doesn't lead down the same route his father's took.Campos has quite a cast at his disposal and he really does get the best out of the film's major players, Tom Holland giving one his finest performances to date in the lead role that showcases a real sense of vulnerability amidst the responsibility to protect those he loves. Robert Pattinson is the scene stealer of the film as a rather unholy preacher that once again proves how electrifying a performer he really is. It's a film made up of many characters that we don't particularly spend a lot of time with but it's testament to Campos as director that he can get such good performances from his cast no matter how minor their role.The Devil All the Time is a meandering crime thriler that will hold you in a vice-like grip for large parts of its runtime before releasing with quiet but unflinching moments of brutality. It's most definitely one of the best films of the year."
15,"Mean, cruel, and unflinching, Devil All the Time is indeed a highly depressing movie. It's also one I couldn't look away from. It's full of misery, loss, and irredeemable characters placed against a southern gothic background. Tom Holland's portrayal of a good man whose actions send him on a cascade of increasingly worsening situations is at the heart of this well-made flick. Good pick for an evening's entertainment if you're a Netflix subscriber."
16,"Tom Holland, the ultimate star and protagonist of the movie, appears only after the first 45 minutes. This 140-minute movie should have been a mini-series (someone may still make one, for all I know). As well, the brilliant support Robert Pattison appears only after Holland does. But then, the 45 minutes of ""prelude"" is comprised of no less than 3 separate stories, each good enough to become a separate movie. They are, of course, inter-connected in one way or another.Story One. Vietnam veteran Willard (Bill Skarsgard) comes home with PTSD. While his pious mother wants him to marry Helen (Mia Wasikowska), he falls for Charlotte (Haley Bennett) at first sight. Their son Alvin (Tom Holland, and Michael Banks Repeta at age 9) losses both parents before puberty. After Willard's desperate prayers and sacrifice (killing Alvin's favourite family dog) fails to save Charlotte from cancer, he commits suicide.Helen is the link to Story Two, which sees her married to mentally disturbed preacher Roy (Harry Melling), with whom she has a daughter Lanore (Eliza Scanlen). In a crazy moment, he takes Helen into the woods, stabs her to death, then asks The Lord to resurrect her. Like Will he dies too but not by suicide. The way he meets his death links to the third story. Lanore, just like Roy, becomes an orphan, losing both parents at the same time.Story Three, a minor subplot in itself, is about a pair of criminals Carl (Jason Clarke) and Sandy (Riley Keough) whose business is in conning victims into compromising photos with Sandy, scantily attired or not at all. Roy is one of the victims. Another character in this arc is Lee (Sebastian Stan), Sandy's brother, a corrupt cop.Remember: at this point, you have only seen 45 minutes of this 140-minute movie. Already, there are three stories each can legitimately claim a movie of its own. Arguably, what I have disclosed hitherto should not be labelled ""spoilers"".The main story, as you surmise by now, is between Alvin and Lenora. There is a third, a preacher called Preston (Robert Pattison), who is charismatic like Roy but mentally sound, if devious.Let me back up a little, and keep this as spoiler free as possible. After the opening 45 minutes, there is another brief prelude, set in 1957, just after the two children have separately become orphans. Alvin is taken into the wings of his uncle where he meets Lenora, a ""step sister"" adopted by his uncle. While there is no blood relationship between the two, romance is not on the cards. However, Alvin loves Lenora fiercely, as a sister. In this brief prelude, we see how Alvin braves a bunch of bullies twice his size in protecting Lenora.Finally, we move to the main movie, in 1965, with a proliferation of period pop music throughout as background. Our two protagonists are now teenagers. The early part of the ""main movie"" runs parallel with development of the dark side in Alvin's character and Preston's cunning lustful scheme with Lenora as prey. I'll stop here before treading into spoiler territory. Suffices to say that usual elements of lust, pregnancy, violence, vengeance, confrontation, and body counts come in abundance, with poetic justice to boot.This movie is a gutsy revelation of festering corruption (in more ways than one) under the serene pastoral surface of the Heartlands. Both the subject matter and the graphic visuals may be too much for some. Those who can stomach it will be rewarded with the enjoyment of some fine acting.As mentioned, the cast is star-studded. With no gender discrimination, but reference only to this movie, the heavy-lifting is mainly by the men, and hence a heavy-weight male cast. Skarsgard, Melling, Holland and Pattison (in order of appearance) all shine while Clarke, in a comparatively less demanding roll, is still an impressive presence. One final observation, only of interest of Avengers fans: this is a reunion of Spiderman (Holland) and Winter Soldier (Stan)."
17,Get ready for a depressing movie with superb acting.
18,"It's great to see a film written, without both eyes on the bottom line. An excellent script, well paced by an ensemble cast who all deliver their A game. Like any great film, each viewer may take a different message. I leave it to you to decide what it is but any film that makes you think after the credits roll has done its job. It's sad to think, that perhaps the only other outfit to be given funding for such a project are the Cohen brothers. We need more films like this, we deserve more films like this."
19,"His performance as peter parker was very different from this. I haven't read the book yet but as I'm watching and analysing the film, it seems like he portrayed his character so well. Best movie I've seen on Netflix so far. Big clap for tom for his acting! 👏🏻"
20,"When watching movies I don't normally feel too compelled to write a review but for this movie I will. The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock is a haunting, twisted story with many complex characters which is what makes the book so interesting because you don't know what they'll do next. Sadly, in the movie, directed by Antonio Campos, the plot is jumbled and the characters' subtext is thrown out almost all together. While I suppose this is to make the movie more mysterious and slow burn, it doesn't work for me. On the other hand the acting was phenomenal! Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, and Bill Skarsgård took the cake for me. They're performances were hands down the best part of this movie. I could barely take my eyes off the screen during their scenes. Overall, the movie's plot was poorly put together and script could use some work (I do like that they used some dialogue from the book) but the acting was phenomenal and the cast did a great job with what they had."
21,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix presents a new film directed by Antonio Campos based on the gothic crime novel also called The Devil All the Time. What's cool is that the movie is narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book! Knockemstiff is a town featured in the movie that you'd swear was a made-up name, but it""s a real place where Pollack grew up. The movie is produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, which makes sense because the characters sort of feel like characters Jake has played in some of his former movies. Speaking of the cast, that's why you want to watch this movie. It's like attending an acting class. That being said, it's a bleak and gruesome movie that features the ugliness of twisted people. This is NOT a family-friendly film, nor one you want to watch with your grandma.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

The lives we touchTHINGS I LIKED:
Robert Pattison has been cranking out a lot of exceptional performances lately. Recently, he starred in Tenet and last year The Lighthouse. He uses an interesting voice for his character in this film, something he loves to do. He has stated before that he feels like a fake if he sounds like his regular voice. In fact, he wouldn't let anyone hear the voice he was going to use until the first day of filming.
The Amazing Spider-Man fans will love seeing Tom Holland in this. You'll be impressed by how Peter Parker disappears and a new character emerges, as Tom Holland uses his physicality to completely change his persona. Be patient...he doesn't actually show up in the movie until 46 minutes in.
Marvel fans will also enjoy seeing Sebastian Stan, although you might not recognize him. The MCU represents well in this movie.
Strong production values
All of the female actresses were great and did a lot with the small roles they were given. Kudos to Haley Bennett, Mia Wasikowska, Eliza Scanlen, and Kristin Griffith.
The scenes were shot on 35 mm film, which is rare for a Netflix movie.
Jason Clarke was good, but we've seen him be this kind of character before.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
When people today see religion portrayed like this in movies, it's no wonder they want nothing to do with Christianity.
Like horror movies, the characters are clueless and don't see what should be obvious.
Most of the characters are all the same age so there's not a wide range.
With a title like The Devil All the Time, you can bet that there are some extremely dark moments you'll wish you didn't see.
Time is supposed to pass, but the characters don't really age.
The story jumps forward and backward in time, which could make it difficult for some viewers to follow.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom channel!"
22,"First things first, The Devil All the Time undoubtedly has the cast of the year. Tom Holland proves himself as a legitimate actor worthy of awards recognition and Robert Pattison makes the most of his limited screentime to create a truly chilling antagonist. The supporting players also shine with Riley Keough, Sebastian Stan, and Eliza Scanlen also delivering great performances.However, outside of the performances there is very little to say about Devil All the Time that is positive. Antonio Campos's script bites off more than it can chew, with themes of religious fanaticism, generational trauma, and the nature of violence popping up on multiple occasions. But the film has so many topics it wants to explore that none of them end up being fleshed out in any satisfying way, leaving the audience with a bunch of half-baked ideas and a sense of emptiness,Perhaps this would have worked better as a miniseries with a slow burn or as a shorter film with less characters and subplots. But in its final form The Devil All the Time is a watchable but forgettable experience that won't leave anyone hungry for more."
23,"This movie made me forgot it is a movie. I was watching a real life story. Told as real as life can be. I am a movie critic and I got nothing bad to say at all.Best movie in 2020, hands down."
24,"I've loved this actor since I first saw It (2017) and he has not disappointed since.If you're going to watch this film for anything, watch it for the acting. I read the book and it's a great story, but my goodness the acting is phenomenal."
25,"The Devil All the Time is one of the most underrated films of 2020 for me. A lot of people like it, but most of the scores I've been seeing aren't as high as mine.It's not a perfect film, and my main issue is the fact that it lacked narrative focus at some points throughout, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.The acting across the board was phenomenal, but this might be the best I have ever seen Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson. They weren't in the film until the second act, but I was mesmerised by both of their performances from the second they entered the picture.The script was fantastic, the narrative was engaging, apart from a few moments where it lacked focus, and the cinematography was outstanding. The musical score was subtly eerie, the editing was sharp, and the sound mixing was powerful.From a filmmaking perspective, The Devil All the Time was brilliant. It might be in my top ten Netflix original films if I sat down and thought about it.It's just a shame about the lack of focus at some points, because that did drag it down a little. Other than that, The Devil All the Time was engaging, compelling, tense, well-written, brilliantly acted, and a truly powerful film. It gets a high recommendation from me.SCORE: 92%"
26,"Every performance in the film is flawless in my opinion. the characters are all very well written and the story is too. if this movie does not get any Oscar nominations I will be pissed. easily one of the best movies of 2020, not that I have seen many."
27,"This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill Skarsgård) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don't call any of the characters ""dude.""It nicely develops many characters to give you a feel for the town folks. Most was done by narration, which I normally find annoying and poor substitute for a good scene. That was not the case here. It flowed.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity, mostly in B&W photos."
28,"The acting from everyone in this film was incredible, however, didn't get exciting until about 40 minutes remaining. You could almost start the movie an hour in and still fully understand what is happening.
I enjoyed that all the characters eventually crossed paths. The first hour was slow and some parts unnecessary but the storyline has potential and could have been so much more."
29,"We've all met people who don't konw how to tell a story; no matter how good the story is , they'll make it a boring mess .Unfortunately, the creators of this film are that kind of people .The story was a good one , not very original, but with a lot of material that could easily have been exploited .The screenplay and directing however, that was incompetent, uninspired , and wasted all the opportunities on offer .
The scenes and storylines were unbalanced, poorly executed, unfinished, stuck together without any sense of choreography .The cast was good , some actors very good, they just didn't have anything to work with .
Characters were never developed, showed up now and then would be gone .Finally the camera work and editing were just lazy, the visual experience bland ."
30,"What a drag! I just wasted 2 hours and 18 minutes of my life...This movie was boring. The pacing was way off. The first 45 minutes was way too slow. And then there scenes towards the end that felt rushed because of the lack of build up. The narration was unnecessary. I don't need a voiceover tellling me what I just saw happened a few seconds ago in a scene. The aesthetic also felt too glossy and sanitized. I didn't care about any of the characters. A big problem here is that none of the side characters get much of a spotlight and thus have no development. It's hard to care about them. The acting was solid, but nothing too memorable. I know people are hyping up Tom Holland's performance, but I thought he was okay at best. He's too soft faced and clean cut to play such a intimidating violent character. The oscar campaigning from his fans is ridiculous. There was nothing oscar worthy about his performance. The potential is there, but we might see it for his next role where he portrays a drug addict in the film Cherry. Anyway, I have no desire to watch this again. The whole movie felt pointless. Really disappointed after all the hype."
31,My god what a movie.... See with patience ....Best 2020 surprise...
32,"I jumped straight to this Netflix's thriller The Devil All The Time when it debuted, and it didn't disappoint me one bit.I was drawn by the impressive cast - Robert Pattinson, Bill Skarsgård, Tom Holland and other familiar faces - especially when those same actors clearly step out of their usual range by taking on a regional American accent.The film is staged in post-World War II America, namely between two rural towns in Ohio and West Virginia. We start by following Willard upon his return from the Pacific front, but the story stretches until the Vietnam war - it is, ultimately, a noir thriller that turns into a family-driven saga almost.Based on Donald Ray's Pollock novel by the same name, published in 2011. As for the script, it was written by brother Paulo and Antonio Campos, the latter is also the director.Having not read the novel or heard of Campos before - to be fair, he has few credits as a director in feature films, and his most notable directing work is on Netflix's series The Sinner - I went completely blind into this tale.I was very pleasantly surprised.The Devil All the Time is a thriller where the tension is always growing until the final climax, so it depends on actors to be able to transmit that emotional escalation to the viewer. The cast delivers perfectly on that.Starting with an emotional depiction of a war veteran Willard (Bill Skargsgard) in which we get to see a slow dive into despair tangled with religious belief, we then get rewarded with two memorable performances by Tom Holland (Willard's son) and Robert Pattinson (the new preacher in town).Pattinson in particular is spell-binding. He is very convincing as a Southern preacher who is as passionate in his speeches as he is flexible in interpreting God's word outside his church.
This movie might not be for everyone.This dark thriller is slow building, and you might not be able to pinpoint where the story is headed for the first hour - Tom Holland's character for example only shows up after 45 minutes for example.But the time it takes in the first half is crucial to explain the actions of characters later on. Only through this attentive look at their past experiences can you truly understand their dark, tragic actions as the plot unfolds.In that sense, the director Antonio Campos does a brilliant job of showing you the building blocks of those characters' character (no pun intended) and progressively speeding up the action and the tension in the story.With The Devil All the Time, Netflix adds another excellent movie to its pile of originals. A brilliantly acted, involving noir thriller where tension is ever rising.Definitely worth watching."
33,"This movie changed my personal views on Robert Pattinson, I have never seen him in a role like this, this only proves that his acting skills is a force to be reckoned with. The movie itself is kind of bizarre and all over the place, the story can be a bit confusing to some and a little boring too, It is a movie that you watch once and move on with your life, the only thing that makes it worth watching is the acting."
34,"I'll explain the plot of this without revealing any spoilers, as I definitely think its worth a watch. Some people might look at 2 hours and 15 minutes as too lengthy or drug out, but when it is a movie like this that is done right and uses every minute of it's run time effectively to create a very compelling story, its really not.The movie jumps back a forth a little bit from different points in time for about the first half or a quarter and follows 2 main characters. The first one being a troubled man who just came back from war, and then a little later it focuses on his son. A lot of intense and tragic things occur throughout the film, and it always leaves you filled with anticipation to see how the next part will play out.The movie touches very heavily on the ways that religion can really corrupt people's minds, too. It gives prime examples of how some of these people who claim to be these big holy rollers and preachers and what have you use their reputable status and/or twist their own beliefs to preform very malicious acts and use God as an excuse to do such things to help them sleep at night. That is one thing I really took from this movie and appreciated.Its got quite a star studded cast too. Its one of the 2 or 3 movies I've seen so far with Bill Skarsgård besides the recent IT movies, in which he played Pennywise (and did a freaking phenomenal job!). Very impressive performance from him in this film as well, along side Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson who both delivered very strong performances as well. Definitely give it a watch if you like gritty thrillers!"
35,"All performances were amazing, Tom Holland especially. While this film is slow and careful with each minute it consumes, it pulls you in all the way until the end."
36,Pattinson plays a sleazy preacher to perfection. Certainly an Oscar winning performance
37,"The philosophy of absurdism was well wrotten by the director, especially the actions of the characters in every way. the cinematography so brilliant, score was good, But for me the thing that made this movie great is the acting, Tom Holland show us whatt he can do in the drama, robert pathinsson.. this man is legend if it wasn't for COVID-19 maybe he could win supporting actor oscar.. generally the cast was perfect. netflix done it this time."
38,The acting in this movie is great! It's kinda a depressing movie but it was good.
39,"The Devil All the Time is to be appreciated in every comma, angle and expression; a film that walks its own path without any effort among the greatest films ever told in this genre. The picture makes us delve into human stories, understanding their problems, fears, emotions, tending towards salvation and destruction, or vice versa. Antonio Campos immediately shows himself with great taste in the shots, in treating the various scenes as ""to be inserted in a frame"", telling us a story as if we were reading a book, with tact and crudeness; everything enhanced with the narration by the writer of the book himself Donald Ray Pollock (which gives guaranteed goosebumps). Tom Holland excels from every point of view, proving to be a dedicated and talented actor, flanked by a Pattison always on a clean, methodical and intriguing, delivering a strong performance, both pushed also by a Sebastian Stan who for the umpteenth time proves to be a actor not to be underestimated, who can give so much in films of this caliber. In conclusion, this is a film that offers unique emotions, a shot towards an apex of power and at the same time of sadness, collecting in the viewer every single piece of his emotions, putting them back in their place, in the form of an opera."
40,"Pretty dark and hard to watch with all kinds of f-up characters and overly religious people.. but it is really a good movie, with good main character (great actor btw) and somewhat satisfying ending."
41,"Each subplots intricate and intertwined. Very mature story, screenplay and directorial execution. Campos was very close to Tarantino in story-telling. Story flow was like many streams falling like a cascade in a big river flowing smoothly across the terrain. Every actors gave their best, but Tom Holland proved he can act and deliver complex dialogues in a needed accent maturely outside an MCU. Robert Pattinson has come a long way since his Twilight days. 2 stars less just for cinematography and editing."
42,"The Devil All The Time is a dark southern gothic thriller set in the ominous backwoods of post-Second World War America. The novel's author Donald Ray Pollock, here serves as an incessant narrator for a bleak and depressing tale of religion, murder and retribution.For those who haven't read the novel, the ensemble cast is the real draw here: everybody from Bill Skarsgard and Robert Pattinson, even in their limited roles, are truly superb. But their characters merely orbit around the standout star that is Spider Man's Tom Holland, who plays Arvin Russell with a surprising level of maturity and emotional subtlety that's deserving of a few acting nominations.The Devil All The Time, with its pressure cooker pacing, jumbled narrative and array of despicably complex characters, is not for an easy watch. Brutal and disturbing, the film is both satisfying and punishing in equal measure."
43,"An ever moving story is complimented by a perfect cast who really make this brilliant. Well written, captivating and memorable movie for the right reasons."
44,"Everything was done to perfection - craft, acting, camera, pacing. It just slowly draws you in. And as it goes on, you can see characters eventually cross path. The first half shows a world full of evil, and in the second half, as the boy sets everything right. What an astounding watch. Very unique and powerful film.
This one deserves an Oscar nod, if it can survive the political sphere of Hollywood."
45,"A great shoutout to Robert Pattinson, whose ACCENT in this movie is supremely the best part of the film....and Tom Holland kills everybody in each of his movie with his superb acting and charms...and a great acting by every cast in this movie!!
A thing which kept me away from giving this movie a 10 is its story which has some loopholes and the score, which was not as empowering as it has to be in such dark, gritty movie!"
46,The devil all the time is an American psychological thriller. The film was very slow and boring at first but it does getter better if you can persevere for 2 hours of watching a movie. The acting from Tom Holland and Robert Patterson was outstanding and was very believable. I would say there was not much suspense but I started to enjoy it more as it got better. A bit of a weird film and it depends on what you like. The devil all the time has mixed reviews so watch it for yourself and see if you like it. Not the best film I have seen but I did enjoy it eventually
47,"I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this movie but wow did it deliver. Good performance from Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Sebastian Stan."
48,"You won't regret watching this movie. It has a great cast that made it phenomenal. The filming was done in Alabama and fans of ""Big Fish"" will recognize the small church as it is the same church used in Big Fish. I loved the entire movie!"
49,"Netflix has been fantastic over the past few months. Successfully filling our days with entertaining movies and shows when a lot of us had not much else to do. This did not dissapointed.
Fantastic cast, great acting and a good story. Well done!!"
50,"It's one of those movies not everyone would appreciate but i really loved it. the cinematography, the grim colour palette, and the performance of every actor is captivating. Robert Pattinson needs to be known by such movies like the lighthouse and this one apart from the twilight series. all of the characters were well written. some might complain about the pacing but I really liked how they built up everything. no loose ends. every arc and every subplot linked and well knit which delivers a perfect cinema. i really hope to see more of Antonio Campos' direction. and Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland and Bill Skarsgard's charismatic performances."
51,"This cast is stacked, so I came in with high expectations. This movie has amazing acting, a great story with great side plots and lots of intriguing turning points. However it was held back from a 9/10 or even 10/10 with its kinda pointless ending and a slow pace. This could have been trimmed by 15-20 minutes and been just as good or better."
52,"Man this was such a great movie to watch! Gotta admit it's quite depressing and there's little space for joy in this movie, but I didn't really care to be honest. The movie is stuffed with great actors and this makes the movie a very enjoyable ride. Even though some of the movie might feel like a crime-tv-serie, there are more than enough great scenes to make up for it and get rid of that same feeling. The Devil All The Time has been judged for the boring storyline or the depressing vibe, but just look for the details during a second watch and i'm sure you'll see what makes this movie great (acting, ost, even just pause a few of the 'heavy scenes' and really take them in before moving on).It's a movie which has a lot to tell, and even wants to scream it from the top of its lungs. A movie which functions as a critical note on religion and the action that rise from it. A movie which holds a mirror in front of you.In short; it's heavy but its great"
53,"The acting is fantastic, there probably will be more than one oscar here but the writing is the best of all. Far superior to anything I've seen in years and you know this cause the narrator is not just filling up the silence but taking you places."
54,"Very strong drama. Taught, well written and superbly acted. I'm very impressed with Tom Holland's restrained performance and Sarsgaard was exceptional, as always. The thing with Patterson is I can't tell if I liked his performance or not. He made my skin crawl so I guess he succeeded. The story was unique and original, which is refreshing in the world of reheated stories. Definitely worth a watch."
55,"The acting is at minimum a 11/10...
Change my mind..."
56,"One of the best movies have seen in a while, everything just works the story telling, acting, visual aspects and the soundtrack are done very well."
57,"The Devil all the time is a good movie overall, but this is clearly Tom Holland's best performance, he was just incredible And about Bill Skarsgård , Robert Pattinson and Sebastian Stan they were always incredible."
58,Definitely Netflix's one of the best this year. Great performance by Tom Holland & Robert Pattinson. It's brilliant how the different characters in the story gets connected to eachother at some point. Narration is wonderful. Worth a watch.
59,"The acting makes it a film worth watching. It is dark gnarly and twisted. The reason for the low score is because I did not enjoy watching the movie. It is misery upon misery and if that is your thing, you are going to love it. However it was not for me"
60,"The title says it all. This movie is not for everyone. If you are not in a good state of mind, don't watch it. It will make you feel worse."
61,"After a string of misses so far this year when it comes to original features, Netflix finally gets one right with the no doubt depressing but captivatingly put together adaptation of Donald Ray Pollock's atmospheric dramatic thriller The Devil All the Time.Set in the post war backwoods of America in the 50's and then into the Vietnam centric 60's, Devil takes us on a dark and depraved yet humanistic journey into the lives of inmingled characters whose various afflictions and trials in life converge in this harsh reality that is often seeped into the deeply religious mindsets of this era and place.Directed by Antonio Campos who helped bring well-liked TV show The Sinner to life (a story that shares similar DNA to this crime filled yarn), Devil is drenched in intrigue and ominous vibes in what is a multi-generational tale that features some of the best talent working today, including an against type and hugely impressive Tom Holland as unfortunate soul Arvin Russell, an orphan who intends to protect those close to him and ensure justice is upheld for any wrong that may be done to them.Initially Devil establishes us into the lives of Bill Skarsgard World War 2 vet and Haley Bennett's young couple, raising a home and family in a dead-end part of the country but after tragedy strikes in some extremely confronting and disturbing ways early on, the focus then shifts to Russell and his life with his grandmother and step-sister, that is directed by the guidance they find from new local minister Preston Teagardin, played by a menacing and detestable Robert Pattinson.There's also Jason Clarke and Riley Keough's unnerving couple, Mia Wasikowska and Harry Melling's god-fearing husband and wife and Sebastian Stan's local lawmaker Lee Bodecker for the film to deal with and arguably this is where Compos's film at times struggles to maintain its focus but Holland remains from the moment he enters the frame the most integral and well-rounded feature of the film that is moving and emotionally charged even when its taking its viewers and characters into some unapologetically dark terrain.So well known for clear-cut figures and everyone's favorite web-slinger, its great to see Holland play such a multi-layered character like Arvin and his presence is a guiding light to such a depressing tale that will find its fair share of viewers that may not be able to take its full assortment of misery and misfortune but Compo's and his cast have created a unique and unforgettable tale layered in trials and tribulations, and one of Netflix's best offerings of the year.Final Say -Tough going but filled with memorable performances and an unforgettable post war setting, The Devil All the Time isn't pure entertainment but it is essential viewing for those willing to endure its confronting subject matter and character development.4 picnics out of 5"
62,"Amazing acting. Never-ending atmosphere of despair mixed in with only few happy moments leaves you expecting the worst throughout the movie. The story and artistic choice were gritty and dark, great scenario progression manages to keep you watching regardless of the movie length.Blind devotion to religion, fear of losing loved ones and acts of pure evil are themes of this movie which may not be suitable for a sensitive audience.The ending was satisfying and felt like a fair culmination of all the twisted events that were leading up to it. Hats off to Harry Melling (also known as Dudley from Harry Potter franchise) for an incredible accent work and performance. A good thriller, me likey."
63,"Very good, very dark. I didn't like when the dog died."
64,"My earlier review which got more than 100 likes got deleted without containing any abusive or spoiler stuff.
Anyways i am happy that i managed to mess around certain fella's minds. Good to kno that certain irate fellas r monitoring my reviews n i am able to waste their time n energy.I will keep it short since I am writing it again.
The film has some big star cast n the locations/settings r good but the screenplay is abysmal.
It has some repulsive n blasphemous stuff.
They shud have shown or kept some balance. Not everyone is bad or crazy."
65,Its really hard to pull of cast this big in a movie like this. I was skeptical at first thinking that this might not do justice to all the name on the credits and talents like Robert Patinson and Bill Skasgard might remain unutilized but I was wrong. Every character was perfectly casted and they all brought their A game. Tom Holland was a surprise. He proved he is not just some friendly neighborhood teenage superhero.
66,"That this has a 7.3 rating is nuts, this is one very long boring movie. I have not read the novel it is based on, but there is nothing here Hollywood hasn't done before when it comes to the south. Actors from all over the world are cast in this, throw on bad mumbling southern accents, they use period music and cars and yet all it feels like is a bad imitation of life. The author of the novel narrates throughout the movie and in my opinion if you need narration you have a problem moving your story along. If they tried to film the entire novel, I have no idea but it felt like it had 54 main characters and was 6 hours long. Tom Holland was fairly good but the performances were all over the place with Robert Pattinson turning in an awful over the top acting job. Having all these name actors is not enough. Worst of all, the film is filled with the same ugly stereotypes of the south that Hollywood loves to churn out. It's insulting. Movies like this are the main reason I love Indie cinema. The only reason I can see this rating so high are fans of the many actors in this rushing to praise someone's mediocre to outright awful performance. 15 minutes into this I felt I was watching a stinker and if you feel the same way, believe me, it doesn't get any better."
67,"I liked this for a multitude of reasons - reasons which I am sure others have expressed far better than I ever could, so here's my additional nugget: I love the narration (spoken by the actual author of the source novel) and the reason I love it is that the narrator will sometimes provide an obituary prior to a character's death, which both explains and makes pitifully irrelevant their actions, motivations, whole existence. And although it's funny, and although I'm atheist, I find this very, very dark."
68,"This film has great acting, a premise that is similer but done differently. The way it made me feel for the characters is more then I can so for tons of other sub par films. It is a slow burn, but a very good film indeed. Trials and tribulations of a young boy growing into adulthood with an added storyline here and there. Very well done."
69,"OK so let me start out by saying this movie is not for everyone. People who are religious will not like this movie, if you have faith in mankind this movie will make you take a hit on that as well.The title says it all; The Devil All The Time. This Movie Follows a chain of events where people with faith are getting take advantage off by perverted individuals or people that have been driven crazy by religion. The story's main protagonist is Arvin, The only son from Willard (an ex-WW2 soldier) and Charlotte (an Waitress). When Arvin is 9 his mother is dying from an illnes, and Even though Arvin's father is obsessed with praying it doesn't save his mother. But Arvin's father (Willard) also teaches him to choose the right time to get back at somebody and take faith in your own hands. And that is what this movie is teaching us. There is no god protecting us and the people who believe so are being taken advantage off by the devil. This movie is well crafted well written and with outstanding performances from the entire crew a must watch and Netflix did it again."
70,"The movie is fine, how they connect all the stories at the end it is really good, but just that i excepted much more from this cast."
71,"At first I didn't know where the story was going and it was kinda dragging a little bit but the acting was so pure I knew there had to be more to it. The accents from Bill Skarsgard, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland was pulled off very well which I've never seen these actors do in a role; it really has done them justice rather than playing characters that haven't got much depth to them. Overall I thought it was worth the watch and gave it a 8/10"
72,"Ill give credit where credit is due... good acting. Well done. Good writing. Otherwise a yawner
If they could have condensed this movie to 90 minutes it might have been alright. Its not about a short attention span... its about keeping my attention. And at that it failed."
73,"Okay this will probably be a complicated watch due to the length here. We begin with a narration, and the location is set: Knockemstiff, Ohio.+1 Star for a great line....'He smelled worse than a truckstop s#itt#r.'+1 Star when Churchboy Magoo murders unsuspecting woman, did not see that coming at all.....The Boy, he grows up. He protects his 'sister'.There are such strong performances in this movie. Jason Clarke is awesome. So is Tom Holland. Even Pattinson was good here.+1 Star for when Carl and Sandy pick up Arvin. And when Sheriff Lee finds them....And Arvin goes home. And Sheriff Lee, goes after him....And Arvin, he gets the win. Good for Him. And he's got the film. To put with the Sheriff.+1 Star for the end.... this is one of the best movies I've seen in a good while....9/10"
74,"A powerful movie! Great storyline, great acting!Every key actor steals the show when its their time to shine. The acting is superb and deserves attention.The plot is very deep, strong and emotional. This also may drive away unaware folks, since the movie might feel like it is dragging a bit. And it kinda does. You need to be up for a long ride if watching this and, if you like heavy dramas, this is one you will enjoy.The score is good, but nothing over the top. I think it could be something else, but probably it is shadowed by the acting and the power this movie has."
75,Gotta say good screen play by the actors specially tom holland and james because cant watch a movie that long if it isn't that good enough. Quick twists all the way till the end of the movie. And there is bit of a dryness in the movie because lack of some amount of thriller but all in all good movie i didnt waste my time watching this movie.
76,"South America during the 50-60's, is there really anything more disturbing but at the same time very interesting? From the beginning I had a dark cloud in my heart, but I don't mean that's a bad thing, I love movies that move me and take me to their place. The actors in this was AMAZING, and as a proud Swedish woman I'm super impressed by Bill Skarsgård. I just feel that they rushed it a bit, this movie would do better as a mini serie. My rating is 8 just because of that rush, otherwise a clear 10."
77,"""The Devil All the Time"" is one film that as you watch you must pay attention to closely for the way it goes back and fourth with flashbacks. In fact to get more out of it and better understanding it may require at least another viewing. Set after the postwar the film intersects and travels thru the 1960's with it's focus of time events taking place in rural southern Ohio, and the rural backwoods sticks of West Virginia. Along the way the film involves sinister and crazy characters it's like their fates have all been cursed! The mood and tone is a mix of drama, suspense, and real life horror. The themes of sex, violence, faith and betrayal are well on display as the film is a menu of death, religion, corruption, serial killers that all intersect with morals and free will. It's compelling to see how time and these two towns connect the characters. The performances are all pro with Bill Skarsgard, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, and Robert Pattinson. Call it a Southern horror soap opera still the movie is compelling, complex, and interesting that has you the viewer thinking. I guess if one wants more insight and understanding read the 2011 novel from Donald Ray Pollock."
78,Really awesome and I just surprised for the story and also good acts of Tom Holland.
79,"I am rating this humor not because I liked it that much, but because it deserves it. It's so beautifully made. The actors were great. The shots were beautiful. The story? Twisted and original. The slow pace (which fit the movie) and the lack of humor made me not enjoy the movie too much, but I was impressed! It deserves to be watched. Netflix had me watch some stinkers in the past (Six Underground, Love Guaranteed, etc.), which made me almost doubt the future of cinema. So thank you for also producing quality entetertainment."
80,The short of it: This is a story that's been told many times with a twist of connecting multiple storylines in an unexpected way. What sets this apart is the dynamite performances. Everyone acting in this film is absolutely superb. It's one of Netflix's best original movies for that reason.
81,"Although it suffers from a pacing and structural mess, the performances of all the actors carries you through to an explosive and powerful enough ending. If you can make it to the end you will be satisfied, IF you can make it to the end."
82,"This movie seems to have racked up a lot of middling to bad reviews from critics, which makes you wonder how they became critics. This is a great movie, with brilliant performances and a beautiful script. I love the narration provided by the book's author, whose voice is perfect (reminiscent of Sam Elliott). Top-notch Southern Gothic."
83,A movie that can't be pigeonholed in to one genre. Well acted with a twisty plot. One of the better movies to come around. Easily surpasses 90% of the efforts made today. Well worth viewing.
84,I get the feeling this is going to be appreciated more in years to come. Has a certain tone you associate with Shawshank or Forest Gump.
85,"I can't trust anyone after watching this masterpiece.
The narration was like a ""magnet"" pulling me in, to pay attention.
Acting 8 🌟
Direction 🌟
Sound track 🌟"
86,"There are no words for this movie other than WOW!!!!
One of the greatest movies that I've seen in a while. Absolutely amazing."
87,A very powerful and suspenseful psychological movie that will keep you glued to it from start to finish!
88,"It's a slow and dense film throughout the beginning but at the end everything starts making sense! And also, the last act was incredible."
89,"... you will love this one!
Besides the suspense, there is great acting and some interesting themes. But be warned, this movie will make you feel uncomfortable! Even more than some horror movies.
I highly recommend it! Read as little as posible about this movie and just go watch it. The less you know, the better!"
90,"....this adaption is about as close as it could get! The movie is definitely dark- but the performances are so good it is worth the darkness!!! I have never understood the appeal of Pattinson, but I sure do now!!! He is great and very convincing as a sleazy preacher. Religion is definitely used in the story telling, but the book is titled The DEVIL ALL the TIME!!! This is definitely a period drama about a slice of life, not a comedy or a thriller."
91,"The Devil all the time is a very bleak movie, filled with some of the worst characters I've seen all year. Characters who do some of the most unforgiveable things but at the same time wants you to care. This isn't something new, Movies like No Country For Old Men are able to portray a world filled with selfish characters only out for themselves with seemingly no chance of change or happy escape. Despite that the film is able to stay interesting thanks to the engaging story and well written characters, unfortunately the same cannot be said for The Devil All the Time, which I found to be a Jumbled mess of a movie with poorly developed characters with no one to root for and an overly long run time.One aspect to this movie that appealed to me was the cast, with the likes of Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Haley Bennett and bill skarsgård to name a few. Unfortunately, there talents here are wasted on some of the most unlikeable characters of the year. Characters being unlikable doesn't necessarily have to be a negative, it's been proven throughout the history of cinema that audiences find evil to be just as engaging (if not more so) than good. We relate more to characters with flaws and if the script can do a good job of establishing these characters then your audience will be on board. But here Evil is portrayed with such little nuance that it can feel overwhelming. As I said above, this movie is extremely bleak and that is due to just how nasty the characters are to one another with very little levity. Take Robert Pattinson's Preston Teagardin as a example, There are some small nuggets of character development sprinkled throughout to give the character some sense of personality, However for most of the film he is presented with such a lack of charisma and is awful to literally every characters he speaks to that it's really hard to see him as a real person and really it just comes off as comical in the end. At no point are we ever given any reason to understand this character and I am sure that's what the filmmakers were going for, I mean the movie is called The Devil all the time After all, but a little more development for some of these characters would have gone along way, just something else to latch onto to give reason to act the way they do so it feels less comical . Maybe not though, Im not exaggerating when I say every character in this movie is despicable, lots of violence, deceiving, murdering, and with no one to really root for this all ends up just becoming exhausting and kind of pointless.At times the devil all the time can feel structureless, with some of the storylines not feeling all that impactful on the overarching plot, Haley Bennett storyline for example felt as if it was from a different movie entirely. The third act does try to stitch everything together with all the different plot threads but it just feels so forced and weak. The final moments especially just felt rushed and lazy. Also a small nit-pick but the film features flashbacks to scenes that have already happened in the film, something that does nothing more than distract me and question why the filmmakers think I have forgotten something that happened 20 minutes ago, its more of an annoyance for me with movies in general and whilst not a major issue, it's certainly something that bothered me here and was done more than once.On a more positive note the movie is very well shot, it does a really good job of capturing the atmosphere of its surrounding, and despite my complaints with the characters the actors did do as good a job as they could. The Score was ok, and despite feeling very familiar at times it did get the job done and even improved some scenes. It is not necessarily a terrible movie, there are aspects to appreciate and its admirable when Netflix try something a little darker. But its not something I'll be revisiting anytime soon and will probably forget by the end of the week."
92,This movie was a breath of fresh air compared to most of the movies being pumped out.
93,"Interesting story, presented well. Fate, destiny, choices? The ""web"" life weaves."
94,"As somebody who hates these kinds of movies, suprisingly this is such a amzing movie. This movies has the best actors and the plot is amazing."
95,To the last- This movie is not one of those preachy movies here we get to decide right from wrong the good from the bad WOW
96,"Well acted movie, but story is so dark and depressing it's hard to watch. Has more in common with a Rob Zombie movie like Devils Rejects than a modern drama. Strikes me as a movie that the young actors signed on to in hopes of broadening their reach for future roles and projects. Just don't understand why this movie needed to be made or how anybody could enjoy watching it."
97,"This is a movie that demands your attention, it has around 5 different sub plots which all join together by the end of the film. With the narration by the author, Donald Ray Pollock, it comes across as a live action book reading which is an interesting concept and I really like it. I fully understand that the narration is not for everyone but I enjoyed it and it is one of the best Netflix films I've seen.The acting choices were solid and it's obvious that all of the actors gave it their all! Tom Holland was excellent as Arvin and it's clear to see that he is trying to be more of a serious actor. Sebastian Stan was a great addition as a corrupt police officer (Lee) trying to do whatever is possible to keep up his pristine appearances and will give it all up to get revenge for his baby sisters death. Lee's baby sister (Sandy, played by Riley Keough) does well to show the marriage trap that she is in with her psychotic husband (Carl, played by Jason Clarke) and you can tell that is breaking with the character arc from the start of the film to the end. Robert Pattinson puts in a solid performance and it's great to see him in a film so so much better than the Twilight Trilogy. He has made a real redemption in my eyes and is becoming a very credible and reliable actor.Effectively all of the acting choices are great, all the actors put a shift in and the direction is great and works well with the narration. There are points which could of been narrated but the actors facial expressions are always on point and you fully understand the situations that they are in.The movie, like the book, shows many different interpretations of what religion is. It doesn't matter what means in the eyes of people who follow it, no matter the religion, people do extreme and dangerous things to try and please their ""God"". Especially in a time where there was lot of small, isolated towns in America where the population of those towns did not have a greater vision of outside that town and tried to find meaning in things greater than themselves such as ""God""."
98,"This movie has everything I like in a movie. A good story, good acting, unsettling vibes.
It talks me about inconsistent morality, hypocrisy, corruption, and other negative things that are very common but we hide in ourselves"
99,Tom Holland's best performance to date! It's like he's been acting for 20+ years! So good
100,You got to see this one! Its a great movie and one that will stay with you. Highly recommend
101,I'm depressed for all characters in this movie. This world is cruel as same as all adult tells us whe we were young. Tom might not represent for kids hero once he performed this film. Poor Jack and I'd like to know why he left his Luger with Jack.
102,Casting was awesome and the movie is yeah a bit disturbing so i would not recommend it to people that have a weak heart otherwise a very great movie.
103,"Reminded e of Bad Times at the El Royale. Full of mystery, twist and turns. In fact, it could even serve as a prequel to Bad Times."
104,Enjoyed this tale of characters who ranged from the angelic to the target darker types . The voice over was not at all bothersome and did not detract from the story . The final act wraps up the whole package but but with the sugary sweet Hallmark channel way .
105,It was a good movie that had great characters. There just happens to be a trend in movies in the last few years where we are watching events instead of following a linear story.
106,English actors do great southern accents. Points out the futility and hypocracy of religion.
107,"Great acting, great story. very sad story. the devil seduces us but we can fight in Jesus."
108,"Well, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgard, and Robert Pattinson in one movie, it was great to watch. I think the title well represented the movie, because sometimes human make religion as their based of action, but it was act of the devil all the time. Worth to watch."
109,"Amazing performance for all the actors
it shows that all of people can be terrible
every body could be dangerous"
110,"The script was great with high-quality actors but you need to know that the plot is tough to digest and some scenes are very sensitive. Although, for such a climax, in the end, it's worth it."
111,"Agree with a separate review that it isn't for everyone but sure was it a good movie. Very well acted, narrated and shot. I love the different time lines coming together and the story line was amazing. Religion has always creeped me out and same with the people and this is why! Very well done, they need more like this."
112,"Just finished watching this movie with some friends. Overall, it's a nice one. Cannot begin to think of how many moments had me holding my breath and gasping after an intense scene. It was gripping and well acted all around - even when Robert Pattinson is trying his best to hit this accent and instead fell short. You hate him so much from the very beginning it doesn't even matter.The Devil All The Time is an emotional tidal wave of a movie, and everybody we watched it with agreed it was powerfully shot and basically insane. That alone makes the movie tolerable.All that being said, it's a shame watching a movie and not being able to fully enjoy it because the filmmakers personal opinions / bias encroach on the film so much that it gets corny. Some of the most intense scenes are gut wrenching, but at the same time feel like they trying way too hard to manipulate the viewer into believing something other than just the movie - forcing opinions on the viewers and making it really obvious and pushy. Hate when directors do that, it's so obnoxious.The Devil All The Time is also heavily existential but also extremely predictable. There were those painfully overplayed themes in modern hollywood cinema where all humanity is displayed in our most banal and most ignorant representation, Christians are all anachronistic simpletons or predatory cult members, and the only pure or morally justifiable character worthy of redemption is the most traumatized victim imaginable. Who hasn't see this type of ""dark"" film like 1000 times already, right?If I were an A-list Hollywood celeb who felt most people in the world are inherently despicable and guilty for existing, religious thought is the downfall of humanity, and everyone with guns deserves to die unless we bury them with our crosses and get on the bus, then this would be one of the best films I've seen all year.8/10 regardless, so it was worth the watch."
113,"Coming to you from the psychological thriller section of Netflix, The Devil All The Time aims to answer a question that audiences have had for years - Can Tom Holland play an adult male? This film throws the actors, in a very dark and depraved story-line, to show the audience that they have range. And before you dismiss it, I'd recommend giving it a chance. It should come as no surprise that this film is not for everyone; be aware of what to expect before you watch it.The story interconnects characters over two decades, around a few small towns in Ohio (think Fargo meets The Departed). The film also explores really lewd and corrupt themes, centered around cultist depictions of religion and a patriarchal abuse of power. The time jumps can initially be hard to follow, but I found that it didn't affect the overall viewing.Tom Holland portrays Arvin Russell, as he goes through a traumatic life as a child,and a hopeless one as an adult. He is surrounded by an ensemble cast,
all playing against type, which could leave you either intrigued, or cringed. There is a very sinful and vile aura that surrounds everyone in this film; there are no happy endings here.Regarding the acting, I'm still not sure if I can buy Tom Holland, who plays a 16 year old superhero, take up roles as a small towner, who smokes and swears. Robert Pattinson also goes into the extremes in his role as a sexually deviant preacher; with his accent and personality, there were times I thought he was lip-syncing, because the voice didn't seem to come out of him. The supporting cast is quite good as well, especially with Bill Skarsgard, Sebastian Stan and Eliza Scanlen.Even though I watched it after a heavy lunch and fully expected to doze off, it kept me in the loop. I don't really have anything negative to say about this film. The writing is consistent, the actors sunk into the roles, and the cinematography suits the tone. The only flaw, is that film is not meant for everyone, but I'd argue that its by design. Its quite long (clocking at 2.5 hours), but I found this to be a good one-and-done film; It was interesting to watch, but I don't think I will ever need to watch this again."
114,"With the breadth of talent in the cast members we can certainly expect something special on screen. However this is not a guarantee what so ever.
But this movie was full of that. Credit to the director and so on for giving the casts a platform to showcase their talents. This movie has the same message as Spotlight.
Also, i love the accent if I'm not mistaken it is the Southern accent of the United States.
My favourite scene was the interaction between Pattinson and Holland in the church where Holland wants to avenge his loved one suicide on Pattinson.
The scene was outstanding. It was unorthodox and natural. Bravo"
115,"This movie kind of reminds me of a Stephen King movie in the way it portrays religion and terrible people. It is a veryyy slow-paced movie that sets up a lot of characters that take awhile to pay off, but it does pay-off in the end and shows how everything is connected. It is fairly well acted, however (Robert Pattinson just hams it up with his own bizzare accent though). If you are looking for a stephen-king ish movie but with a slightly more more upbeat ending, then give it a go."
116,"I think I may have loved it. I just don't understand the unnecessary critisism towards it. There's just so much to appreciate here. The length or the pace never bothered me. Rather I was taken into the film right from the start and that intrigue towards the story and these characters reamined throughout the film. I loved the tone and feel of the film and the lived-in quality to the film which works so well mainly because of the methodical and atmospheric approach the film took, without any rush, taking its own time to tell such a rich and expansive story spanning decades with so many characters that it becomes almost overwhelming to take it all in at once. But that's necessary not a bad thing. In fact, I loved this film partly because of that. Once you start sinking into the story and the characters, it becomes such a rewarding experience.The cast is absolutely great. Each one of the actors played their role with such honesty and sincerity that you just couldn't help but admire all of them. They are all brilliant. But the one that stood out for me was Robert Pattinson. I thought he was just sensational and a revelation. He has a small role but definitely a 'meaty' one. I loved and hated him at the same time. I also strangely felt that his performance was also a bit comedic particularly towards the end of his role. He delivered an excellently energetic performance. Tom Holland was great too. His performance was quite mature and unlike anything he's done before.The music fitted well to the film. It came in during just the right scenes and that made it's impact felt much more than it would have. I personally loved the narration in the film. It really helped to understand what was going on inside the characters' minds and also helps us get a sense of the larger picture of what's going on. I never thought it would complement a film so well but surprisingly this is a perfect example of why a narration is required. It isn't in the past tense, it's happening right then and is almost like an additional character in the film. The film is very unexpected and you'll not be able to anticipate what will come next. Things happen so quickly and so suddenly that you'll not be able to anticipate the characters intentions. I loved how the film came all together as the film came to an end, in such a neat manner. The direction and the cinematography were so carefully done and it helped a great deal in achieving the tone and the feel of the film.The themes are so complex and asks such deep and unsettling questions and I can see why many people may not like this film that much. The Devil All The Time is a southern gothic tale about faith and fate. It's dark, twisted, bleak and fascinating. It's a film that demands your full attention. It's a film that makes you think about yourself, question your beliefs and whether it's all just randomness or a divine intervention."
117,The movie is dark and won't give you a big feeling of relief at the end. BUT!!! The acting was amazing.
118,Honestly I've never written a review before but I went out on a limb and just thought hell il give it a go saw no trailers read nothing about it just watched it for what it was and the cast done an amazing job of telling the story I felt the emotion of everything heartbreaking and heartwarming there isn't a starring role in this movie because everyone no matter how big or little a role put in a star performance
119,"Unsettling, slow burn and hard to watch in some points, but very well made, good acting all around"
120,Such a great storyline. The acting was amazing. So many twists and turns throughout the movie. Kept me interested the entire time.
121,"I did not expect to much from this movie, but best I have seen from Netflix in a while. I really like how the movie was told and how it all plays out. The movie felt a bit long, but still it kept me interested enough not to be sitting on my phone watching women and burgers on IG.Nothing I ever will see again, but I think it will stay in the back of my mind for a while. Pretty good movie, def worth a watch. 7/10"
122,"The plot and effects were superb. Although the film began slowly, cracks soon emerged and the plot made unexpected twists and turns which were unanticipated. Although I had my doubts about Bill Skaarsgard's infuriating acting as the It, his acting was redeemed through a believable and palpable display of brutality and his maniacal belief in Christianity. Such can be said about his whole family, who either buried their heads deep in the sand or stood to abet the murder of multiple victims in praise of the lord or in protection of their families. God bless Skaarsgard's mother for all the torment she was put through. A bad case of PTSD must of befell Skaarsgard to have become such a brute. Hated both priests and wished the second one dead earlier. A satisfying end to the film as everything returned to how it was before. Brilliant and a must watch!"
123,"This movie is a perfect piece of a lie which resides in all of us, when it overcome upon us we just take this lightly and show other that we are normal as of other, however person shows their evil face as the times come and when the time come one matter how it should be justified."
124,"So on many sites it became an issue about is this horror or isn't it or is it a drama with a dark theme. Well, horror it isn't for me that's for sure. For me it's a dark drama worth seeing if you like weird stories and movies that ask your brain to work it all out.The score used, the way it was shot, the lighting and of course the acting is all above mediocre. I can't go into the cmparing between the book and this flick but did I like it.The characters, the acting is so well done and casted that it becomes almost a master piece. The story is dark themed and here and there you will have some gory shots. For most the crucifixation scenes are the worst ones. But hey, as I said, this is not about possession if you think that the word Devil should give you that. It's all about the Christian belt deep south in the USA, I have visited it as the era of the hillbillies so I do understand it all. If you aren't into Christianity then you will have the devil all the time.And as many said, spiderman, sorry, Tom Holland is giving the best. Enjoyed it a lot. Give it a try but be aware, it's not your usual flick.Gore 1/5
Nudity 1/5
Effects 3/5
Story 4/5
Comedy 0/5"
125,"Actings are great, especially Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsgad are my favorite ones. When i first saw the Tom Holland i was prejudice but that was a huge mistake, i get it. Movie everytime gives to you adrenaline, curious, fear and intense. Storyline maybe seen as messy, ridicilous or pointless but it's satisfying indeed but it deserves more than 7.1"
126,Just got done watching this film and i gotta say This film is a amazing Thriller and Tom Holland is amazing in this film it felt like he was out of his Spiderman element and played a dark sinister Character Robert Pattinson who played the pastor his role is not meant to be liked but he really did his role very well really loved this film all around if you are watching this to see your favorites in this movie you shouldn't because this film is very dark and there are very dark things that happen in this film but i just cant get over how well everyone performed in this film Mainly tom holland his character was amazing he played it so well but overall the film is amazing i really loved it so if your looking to watch please give it a watch because it's a Must Watch.
127,"A slow paced thriller with some wonderful acting by almost each and everyone in their specific roles. Holland as Arvin was just awesome and Pattinson is a fine actor and does complete justice to his role. Overall a very good movie, it's only draw back being very slow and takes quite some time to set things in motion."
128,"Great movie, the movie is so dark..story plot is very good!"
129,"This movie is pretty great, i dont see how this could make anyone angry its made so well"
130,"I was reluctant going into this but my friend really wanted to watch it so I figured what the hell and boy I'm glad I did. I'm not too crazy about the cast but in my opinion they all gave their best performance yet, especially Bill Skarsgård, Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson. I definitely can see some Oscar nods coming for this one. If you like gritty movies and have Netflix check it out."
131,"I won't spoil it for you but absolutely worth the watch. Didn't feel like a two hour movie and honestly I could've gone longer. The storyline, acting and vibe was the best I've seen in a while. I was not anticipating to enjoy this movie so much. I purchased the book to read next."
132,"The Devil All the Time (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Devil All the Time is a crime drama film with a talented cast ensemble that involves a dull story about religious themes. Sexual predators. And police corruption.The plot follows Willard (Bill Skarsgaard) who is a vet. Comes home and falls in love with a waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett). They have a son. Willard becoming obsessed with praying to god. And teaching his son about facing bullies and fear. While Helen (Mia Wasikowska) falls for a preacher who tries to believe that god is testing him. Years go by,Arvin (Tom Holland) and his step sister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen) who are close. She meets a shady preacher Preston (Robert Pattinson). While a corrupt officer Lee (Sebastian Stan) is trying to get reelection while trying to hide his sister Sandy (Riley Keough) and her husband Carl (Jason Clarke) behaviors. Not knowing they are picking up hitchiking guys and the husband letting them having sex with his wife.It is a slow moving dull story that feels very thin. While coming across abuse, sexual predators like priest preying on young girls. And corruption.The script narrative is also annoying that could have been done without.The cast ensemble is great though that delivered there performances. Tom Holland playing a serious role. Robert Pattinson and Jason Clarke playing very dark roles. Bill Skarsgaard doing a great job.Overall, it was a slow and dull direction crime drama. That could have been shorter. And better narrative dialogue."
133,"*Everything is just pointless in this poorly put together mess of a movie.*The only curiosity u as an audience feel is what am I watching?*The cast is one of the most diverse and interesting ever assembled in a movie. But there r so many characters & none of them feels fleshed out. I don't know how Netflix convinced some of these actors for this movie, seeing as neither do they have screen time nor do they have any material to work with, must be the money I guess.*Only Rob Pattison understands that it's just a pointless pulp movie discussed as something artsy, meaningful and just let's loose as a sweaty, creepy, smarmy preacher. He is appropriately hammy even if the southern accent never feels right.*The Place Beyond the Pines somewhat deals with similar themes, give that a watch instead.Verdict: Complete Waste of an incredible cast in a pointless, meandering mess of a movie. Avoid at all cost"
134,"Well, I watched this with a friend who had wanted to see it. If it wasn't for her, this brilliant film may have passed me by.
Every single actor was well placed in their role and exceeded all my expectations. Extremely well acted, beautifully shot with a great soundtrack. So, so glad I watched it."
135,"Great 👍 film start to finished. After I had seen it's I want to watch again. Love the ending, this is the kinda ending I love in a film."
136,No likable characters and so boring. Can't believe such great actors wasted our time.
137,"When a leftist director who has no personal experience with Appalachia sets a movie in Appalachia, what do you expect? If you answered anti-religious depiction of troubled misfits, then this movie will meet your expectations. Anti-religious sentiment is such a heavily-mined concept in film today that if you really want to be brave and edgy, you'd write a pro-religion film. And setting dark, depressing films in ""darkest Appalachia"" is also beyond stereotypical. I think it says far more about the psychology of the writer and director than it does about the inhabitants of Appalachia. Darkest Appalachia is where urban directors locate their own darkest fears. Hollywood's Appalachia only bears a superficial resemblance to actual Appalachia, because it's not an actual place to them. It's where those ""others"" live, and they populate it with their bigoted stereotypes of what they imagine those others might be like."
138,"Just finished watching and I feel having the urge to write something. Already loved this film from trailers but now loving it more than ever. No special ci-fi actions, just a gun, a camera, speeches and some outstanding acting performances are enough to compelled your eyes.
Thanks Netflix your bringing such a wonderful film to this world."
139,"If Antonio Campos had adapted The Devil All The Time into a sprawling epic fit for TV, or even a three and a half hour tour de force, the material would have been better suited for adaptation. Conversely, even if Campos had dropped some of the subplots that populate Knockemstiff's dark and tragic history, and focused in on the section that shows Arvin and Reverend Teagardin's plotline, this could have been a lightning quick story of humanity's connection faith, and just what qualifies as good and evil.It's the most troublesome sort of dichotomy, as The Devil All The Time slips through the cracks and into the lukewarm waters of mediocrity. While the film is still enjoyable to a degree, the finished product sits firmly on the fence of either requiring a good trim to tighten up on one story, or a more free range approach to let the multiple plots build themselves more freely. Either choice could have made for a better feature, and in a movie all about the choices we make, the most devilish thing about it is that it chooses to do neither, dooming it to be damned by audiences and critics alike. It hurts to talk about how ok it is when the talent and resources available could have made one hell of a time."
140,"Undoubtedly a movie with great casts involved, and great acting there, but the screenplay... Um, not quite there...For a start, there's quite a handful of narration, which I didn't like (personal preference).A dark story plot, when not handled well, ends up just being another boring & dull movie. By the 40th minute I was already thinking of switching it off. I don't know why I hung on to it, probably hoping for some last minute surprise that could bring the movie to an exciting level, or if not, at least some proper closure to all that'd happened earlier in the movie. But nope, at the end of it, it was the same, just as dull as it was at the beginning. I'm impressed with Tom Holland's performance though. The 2 stars rating was for him, otherwise I would've given it a zero."
141,"The acting is just superb. The storyline is solid. Contains violence and disturbing subjects, as I said in the title, not for everyone."
142,"3 lines for those who are looking into it
>Best Performances ( Tom holland, R.Pattinson )
>Dark Genre
>Intriguing screenplay"
143,"Wife really hated it at first half hour, we watched through and said we need a second go to get a better grasp on it.Second time it was enjoyable, we could really relate to this dark movie.Wife says its an 8 so be it, I did enjoy the dark story.Not for everyone but most adults should enjoy this."
144,This movie shows how manipulation is at its best especially when it comes to religion. Warning religious pals might get offended.
145,It's nice to see Tom Holland has a little range apart from Spider Man and I was very impressed with his performance in this. He's very likable and easy to root for. I'm a sucker for any film that shows certain Christians for the psychotic hypocrites they can be. Robert Pattinson is a long way from Twilight here as a sinful preacher who's always the first to cast stones.
146,A gripping southern gothic tale with a stellar task playing against archetype.
147,"It was hard to see how much hurt people did to each other. Once I finally accepted that it was likely everyone was going to meet a bad end it did t bother me so much anymore and I could enjoy the story better. (Not everyone comes to a bad end, so no spoilers here.).
As others have mentioned, the acting was top notch. I've seen Robert Patterson in a few movies recently and I've been surprised at his acting. I've had it in my mind, as likely many others have, that he's just a one trick pony vampire teeny bopper heartthrob. But that's not him at all. He's probably had to work extra hard to get rid of his Twillight reputation. Kudos to him. Everyone else is also stellar."
148,"I did not expect much but maybe that was the best way to approach the movie. To make it short: I enjoyed the film and do not regret the time watching it.The story is ok, the characters were ok, yep, perfect home cinema that goes well with a nice drink and a big bowl of popcorn. LOLI give it seven stars and my little recommendation."
149,"It is definitely the best performance Holland has done so far ... this film has an impeccable cast and incredible acting. However, the pace of the story is a little slow and there is something or other that was unnecessary in the film."
150,"A good story with emotion, relationship, courage and revenge. Though first half is very slow and dull, it does not pick up from beginning. You have to wait till second half for real drama and this part is worth to watch. Climax and end is expected, nothing so twisted. Acting by all actors and actresses are very good. Every character perfectly fit in their roles and I especially impressed by Tom Holland ( Arvin here, we know him for spider man), Robert Pattinson (Lusty priest) and Bill Skarsgard ( father of Arvin). Atmosphere, costumes, life styles of 1950-60 is likely seems as same"
151,"The acting in this movie was very impressive. Having the writer narrate also really paid off, you could feel the narrators connection to the characters. The Weaving together a series of separate but interconnected events is done flawlessly. A very well crafted, well acted film."
152,"There's a great deal to be said about going into a movie completely blind. All I knew beforehand about this movie was it was set in the south in the 40's, 50's and 60's, Tom Holland was in it smoking a lot of cigarettes, and it appeared to be a dark story of some kind. I didn't even look up the cast list online, so when actors like Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska started popping up, I was pleasantly surprised.The Devil All the Time is a dark, spiritual, generational southern epic tale that you just know is going to go down certain dark country roads and the characters will do some suffering. Yeah, it's not a happy tale. There's a married couple that serial kills together. There's a scene with spiders that will give you arachnophobia even if you didn't mind them before this movie. Someone eats deep-fried chicken livers, which sounds absolutely disgusting. This movie has a lot going on.Tom Holland is pretty intense as Arvin, more so than I've seen him before. Riley Keough always seems to be playing the same confused, lost white trash girl in every movie, but she is good at it. Robert Pattinson plays a smarmy southern preacher like he's Elvis just getting back from the prom and wants to get laid.The movie unfurls steadily, with some cool narration by the author himself, Donald Ray Pollock, in a storytelling manner that eases you in like you've been greased up for a spontaneous proctology examination at the last minute. I love these kinds of stories that span years and generations and then all come together at the end. I wouldn't dream of spoiling anything but just hope you'll enjoy this ride as much as I did."
153,I really enjoyed this movie the soundtrack and music were great . The acting was spot on with Robert pattinson showing us he can do anything .
154,"It's a bit weird, but it's trying to be. Skarsgard and Holland are fantastic in this and the characters are very memorable. If you are a religious person and can't take a joke, then this is not for you. Tries to be far fetched and if you are happy to go with it you'll have a great time enjoying this movie."
155,"""Some people were born just so they could be buried.""There are elements that hold the movie back from being great. But that doesn't take away from how divisive it is. It's dark, gritty, and difficult to watch at points. Though technically not horror, it feels very much like one. Some of the imagery and awful events feel right out of a drama-horror. I don't want to say that it doesn't go full out with gore/intensity, but I wanted them to go full out. A few shots of gore last less than a second where I questioned what I actually saw. Minimal gore works to an advantage in occasion, but with how fast the movie goes and with so much to cover in the story it would've been nice to slow down to take everything. Unlike a common criticism from most audiences, I would've like the runtime to be just a little bit longer. It's already 135 minutes which is long enough but I would've liked more.Like I stated before, the story has some much to cover. The three different acts follow a different story that's connected to a stacked cast. Starting right of the bat, the movie introduces many characters. Honestly, it was hard to keep up. Already I knew everything would be connected. It's not till the second act where it makes more sense. To help explain, a narrator is there for the audience. If I could change one thing about the movie it would be the narrator. Voice overs dumbing down there story for the audience irritates me. Not everything is simplified, but most of what the narrator says is a given. One of the most emotional (intense) scenes is somewhat ruined by the voice over.A few of the scenes fall flat due to narration or other aspects, but the ensemble give it their all. If the competition weren't so high for other upcoming movies, this easily could've won awards. Though some characters don't even meet it feels as if there's a strong relationship whether it's characterization or acting-wise. A few actors don't get as much screen time and I wish they could've had more. Either their acting is just that good or I wanted more development. The best performances come from the closest characters: Eliza Scanlen, Tom Holland, and Robert Pattinson. Scanlen already has had a great year with Babyteeth and is now a must watch actor. She has an emotional role and makes it believable. I'm sure you've heard of how proud Tom Holland is of this role and movie. He proves that he can do something other than action/superhero movies. His return to drama since The Impossible is impeccable. Every minute spent on screen is a minute well spent. Holland truly immerses himself and the audience into the movie. If either of those performances didn't invest you, Robert Pattinson came and have another career defining performance. Ever since Good Time, or even going back to The Rover, Pattinson full sends his role. I wouldn't be surprised if he will be considered for awards at the end of the year. All I'll say is ""DELUSIONS!""Antonio Campos directs well. With how tangled of a story if is, the end result untangles and ties itself together nicely. There are ruts along the way. The portrayal of how evil the characters are goes a little overboard with some characters, especially if they aren't developed enough. Many people will be turned off by how overboard the whole thing can get at times. But I found myself so invested that I couldn't look away. I checked my phone maybe once but the movie finished in a flash. Maybe a rewatch will reveal more flaws but for now I'll enjoy what I remember."
156,"Readers of Joe R. Lansdale's books will know what I mean by: Evil of different kinds. Justice has it's own price to pay. I actually thought for a moment that this was written by Lansdale, but discovered it was written by Donald Ray Pollock, an author that I will be adding to my reading list. It's hard to watch the darker moments of the movie, but the actors did a very good job of bringing the characters that they portrayed, to life. I would add a caveat, if you are triggered by certain things, take the content warnings seriously. It's not overly graphic, but the implications bear the weight."
157,"Great movie , netflix at its best days right now and robert Pattinson just gave his best performance"
158,"I'm a mature movie goer who can accept film violence in context. However, this piece crossed the line.Great cast, solid acting, visuals and soundtrack delivered.But this film was gratuitously violent for violence's sake. To me it was like watching torture porn, and left me feeling much the worse for viewing it.I am so very, very sorry I watched this film.I feel emotionally stained by it, and it's going to take some time to feel clean again."
159,Incredible cast. Well delivered. A bit of Americana we love deny exists.
160,The Devil All The Time checks out as a movie that starts with a slow and steady pace and goes on with it. The film follows a straight narration that shows different situations and acts at different times. Some of the acts will make you curious where others will make you feel kind of bored. The performance of the actors gave a good push to the film especially the performance of Robert Pattison and Tom Holland. The first half of the movie tries to uplift itself but didn't quite do so in the second half because of some repetitive techniques. Overall it's a film you can definitely watch and enjoy for at least once.
161,"Very dark with sprinklings of humor in Robert Pattinson's repulsive character.
I was sucked up from minute one. Great story, great direction, & wow what a great cast ! Holland and Pattinson killed it. 8/10. Loved it. Watched it twice."
162,"First good film I've seen in a long long time! Compelling, well acted, well directed and gritty. Yeah it's about bad people doing bad things but it's also about good people doing what's necessary. Quality filmmaking!"
163,It was an incredible movie!! Deserves higher ratings!!
164,"Great actors, great acting, great film directing. Really good script. Also love the way all the stories connected. All the twists."
165,"7,5/10
Positives ✅ :
The performance from both Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland was really profound and persuasiveThe gloomy , bleak tones were a power point for that movie , that enabled the implementation of the idea well enoughThe soundtrack was Appropriately gloomy, more forebodingThe different ideas presented by the film such as abusing power , Striving to overcome obstacles to noble endeavors , the terrible consequences that could occur to someone because of their previous faults , The punishment of tyrants, the state of some people being in a psychological suffering and misery that prevents them from seeing things as they areNegatives ❌ :
-The voice-over was really unnecessary 😅 the only possibne reason for this is that the novel writer required to be part of this movie to let them adapt from his novel
-Some storylines are just there to serve only one purpose
Some talents are wasted on such a small roles with brief scenesThat was an overacting from Robert Pattinson , he really needed some supervision to guide him to perform perfectly , and Improvised accent wasn't suitable at allThe course of events depended heavily on coincidenceSome storylines didn't take long to build properly, just scrambling to move to the next step."
166,"I would love to see some of the films on Netflix, that are worth the nomination, get honored by the academy. This is one of those films.
This movie is amazing. From beginning to end. Some have complained about the story line, I honestly just think those people got bored with how slow it went. But it's pace helps you understand more of what is going on in the film.
Robert Pattinson's performance is perfection. Tom Holland did a great job, his character Arvin, that poor kid couldn't catch a break.This movie is excellent. It's gripping, it keeps you guessing and glued to the TV, it's also very sad.
Very recommended. And it deserves recognition for it."
167,"This movie is quite the roller coaster. It's set in a rural post WWII town in Ohio and converges around Tom Holland's character Arvin.I like how most of the characters are more or less evil, and truly put him through the concept of fighting 'The Devil All the Time', of course a line in the movie. Arvin is one of the only innocent characters in the movie and we constantly see him being bent by the other characters and their actions. Though some of the things he does can be seen as bad, he is more or less justified in them.It's definitely worth a watch!"
168,"A totally unique film that will surprise and shock in equal measure
Some brilliant understated performances from a strong cast but Tom Holland Stella performance steals the show
At times unsettling but always interesting it keeps you mesmerised right to the end"
169,"I didn't decide on what kind of ride viewers would be on, because I had experienced so many emotions, thoughts, personal delusions, and such things I hadn't expected to experience. I, personally, had to pause the picture a good number of times to let myself absorb what I was experiencing. I'll be watching it again as soon as I can after I settle myself down. Damn good movie! It will be too much for some viewers."
170,Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson were absolutely breathtaking in this movie. Very well done
171,"Netflix's 2020 drama thriller The Devil All the Time is a near perfect novel adaptation. Drawing its plot from author and narrator Donald Ray Pollock, The Devil All the Time is a visceral presentation of life in rural America in the years following the second World War. The film stars a host of powerful actors including Bill Skarsgård, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, Jason Clarke, and Robert Pattinson in perhaps his most intense role outside of The Lighthouse (2019).The film bounces between time, place, and character, drawing a horrifying yet undeniably believable look into the effect war, religion, and poverty have on small town society. I found the film undeniably beautiful, with every shot purposely underexposed the deliver a darker tone with a deeper color pallet. Equally impressive was the manner in which the film presents itself nonlinearly while still keeping the audience from becoming confused, an ode to strong editing.The Devil All the Time is a must for anyone who has a Netflix subscription and is worth opting into their free trial for those who do not. Make sure the kids are not around and please do not watch this if you are sensitive to strong violence or sexual themes including the abuse of power by church figures."
172,"Tom Holland gives his best performance yet in this Crime/Thriller based on the book The Devil All The Time by Donald Ray Pallock. This movie is crazy dark and twisted! The supporting cast is incredible right along side Tom, especially Robert Pattinson who plays an evil pastor. If you have the time sit down and watch this movie it's great!"
173,"I'm not a fan of Netflix originals, but this one definitely sits along Roma and Marriage Story as one of my favourites.It's a tough movie with great actors who deliver. The movie does touch a lot of sensible topics so the performers really had room to flex their skills and it shoes. This is also why it might not be for everyone. But - I mean - there's so much shallow content out there, it's good to actually get something that really challenges you as a viewer.Really great cinematography as well. A lot of cool shots with great composition and a set of recurring visual motifs - hint: keep an eye for whenever someone looks directly up at the sky through the trees.I really enjoyed the structure of the story. Even though other movies use similar narrative structures - Magnolia, Cloud Atlas, Traffic - this one is particularly satisfying and cathartic. Also, while there's a narrator - the author of the source book himself, he has a great voice - there's almost no exposition. The ball's rolling from the first scenes.My only minor complaint is that some of the accents are off putting. Clearly, some actors have more of a talent for them than others.A great watch overall!"
174,I enjoyed the pace of this film. The soundtrack through the years probably helped that journey.Great Cast! Did not who the Director was for this film but definitely felt some Coen Brother Vibes on film.Alvins story through out was so sad. Def felt like breaking point near the final arc. Sure hope he enlisted our settled in CinciNot know this one was a book til after the movie. I would love to read the bookBig Marvel fan so def enjoyed Spider-Man n Buckys performance. Def felt an Easter egg when Bucky was burning the images of his sister in the bin. The background felt like the one where Capt America gets a hiding n him n Bucky 1st meetAnyways back to the Film. Don't why this film is lowly rated by critics. Probably because the adaptation of the book.The religion theme is heavy and fully real and not cringe like other movies with similar themes. These performances were so real.I look forward to this Directors next piece. Loving Robert Patterson's work since In Time. Good to Alicia Silverstone back.
175,"Well-made, not just in its technical elements but in the way it deftly ties its many characters and generation-long plot threads together in such a satisfying (and ultimately surprisingly positive, as suspicion and violence give way to trust and sleep) manner, making for a powerfully morbid epic on the dangers of religion. That said, it's done through a distanced, fairy tale-like approach that prevents it from ever reaching emotional dramatic excellence despite solid turns by the whole cast.
7.5/10"
176,"I will begin this review by saying that I think this is one of the best movies of the year and that it is one that is not for everybody because it is very dark, depressing, morbid, and the structure of it is pretty unconventional. It's for these reasons why the film has received mixed reviews. Anyway...The characters are distinct and interesting.All of the acting is phenomenal especially from Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson.Some thing that surprised me about this movie was how well-written the dialogue is. There's a line from Sebastian Stan's character that I absolutely loved. It's screwed up but honest. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you hear it.The violence in it is super effective. None of it feels cheesy, it's all incredibly brutal.The fight choreography is pretty much flawless.The movie is two hours and eighteen minutes long but it feels like it's an hour and a half!The cinematography is absolutely fantastic!Everything in it looks very accurate to the time period.There were moments where you could see some noticeably bad CGI, but when I say ""moments"" I mean they're very brief so it doesn't distract you at all.The narration does not throw the movie off track at all. It only helps it. Fun fact: The narrator of the movie is the writer of the book, and he's never done narration before.I love the hidden ""Screw you"" at the end of it. I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is. Look it up, it's awesome!Even though the film has a jumbled structure it's never hard to follow.Honestly, the movie feels kind of Coen Brothers-esc. It is by no means a rip off, it totally feels like its own thing."
177,Impeccable acting. I admittedly had reservations about the difficulties of turning this book into a film. The cast takes this movie to another level. Each actor brings something incredible with their talent. Tom Holland blew this out of the water!
178,The level of submission in acting of Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson had me chills. The story moves from past to present and visa versa is truly enjoyable.
179,Absolutely brilliant casting job! On the edge of my seat the entire time!
180,"All actors playing so realistic. Sometimes I was little nervous about heroes. Sure in reality in the world happens things more horrible. But you can find very many sensitive themes in that film.
In that time movie feels like music, with dramatic effects and little hope for all of us. Special thanks for authentic world, costume, characters and all little tasty things. Thank you!"
181,"A sketchy movie for sure, a lot of gothic elements involved. But definitely a sort of, ""breath of fresh air,"" if you will. I don't remember the last time I watched a gothic movie that contained good acting, cinematography, screenplay, and just overall filmmaking. The acting was incredible despite a somewhat different band or group of actors. Tom Holland was great, so was Pattinson, Stan, Clarke, all the female leads were great. Skarsgård surprised me because he did such a great job. I didn't really notice the cinematography until the last 45 minutes, which was the best part of the movie by the way. The way they shot each seen, slowly zooming in on each characters face to see their reactions, fear, desire, that was incredible to see. The screenplay was great because of how the movie jumped from all these different timelines and characters, obviously in the end all these characters are intertwined with one another, which added to the epic finale in those last 45 minutes. The way they wrote the screenplay to build all of that up, build all these characters up and their different backstories throughout the movie, was also very well done. I think because if these elements it makes this movie well worth the watch. Very unique, very freaky, and somehow they threw in a somewhat happy ending, which some may not like. Overall, one well worth the watch, try it out."
182,"I honestly thought this would be a b movie that I skipped after 30 mins or so. But the director and casts did so great as if you were invited to come further!! There was bit and pieces of information and you were craving for more, however, It didn't leave you there thinking who is the antagonist or the protagonist. But you'd definitely stay to see how it ends!!
The casts plays well since Holand, Skarsgard didn't grow up in the states but they speak the accent well!! They act naturally and very well!!!
The duration of the movie is 140 mins but it went fast. I didn't notice till I look at the clock which means it is not boring at all!!! The presentation of the movie and narrative storytelling were unique and great!!! Love love it"
183,"Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling excellent acting.
Beautiful connection between characters in the climax."
184,"I love The Devil All the Time in every way. The story is awesome, the photography as well as the acting.All the actors performed fantastically, especially the gorgeous Riley Keough, grand-daughter of Elvis. Riley is not just a pretty face.Young British actor Tom Holland does it flawlessly, including a great accent. His two scenes fighting for his life were top notch, couldn't be better.Holland can really act, he is not just spider-man, and he showed it.Sweedish actor Bill Skarsgård as that returning soldier who wife dies, totally breaking him, is really commendable.The film develops in west virginia post WWII, taking us deep into each character, its motivations, and makes us think if it is ok to kill an evil person. of course it is not, but the film pops that question.Hollands character went on to kill in cold blood the priest who did bad to his little sister, prompting her to end her young life. how to deal with that situation given all surrounding factors.I loved the movie. and i would recomend it to anyone, and this effort from new york director antonio campos is worthy"
185,"Red necks and trailer trash. White thugs. I didn't know could be so sexy. Entertaining, sexy, masculine, and erotic. Not predictable. I will watch again"
186,"Pros:A brilliantly acted film from virtually everyoneSpecial mention to of course Tom Holland - which I would argue is a career best performance from him to lateAlso, Robert Pattison as the preacher - fascinating performanceAntonio Campos' first proper feature film and he did a fantastic jobVery dark and gritty - which some will like, I didThe final 30 minutes was greatCons:Jack...I did think, the film started off a little slowly - therefore the film could've been slightly shorterAgain, I did think although the final third of the film was entertaining, I did think it was predictableThe dark aspects of the film will put people offOverall, I thought 'The Devil all the Time' was a brilliant film by director Antonio Campos with superb acting, especially by Tom Holland and Robert Pattison. I did enjoy the dark nature that the film brought as it was essential for the plot, although others will not be as keen. The final act was my favourite part of the film, concluded excellently which made for a really well put together filmQuote - ""Bodecker believed that people were like dogs, once they start digging, they don't wanna stop""- NarratorScore - 4/5"
187,"Okay....!!...where to begin...if you are looking for something new ,a good story,some madness and ofcourse a movie night with family and friends....this movie is a good option...Tom Holland did a fairly good job, Pattinson is as good as always....the story is strong"
188,"If you think this movie is not good, you my friend are deluuuuusional."
189,People its gonna rate me because of this comments. Of course Pulp Fiction its much better because of many reasons. But its a great movie. I like the way the narratives get together. Sfbe.
190,"This movie was very well written and directed with absolute precision. The cast was fantastic with some wonderful supporting performances by Robert Pattinson Jason Clarke, and several others There were some very very dark characters in this film and it was an extraordinary indictment of mainstream Christianity and especially a lot of the fake preachers out there who prey on unsuspecting souls. The second half of the movie was even better and the movie just built to a very surprising and powerful finish.There were some Shakespearean elements in the story and if you like vengeance films, this is a really good one."
191,"As others have said, the story is quite entertaining and nicely intertwined amongst the various subplots. The acting was great. Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsgard in particular do such an awesome job. Definitely recommend watching it."
192,"Lawd, nothing prepared me for this film! I knew anything with Bill Skargard in it will be a hit and boy was I right. Okay, this is no love story, every character is a nutcase but Tom Holland is human and loveable and the sorrow you feel for him, it's too heartbreaking. You will end up rooting for him, it's only natural. Robert Pattinson is fantastic in his part, played to creepy perfection. I truly enjoyed this rather shocking and utterly tragic masterpiece. I however cannot watch it again. But you shouldn't miss it."
193,"By me this movie deserve a lot of Oscar's...
Give it a try..."
194,"Not the roles you expect from the cast necessarily but they all excel and this extremely dark tale. Was hooked from first minute to last. Depressingly, dark and brilliant. I've been a Tom Holland doubter but I have to say he was truly fantastic in this role."
195,I rarely write a review. Only when I'm suprised about te reviews. This movie is a hit. Slow but exciting! Well done!
196,Great acting. Even a few avengers in this one. Tom Holland plays great. A very different role for him.
197,Excellent acting during the Vietnam Era time frame.
198,I loved this film. It was beautifully done in a haunting sort of way.
199,"So much deeper than usual Drama.makes you walk in all characters shoes and almost understand what they feel!Acting, editing, scenario, music...ALL film making aspects are Oscar material.reminds me of Tarantino movies minus the blood...! hesitated between 9 and 10."
200,"If you're a film buff, this is one of the best films sense ""There Will Be Blood"" and "" No Country for Old Men"". Absolutely superb! Wish there would be more passion back in film making like this."
201,"The devil all the time is a movie that was so well written and directed the acting was absolutely superb.
It was nothing like I was expecting to see it had so many twists and turns the characters were so well played by the corresponding actors.
I would recommend this movie for everyone but it is not for the faint hearted."
202,"Most depressing movie ever. If you want to die on the inside, this is the movie for you"
203,"Movie was slow at the beginning but picked up in the last hour, wish i saw more pattinson because he was great in the movie"
204,This kind of psychological thriller movie usually ends in confusion and in abrupt but iam so glad the ending didn't fulfill my fears of it. One of the reason I watched the movie because of the casts and the movie did justice to their actings. Yeah the story of most was tragic and it was really thrilling.
205,Oh My God what a long waste of precious hours. This movie is painful!!! It has no story line and what storyline there is is painfully slow! Don't waste your time watching this movie. I can't understand how it has done so well so far. It is slow and to sun the story up could be done in 30mins! Much better things to watch out there!
206,The acting was phenomenal. Thanks to Antonio Campos for this great film!
207,"Well acted, well balanced and reminded me of an early days Cohen Brothers movie.
Great!"
208,"Visually pleasing and spanning 3 decades, this film tells a story that's easy to follow though at times overreaching. I was deeply interested in the main character's journey and if he would be able to overcome adversity from an early age. The movie time-hops several times but you're never left to gather your thoughts about where the story is at the time, whereas some movies have your head spinning"
209,"Incredible acting all around. The story was addictive to watch but wow was it ever depressing. All the storylines came together perfectly, I just needed at least 1 win and it never came...."
210,Good movie. Great actors great director. They did such an amazing job tapping into their characters I lost sleep because of a couple of them
211,"Netflix is far from having excellent movies, but this is a very good one. The plot is convincent and have some good turns. The characters are unique and original and so the cast's performance is amazing."
212,"TL;DR - A slow burner that manages to keep its script tight, and delivers more than expected.It's a slow-burner - a genre that I am a fan of, and picked it up initially because of this sole reason but was soon delighted to watch how they've fused the 50s and 60s era with a somewhat modern and refreshing story that doesn't have long pauses. Sure, Tom Holland looks a bit young for his role, but this instills a greater faith in his acting spectrum than his Marvel journey.Robert Pattinson, like always, is a delight to watch as he gives his 100% to every role that he takes.I liked how the subplots were woven together by the end and it was a nice and subtle ""ah!"" moment for me.The women in this film are very beautiful as well and reminded me of Kelly MacDonald's role from No Country for Old Men."
213,"This movie left me feeling really yuck, but Tom Holland really shines as per usual"
214,"Well, this film didn't go down all that well with my Zoom watch party, so I guess it was a good thing that I wasn't the one who selected it. In fact, it was agreed that they would pretty much can it half way through, though a couple's Zoom connection went down and they continued watching it long after the rest of us had given up. Okay, I decided that I'd continue watching it afterwards, but that is because I'm one of those people that like to see movies through to the end.Like, I didn't think that it was too bad, though as others suggested it wasn't that the plot, or the theme, was all that bad, it was just that it could have been done much better. In fact, they suggested that there are much better movies that deal with violence and the backward nature of people who live in the Appalachians. Another criticism was that the female characters really didn't seem to have much depth, and were referred to as lampshades - you could replace the character with a lampshade and it wouldn't make any difference to the film.Another criticism was that the violence just seemed to be quite random, and character were killed off pretty quickly. I pointed out that this was also the case with Game of Thrones, but they argued that at least there was a point to the violence, and death, in Game of Thrones. There just didn't seem to be all that much point here. The thing is though that as the movie progresses things start to become clearer. Like, the guy that takes photos of people having sex with his wife, and then killing him - it turns out that he is a serial killer, and that he believes that the best photos are those of where somebody is dying.Mind you, the preacher was pretty weird. Like he kills his wife just to see if he has the power of resurrection. Yeah, you can probably work out what happens in that instance. On the other hand, there is this thing about the main character - like, who are they. But once again, it does come out as the film progresses. However, the tag line about a virtuous person fighting against a hotbed of violence isn't really the case with this film because all of the characters are pretty dark.I guess the main theme of this film is that violence begets violence, and this is clearly shown with the Luger. The Luger comes from the war, and as it is passed down through generations, it seems to just represent that violence can only be solved by violence. Another thing seems to suggest that this obsession with guns translates to an obsession with violence. It is almost as if people simply cannot be trusted with them. In fact, in this world it is pretty much a story of people taking the law into their own hands.However, the film did seem to be somewhat all over the place, though we were surprised that it was that popular, especially given the rating on the various sites. Okay, I liked it, but it certainly wasn't great, and I really had trouble getting into it as well. Sure, it is one of those films that tries to make you think, but in reality there are so many more films like that out there, that are done much much better than this one, that this one is probably best left alone."
215,"At first, to see this movie i was really attracted by the cast who was really rich of potential and i dont thinks thoses actors have signed for another bad netflix film. And a friend asked me why was the film called like that so i tried to understand the answer behind this.The film is separated in two parts, two générations to be more clear who we can « delemilite » by the two pastors. The first is about fear and the second is about lies and this is going to make the continuity of the film.
During the film, a narrator guides viewers to tell the story and describe the characters. The narrator disappears after the death of Robert Patinson, when the character shows this part of devil / evil in him. He can be violent throughout the film, but these actions are driven by the love he had for his family, unlike the other characters.,In the film the characters make types of mistakes, there is first of all the ""failure"" in religion or in humanity,
for example Jason Clarke fails in humanity, Tom Holland fails in religion but not in humanity
Then, two types of actions are made, the criminals and the human ones (the ""human"" action can be a criminal action but they are more empathetic and understandable) for example in the film Sebastian Stan does not want to accept the truth about his sister even though he has seen the photos of his crimes, he desperately wants revenge even though he knows that Tom Holland is right in his defense.The meeting between the character of Tom Holland and the couple was in my opinion a bad choice for the script, I found the coincidence haphazard, as if they wanted to end the film quickly. This scene is meant to be the thing that connects the characters that we've seen evolve and move during the movie and I see this scene as just an easy choice of storyline. Right after that, in the car, there is the conclusion of the couple's story in some sort of Mexican confrontation scene (a scene where all the characters are trapped in a menacing death, they all point a gun at each other. ) I liked this scene because I find it quite unexpected and surprising.I expected the film to be more concerned with the character of Tom Holland who was afraid to become like his father was in the past. Speaking of the father I found him to be the most well written character in the movie, the whole introduction at the end of the war was captivating and got me immersed in the movie instantly it was for the best part .I really don't like the music in the movie, I found it repetitive and all the songs were basically the same with the same melody.
But besides that the scene in the cars was really good, I was really convinced of the moment when the movie was about with the cars, the music on the radio etc.Note:
I gave this film a 7 because I gave three stars for the script, two for the acting, three for the immersion (costumes, atmosphere, etc.) and one for the music and a bonus. So 2 for the script, 2 for the immersion 2 for the acting and one because it was an exciting film."

217,"I was hyped after I saw the trailer and saw the cast. But the story and length of the movie made me a but sceptical. Usally a movie really has to ""catch me"" so I'm not getting bored with movies that long.The movie got it all for me! The story was well written and I loved the sets and the acting. This 2+ hrs just flew by and it was even better than I thought. I would watch that movie totally again and recommend it to everyone at the moment! One of my fave movies of 2020 so far!"
218,Whoa what a lemon.....to bring God into this mess without at least a foreseeable outcome...is something else. This movie was something I wouldn't subject my worst to.
219,"It's been a hard year, also in the movies industry.
The firm is superb. I guess it will get Oscars, including for acting.
It shows the violent life of the low class, poor and ignorant people who lived in small towns in south US, where terrible things happen to the good hearted and naïve people, and the way others take advantage of it.
Acting is wow, every actor in the cast is doing an amazing job, and all looks so real, it's like time travel to the 50s and 60s, all including the cars, outfits, hair, houses, and the characters, the way the move, the inside of the house, way of speak etc. A must see, an outstanding performance and directing."
220,"From the moment this starts until it ends I was hooked, the acting is absolutely phenomenal, the multiple story lines all connecting was genius and it pays off. This is a slow burn movie but the final act (last 45 mins) is where the film really shines. Tom Holland is incredible and gives the performance of a lifetime, Bill Skarsgård is only in the movie for the first 35/40 mins but he is also incredible, The scene stealing Robert Pattinson is on usual form, every time he was on the screen I was star struck he was that good. Jason Clarke was ruthless as one of the serial killers praying on young men and Sebastian Stan as the corrupt sheriff was amazing, there is one scene in particular that involves Sebastian Stan and 2 gangsters in a house and that blew me away. Overall this is a slow burn but very very violent film about the cycle of violence in life, please watch this movie you will not be disappointed."
221,"The acting was freaking great! The atmosphere was well suite. The storyline was great with awesome link. The cast selection is unbelievable but I gonna to said it is a right choice, it is like they are born to it.But I had a ""unknown"" deep feeling after watching this. It is a great film but I am not going to watch it the second time soon. Probably never.Netflix start looking into making a great standalone film recently. Great move from Netflix."
222,"Brilliant storyline.
Exceptional acting. Everyone is just so good!
It is overall a great movie."
223,"Packed with sinister characters with sinister intentions, Antonio Campos' adaptation of Donald Ray Pollock's 'The Devil All the Time' is a hellish ride from start to finish. The unsettlingly bleak film is confidently directed, handsomely produced, and impeccably acted by its spectacular cast that includes Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, and Bill Skarsgård."
224,A great story that was well adapted to the world of cinema. Endearing characters and others who are disturbing. The narrative is great!
225,Wow. This film is great. Definitely not everyone's taste but love the story telling. Told just like a book
226,DELUSIONS !!!! DELUSIONS !!!! DELUSIONS !!!! DELUSIONS !!!!
227,"For starters, I walked in with no knowledge of the story at all. I knew this was a film adaptation of a book, but other than that - nothing. I was looking forward to the film due to the cast line up, and they all really stepped up in their roles. Tom Holland did an amazing job as the lead and I think this is an incredible shift for him from his previous work. While this story is not for everyone, those who do watch it are in for a great story. The cutbacks from past, present, and future all flow very well with the story and I think the way it was pieced together tied things together in a way that didn't leave you confusing and satisfied in the end. The music was beautifully eery and it really drew me in even more to the story. I was absorbed almost instantly to the story and truly think that if you can stomach the film, you should give it a shot. Overall one of the better films to come from Netflix in a long time."
228,"This is amazing film! i didn't expect to be that good , amazing cast and amazing away to say everything in so short time, the pass from one generation to another was smooth and unique , i love this film!"
229,"I was hooked from beginning to end with the story, and the acting. Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Bill Skarsgård, Sebastian Stan and Harry Melling were great. This is in my opinion one of Netflix finest original films. Yes, it is that good."
230,"This is a brilliant but horrifying film. The acting and character studies are superb. If you can get past the darkness it is rewarding and a film well worth your attention.
It's one of the best films I've seen thus far this year."
231,"This is a surprisingly good film with impeccable acting from Pattinson, Holland and Skarsgard. I had low expectations because I typically do not like Pattinson's acting in films but really got into this movie. That being said, it is not a film for everyone. Loved watching the characters grow into themselves. Definitely sends you on an emotional rollercoaster but I'm glad I chose to watch this."
232,09/17/2020 This Is an excellent movie with perfect actors and a rock solid storyline that will hold the viewer right up to the end. I highly recommend it. Bon Appetit'
233,"Fantastic film one of the best films I have ever seen,the story been told along with fantastic acting,I loved every minute of it and it will truly stay in my mind as one of the best films I have ever seen the script acting everything about it"
234,"Just so you know this feeling is pretty gory. So if you're a bit squeamish this may not be the one for you. Overall the movie was a well casted, well made, and pretty riveting story, but it was depressing. I was so into the story that I never looked at my phone which is a pretty good feat. The production value is good. The camera angles were very good and varied. Overall worth the watch."
235,"Based on the great, seedy novel by Donald Ray Pollock, The Devil All the Time takes us to Knockemstiff, Ohio (one of the best place names I've heard), where the inhabitants partake in all sorts of nonchalant depravity while they wail at and about the Holy Ghost. The heart of the film is Arvin Russell, who tries to be good against all odds. This story really made me think about Trump country - how alien it looks to us and how alien the coastal elites must seem to them."
236,I voted a bit high to bring up the average. This is a brutal film in its visual depictions and themes but worth checking out. You'll probably only want to watch it once!
237,I didn't know what to expect as most Netflix original movies don't impress me - but this movie only got better with time. The acting is solid & the plot lines captivated my attention. Think Stephen King meets Tarantino. There were several instances that disturbed me but I understood the relevance. This movie was thought provoking & unforgettable.
238,"Dark and mysterious, The Devil all the time is a great movie to watch with a great plot that really make the audience focus on what's going on. Pair that with some brillian performances,particulary by Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson, and you have an excellent film to dive down to."
239,This is nothing but one grisly and senseless crime after another with no plot. Couldn't even finish the movie. Do not understand now this is rays so highly.
240,"Great acting. The story however is drawn out, bloated and extremely bland"
241,The actors in my opinion were really good. And I liked the way they wrapped up the story
242,This is a captivating story of trigger happy individuals in a grim small town. The stellar cast adds to the viewing enjoyment.
243,"This film sucked me in due to its sensationalism of a world of mentally-damaged people involved in sadistic violence and pornographic sex. I gave it a 5 score, because it was very effective at doing this. It was like gawking at a tragic, bloody road accident without the ability or even the desire to assist. I feel disappointed for allowing my imagination to be captured by such degenerate material. Although this sort of material is commercially popular, it definitely isn't healthy. I couldn't feel empathy for those, who suffered, because rather than containing their suffering, their immediate reaction was to lash out with violence at those they believed was the cause of their suffering. There were only a few tangental characters, that acted in a way, that I would describe, as normal. Maybe that was the point, to mirror the new upside-down world-view, that deranged is ""normal""."
244,"I didn't expected too much from this movie and I watched it only for the casting. Finally it was an amazing movie. The performances were breathtaking from all the actors. Tom Holland was a surprise, because this role is very different from the others. Also Robert Pattinson was amazing in his role and proves to everyone how amazing actor is. Also the directing, the cinematography and the music were excellent and made a dark atmosphere. The screenplay was slow but also stormy from the begging to the end. The movie generally is very tough, shocking and has a lot of messages about religion."
245,"What is this greatness my eyes just witnessed this is one of the best movies I've ever seen words can't describe how great this masterpiece is @tomholland2013 proud is an understatement he for real proved his the most talented person of his generation
.
Tom's performance in the devil all the time brough such emotion and is unlike anything I've ever seen before. i've never seen any young actor, ever, throw themselves so entirely into a role and disappear into it so masterfully....oscar season let's go, he's coming"
246,"I have witnessed some absolute rubbish in my time, but this takes the biscuit!
Pointless, drivel, masquerading as art..."
247,"The film is basically a highlight about how religious fervor and American values in the 50's and 60's were a façade for growing mental health illness and internal hatred. The acting is alright but the story is boring. If you like watching a most-likely inbred string of characters kill each other, this is the movie for you."
248,"Okay, so the book is absolutely incredible. Honestly, the author is so talented and you get a reprieve from all the disparity through his hilarious descriptions.Anyway, the film. I was disappointed with the massive storylines they chose to leave out, but as far as the rest, I felt it mostly did the boom justice. I will say, Robert Pattinson was severely miscast. Being that he's associated with a tween series, he did not come across as dangerous and vile as his character truly is. His performance was pretty good, but you can't be that character and also have been in Twilight. Doesn't work.Moral of the story, decent film...amazing book."
249,"At the beginning it was quite intriguing but soon enough the movie and the characters revealed themselves.
Very noir as story but the wonderful cast and acting make it a movie that you won't forget."
250,It won't be everyone's cup of tea but I enjoyed every sip of it.
251,"I admit I was attracted to this movie only because of the cast but it pulled me in like a black hole once I started watching. Masterfully acted and edited, this movie is a little world of its own and once you enter it, it's hard to leave it. So many movies on Netflix you watch and then a couple of days later you can't even remember them. This one will definitely stay with you for a long time. But a little caveat: If you are easily depressed or an empath, consider steering clear. It is a dark, evil world and it WILL affect you. I considered turning it off at a couple of points because it was hard to watch, but continued hoping there would be a ray of sunshine at the end. There isn't. I do not know who Donald Ray Pollock is but he is either a genius writer or needs to have a thorough psychological evaluation."
252,"Acting is phenomenal, story is interesting and very well executed ! Netflix been stepping up their game."
253,"It was the cast that drew me in, didn't expect much, BUT man, this was such a brilliant film!You will be at the edge of your seat throughout!"
254,"First things first: the movie is very well executed. Antonio Campos was very clever choosing the cast and writing the script. Everything is so well done and fits perfectly. The movie is very sober and tender.Second things second: what would you do?
You can't even judge Arvin because the question that will appear on your mind will be ""if I was in his place, what would I do?""
His relationship with his father surely was a big trigger for everything that he did, but you can't blame the boy, can you?
The character is so complex and rich with feelings and experiences.
I saw myself rooting for the boy all the time.
Amazing, this is a movie I could watch over and over because it's a real masterpiece."
255,"The Devil All the Time definitely won't be for everybody. It's violent and tough to stomach at times, but it's also brilliantly acted and has some of the most intense scenes I've watched in a while.The best part of this film is Tom Holland. He gives an incredible performance, and this will definitely be a turning point for his career. The rest of the cast is top notch as well. As far as the story goes, I think this is a great exploration of the trauma and hardships that can get passed down from generation to generation. It also explores the monsters and psychopaths that live right next to us who uses religion, sex, and power to take advantage of people.The only criticism I have with this film is that it could've been longer. There's so many characters and storylines to the point where its 2 hour runtime isn't enough to give this movie the impact it wanted. I know this is unimaginable to people who can't watch a movie for more than 2 hours, but I wish this film was 3 hours. If this movie was a 3 hour epic that allowed the story to breathe, it could've possibly been a masterpiece. Even though it isn't a homerun, this is still an incredible film and one of the best of the year."
256,I can see what it was trying to do. It was going for that tarentino-esque slow burn but unfortunately it missed the mark for me. Decent performances all round though.
257,Wow loved this. Truly enjoyable and always wondering what's going to happen next. Acting was on point! Didn't want it to end.
258,"I am surprised by the acting of Tom Holland. Saw the spiderman movies he done and would never thought he would be capable of that. I am more disappointed by Pattinson who was not the greatest fit for this role..Anyway it's a nice movie, well directed and with good acting. Missed it with all the stupid things Netflix usually proposed...I do recommend"
259,"No words for this besides how much it reminds me of a Coen film.
Unbelievable cast"
260,"This film is absolutely well done - there are almost too many great performances to list. Plenty of cinematic moments and compelling ideas too. But somehow it doesn't add up to a great movie. You need voiceover narration just to connect everything, and that narration has to try awfully hard to spell out the themes. There's a little too much telling and not enough showing (which is ironic considering how desperately the director wants to graphically show whatever he can). I still enjoyed the acting, but it might have worked better as a 7 episode miniseries than a 2.5 hour movie. There were lots of good parts that did not quite fit together into a whole."
261,"Religion figures prominently in this slice of American Gothic from Antonio Campos but it's the old time religion of the Old Testament rather than the New and it's the Devil who's in the driving seat in ""The Devil All the Time"". Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it's a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We've been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can't keep a good genre down. It meanders a little and jumps back and forth in time maybe more than it should and it's certainly overlong but it's well-acted, (particularly by Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland), and very nicely narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, author of the original novel."
262,"The movie proceeded very simply and meticulously and I think that was nice. The fact that they performed the action scenes on the spot increased the tension. The story wasn't bad, it could be called good. The acting were good. I think the cast was fantastic."
263,"It may not be for everyone, but I was seriously impressed. Robert Pattinson, Bill Sarsgaard and Tom Holland were all superb, in particular; I wasn't aware that Tom Holland had that kind of depth as an actor. True craftsmanship in acting and storytelling. Great movie."
264,It is a fairly well movi in Quentin Tarantino style like overuse of violence and the sequences of main characters and their connection. But its tone is so dark and a little more profanity would be better. And the backstory of the main character got too long and got a bit boring. Performances are fantastic. Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson are rediscovered with such dramatic roles.
265,"I couldn't t believe the insane cast in this movie, pure talent, everyone did an outstanding job, the first few scenes with Bill Skargard are spectacular. I can only praise the movie and the great direction, despite the intense slow pace and the topics, I was intrigue the whole time.
Ignore the haters, is clearly a movie that not everyone can appreciate."
266,"It's an awesome movie to watch.
This movie was what I would imagine a greek tragedy to be, played out in an ancient forum fraught with blood and sex and perturbed beauty.
This movie was slow, but in a satisfying direction: tons of anguish and surgical methodology. In its approach it was borderline cult: judged in the foreseen but not metabolized in the current.
The plot was nonlinear, anchored by an omnipresent narrator. Normally in these movies the narrator is persistent; however, this is amongst the unique spectacles for which a viewer may not be annoyed by an all-knowing overseer.
The plot comes together. The characters are clear in their individual directives; so the ensemble-based narrative works well.
To speak of the thematic elements is convoluted; the perspective lies within the main cross to ladder derivative: a cross is present whenever violence occurs, indicative of a hyperbolic directive laced with malice and solemnity. Evil exists within innocence and innocence exists within evil. Every time you see a cross it's as if a higher sign of evil or human error to come.
Another motif was characters looking up into the ""heavens"", whether it be treetops or clouds. Maybe drifting into a collective hovering existence binds our knowledge of mortality. Everyone was tied together in this plot, which made the end so enduringly cathartic. I was excited and fearful for the protagonist, a feeling coveted in the viewer's perspective.
The plot may have been a bit predicable, but I don't think it's bad in that it hints to the viewer that the narrator was rooting for the hero who may have turned out to be a forlorn serial killer himself."
267,"A drama based on a book.
It is not a thriller, it is not action or horror or suspense.
It is about a family history divided into two moments: the history of the parents and the child, from the moment they meet and all the circumstances that they have to go through to survive attached to faith.
Quality.
Spectacular.
The era masterfully recreated.
It is about religious fanaticism, about the abuse of the leaders of the sects, the naivete, the search for revenge and justice, the fetishisms.
Narrated, in fact the story is being told to you.
Although it is quite extensive, the film does not fall.
The sex scenes well carried out and cared for.
The murder scenes neat and well directed.
Tom Holland steals the screen.
Robert Pattinson is doing great in the movie.
Despite touching on a delicate subject such as religious fanaticism, it is masterfully addressed.
Safety pin."
268,"This movie was phenominal. The way all the actors gave meaning to their characters is unbelievable. I had high expectations of this movie but they totally complied to that, and even more. I need to give Tom Holland an extra praise. The way he performed this character is outstanding. You can read his eyes and thats what I call real talent. Im fully convinced he deserves an oscar for this amazing performance."
269,Clearly made by New Yorkers and foreigners who Don't know flyover country. Boring propaganda.
270,"Beginning like ending, All actors does great work and director"
271,"This movie has a really strong cast with some great direction and really interesting story. The movie is dark and violent and is really emotional at the same time. The performances by tom holland, robert pattinson, eliza scanlen are very strong. This movie is being under appreciated sadly since ppl are inflicting personal bias. Its a really good movie.One problem i did have w this movie is that the narration is kinda pointless and is to some extent annoying. It has the same vibe as some disney movie. The movie will be really serious and then the narrator comes in to tell u what the characters are thinking. He's basically j for expo because it seems like the writers got a little lazy. But even with that the movie is still really engaging and a good watch."
272,"All the stories related about one thing: religion. It's not for everyone, but I really recommend.Pattinson's performance was great. I don't know how he can do such a perfect accent. Tom Holland sorprised me."
273,"If you liked:
Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri

First ReformedMy longest review so far. This is the newest (2020) drama-thriller from Netflix, and it's a true gem. I don't understand people who complain that Netflix creates crappy things lately and disregard it as a film source completely, while still wasting their time to watch those crappy shows. Learn to filter. A billion-dollar company has to produce all the time, and obviously only a small percentage of that will actually be watchable. Now to the film.
First of all, it's a tough film that definitely not be for everyone. It deals with religion, violence, and death, so if you are sensitive about these topics and can't keep an open mind - you shouldn't watch it or read my reivew. The first thing that jumps into your eyes is the all-star cast. I thought that 3 famous actors (Holland, Pattinson, Skarsgard (Pennywise)) were enough, but I also knew e v e r y single supporting actor which almost never happens to me. At first it was hard for me to even understand who the leading actor was, because the performances were so good. Tom Holland finally taking a serious and morose role for once (and delivering!), and my admiration for Robert Pattinson just keeps growing, as he added another great unusual performance to his piggy bank of acting. Mark my words, this man will get an Oscar during the next 2 years, unless the Academy keeps screwing up the eligibility rules.
The word of the day here is delusions. This has actually been on my mind long time before I watched this movie: what happens if you lock yourself in a plain room for a couple of months, with nothing in the room except for food, water, and a bathroom. White walls, white bed, white everything; no books or tv, no phone, no interactions with other people. Just you and your head. Your mind becomes so bored and lonely, you start talking to yourself. You start to sometimes hear yourself answer, without actually opening your mouth. Maybe you get a football as a friend and name him Wilson. You can now have full complicated arguments with nothing but your own brain. Now what if you had a book, and that book was The Bible? You also start hearing voices, but this time you interpret it as God. And whatever now comes to your mind, no matter how absurd or horrible it could be; it becomes The Word of the Lord that you must obey.
I've always found the fact that people need ""guidance"" and interpretations to properly read the Bible kind of strange. God essentially wants everyone in heaven, so shouldn't everybody have the same opportunities to understand his book and his teachings by themselves? For an extreme example, how are you supposed to even have heard the name ""Jesus"" if you were born in 2020 in an uncontacted tribe (and those do still exist) in the middle of the Amazon rainforest?
This movie deals with extremes of religion-based delusions, some of which (like Christian all-forgiveness) are usually not even viewed as such. The main question here is: If the world around you is rotten to its core, is ""pray, love and forgive"" really the answer? If someone you love got murdered, and the murderer was left unpunished, should you still forgive, and pray that it doesn't happen to someone else? When both God and the Law are neglecting their duties, should their work stay unattended?
This film did not get universal acclaim because people do not like to think about these things. They consider it too dark an ""unchristian"", thus missing the point of the film completely. But for me this was one of the best films I've watched this year, and it would be my pick for the Best Picture Oscar."
274,5 or 6 stories in one movie and guess what? It is all amazing. great acting actually i didn't see movies like that from away time
275,"This movie was so good it would easily make it on big screens, but to have it on Netflix is is because of the pandemic. You usually don't get these kinda quality movies on Netflix off its release.The movie starts very slow and at some point I felt like its kinda boring me right now, but something keeps me watching. Well, then the story develops and the progress is amazing. Many subplots find a way to a main plot and that's the thing in this movie that makes it so exciting.It's the first movie of Tom Holland that I've seen where he's not playing Peter Parker. So I was hyped too see how he delivers. His acting was brilliant specially in the last 40 minutes of the movie. My God, didn't expect him to see him so authentic. He's the sunny boy with a golden smile we all know and then when the mood changes is or is serious in a movie like this his expressions and motions are clear and authentic. Fabulous work Tom ! He proved he can come out of the big bloster movie Spider-Man and play a different character like a top actor.Robert Pattinson... oh boy the cast is soooo awesome. AN actor who reminds me on Matthew McConaughey who played in comedians and romantic movie that I dislike and then here comes: True Detective, Dallas Buyers Club and many other fantastic roles where he played. Pattinson was criticized a lot by people for playing in Twilight, but this year was absolutely his year with Tenet & this movie right here and Batman in the bag. He's about to blow up !! Pattinson was convinced and I was shocked for how good he performed, when he played his role as the pastor with his speeches and imaginations he expressed. He was really creepy during the movie. I read some people even say he stole the whole focus and movie as a supporting actor due to his performance. I can admit someway you want to see him more and more.You miss a great movie if you pass on that one. There's not many movies in a quality like this. It's definitely one of my favorite thriller movies. It deals with faith, prayers, psychoses, delusions and evil habits of humans. I don't rate and know the director, but this movie is a gem. It deserves massive credits."
276,"A little bit slow in parts and probably could have been condensed to two hours. However the acting from Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Harry melling and Robert Pattinson was outstanding!"
277,"Im not a huge Edward Pattinson fan but I really have to say, his acting was great.Tom Holland stops being a kid here and becomes and adult and I cant see peter paker anymore.The rest of the cast its on point.The movie is weird,long and a bit of slow, but it's great, you cant keep your eyes off the screen."
278,"I won't bore you with a wordy review. This was an excellent film with a plethora of rich characters and substories. Holland and Patterson were both equally compelling. This movie was never dull and never once coasted along between scenes. Every minute of this was engrossing, if not entertaining. I highly recommend this excellent piece of cinema."
279,"Loved the movie, reminded me ""The children of Hurin"", and that Luger reminded me of the sword Gurthang."
280,"This is a very dark movie, with some uncomfortably graphic scenes. It's a testament to the screenplay, the director and the actors involved, that such a story is told, without becoming overly predictable, or gratuitous.The casting is excellent. Great to see a crop of primarily young actors who knock it out of the park. Each of the characters have a backstory, which reveals itself throughout. Just a really compelling tale."
281,"This film is just so good! The atmosphere, story, acting, it all just works so well. Gripping and thus far my film of the year."
282,This movie was dark yet strangely satisfying. The storytelling and acting was amazing. The movie starts by introducing several characters which lead to different timelines and somehow they all converge in the end. It's like a series of unfortunate events. Well done!
283,"This film is one of the best Netflix will ever have, because it's got that rare beast: perfect casting and absolute respect for the source material. I love the book so I was waiting to be disappointed by the casting or an altered plot as I often am, but this film really hits all the spots, it left me wishing they had made a two part film or done a mini series because I wanted to see even more of these characters.The film is a dark American Gothic, unrelenting in its treatment of the characters caught up in this world. You have to look hard for the rays of light in this, in a line up that contains Robert Pattinson's superbly creepy preacher and the consistently good Sebastian Stan's duplicitous Sheriff.Tom Holland is the star of an all round great cast, he's sublime. He keeps his emotions mostly internal and you can actually see the inner conflicts in his eyes and his body language. I hope there's a way for him to get some awards for this one."
284,I am blown away! This movie is one of the best I've seen this year. Roberts performance is outstanding! Amazing to see how much he has grown since Twilight. Big surprise to see his Harry Potter costar Dudley lol Tom Holland's performance as a serious actor def has a bright future! All in all it was def a great watch and worth the wait
285,"The Devil All the Time - 8/10 (Maybe 7.5, can't honestly decide)The Devil All the Time reminded me a lot of The Place Between the Pines but darker and more violent - and mixed a little with Lawless. It's a story that tells mirroring story arches of a father (Bill Skarsgard) and his son (Tom Holland); unlike The Place Between the Pines however, the emphasis is put on the son rather than the father which is to the film's detriment a little. Not a lot (see my rating) but I found myself enamored with Skarsgard's performance as well as his plot more than with Holland's acting and plot. Both are good, but I wish the father was more of the focus in the film. But that is only a minor complaint as I enjoyed both parts of the movie.For the most part the acting is great; Skarsgard especially steals the show but Harry Melling is also surprisingly superb. I say ""surprisingly"" only because I have not seen him since his turn as Dudley in the Harry Potter franchise and was not aware how talented of an actor he is. Jason Clarke and Sebastian Stan also put in great work and although I am not particularly a fan of Holland or Pattinson's work they were not distracting in their performances. Although, you could argue they were distracting as it was plain they were cast in this film to try to broaden the audience of a film that would likely have been merely a cult classic (and honestly, most likely still will be regardless.)This film is dark and twisted and certainly will not win any award for ""Feel Good Movie of the Year"" and is more of a character study. But in all honesty it is not much of a character study either as it remains fairly shallow in its study of the characters. So what is it then? It's a story of what happened between these interconnected characters at this point in time - the writers and director do not tell you what to make of it but instead challenge you to make of it what you will. A strategy that I am intrigued by personally, but rarely works among the masses. At least the general audience members in America.That is why I deem this movie to be more of a cult classic than a hit with the general public or even critics; from its dark subject matter to slow-burn pacing and lastly its ambiguity it will not draw in a large crowd. But those who are drawn in just might become obsessed with this movie."
286,Acting alone 10/10. Great experience but not for the faint of heart
287,"I was half expecting this to be a a little dry. But I was pleasantly surprised. Tom Holland has made a great decision starring in this film, as i feel he could have been in danger of being typecast. But his performance is one of his best I've seen.Granted this film isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it throughout."
288,"I love the narrative similar to the old films and the way the narrator leads you through the different stories but it gets a bit predictable at some point.
Still the performances of Holland, Skarsgard and the new batman, Pattinson are amazing!
Great production by Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal, second work, and company."
289,"The movie is slow in the beginning then gets violent in the last hour. The storytelling is fantastic. It makes us think about our blind faith in God. The casting is extremely good. Performance wise Tom Holland exceeds all. Robert Pattinson is also noticeable but his accent in this is a little weird. So, overall Netflix wins with this dark and amazing watch."
290,"Slow burn in the beginning but it all comes full circle in the end. Tom Holland deserved so much praise, also other casts.. amazing. The narration was perfect. It filled it details but wasn't distracting. Great psycho-thriller!"
291,This movie is a rough but must watch! The story is so well rounded. The actors were well casted and executed this story in the best way. Wow. Just wow.
292,"Very good movie with outstanding acting.
Maybe a little 2 long but overall a solid movie."
293,Wow just wow I have seen many intense movies but this one is just different in a good way
294,"Robert Pattinson'performance might give the delusion of being really something brilliant or magnificent but it just doesn't come off as impressive. Tom Holland on the other hand has really surprised with his performance! Rest of cast is really good as well, Sebastian Stan fits his role well too. Overall the movie is worth watching."
295,"Another Netflix masterpiece film. The combination of the cast of mega stars is never wrong to make the film feel alive. The whole story is arranged slowly but surely, bringing a complete atmosphere, such as the meaning of life, love, and evil. I really like it as all the crimes here are based on the rottenness of the human heart and mind, and reflect mostly the existing reality. It doesn't matter whether you are a religious person, a person in office, or an ordinary person, you will never be free from mistakes and sins.I really like it when all the stories bring all the characters connected and connected to each other, there is no waste at all here. The story is explored perfectly by dividing the screentime of each character evenly. I also like that there isn't one character who stands out more, all the characters are very influential in the story here. The film uses repetitive scoring, with decent screenplay and cinematography. The tone that was delivered was diverse but still consistent with its main focus. Featuring a storytelling style with narrative intervals, this complex and long story has succeeded in making you not bored and being very interesting.Boyy, all the cast here put on an incredibly powerful performance. Even though it only appeared at the beginning, Bennet and Skarsgard were very successful in creating Arvin (Tom Holland) 's background for the whole story. the same as Bennet and Skarsgard, Wasikowska and Melling show pretty good acting. Rilley Keough and Jason Clarke succeeded in portraying evil and scary characters, and Sebastian Stan who also succeeded in evolving into a badcop with a distinctive stature. Scanlen succeeded in bringing the role of a vulnerable girl, Pattinson always amazed him where he brought the character of a religious person but committed a sin. Lastly, Tom Holland, boy, he managed to escape from his spiderman image, he evolved into a likeable main character who is easy to get the attention of the audience. I think Holland will continue to improve his acting when he plays more non-blockbuster films.I crowned this film as my second favorite Netflix film after The King. I hope Netflix releases more films like this."
296,"A really great one time watch absolutely loved it,and the performances were great too"
297,"Wow! What a film! The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, the cinematography is stunning, and all of the performances from the cast are just fantastic! Especially, Tom Holland who really gets a chance to flex his acting chops here and Robert Pattinson who is a total chameleon and it's an absolute travesty that he hasn't been nominated for an Oscar yet! I also love how they tied all of the characters' stories throughout the course of the film. It is very much a slowburn but once you get invested in the story, the runtime doesn't matter at all. The film in general is a bit disturbing so if you don't vibe with that kind of stuff, maybe this isn't for you but to all of those who can handle it, do please go and watch this film! Amazing flick and most definitely one of if not the best film that Netflix has ever produced!"
298,Just watch and enjoy. Best two hours I've spent watching something in a long time. Tom Holland is one of a kind
299,"The Devil All the Time is I found an interesting film. The story features interesting characters and how they are all intricately linked together. The story is driven by the characters who are all morally corrupt in some way even at some point the protagonist. The performances are all brilliant, from Tom Holland's Arvin who had shades of Travis Bickle mixed with his natural likeability and Robert Pattison's creepy Preston with his softly spoken southern accented menace and don't forget all the other performances, every one is convincing. I highly recommend this as one of the better Netflix offerings."
300,Where do i start movie is really outstanding in every department especially acting of the cast was so good .Robert paattinson and Tom Holland hats off .
301,"I've read some very pretentious reviews. If you're cinephile.. I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this movie. The ending is worth it. I'm not sure which critic it was that said it wasn't. The character development is great, especially for the protagonist. The cinematography is excellent. The writing, and the acting is phenomenal. If you're into popcorn films like Hobbs and Shaw, you probably won't like it. It's dark, but not overly-dark and dramatic like some pretentious art films. There really isn't a thing to complain about this movie. Maybe, maybe the looping timeline may be a little confusing.. but other than that, I would highly recommend this film. I'm not a articulate reviewer, but I do adore film."
302,"Loved the film, very gripping and felt a lot shorter than it's run time. Acting was amazing from all of the cast. Not the sort of film that'll leave you happy and skipping over the hills but this is definitely worth a watch if you enjoy darker films."
303,"Complex first hour, you have to figure out what is coming after, then it feels like a thriller full of diverse characters some searching others self deceiving, all immersed in the oppresive back roads of the rural country soaked Bible innuendos half digested and serious consequences. The directors' hand is shown in the sober and precise acting that creates film stars."
304,"A great dark gothic movie.Yeah, sure could have been a limited series but better off a movie. This movie isn't only about Batman and Spider-man battle. It is so much more than(Not a marvel or DC fan) Excellent performances by a stellar cast. Sebastian Stan was a better choice than Chris Evans because Stan killed it. Antonio Campos great directing. Musics and editing were just at the right places. Production design not cheap."
305,"I've read the book and all i can say is that the movie was well made. The exuction is really good. From the narrator to character introduction and build up.The film tells us, that each one of us has its own devil or evil within us. Some were born bad, some were born good and becomes bad. Some do bad things with no reason, and some with.It's a cycle of unfortunate events (killings) that evolves to characters which is connected with each other and how the main character (Arvin - Tom Holland) ended it."
306,Any person who likes intense movie will love this one
307,"This movie depicts around 3 different personalities, or maybe say persons. Eveey one of them having different kind of life some sad, some thrilling, and some bad. But I wanna say the story is no other than a masterpiece. Tom Holland just kills it. The story and storyline are way too good. Acting of everyone in this movie is just flawless. But it contains some frightening scenes. But overall I wanna say this movie is a total masterpiece. You will surely lovee this movie. It's not just any thriller movie or a mystery movie. This movie is way too good."
308,"I had no idea what this movie was about going in but quickly realized that I was in for a treat.The first pleasant surprise was seeing Bill Skarsgård appear. He was brilliant in Castle Rock and equally so in this film. The role fit him perfectly and his performance took the movie to another level. Harry Melling, Pokey LaFarge, Eliza Scanlen, and Mia Wasikowska were also perfectly cast and delivered many memorable scenes along with Skarsgård. There are elements of a movie that distinguish it from being bad or good or a classic. This is a classic thanks to the amazing job these actors did.Of course, the writing and production deserve equal, if not more, of the credit. This is a long movie but it flew by. There were so many surprises, twists and turns that I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The time period was captured brilliantly and the feel of the movie was deeply authentic. It's such a beautiful piece of work. I put it in the same league as 'There Will Be Blood', 'Miller's Crossing', 'The Green Mile', or even 'The Shawshank Redemption'.My only negatives are that I don't think Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland belong in this movie. They are just too well known (victims of their previous successes). Let's face it, a vampire and Spiderman should be nowhere near this movie. Thankfully though, the rest of the cast saved it. Along with the previous mentions, Haley Bennet, Sebastian Stan, Riley Keough, and Jason Clarke were also fantastic.You have a great one here so set aside some special time and enjoy every moment of it."
309,I ain't comparing but this gave the same feels tbh
310,"Do not watch if you don't want to be depressed. Slow burn, amazing cast that executed well. Much better than anticipated. The acting is only surpassed by the unique and chilling story."
311,"Religion is bringing out a devil in human beings and its nothing new in the world we are living, but this movie really shows humanity at its lowest. Great storytelling and superb acting! Sincerely recommend seeing this movie.
Masterpiece!"
312,What a great film filled with brilliant performance's especially Tom Holland. Robert Pattinson bill skarsgaard. The writing directing is superb. I highly recommend you heck this movie out!
313,"I thought i was the only one who found the similarity between this movie and Tarantino's. It's a well packed psycho thriller with top notch act, parallel stories and violence that reminds me to Pulp Fiction"
314,"Sometimes with an all star cast you don't actually get a great story, but this movie has both. The performances were really fantastic. The cinematography was also incredible. I typically wouldn't watch a slow burn like this more than once, even if I like it, but I think this one is too good not to see again."
315,This is the best movie I've seen that was made by Netflix good writing and directing and Tom Holland he's a future legend . More like this Netflix please
316,That was one the best movie I have seen in this month . So dark and sad that made me cry but I LOVED IT . Actors group was the best part .
317,"Holland surprises me, Pattinson is gold - - Very Very Good movie"
318,I first seen Tom Holland in The Impossible and in there alone you can already see the potential of this kid. I read somewhere that this movie is where he becomes an adult and stops being peter parker. THIS IS HIS BIG BREAK in acting. Kudos also to Robert Pattinson. He is just a great actor period. They both deserve a recognition from the industry so i really PRAY that they would. 😊 Great acting from the other actors too! A bit slow at first but Bill Scarsgard made it interesting. Great movie Netflix!
319,"I have a only request: please Netflix make movies more like this,"
320,"I don't what is was about this film but like for a while after, I just felt like sick to my stomach. It had such visceral imagery that only needed to be shown for less than a second and it was those scenes that stuck with me. Also seeing these actors that I hold so dear to my heart in these roles makes me feel sick. I know that you need to separate the actor from their work but it was hard for me to do that here. Really great story nonetheless. I was wondering how the couple would weave back into the story again and I think that was done really well. I was so nervous for that last part of the movie, I had no idea what was going to happen. I'm happy with the ending. It's not often that movies leave a lasting impression on me and this one definitely did."
321,"Seriously, this Movie made me watch it till the end. I couldnt move till i ended it. It was so amazingly curiously engaging that i almost didnt drink a glass of water till I watched it to end. Really great performances. Beautiful direction and Nicely Done..! BRAVO to the Team Producers. Directors and Actors... Deserves to be watched and understood..."
322,"Did not know what to expect starting this. But was immediately drawn by the amazing story telling, superb narration, and fantastic performances by Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland.
Really glad I watched it. If your looking for a good story with great acting it's a definite must watch."
323,"It is tense, disturbing and dramatic, it also has a story that manages to interest the viewer."
324,"The Devil All The Time is not a film I would see many times. Much like, perhaps, The Road, it is a beautiful and a well directed movie, but the brutality of its story (adapted from the book by Donald Pollock) shows us some of the worst parts of mankind. And although I must say it accomplishes its goal in a very honorable way, I leave the warning it may be not suitable for everyone.
We testify in all characters the incessant need of belief in something superior, either it is God or Death itself. We witness how cruel, corrupt, violent and mad, the human being can be.
The story is brutal. But the film is powerful, and wonderfully casted.
A special praise for Tom Holland: may we see him in more dramas like this one, in the future."
325,"Could also be called ""A series of unfortunate events""Oh wait..."
326,"I have a feeling this film will become iconic in twenty years because of the heights this cast will reach. The cast are surely the best amongst their acting generation and have been crammed into a truly unique film. A friend asked me what it was about and I didn't attempt to describe it. I don't think it will be for everyone. It had a sickening feeling all the way through, even though there aee far more visually disturbing films out there. It reminded me of the film Frailty for the sense of foreboding. I watched it this morning and it has stuck with me all day. Brilliant."
327,"Strong ""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward, Robert Ford"" vibes throughout. If you enjoyed that film (or ""No Country For Old Men""), you'll undoubtedly love this one too.Granted, it's not for everybody (being very grim, slow moving; creating tension through deliberately subtle, nuanced editing which tends to usually linger on each each for far longer than usual) but it's a film which definitely has a pre-existing audience that'll enjoy it for what it is.I'm simply fortunate enough to be within the niché market that ""The Devil All The Time"" clearly intends to pander to."
328,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a movie as grim as this one this year. It similarly explores fate and morality by way of intertwining storylines much like The Place Beyond the Pines did. It requires patience and it certainly isn't a comforting watch, but I found it to be spellbinding, with a stacked ensemble that all bring their A-game. This one will linger with me for a while."
329,This movie was fantastic! Tom Holland perfectly embodied his character while also managing to keep my attention throughout the film. Sebastian Stan was unrecognizable in this role and he was amazing! I couldn't look away from his character anytime he popped up on my screen. Robert Pattinson's acting was fantastic but I felt by self zoning out a little bit during his scenes (Except for the 'delusions' scene lol that definitely caught my attention).
330,"Every single actor acted the hell out of their part. Bill Skasgard was especially good, as was Tom Holland and Patterson"
331,This movie is definitely a slow burn. It is very dark and gave me almost the whole time a feeling of unease. Nevertheless the movie got me thinking about it a lot afterwards.That's why I would consider this movie well done! However I don't think I will rewatch this movie anytime soon.
332,"I Like This Movie Very Much.
And I think tom holland is really good in this movie.Robert Pattinson,Bill Skarsgard and Sebastian Stan is good actor too.
I Like This Movie."
333,If it wasn't for him I would of turned it off. It would of been way better without the heavy religious tone throughout. I would be rating this movie a lot lower if it wasn't for his performance. A really boring and frustrating movie to sit through. Don't see how it's getting such great reviews.
334,This is not a feel good movie. The tragedies just keep coming. Excellent acting across the board. This is going to be a contender for several awards.
335,Best film I've seen since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
336,"My review will be short and straight to the point.
I loved the way this ""story"" builds with mostly character developments. Very unique film pacing, which leaves you satisfied at the end. Feels like a whole season of a series instead of a movie, in a good way.
Watch it if you can!"
337,Wish it ended better but soo good. Loved the actors in it
338,"Just watched this on Netflix. I loved this movie. Didn't feel long at all. A few different stories interwoven and all wrapped up nicely in the end, complete with utterly nonsensical side plots. Acting is good. Story is captivating. Well worth your time."
339,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the first five minutes. I don't see many films that have me this captivated for the entire duration, but this one did!
The acting specifically was amazing, which makes sense with such an all-star cast. Even actors I've never seen before were impressive and those I already know (Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Robert Pattinson, Jason Clarke) did just an INCREDIBLE job portraying their characters.
PSA: this movie deals with some pretty intense subject matters, so be aware of triggers (war, PTSD, suicide/murder, underage sex). However, start to finish, this is a movie I would absolutely recommend."
340,"10/10 acting.
Love how British actors like Pattinson, and Holland did a great Southern American accent.
10/10 camera aesthetic. It's so good that it actually looks like it was shot in the 1950s.
10/10 storyline and plot twists. Every 10 minutes something next level was happening.
One of the greatest movie that came out this year and on Netflix. Absolutely loved it."
341,"Tom holland and robert pattinson were amazing! Also, they will have a good future.
The director was perfect."
342,If you liked no country for old man or there will be blood go for it....
343,"While not a a movie I will rewatch again and again, this movie was excellent. The cast crushed their performances. I thoroughly enjoyed not knowing what was next and was genuinely surprised as everything played out. Enough to make you put your phone away and pay attention as to not miss anything."
344,I thought I will not see Shawshank Redemption or Time To Kill or either Murder In The First style of movies again. this movie brings back excactly the same tention and feelings.. yea it is one of the best
345,WAAAW !!! This is one of the greatest stories I have ever watched. it's amazing how everything linked up the way it did and circumstances changes and leads the characters to react in this truly fantastic and realistic way. The acting of the cast was magnificent. I actually cried watching Bill skarsgard wonderful portrayal of the character he played. Nevertheless the rest of the actors especially Tom Holland did one hell of an act during the movie. Seeing a wonderful and realistic portrayal of characters really gets me hyped and excited even if the scene was so dramatic or tragic and what Tom Holland did had me jumping. The accents are a whole other thing. Robert Pattinson had this vicious and a little bit nervous way of talking which was really 💯. Sebastian stan's acting was so freakin realistic. I really believed him. One more thing the soundtrack was PERFECT for the movie.
346,"I love ensemble pieces, especially those that tell stories of people whose fates are linked with each other rather than the people themselves. It kind of reminds me on a larger version of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" in some ways, although it tells a totally different story. The story is captivating. At the beginning you get introduced to a lot of characters but soon learn that those just are the base for what to come. It generally makes you think that all of that would not have happened if a character of the past just did another move. Its truly a story about fate and how fate defines our lives. And its a story about evilness and gives quite clear answers of the question if people are born evil or if they are made.
The acting is great. Tom Holland totally nails the role of the main character. Well, he is the main character but divided into two roles so its not like Holland is your typical lead actor here. Still he manages well and shows off some absolutely new facettes of his talent. Robert Pattinson is in a noticeably smaller role and wonderfully plays against character. There is one scene between him and Holland, where both actors are wonderful but where Pattinson still steals the show and owns the screen in the most perfect way possible. Riley Keough was fine and it was nice to see her in a character like that (its similar to the characters she usually plays but with a nice twist) Jason Clarke was the weakest point. You really could see the wheels turning in his performance and he usually can do better. Mia Wasikowska was rather wasted in a small but important role. Eliza Scanlen proved once again her ""interesting newcomer to watch out for"" status. I also liked Sebastian Stan who like most actors in this flick wonderfully played against his usual stereotype. Bill Skarsgard was very memorable but the role was shorter than expected. But the first third of the film absolutely belonged to him.
The atmosphere was fantastic. The score haunting and the screenplay perfectly crafted. I think it will really pay off to see it a second time around."
347,"NOT FOR ANYONE, but so cool the story, ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES produced by netflix!"
348,Really stellar acting performances from all the actors! This is a very brilliant film
349,"Script, acting, scenery and the journey the movie takes you on was emotionally investing.This movie makes you feel for the actors which is a trademark of a great movie.It had potential to go down several paths but the way in which all unraveled was delivered in a well timed manner. Nothing felt rushed.The dramatic stories that unfolded will have you hoping the best and the worst for certain individuals.(If any of the cast members look in the reviews, thank you).Worth watching."
350,"But more of the former (imo a good thing).
The Spiderman kid (that's him, right? Sorry I don't watch crap) gets a phenomenal opportunity to showcase his skills in a real film & he nails it. As does Robert Pattinson who has been on a roll off late, I guess. He really is carrying that Ed Norton/ Christian Bale torch forward. The theme basically revolves around men being absolute filth. It's a slow burn & has varying degrees of sadness in almost every frame. I suggest watching it in two sitttings (140 min long). Professional critics don't look too impressed (Metascore 57!), which these days, is a reliable sign of a great film devoid of the usual sickening tropes."
351,"This movie initially reminded me of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"" , not the story line, but the way the movie was made. A narrator describing each and every section of the movie makes it warm to watch. I really appreciate the efforts made by Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson to convey the dialogue in East Virginia cowboy accents which made it interesting to see these people on screen. The plot focuses on 3 stories which are basically interconnected among each other to create an atmosphere of mystery surrounding each one's death. It mainly focuses on people who are orthodox Christians whereas some are against it. The interesting thing of the movie is how preachers and reverends twist certain facts of the Bible and make it comfortable in fulfilling their personal purposes like sex or resurrection. I recommend this movie to those who are against Christian beliefs or Atheist as it will be a favouring movie for them."
352,Movie moved a bit too slow for me but tom hollands acting made me watch to the end
353,I thought this film was very well done the casting was thought out well and the acting is Oscar worthy on both the main actors i admit takes awhile to catch eyes and i predicted the last 45 mins and how it was going to go but besides that such a well made movie
354,"This movie is very good, I really enjoyed seeing Tom Holland go up against the corruption in the small town. Acting was amazing and well directed by Antonio Campos. It succeeds in suspense thriller as well as a nice slow burn. If your in a mood to watch something dark, bleak, and grounded with a good ending then this movie is for you!"
355,They did a great job casting and adapting this story on screen! Was not disappointed!
356,"The story fallows two generations and both have plenty of misfortunes from illnes to suicides and madness. Around the boy everybody falls to dispair, to bad decisions and pure evil. A priest that seduces young girls, a vile couple that kills strangers off the road, a corupt cop, a mad father because of war, another priest killing his wife after bitten by spiders so that he could ressurect her. Facing all this that boy must defend and act vengeful.
a long ride that deserves to be seen."
357,"I didn't expect it to be that good!
It was slow paced on the beginning but on the final hour
3 different person's stories came together and made this movie a good one!I thought it was gonna be a boring bad netflix adaption but I was wrong it's very good!
Great perfomance by Tom Holland! Pattinson was good but the accent was kinda bad
This movie is a must watch! The final fight kinda made me nervous which is the first one for me because I never get thrilled on movies this movie gave me a great experience! I'm glad I waited for this! 8/10!"
358,"The story told in ""The Devil All The Time"" is based on religion and sins and with a wonderful touch of suspense making it a very good movie !! Tom Holland shines with his best performance to date, Robert Pattison makes a character where it is good to hate him. I don't think the film is dragged but rather long and tells its story in a wonderful way!"
359,"He has done it again, he just keeps getting better with each film!
Movie 8/10
Pattinson's performance 10/10"
360,"Great acting. Awesome story, long but interesting. Netflix with yet another ball out of the park."
361,This movie starts slow and in the end it all comes together! Love the cast and the atmosphere. I had high expectations and wasn't disappointed.
362,"This movie has been on my watchlist for a couple of weeks, after watching Simon Killer from the same director, I was very interested in seeing him explore such a long and expansive story like this one (especially when all his other movies are very short on plot and running time). And after watching it this morning I can safely say that Antonio Campos has done a really solid job with this movie. With it probably being my favorite of his whole filmography.First let's start out with the acting, the acting in this movie is pretty great. With Tom Holland being the most surprisingly great of all of them. I know he's a good actor, but it's easy to forget that with all these Marvel movies he's doing. Not only does his character have the most depth, but Holland manages to really bring the character out through simple tics and mannerisms that really make the character stand out from the rest. In addition, we have the usually great Robert Pattinson, who again brings his all into the movie. It's still amazing that only 8 years ago, he was doing Twilight movies, amazing how far he's come. Those two actors in particular were phenomenal and they really make the movie worth watching.In terms of cinematography, this movie again shows that Campos really has an eye for the camera. With many shots in this movie being really beautiful, and with these shots it brings a sort of pleasant atmosphere to the movie (despite the dark subject matter).If I had any problems with the movie, I will say that Tom Holland's character seems to be the only one in the movie that I really got a sense of who he was and what his motivations are. Also he was the only character I really connected to in the movie, and he unfortunately doesn't come into the movie until about 50mins to an hour into it. Even with that, the movie tended to drag a lot in the middle to a point where it felt like it could have easily been cut, which is also a problem I had with both Simon Killer and Martha Marcy May Marlene. Although he more than enough makes up for it with his endings in all three I've seen (which includes this one)But overall the movie is definitely worth a watch, it's incredibly well-acted and well-shot, and despite it's being around 140 mins, it almost never manages to feel its length. So please check it out if you canEdit: In addition, if you were a fan of Place Beyond the Pines, it has that same sort of style and long-form storytelling as that one."
363,It feels like Tom Holland has finally come of age. He has taken his acting to another level. His performance is completely note worthy of several accolades!
364,The story is little pointless and very good actors are misplaced...
365,Netflix needs to put out about 5 or 10 more content this good by years end to make up for that trash monkey bullsht CUTIES.
366,"This movie is a magnificently crafted piece of the Southern Gothic genre, full of mysteries, suspense, and the evil of humanity at its core.The film takes place in Southern Ohio after WWII, in a well-written story where most of the character's stories and tribulations are intertwined flawlessly between one another, which will inevitably lead to some cathartic encounters.Some plots and twists are easily decipherable, in the sense that you know what's going to happen next, but the filmmakers manage to still shock the audience with astounding performances from all star-studded cast that includes Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Jason Clarke, Haley Bennet, Mia Wasikowska, Bill Skarsgård, and Sebastian Stan. But it is Tom Holland who deserves to be named MVP in this astonishing production, as his performance is not only beyond perfect, but also his character is the one that connects to the audience, and one of the most well-balanced person in this story full of darkness and horror.This movie definitely deserves all the praise, it is well shot, amazingly acted, and to be a movie that´s longer than two hours, the pacing is perfect."
367,I really like to watch this movie. Impressive actors.
368,Really enjoyed this movie. Highly recommend. Great acting and story
369,"I enjoyed the movie, great casting excellent acting. The movies flows in the one direction and reach the destiny."
370,Every single cast member was absolutely incredible. Yes the movie is long (like so many great films are) but this was captivating. Definitely a must see.
371,Everyone can simply not see this film you need to have an eye for psychological thriller films to watch this one.
372,The cinematography and soundtrack was outstanding. The flow of the movie was great. It did not feel like a 2 hour movie and timeline made sense. The cast did an incredible job acting wise. Major shout out to Bill and Tom Holland.
373,"One of those movies that slowly embraces you with the beauty of acting and vistas beyond our reach, tucked far away in the memories of the late 60'sthe stories told in this movie are all linked together, tales of grief and loss, joy and revenge...through it all the church commands an ever foreboding presence and one cannot help but feel this amazing movie lets us know that not only religion back then was tainted with the blood of others, but also that very little might have changed in the present..Tom Holland puts in a stellar performance, as well as the other actors....
this is cinema as it was supposed to be...superb.."
374,The movie tries to be Disturbing but becomes Repulsive
375,I was heading into this movie with no expectations I love Tom Holland and bill skazgard anyway but my god did they deliver superb acting and a superb storyline great movie would definetely recommend
376,This is a compelling movie full of irredeemable people played by brilliant actors. Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson are particularly impressive as they portray southerners without giving any hint to their English roots. In the end I was left disgusted by the characters but praising the brilliance of the performances.
377,"Last night, I finally got the pleasure of sitting down to watch this movie, and boy, is it somethin'. Let me start off by saying this,
this movie is dark. Very dark, yet very entertaining. Donald Ray Pollock's narration is brilliant and the acting is superb. The way the story is told is also very amazing. It is told in a linear fashion, but has points where it stops to go back and tell why what is happening is happening, that is the best way I can describe it. It's genius. The music of this film is on another level. Both the orginal soundtrack and the old gospel and country songs used are awesome. All of the characters and their stories are freaking amazing. The whole premise is just great. Robert Pattinson as Rev. Preston Teagardin is some of the best casting I have ever seen. Jason Clarke and Riley Keough as Carl and Sandy Hederson is a pair I would not expect, but Carl and Sandy were probably my favorite characters and they were great! This film is dark, slow burn, Southern gothic film that needs to be seen by EVERYONE. Has echoes of Tarrantino and Coen Brothers, but better. Everything is just right in this film. The acting, the story, the character arcs etc. If you don't like this movie, you're delusional, and our delusions lead us to sin."
378,"Story of a young man with a lot of bad things happening around him most of his life. Quite a long tale but much needed in this time of hollywood nonsensical panderings. According to those new rules for winning awards, I guess this will be left out but the loss is all theirs. Bravo Campos boys."
379,"I thought that they'd stopped making movies like this. I'm glad this was mad. Acting, music, theme, editing, storytelling all coming full circle. Interesting to see the Twilight dude and Spiderman playing grittier roles. The way this movie is done, you actually care about the characters. It's a slow burn and done well. Held my attention till the credits, and that's hard to do. Hollywood, learn from this.Much of the theme centered around false religion and misplaced faith and it shows the dark side of humans. There's no light or dark, just gray all the way through. This movie is human"
380,"It released today in my country on Netflix and I just decided to watch it as the cast looked good. I would describe this movie as awesome: Great storyline, Best screenplay, outstanding performance, especially by actors Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsgard and also the child actor who played young Arvin Russell. A story lined with tragedy and sadness but shows the truth about the world and evilness of humanity, the best quote from the movie is,""Some people are born just so they can be buried""!"
381,Not a good one to watch ! Very rare since the beginning ! Good actors very bad movie 0 star
382,... which is still overly short for most of the evil characters that spring up here. A vehicle for some accomplished actors to peddle their wares but ultimately an unoriginal and cobbled concoction that struggles to engage during its formative establishment and fails to know when it's time to call it a day.
383,"I think , that movie isn't really good. I was expecting very good because Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson are really good actors. It has a awesome cast , the cast likes Champions League but the story likes garbage. I'm sorry but I didn't like it."
384,I created an account to simply say that this movie depicts everything that is wrong with Conservative Christian America. They are the most duplicitous group of dysfunctional people in modern history. This movie is chalk full of future Trump supporters and are exactly the type of trash that Marilyn Manson sings about in his song Cake and Sodomy. They don't need Jesus. They need a lobotomy.
385,"Nothing Spectacular or crazy twists , but worth a watch , maybe a couple of the cast made this seem more desirable than the movie deserves ."
386,"Powerful, oscar worthy movie. strong, violent, sadness , tragedy and ...RELIGION. its everything. movie is long but very exciting. not boring at all. its all well connected. well written and directed. good quality production.No offence with tom holland decent performance,BUT the movie was great in start until it totally changes later. its a fiction story or based on a novel. but its kinda more reality to it, especially in small towns of america where small community lives. where religious people or church trying to control the people or town. ---- first of all, there is NO BAD RELIGION, there are BAD PEOPLE in RELIGION which make it look like worse.---. so its same in movie. where in start the husband is trying to pray GOD to help his dying wife and his evil deeds in war. and then there is a preacher who practice magic or something like that and then another young preacher came. so the movie shows the Bad part about religion. which obviously Hollywood propaganda about religion.but anyhow, its very emotion and strong movie."
387,"Great act. With only this point i can simply give this movie 7. I dont really know pattinson, but tom holland? We all know his character and with this role? Dang man. All the characters was delivered a great performances. Bold, strong.The story itself have a great split timeline. They already used ""good movie"" material. Executed good enough but it can be 9 tho. It waste no time, perfect phase of story."
388,Abit of a slow burner that later picks up so u get rewarded. Well acted and good 2 see different side of the lead actors that come from more commercial movie roles.
389,"An immersive look into the religious fanaticism that corrupts american minds for many decades, especially in the interior states, where low education and consanguinity are a safe haven for the prejudice that derives from that fanaticism. It is also a story on hate, violence and the failed american dream."
390,"I came across this film the other day. It looked interesting so I watched it. At first I wasn't because Robert Pattinson was in the Film. I was never a fan of his. But I watched it anyways. Oh my God this Film was Fantastic Roberts charactor as the Rev. Was great he was no ordinary Rev. He was a slimmy, creepy, idiot, of a jerk behind peoples eyes. Took advantage of the young ladies. He was a jerk he played it very good. As a matter of fact all actors in this film and actresses. They all where fantastic not to often you get a film with a perfect cast. In this film it is 100 percent a perfect cast. Oh and the music the place they choose to film it at. This is a Award winning film. Even the young kids they choose they where even great in this film.
THIS IS A MUST WATCH FILM FOR FILM LOVER'S."
391,"This movie will make you shift in your seat. It displays humanity at its worst. It's like someone took a twisted Coen brothers script and morphed it into a subdued Quentin Tarantino movie with no sense of humor at all.I managed to get through the first half of this slow paced movie knowing that Tom Holland was going to appear as the older Arvin Russell. Tom Holland brings a heroic charisma to the Arvin Russell character. Sure enough, his character redeemed the movie's slow plot line and the movie came quickly to a close. I was glad I stuck with watching. I am not a big fan of movie violence, but on the deepest level this movie points out how deplorable violence is. ...Even when it is committed by its heroes.If you start watching this movie, stick with it. You will not be disappointed."
392,"So I am a few days late but I have now watched Netflix's new big film The Devil All The Time and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man attempting to protect the ones he loved by going after sinister characters in his town.Main Character
Even though he doesn't turn up in this film till the 45 minute mark, Tom Holland is the main character here and he is fantastic. This is a really mature performance, his character is going through a crisis for the majority of the film and you sympathise with him as he attempts to stay good but protect those close to him. Holland is still a young actor and the future for him is huge and hopefully he can be a leading man for years and years to come.Supporting Characters
Robert Pattinson is a busy man at the moment, with Tenet and The Batman but he plays a preacher here and he is fantastic too. He has a different accent and he does it so well here, he is such a slimy person and just by looking at him you can see something is up with him and he plays this role so well, when you consider he is usually the leading man. Bill Skarsgard plays Holland's father here and he does a good job too, you can see where Holland gets his personality from and the two characters journeys really mirror each other and fit the tone of the film really well. Sebastian Stan plays a crooked cop and he is great, he is a charismatic guy and he fits the role well. Credit to Jason Clarke, Harry Melling & Riley Keough who also all do great jobs in their respective roles.Story
The story is interesting for sure, seeing the different characters and their stories are a highlight and made better by the great performances. This films story is all about crisis, mainly in faith and the film does a great job of portraying that and make some really interesting and characters and this film has a really great ending. But, sometimes I think maybe the film should have focused on a few less stories, it is clearly trying to be a film like Pulp Fiction that wants to have everything connect and it does an okay job and not great job at it.Script
The script for me was okay, The drama is here and the film is as dark as it gets which considering the subject matter, that is fine for me. But for a film that lies on its drama there weren't really any moments where the drama hits the highest level and is memorable and that is a let down. Also this films storytelling device of narration feels cheap and lazy and like we need our hands held throughout the plot.Style
The style fits its film very well, everything is dry and looks like a place you would never want to visit. It shows the worst of the worst and the way the film is made really highlights what the film was going for. But I also felt this film was a little long in the teeth, mainly the first act, which took a bit to get going, if this had been sped up a little bit this film would be a much higher level in the final rating.Overall
Overall, this is another good film for Netflix with a great cast that fails to hit the highest levels. I think if you like character driven well acted films then you will enjoy this film and it is a good watch."
393,Quer uma dica de um ótimo filme novo no Netflix? É esse mesmo (The Devil all the time) com Tom Holland (talento que vai dar noque falar!) elenco muito bom (só o Robert Pattinson é uma lástima como sempre) e excelente roteiro! Want a tip for a great new movie on Netflix? This is it (The Devil all the time) with Tom Holland (you're going to hear about him a lot!) Very good cast (only Robert Pattinson is a shame as always) and excellent script! #movieslover #netflix #tomholland #tomhollandfan
394,"My fiance put this movie on, we had no idea what it even was about. What a great decision she made. Watch this film. Great job Netflix."
395,"First of all, Tom Holland gave a solid performance so praises to him. The movie started out kind of boring to me but it quickly caught my attention as the story unravelled and I got to know how the lives of the characters were connected. This movie is kind of like watching a car crash happening in slow motion, it was gripping and violent."
396,What a performance from TomHolland and RobbertPattison .. this film is so dark and iam in love with it!!
397,"This was one of the most amazing movies Netflix had ever produce. The acting is excellent, and even though I'm not a fan of slow-burn movies, this felt worthy. I totally recommend it and left this movie with one thing in mi mind. Even though sometimes we think we are doing something led by god... It was the Devil all the time. Loved it"
398,"Slow burn, good acting. Intriguing story line keeps you hanging on."
399,"This movie is an unexpected treat. I stumbled onto it accidently before going to sleep and I just kept on watching till the morning. It leaves you with a mixed feelings, the plot is messy and there are some coincidences that it's just a bit hard to swallow. Never the less this movie gives you a real taste of that era between 1950 - 1965 in the middle states, and in my opinion, it worth a lot. Most of the characters are much less touchy about matters of life and death, violence and gender relations as they pretty much accept that this is the way of life. Main protagonist view of life is much closer to ours, but still some may call him a sociopath nowadays.
This is a great movie, and obviously there won't be a follow-up, but I would definitely like to see more of the same kind, as this movie, for lack of a better phrase ""keeps you real""."
400,"If you read the book, then you know what a wonderful job the screenwriter and director did in condensing this down into a film. It was wonderfully acted. The accents created by the actors were great. It's not the feel good movie of the year but a great one nevertheless."
401,"Just for this synopsis I would fall in love, strange and bizarre people in cinema attract me, and here in a brilliantly developed way, the narration gives life and brilliantly sketches the comings and goings in the past, through the stories that harmoniously intertwine , intense, fun and extremely dramatic and captivating, the characters, although extravagant and exaggerated, are charismatic, perfect script, excellent production..."
402,The devil all the time takes your through different stories and bounces around a lot. The film was pretty messy in the beginning. But each story is interesting and takes good turns. The movie got better as it went along. This was capped off by satisfying finish and 3rd act. The movie successfully explored interesting characters and themes in pretty unique way. The intertwined stories really worked for me. One problem I have with this movie is the totally unnecessary narration. It took me out of the film and added nothing. All things considered it's a good movie worth watching.
403,"During the film i had that feeling that this picture was directed by the Coen brothers, but it is the day that i will remember from the name of Antonio Campos. Perfect cast; Robert Pattinson got the role of his life. Finally not some lame loverboy or vampire. Tom Holland my god, i literaly thought that guy is just the worse spiderman i have ever saw but it aint true. Good acting there too. And the story was just impeccable. Many thanks for that experience."
404,Once again Robert Pattinson shows his acting skills in a thrilling and diverse story that is told pretty standard but has really big moments.
405,A simplistic gritty thriller that almost gives of indie vibes if it didn't have all the big name actors. All round a great watch and well worth it
406,"This movie sure did come out of no where. This cast was amazing and everyone held their own and gave their characters so much depth!!!
Haven't been this happy with a movie in a long time! Well done Netflix, well done. You are the true hero of 2020"
407,"This movie is not going to be for everyone. In fact I am not really even sure that I liked the movie as it is dark and depressing.However, the story telling was very interesting in how it was laid out and the acting across the board was phenomenal.I don't really know that I was smart enough to get the point of the film or literature it was based on, but none the less it is one I won't forget about."
408,"One of those movies you wish to see as tv series, you couldn't take your eyes off for the whole running time. The characters and the storyteller (The Writer Himself) made it the movie of the year."
409,Fantastic movie not for everyone its well acted has a good story Tom Holland is surprisingly good. I like a slow burn and this is a slow burn but gets your heart racing at times. The author of the novel this movie is based on narrates throughout adds an insight to the characters you cant get unless reading the novel which I haven't but I will now.
410,This movie is a masterpiece... I enjoyed every second of it.. I can not say enough about the cast... the music in it is awesome.. The way they set up the old time feeling in it hits the mark.. I don't get to leave a 10 that much but this movie deserves it.. it was amazing to watch
411,"A gritty, graphic slow burn that I honestly couldn't stop watching. All of the actors' performances were amazing."
412,"This movie is all about Tom Holland, he showed that he is not just a superhero, he is the superhero. A slow burn movie, which builds up the heartache as it drags on, like the list of bodies in it. Such fine acting!"
413,"This is the sort of level that Netflix needs to be hitting more often than not because this film is one of the best that is has produced.......or put out to the world. Saw the trailer and was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cast and the interesting story, however I was hesitant because Netflix hasn't always delivered.I am very pleased to say that ""The Devil All the Time' is everything you could want in a modern day thriller. We have to start with the cast because it is the biggest draw and the main positive of the film, so many names I unfortunately might forget some. The best for me is Robert Pattison who is just a chameleon of an actor, plays this super creepy preacher extremely well and that accent is impeccable. He is in a strange way a pivot point of the film and triggers a lot of events that unfold towards the end of the film. Tom Holland, great to see him in something that isn't a comic book film. Definitely an extremely talented guy that has a lot of potential and has a bright future ahead of him, played the role really well and was easy to get behind and route for. Next I would say is Eliza Scanlen, who I up until this film had never heard of........but boy am I going to look out for her now. Superb in the role of ""Lenora"" actually looks a bit like Mia Wasikowska who portrays her mother in the film. She definitely delivers a small but very effective performance that you won't forget. Lastly I would say Bill Skarsgard, who sets the tone for the film and you could say is the heart of the film. Again delivers a very powerful although small performance. The rest Jason Clarke, Riley Keough, Haley Bennett, Sebastian Stan and Mia Wasikowska are all great in the film as well.The next major positive of the film is the narrative or how its told through multiple jumps in time and characters. This film could easily have been very confusing with the amount of characters and story threads it has, however some how it manages to balance them perfectly. At not one point in the film was I confused or trying to figure out what meant what. Obviously towards the end of the film when all of the threads combine together, every single one of them gets a rewarding pay off. A very interesting and nice way of telling a story over many years and generations, kept it fresh and engaging to me as the audience.Overall I was really really impressed with this film and it did not disappoint with the outstanding cast it had at its disposal. I would say this film is a 75% out of 100 or a 7.5 out of 10 it is so so close to being a 8/10 but I just feel the film takes a while to get going, thats the only real criticism I have. However when this film does start going it doesn't stop all the way until the end with plenty of twists and turns. Would definitely recommend to anyone how loves Thrillers but also someone who loves character driven stories."
414,"""What a amazing movie, very well acting, very intense, easy to follow, not bored at all, Tom Holland doing a very well done acting here, Robert Pattinson is amazing his perfomance, acting, and his very unique accent is awesome, Riley Keough and Jason Clarke they both succeed make me intense every scene, and all the supporting actor and actress is very well done, highly recommend"""
415,"The movie is good but the idea of the movie is not well represented.As the story revolves around the god ,and the action done by them in the name of the god is not shown in the climax."
416,"It's been a while since I have seen such good acting where it's all about a good plot in a realistic setting. The actors talk like people there as I have roadtripped through this part if the woods and people are just people no super heroes just doing what they think is right!
You can tell this movie is based on a good book as it gently intertwines the relationships of the characters.
Great job on the cinematography and wardrobe, I was going to give up on Netflix but this movie gives me hope there is still room for movies with a red thread exposed to trauma and unfortunately tragic events that do occur!"
417,Netflix is at the top of the streaming empire. Great performances in a period piece.
418,"I was not expecting much at the beginning, but enjoyed it. All the stories merge at one point and all the scenes are meaningful. Was skeptic about if spiderman's Tom holland can portray the character well. But, he blended very nicely. Other actors' acting was very smooth that blends with the story. The movie is not for everyone. It is for someone who sits relax and wants to listen to the story. The narration, direction, color gives you vibe of Forrest gump & The Shawshank Redemption. My only complain is that in the story all religious characters are bad and subconsciously it implied religion is bad. But, it's a story. From story telling point of view the movie was good. A Good Movie to watch."
419,"This movie being put out did so much more harm than good. It basks in horrifying images, graphic violence and just constantly senselessly messed up scenes that say nothing. The over dependence on a narrator to literally explain character's thoughts and the entire plot's development is hilariously pathetic. This is truly weak storytelling, exploiting horrific violence and the guise of some sort of religious symbolism to fool people into thinking there's some depth to it. Nothing unique is said in this movie, and it's a generally unpleasant watch. I like the actors, but I have no respect for the filmmaker. This movie is a senseless and reckless Netflix grab at an audience that will watch whatever they put out with young stars, and it borders on being genuinely harmful."
420,"Like the title says the acting was great. Just wish more of the ""main"" characters had more of a character arc.Felt like every one we met was introduced with little to no back story, never really explained what drove them, then they were gone. Made it hard to have any emotional investment in any of them"
421,"Lunatics at every turn, it was no longer believable. It's based on a book, doesn't make it okay to make such vile garbage into a movie. It's also trendy to mock religions these days, so of course every single psycho in this movie had to pray/preach/reference the Bible/listen to Gospel songs or they wouldn't look complicated enough. We get it; it's supposedly cool, brave and edgy if you don't believe in God, no need for such a lame, lengthy excuse of a movie. Nobody in real life could be surrounded by that many freaks in one lifetime. Should have stuck to Asian shows on Netflix."
422,As usual Netflix is now mostly into dark sinister things. Would disappoint I guess to its cult of followers.
423,"Nice acting cast expect Pattison, he was bad in this movie. Script is also bad and boring and the writer didn't know how to execute his idea in the right way."
424,"The film definitely isn't for everyone but luckily I enjoy films like this. I've seen people complaining about the length, for me personally it didn't feel as long as it is and I also enjoy long films anyway. I'll admit it took me a little while to get a hold of what's going on but as soon as I did I really enjoy it. It's hard not to enjoy a film with such a great acting display. You've seen it from everyone else's reviews but Tom Holland stood out massively put on a A star performance. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was Robert pattinsons accent I thought everyone else's accent was a lot better then his. Other then that it was a great performance from him."
425,"Honestly in the modern day where everyone is a critic of anything new, I'd say we try to watch things ourselves before making conclusions, yeah the Rotten tomato rating isn't that good, but don't try to pull yourself out of not watching this. This movie has exceptional performances from Tom Holland and the now popular Robert Pattinson, but focusing on the story there are some plot holes and the screenplay at times does get boring. But it's still a must watch and very great movie."
426,"Dark, ominous, slow-burning movie.If you've seen a lot of movies, you'll instantly recognize the actors as having mostly psychopathic-like roles, which only adds up to the suspense & the mystery of who might be the Devil, metaphorically speaking, of course.Great attention to detail, the resemblance of the actors is just amazing & pace is just as it should be. Expect nothing but the best when it comes to the acting, because the actors are truly one of the most talented ones."
427,The review title says it all. It's got a story consistent with pulp fiction and the visuals of deliverance
428,"This is one of the few decent films this year, most seem to be ""Woke"" films which I will not waste my time watching, I want entertainment, I do not want to be, nor will I be lectured, this film had a very good story line and was absorbing, the only thing I would have liked was to know the eventual fate of the Character played by Tom Holland, Arvin Russel, a very good film indeed."
429,"The plot provides so many points to be interested by. So many disturbing things, and so many things that are seeming pleasant for the characters but are inevitably painful. It has a great cast that does an amazing job. It gives a creepy look into the good ole christian side of the 50's and 60's. So many people going about their lives yet end up coinciding in a murderous and revelatory end."
430,"First, this movie is not for everyone. It is slow paced, dark, not many 'happy' scenes and one of those movies where everything that can go wrong will.That being said, it very well acted, very well directed and written in a manner that will stay with you long after seeing it. Too often I can barely remember the movie I saw last week....this is not one of those."
431,"This is by far the best ""original"" film netflix has released."
432,"Not sure how these European/English actors pulled off better southern accents, than the southern state I'm from. Bravo! Great acting!"
433,"I had absolutely no idea what this film was going to be and it has left me pretty happy overall with my choice of film to watch.I'll start with the negatives: for a long film there is a surprising lack of character depth, made it hard to really like anybody. I feel like the first hour or so is a bit dragged out, could have been condensed slightly.The positives: well it's basically written in the title. The acting from everyone was fantastic, great cast and equalled with the performances. Tom Holland, special mention, can take a bow because he was excellent. And the story itself is an interesting tale and I think it's really well done how the ""separate storylines"" collide. It's a story that's pretty unique as well (well I've not seen anything like this).Overall it's a good watch. Worth the time you put into it. All I'll say it don't watch it you have a short attention span! But overall enjoyed this."
434,"I don't know exactly why but I love this movie. It doesn't have the strongest story but it is a wild ride. This is one of those movies you watch once and love in a strange way.The best part about this movie is definitely the actors. Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skårsgard... y'all did a fine job!"
435,"At some point I was hoping for something like Castle Rock, minus the supernatural, but the movie never took off. It just seems to show us different storylines, some of them connect at some point, but I fail to understand what was the conclusion there.
It's like most movies these days, especially on Netflix. There is a great potential with the cast or story but in the end it's a movie made for the art of cinema, but not really to tell a story."
436,"Reviews are bias always, doesn't matter if you are a critic or not. Anyone who claims otherwise is simply defending a hypocritical ideology. That said, with out sounding like a narcissist, I rate movies based on my perspective and how it would viewed in the world. I loved the movie, the acting was amazing. But its not a happy movie and the title gives it away. The plot is amazing and the actors who are not American did an excellent job with their southern accents. Wow! Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Bill Skarsgard, Harry Melling were phenomenal. Watch it !!!!"
437,"Hit play at 2am on Netflix, not knowing what to expect aside from a great set of actors, and I was definitely not disappointed. Very well cast, extremely well acted by every single person in the movie (and that's something I rarely say). I predicted the majority of the ending a little more than half way through the film, but that's not saying much considering how many movies I've watched in my life. One of my very few negative comments is that I had hoped to m discover who the narrator of the movie was, but now that I know it was based on a book I supposed I just have to accept that he's just a narrator. Also, I wish there was just little bit more character development for two or three people, but since it's already a relatively long movie it was an acceptable loss.Dark and very depressing for a good chunk of the duration, but for the most part I was very happy with how everything concluded and would highly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate something that takes this type of direction. Glad I found this one and stayed up til 4am to finish it."
438,"Overall Movie is Good. First half is little bit slow but after first half this movie story on the track and really this movies is good. But if you are like movies zodiac and slow pace movie then you like this movie, absolutely. But you don't like this type movies then you don't like this Movie and Overall One time watch movie only one time.
Thank you."
439,"Yes, that's my title for this gem of a picture. With all the senseless death, one can only pray (pun) that the boy lives in the end. Enduring the length of the film, the ending was worth The wait. Oh, and how many thought that Arvin was headed to San Francisco when the VW Bus pulled over? Nice going Netflix...great cast of actors and a good story"
440,"Though it could be a bit slow at times, I thought this film was overall very compelling and impressive. Its' greatest strength is definitely the cast, as there were impeccable performances on all sides, especially from Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson. It's a dreary, dark slow-burn that studies the ways in which religion can corrupt a person and how dangerous such beliefs can be to a community. It gave me 'There Will Be Blood' vibes, another great piece of cinema carried by extremely talented actors. I'd recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of slow-burn thrillers with intense moments and deeper meanings. I can understand some of the negative reviews on here, as there were elements that were a bit lacking such as character development, but I was willing to overlook that as the film was interesting enough to keep me watching until the end. It's not for everyone, but there's definitely plenty to appreciate with this one. Worth a shot."
441,This movie was really dark and compelling! I sometimes feel with dark movies that certain deaths can have no meaning beyond it being sad/for atmosphere- not with this movie. Every death had a very important part to play with the plot. The acting was incredible too.
442,"What an amazing movie. The acting, the storyline- everything. Just great from beginning to the end."
443,"One of the finest ""guilty pleasure""
Tom hollen is awesome
Story is great over all must watch movie"
444,"SYNOPSIS:
Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) has had a very rough upbringing and eventually when he's older, decides it's time to take matters into his own hands. However, things don't go as smoothly as he'd hoped.REVIEW:
At the very beginning of this film, a waitress tells Willard (Bill Skarsgård) he has a ""nice face"" and I've always wished that a woman would just make a blatant indication of her interest to me like that. No I haven't considered the fact that maybe I don't have a nice face. Enough roasting, let me review this film.In The Devil All the Time, we start off getting a feel for the path this film is going down. We're focused in on different groups of people who reference God in one way or another and you get a true understanding of the title of the film. Anthony Campos has this way of making very beautifully dark images. He can throw it right in your face or it can be very subtle and it makes for some very good shots. The film moves at a very smooth pace and keeps you invested with either the story or what's happening in the moment. Now, it is a parallel telling, so we're going back and forth between different people and they're stories and there are some more interesting than others. The storytelling does make sense, however, I felt parts of it could've been done in a more clever way. It did feel towards the end, they got tired of writing and just decided to make things very coincidental and a lot less organic. I know people have mixed feeling about ""Crash"", but I do feel the stories converge in a much more natural way. Maybe I'm being too heavily critical, but I just think it could've been cleaned up slightly. To me, the best story is between Arvin and the new preacher, Preston (Robert Pattinson). You have this established friction between Arvin and faith and when Preston comes in, you can see the validation of that distance in Arvin's eyes. That scene between Arvin and Preston was... intense and perfectly acted. Replay that scene please and thank you.Moving on to the performances. Oh my goodness and gracious Robert Pattinson. Wait... let me wait to talk about him. You have maybe one of the best actors to never win an Oscar in Jason Clarke. Him and Riley Keough as this messed up couple was a joy to watch. One very disturbing image had me cringing. Then we have Harry Melling as Roy Laferty and in his very limited screen time, he's fantastically disturbing. Sebastian Stan was good, but I would have to say his part as the dirty cop was least intriguing to me. Wasn't fully invested in his part. Then getting into Eliza Scanlen as Lenora and Tom Holland as Arvin. Those two did a very good job in their roles and created a real emotion to both. I felt the essence of every scene they were in and I was always interested in both paths. The two standout performances to me were Bill Skarsgård as Willard and Robert Pattinson as Preston. Bill Skarsgård needs to get more opportunities. He could possibly be one of the better character actors we have today. With what he does as Pennywise and what he does in the film can't be ignored and needs to be appreciated by those in this space. You don't just watch his character, you feel it. You feel every decision he makes and when he does something it affects you on a deeper level. Truly amazing.ROBERT PATTINSON:
Now, Robert Pattinson. Oh my dear baby Jesus, Robert Pattinson. I have never been more #TeamEdward in my life. He gives one of the best performances in the last few years in this film and it's his best performance of any film I've seen with him. Woah woah except for Twilight I get it. Us non teenage women just don't understand what he did with that role, sureee. Anyway, other than Twilight, Pattinson gives the performance of his career. I was watching and laughing at it. First of all, where did he muster up that voice? What is it about a tone of voice that can really make you disgusted at a person? And I mean to add to an already weird experience you have with that person. It puts it over the top. If he came out talking like Morgan Freeman, I wouldn't have felt nearly as uneasy. Probably, would've been put to sleep to be honest. But then add that weird energy he gives off. This is before finding out more about him. Basing off of a first impression, you just know something is off about this guy and you immediately don't like him. He does act like a total ass to a sweet woman which I guess helps push you toward a distaste for the man. With every word that comes out of his mouth you hate him more and more and it's insane how believable he was in this role. Absolutely stellar.In conclusion, this film carries with through with intrigue and pacing. I was never bored with the film. I do feel it could've been tweaked and could've ended up a better film than it was, but I still loved moments in this film and could see myself revisiting it. 7.6/10."
445,The movie pulls you in. Grows on you with each passing frame. The cast is exceptionally good. Each character very well written and potrayed.
446,"I can't deny that knowing what the cast was gonna be was the main reason I wanted to watch it, and it really didn't disappoint. All of them embodied the character and I was not bored for a minute. Really good set up from the moment the movie starts and even though it's 2h20, it feels like you could watch even more. Tom Holland really outdid himself in this."
447,This movie not only brought an amazing cast with amazing talents it also brought us the amazing direction of Antonio campos i just loved this kovie amd how it filled me with these emotions
448,"From the deep south midwest usa, also called the redneck country, based around 1957 till the end of 60's. its a family saga, a very religious inspired saga, where satan is surtainly the devil, and the preacherman is just a stringpuppet guided by the devil, to fulfill own cravings and lust, driving young women and men into dispair and death. its almost like a mafia flick, the great difference is the word of god in the bible belt , and the poverty that makes people do anything for a piece of bread, then you soul are easily sold, and the doors of heaven and hell both stand wide open, to devour you into oblivion.incest, mental ilnesses, pimps and hookers... they are all there for a reason, and the reason for us is to make a good, devastating and uncomfortable movie to watch. its also a revengemovie en masse, and how the deeds are done is just amazing and blessed with rightsiousness.its a little slow on plotspeed, some of the caracters are shallow on description, but edit and filmowise its a broilr, and the choice of southern score are goodthe acting are dead serious, and you wont laugh much, so hold back your tears, they arent needed in this flick, with a big recommend from the grumpy old man"
449,"This quote sums up the devil all the time perfectly. It's a story about people, good people still do some bad, and bad people who do some good. It is a realistic, human film I think everyone can relate to in some way. Written by Antonio and Paulo Campos and brilliantly directed by Antonio this is one of the best films of 2020 so far. I've been keeping my eye on Antonio Campos since I saw simon killer a few years ago and I think this is his best film yet.The devil all the time is a very well crafted film with beautiful shots riddled throughout. It is technically great. The editing to keep each story flowing in a way that is engaging and makes sense is fantastic. The cinematography is amazing, I love the long takes, I love the wide shots, I love every single shot in this film, it's stunning.I love the story being told, on the surface it's about the first eighteen years of Arvin Russell's life. But it's more than that, it's about religion, it's about family, it's about growing up, it's about grief and it's about manipulation, how people can be manipulated and how people can manipulate. Everyone in this story is manipulative at some point or another, some more blatantly than others. Everyone is manipulative except for Arvin, his step-sister Charlotte and his grandparents. Arvins dad Willard manipulates Arvin into religion and Preston Teagardin manipulates girls into sleeping with him. But most of all, everyone in the story is manipulated by God, more specifically religion, except for Arvin. People go to extreme lengths to please God and show God that they are worthy. Growing up in a christian family I can confirm that people do go to extreme lengths to do what they believe they must do. No one around me has ever done anything so severe, but it happens nonetheless. I should add I don't think this film is derogatory to religion or christianity, I think it is just a interesting way to tell this story and present the themes at the same time. I don't want this review to drag on for too long but the themes of this film are very complex and interesting, I could talk for a long time about them.The characters are complex and feel like real people. They are, like the rest of the film, very well written and interesting but most of all they are all entertaining to watch. I loved getting to see so many different perspectives on different situations, it gave the audience an understanding of the people we consider bad, this rarely happens and I am always very glad when it does.I have but one kind of big complaint about this film and honestly I don't know it matters all that much. I think this story is impossible to tell without a narrator, but unnecessary narration is something that really bugs me. It was used well most of the time, but when the narrator tells the audience exactly what certain characters are thinking it annoys me. I mentioned I don't know if this criticism matters very much. This is simply because I don't think the film would have improved without the narrator saying what characters thought. I think it would have bugged me less but made for a worse overall experience. I have a few smaller issues as well, there was one flashback that was very unnecessary and was only used to remind the audience about what happened earlier. There were a few moments where the CGI was distracting. And the pie that was left at the Russell family's doorstep had no note or anything saying who sent it, obviously this is extremely minor, just a little thing that irked me.Finally I'd like to acknowledge the action scenes. All of them are remarkable and particularly intense. Arvin's encounter with Preston is one of the more intense scenes I've watched for a while. During these scenes I am really worried about the characters involved. They were excellently executed and I was impressed by them.Overall I loved the devil all the time and recommend it to everyone. So far it is my second favourite film of 2020 only topped by Charlie Kaufman's I'm thinking of ending things, a near perfect movie in my opinion. I'll be surprised if anything is better than that film by the end of the year."
450,"The actors and characters in this small town USA story really bring this film to life, love the setting, really a thought provoking film/book that left me with a few things to think about, touches on a few subjects that may hit very close to home, I.e, faith, religion, justice, manipulation. This film really doesn't hold back in those respects and I really enjoyed just sinking into this film and not thinking too much about it, I just allowed the film to happen, although, at times it's structure is at first confusing, it isn't a hard film to follow at all and I was really engrossed by the story which I personally thoroughly enjoyed"
451,"The performers/casts are super heavy in acting and they portray their characters more especially Tom Holland because he is different from the Spiderman I met who he played here the more I can see how good he is acting but his character here as Arvin in ""The Devil All the Time"""
452,"A great film comes along now and then like this one which blows you away but is very dark and very bleak and leaves you heaving a sigh of relief and contemplating just what you have seen as the end credits are rolling.The cast are all excellent but special mention must go to Tom Holland who is very very good. The cinematography is spectacular in framing everything just right with the pace and direction spot on too with nothing too flashy which keeps the tone of the film consistent.It is engrossing and captivating for the entire run time and it is not a short film so that is to it's credit also as well as the writers.
I thought the soundtrack was great too plenty good country ditties to nod along to whilst the carnage unfolds.To sum up, i would recommend it, i enjoyed it and it will no doubt linger in my mind for a few days to go."
453,Builds slow and steadylike. . . good performances all around. All credible characters. You get to see the underbelly of the small town biblebilly grift playing out. A nice way to pass 2.5 hours with several unsavory characters that keeps ya wondering where it all will go . . . Well done. I recommend it.
454,"""The Devil All the Time,"" (2020). Directed by Antonio Campos. Written by Antonio Campos (screenplay) and Paulo Campos and others. Starring Donald Ray Pollock as the narrator, Bill Skarsgard, Tom Holland (Arvin), and Robert Pattinson as Rev. Teagardin. As this film opens, the viewer is directed to a map of a part of West Virginia, the area around Nitro. Immediately we sense that the setting for TDATT is an impoverished area whose inhabitants are denizens of a culturally backward class of Anglo people. A narrator makes an appearance and introduces us to and informs us about the characters in this story in much the same way that Chaucer uses the Prologue of his Canterbury Tales to setup the structure of his verse. In TDATT, the narrator gives us glimpses into the narcissistic/supply paradigm through various vignettes or tales such as The Friar's Tale, featuring a specific character or characters. The predatory instinct of the narcissistic personality type is revealed through cunning and lethal imagery, both psychological and physical. Religion and prayer are tools in the community arsenal used to guide the pilgrim and restore order. Both tools enable the community to rein in the terror foisted on the community by the Devil, or in this case malignant narcissists preying on the innocent. So we have an enlacement (complexio) of the prey/pray adnominadio running throughout. When Arvin, the protector of his family, is trying to figure out to restore order to his community, he contemplates what his aunt, the elder in his family, would advise him. She would tell him ""to pray on it."" So Arvin decides ""to have prayer"" with the predators. He preys on them. He stalks them. Watches them. Reveals to them that they have been unmasked. And that he will seek justice. And deliver it. So in effect, it is the men of right action who enable the rights of their people. Men who are able to use common sense and analytical powers restore order because, you know, the Devil nevers sleeps!
This is one of those very special tour-de-force movies with all the stops pulled out. Excellent in every way. Screenplay, direction, acting, art production. And most of all...a message. A message which tells us what is the meaning of prayer. I give this film 5 of 5 stars. It's on Netflix. Enjoy!"
455,I wasn't quite sure about the actors in this movie especially Tom Holland. I saw him in a blockbuster but you can never tell with those. Bbbbbbut this movie caught my attention from beginning to end! And Rob made such a good bad guy. Definitely would recommend it.
456,"This was unlike anything I've seen before. Peculiar movies like this, can quickly become too artsy, and lose the majority of the audience. I for one really enjoyed the pacing of the story, and the development of the characters. By the end of the tale I was really invested Arvin Russel, excellently displayed by Tom Holland. The ominous characters left a bad taste in my mouth, and I applaud the whole cast for their delivery.The plot jumps back and forth in the storyline, but it's still possible to follow the plot as a whole, and the jumps are used in a tasteful way to build the background of the characters. No unnecessary narration and overall just a very smooth delivery of the story. Loved it."
457,"Sometimes I just look for a movie that has not had loads of hype and decide to give it a try, I have found some fantastic movies this way and this was my latest find, great acting from all and despite the length of the movie kept me entertained throughout, liked the way the characters intertwined with each other right to the very end, not one for everyone but think if you give it a try you will not be disappointed."
458,"Great movie and great performances, altho I found some parts a bit disturbing and hard to watch. Overall it's quite different and a really good movie."
459,"Me likey!!
Great acting
Good pace
And if you pay attention to the dialogue at the start of the movie TVen every clicks into place
Best Netflix mai ie since the irishman"
460,"I'm not going to waste too much time, the movie is set between the end of the Korean War and the dawn of the Vietnam war, our protagonist (if you can call him that considering Tom Holland had top billing, didn't appear until 40 minutes in and had what felt like the least screen time in the whole film) is an orphan raised mostly by his grandparents whose protection at all costs mentality gets his life intertwined with a whole swarm of disreputable characters and a particularly nasty God fearing sinner. Tom's acting was stellar, along with Eliza Scanlen, Bill Skarsgård and Robert Pattinson shining too. The plot was intriguing but seemed to have an annoying stop-start-stop pace that may make repeat viewings feel a bit drawn out, but at the end of the day, this isn't an action film, it's a drama and with a 2hr 17min runtime, it could be far worse.
To summarise, if movies like Prisoners by Denis Villeneuve are enjoyable for you, you should give this movie a chance.
My personal opinion is that this is one I will be coming back to rewatch soon, a damn fine movie."
461,"I think this Movie would've been great, but there's a part in the middle about the Policeman's Storyline that I felt got a little bit convoluted and didn't understand very much.The Storytelling and Characterizations in the first half was excellent though, and it had some nice twists near the end. At worst it is pretty good, Human Interest Movie that could've been great.Nice to know in the End Credits that the Author of the Book the Movie was based on, Donald Ray Pollock also was the Narrator in the Movie."
462,"If you a sucker for characters doing monologues in southern accents like me then this is the film for you.
Add in interesting crazy characters, brilliant acting and good cinematography!
Definitely not for everyone though, but if you liked the trailer you would probably like this!"
463,"A story of insanity, religion, tragedy, revenge, innocence, lust, evil and triumph. These items will always with us, whatever time period we are in, unless the human collective takes a quantum leap into a more knowledgeable realm. Interestingly, the author of the novel from which this film was derived in the narrator for this."
464,"What a pleasant surprise this was. I knew nothing about this movie other that Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson were in it and I enjoyed the hell out of it.The entire cast is great, but Tom Holland and especially Robert Pattinson steal the show with some of their best work to date. This film reminded me a lot of the amazing The Place Beyond The Pines.This is one of those movies with many different plot thread that conect in the end, and so, it feels pretty aimless until the third act and I wasn't as invested in the plot threads that didn't involve Holland or Pattinson. Still, when it all does come together in the end, I was really satisfied.My biggest issue is the narration. It felt very unnecessary as most of the time it just explained things that really didn't need to be explained.Overall, this is a really damn good movie with fantastic performances. I definitely reccomend it."
465,"Hesitated to watch it at first on sunday night, but was surprised at how good the movie was. Kept me engaged and rooting for some characters; amazing acting. Def one of the must watch movies on netflix atm."
466,"This was a pretty good watch. In my opinion It's going to be a classic. Although, there were some predictable moments, I really don't have much to say in the way of negativity about this film. Lastly, I'm amazed at how well the Spiderman actor played the role in this movie. I would highly recommend watching this movie.P.s. I think the narration in this film is a nice touch!"
467,"A Film with so many Evil wrongs must have a innocent protagonist.A meticulously placed script that builds on this and towards the end you have no choice to feel the empathy.At first I thought the movies pace was slow, but it truly builds the characters for you to understand the background to the ending.Would definitely recommend."
468,Couldn't ask for a more dedicated actor who are almost all from the u.k
469,"With such a star-packed cast I was wondering where this movie would go. I've felt a strong similarity to ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" except the comedy was replaced with more thriller.Again, with such a big cast it's obvious the runtime has to be more and some people could find it a bit too much. There were a couple of moments where I lost focus and interest but for a few seconds only. Overall the movie has a good story and ""nice natural cinematography"". This movie is very different from the stuff that Netflix usually puts out and I find that a good thing.The acting is amazing, as one would except with so much potential and talent. Tom Holland was the biggest surprise to me, he did really well. You'd think after being Spiderman for so long he could only be seen as the friendly neighborhood character. I've found his performance refreshing in a good way.PS: After hearing how Pattinson didn't use a dialect/accent coach during filming was surprising. My respect for him has been growing insanely rapidly in the past few months, but Lord Almighty he could've picked a different voice 😂"
470,"The Devil all the Time is a very good movie but it's a dark one, not everyone's cup of tea. But bear with me here, it's an ensemble drama/thriller with bits of the psychological genre. It features an all star cast with so many well known actors like Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling to name a few as there's so many well known and who did amazing performances. Tom Holland reinvents himself in doing a very dark character and its probably one of his best performances.In the movie we get to follow a couple of characters, most of them are crazy in some way as they are clearly suffering from some kind of mental illness. We have Bill Skarsgård's character named Willard Russell that is clearly suffering from PTSD of what he witnessed in WW2 and his son that is played by Tom Holland.
Other than that there are multiple of main and side characters that is played by Harry Melling, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Jason Clarke and lots of other interesting characters.The production design is great, but the cinematography is the best part. There's some parts with the writing and storytelling that isn't really the best that it could be but I didn't mind it because of the great and believable acting plus the immersion makes. The story is messy at times but it fits the atmosphere of the movie and it's messy mostly because of all the characters, it could have easily been 30 minutes longer to really flesh out the characters. The usage of a narrator for me has both positives and negatives but I felt it was needed in the first act but not the second act. The movie is well directed, Antonio Campos did a great job."
471,"The movie revolves around Arvin who grew up with a traumatic past, and is surrounded by people blinded by darkness and/or religious delusions. Two of these delusional people are his father and his sister's biological father. His sister's biological father, a preacher, believed that God can cure his fears. He dumps a jar full of spiders on his head, and later stab his wife in the neck with a screwdriver. Again, he believed he can raise her from the dead. Similarly, Arvin's father is also a religious man who believed in God and the power of prayer. He killed Arvin's dog for sacrifice and abuse his son into praying intensely. Since prayers and the animal sacrifice did not cure his wife of cancer, he committed suicide.As an orphan, Arvin was later adopted. And like his father, he is violent and protective of his family. He brutally inflicts physical harm to his sister's bullies. And even killed the preacher who was responsible for her pregnancy and suicide. The movie ends with him killing three more sinister people.The movie is dark due to the deaths that Arvin witness as a child; and the deaths he is responsible as an adult. It is also dark because of the vile people filled with religious delusions. I read comments by religious people who claim these vile people heard the voice of the devil, and Arvin is acting out God's judgement. I think the moral of the story is religious indoctrination and delusions rots the brain. We should be taking accountability for our misdeeds. And Arvin taught me that we should protect our family at all costs. Sometimes, self-defence and killing vile people for love are justifiable. Until you can provide factual evidence of God and the devil, there is no rational reason to justify anything with religious faith. Arvin is the least religious person in this movie."
472,It's Actually a good Movie a little paced at start that's becoz it has to link all threads to end it.. but at the end it really very good..
473,Slow Tragical sad chain story :( but very Good Last 1 our 💪
474,"The movie hasn't really got much to say except that people are hypocritical jerks but it says that in a quite beautiful and violent way. There are no real good guys and any character even remotely likeable is pretty much doomed from the start. This is a violent period piece with only a couple of likeable characters. Everyone else is battling for biggest jerk.That being said it is still a great story dealing with faith, loss and the destruction of innocence. Are you talking to God or the devil."
475,"It was so so boring. Great cast, great performances especially from RP who shone in a dark and creepy way. An interesting example of how people can think they're godly but are actually evil...but overall it was dull as dishwasher. Another example of how Netflix don't really mind if you like their films so long as you watch them."
476,Absolutely worst movie I've ever seen.Drags on w-a-y too long.It's as if David Lynch had a epiphany to try to create something worse than his normal drivel.The movie should be avoided at all costs.
477,More crap on Netflix. Man was I bored after one hour. Why people thought this was a good cast? Hope I don't see them in anymore movies. What happened to Hollywood?
478,"Not what i expected form this cast ... very boring and the acting wasn't that good
I couldn't finish the movie"
479,"Great Epic
the providence of God
coincidence n collision of fate
fierce of violence
weird
absurdity
absence of God
disgusting ugly world
cynical writingThat is what this movie is most attractive
all time evil is here"
480,"Another dead Netflix supermarket movie.
Yeah, I got a little entertained like eating a lot of candy regretting it later.
Like in most NF produced movies, there is no reason for this movie. No real tension.. Though casted with some ok actors, they all seem to be casted with no personality.. They are, for most of the characters, casted with a pretentious subtlety, that after watching 3 NF movies in a row with the same supermarket product, makes you promise yourself not see another NF produced movie again... But... it's like with Candy....
I really hope at some point NF, and their customers, will get so bored watching their own productions, that they will invest more in quality.."
481,Great adaption of the book. Tom hollands acting is excellent
482,"This truly shows all the actors great great talent but Holland and Patterson are amazing doing the decent into darkness and despair,And Eliza Scanlen shows why she is going to be a star.
This worth investing 2 hours watching on NetflixAlthough the excess of narration is a bit insulting to the viewers."
483,"It's a film that could not be made if it portrayed a different religion. Because it's Christians, the south, the poor, it's a film filled with Hollywood tropes and narratives. The film has major actors to broaden it's reach. Don't pay to watch it, apparently the agenda of this film is to get it viewed by the masses."
484,"The acting is really but wasted in every actor that appears. Some characters are weird and with no depth so you just start to not carry about any of them. I was waiting for some great shoking reveal, but nothing really stands out. It's a shame because it looked like a good thriller, But ends up with no message to the audience and a waste of time. Also I wanted more of Bill..."
485,"With an all-star cast, the acting is all terrific, especially by Tom Holland, who gives a dominant performance as Arvin Russell. It's great to see Tom in these types of films other than Spider-Man. Pattinson is again terrific, on a streak with great roles in great films, and Skarsgard is great as Arvin's war scared father. The story is good, based off a book. The intertwining stories fold in well on each other, and the narration is good as well. The cinematography as well is very good, with nice shots of the West Virginian woods, and the golden sunlight setting. It makes you feel like you are inside the forest with the characters.
However, the film is slow paced and takes a while to kick in. It's about 15 minutes long in my opinion. Towards the end, the narration starts to get into obvious exposition, which I thought could've been done differently.
Nonetheless, the film is another Netflix production that you can add to your list for a dive."
486,"Very well filmed, very well acted, great music score, all for the hatred of God. You end up being less than when you started by watching a film like this. The Devil all the time, indeed. The stories build hope for the express purpose of slaughtering it on the floor kicking and scraping. The story largely works on making the Christian faith out to be evil itself, I think that's a clear message here.I would give it a 8 or 9 for overall quality but I'm conflicted because it has an agenda that's disgusting.I see a lot of people praising this film. I try to be open minded but I can't get into the head of someone who would enjoy stories like these. I like movies like No Country For Old men or There Will Be Blood. But this movie is not at all like those films."
487,Casting looked great and other reviews made me think this maybe a great movie.Disappointed as potentially could have been better as didn't really feel a connection to the main cast and the acting was decent but flat.Overall not great but others may enjoy.
488,"You'll enjoy this mocie as well. It may not be so epical, but definitely one of the best titels on Netflix. It's a shame that it have currently an average score of 7,2 while at the same time Ratched has 7,6.
The Devil All the time deserves strong 8.
Interesting characters, great photos, non linearity and an author of the book on which screenplay was based as lecteur ;-)"
489,"For what this movie set out to do, it did it in flying colors. You know what the title of this movie is, so go in expecting that things will get heavy, messy, and violent.The first half of the movie is slow, but it's not void of scenarios that sticks to you. This movie won't try to tell some grand message, and it's not supposed to. It documents a series of events, and presents a cast of characters who are extremely well acted and convincing.Those who try to look for meaning into this film will either get disappointed as the message is pretty grim, or simply get offended. If you can't remember a movie that offends you, this movie is definitely worth a watch."
490,"Good plot, great cast, great acting, a confident director knowing what he was doing, great soundtrack, raw, violent, multidimensional and good edition.The second act is probably weaker than the first and the third (to confirm on a second view), but, overall, a very good thriller and an excellent story.Would love to see some love for Holland and Pattinson, during the awards season, for their great performances."
491,"If u wanna see serious tom Holland never miss this movie, he has a very good acting in this movie
And patinson awesome playing. Now he is one of the important actor in Hollywood"
492,"This movie itself is really solid, no complaints about any acting or the soundtrack or anything, it's intriguing and it's executed really well. I said in my title that it reminds me of a Tarantino film. How so? Well to start, this story focuses heavily on multiple different stories. There's 5 different plot lines that get followed throughout the story, and they kind of jump back and forth between the timelines a bit to start. Kind of confusing in the timelines, but wraps up nice and linear, similar to Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction. The old timely dialogue and setting helps perfectly capture a specific point in time but with a modern twist to it, much like Django or once upon a time in Hollywood. And good god, the use of violence in this movie is really good. The violence happens throughout, and has different levels of gore and shock to them, again, much like a Tarantino film. Sure the film shows a lot of things similar to how Tarantino builds the world in which the story is set in, but the actual tone itself is nothing like a Tarantino film. This is where I will compare it to the witch.This movie is uncomfortable to watch, it's all about how people are trying to live out these religious lives and how ultimately their choices lead them to tragedy. Ironically, the only person who is not dead by the end of the film is the one character who does not act religious whatsoever.
Same sort of thing with the witch. You are watching, feeling uneasy, then at the end all of the people who followed their faith and try to act like good people instead of just being good people, end up dead. It's about how bad comes out of good and vice versa.Overall I'd say the movie is really good. It wraps up nicely, I would say the first 45 minutes are the world building so you can understand how they all connect as the rest of the plot goes on and concludes itself. Masterfully put together, acting was good, shock value varies and is used appropriately, the characters often show both their good and bad side so there's a lot of moral gray, but simultaneously the outcome stays the same for most characters. Only issue I'd say is the movie near the end is a TAD bit too predictable, I often found myself being able to guess what was about to happen. Though I guess that does mean that the movie did a good job and keeping me interested the whole way through."
493,"Adding this to my list of favorite movies this year. Very dark movie that does a good job of conveying all characters at a point in time. Wonderful acting as usual from the stars and an exciting plot that never gets boring. In the end of it all, it feels so satisfying to watch and makes me appreciate this movie than I anticipated. Good job Netflix 👌🏾"
494,"Men....Tom Holland is growing into one of the best actors of this new decade. The ""kid"" is a natural.
Kudos to Robert Pattinson. He's no longer a teenage vampire for sure. He has grown a lot on the past couple years.
And Bill Skarsgård, very good performance.
A must see, and get off the cellphone during the movie. Appreciate all the minutes."
495,"Lots of great actors.
Watched it to the end but it was an effort"
496,"Best thing I've watched on Netflix in a while.
Wish they would make more originals as good as this!"
497,"Netflix is capable of making quality content which can easily bury its competitors but when it comes to making a movie with a good storyline they don't take risks with rookie actors but summon highly acclaimed actors,this movie is an example of that. The actors are at their finest in the movie but a well written story can be treated fairly by rookie actors as well. It's very apparent for netflix when it comes to a movie with a good storyline, rookie actors are inevitably to be overlooked."
498,This is one of the best Movies of Year 2020. Every character has played its role with perfection. The Best Tom Holland performance so far. I especially liked the role of Harry Melling as ROY LAFERTY. He has nailed his role with great acting skill. This movie is nowhere below 8/10.
499,"I was pretty excited for the devil all the time and I must I wasn't disappointed . The acting was a 10/10 from Bill Skarsgard to Robert Pattinson to Tom Holand and yes Tom Holland's acting was simply stunning . There were things though that the movie was lacking . Firstly , the tension . I wasn't anxious while watching and I didn't care that much for the characters (because everyone was a psycho) . Secondly, the movie is a bit too long and sometimes boring so I think the ideal runtime should be between 1.45-1.55 . But the movie ties the characters so nicely . In the end you understand everyone is connected somehow with someone else . I must say I went in with wrong expectations . I thought it will have more action and less drama . But I gave this a 7 because the technical aspects of the movie are perfect ."
500,"Its really a perfect movie all around .
the story is fresh ,so you cant figure how things goes.
acting is so good , it really been a while since i saw something this good ."
501,"Have some patience, it's completely worth it. Take an intermission if needed but keep watching, it unfolds in such a way that during the second half it's hard not to look away. Imagery was excellent with lots of golden hues, 35mm, acting felt very authentic. Lots of familiar faces. May have to watch something lighter afterwards as it is deeply profound and thought provoking."
502,"If you consider almost everyone is the film is definitely not from the south, they certainly play the part and accent well. I gauge a good movie by the amount of times I reach for my phone. I didn't feel compelled to once during this film. Excellent job to everyone who made The Devil All the Time."
503,"This film gave me an education about the good folks WVA. I believe parts of the state have people living today just like the good folks in the film. Good cast and Tom did a great job in the role. Oh yes, I won't be visiting WVA anytime soon."
504,"The beginning feels like it is going nowhere, but it does! This was a pleasant ride from start to finish, some funny one-liners and the horror elements were well distributed through it!"
505,The cast is the best with this movie - great all around but I really liked Harry Mellings portrait of a lunatic reverend. Funny to see two ex-Harry Potter actors doing something like this!! I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. Religion truly is a source of evil sometimes.
506,"Fine acting. Good storytelling. Fine direction.
It was a Better than average movie but it was just a little boring, a little cliché but that's most of what's wrong with it."
507,"A depressing plunge into post-war backwoods territory, 'The Devil All the Time' produces a grim web from various plot threads, but that web is sometimes too fragile to hold its weighty themes.It's a film littered with strong performances, but the narrative is bit too unfocused for the first hour; a result of its structure and characters, jumping between different people in different time periods. There's almost too much story trying to be crammed into its 130-minute runtime. Fortunately these characters begin to converge soon enough with some satisfying developments.This crime drama has dark subject matter throughout, tackling all sorts of themes such as religion, violence, corruption, and abuse. The characters find themselves entangled in these themes, reflecting the setting and time frame, and the film doesn't shy away from brutality. Though, thankfully, there's nothing gratuitous.Overall, 'The Devil All the Time' might not be as emotionally powerful as its content deserves, but a talented cast keep you engaged in the characters' gloomy lives right up until the end.7/10"
508,Isn't it strange how people meet and how the course of their life can and will change yours. The acting throughout was fantastic. I hated some characters and felt for others. A lot to take in and might need a rewatch to catch everything but I never felt lost through the film. A good crime thriller that kept me entertained throughout. Would recommend!
509,"I just attempted to watch this movie because of all the hype and honestly I was bored the whole time. It was a bunch of random horrible people doing their random horrible things and.....well thats about it. I couldn't even get through the whole movie because it felt like there was no suspense or plot to it at all, and it was ridiculously long. The acting was good but overshadowed by the melancholy atmosphere. There was literally no point to this movie. It's true when they say it's depressing and not for everyone, it certainly wasn't for me."

511,"Even with a rope, it might not be possible to tie the cores of the story of this Netflix adaptation as well as the script is capable of doing it.Based on a book of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, directed by the semi-Brazilian director, Antonio Campos, and with big names in the cast, The Devill All The Time impresses us with the balance between the linearity and the cyclical flow of his sordid suspense.With the mix of religious fanaticism and hedonism at the center of the work, the story unfolds with a disturbing series of terrible choices and their consequences with superior characteristics.Involving wars waged between men and with God Himself, regardless of religion or lack of it, as seen in one of the characters in the film, the lustful pleasure or the feeling of satisfaction by the dogmatic rigidity of a higher belief form clearly opposite parallels, but with an inevitable encounter.In the script, a soldier returns home, tormented by the terrors of war. In a certain restaurant, he finds the love of his life in a waitress who is asked for the pleas of the needy. In the same place, an adventurous and perfectionist photographer is faced with another passionate and seductive waitress attracting her with his harmony.One will lose his wife to a cancer after brutal supplications to God, with the right to sacrifice and abuse, begging him to make it disappear, and the other will start a wave of voyeurism linked to brutal murders for many and many years.As a result of one of these meetings, we have the figure of the young boy abused by his father's flawed, fervent and short-lived religiosity.At the same time, we have the orphan woman who gives herself over to the worship of an exaggerated and God-fearing pastor. In yet another unpretentious encounter between religious, we have insanity and disbelief arising from an excess of belief leading to murder and another orphaned girl, as in her own mother's cycle.Against these two children, there is the growth of a pure relationship between foster siblings, soon affected by a further pastor who emerges ahead of their falsehood and seduction.In this production, at all times, we are introduced to chance's destiny and active choices about its actions and events. In any case, deciding to act or being coerced to such an act, there is not a single ""saint"" or innocent person who is not a victim of his own actions in any region where the two American cities set in the work meet.Not even the poor victim of a suicide that was not supposed to happen can keep that title for a long time. The actions that led her to this end were not only accepted, but the rope itself was literally suspended and tied around its neck by its own hands.With fleeting joys and extensive disturbances throughout the plot, with virtually no rest for such distress inflicted on its protagonists and supporting actors, the performances of his cast can really make you believe that so much suffering or apathy towards him is really being felt by everyone. - Maybe not so much for Robert Pattinson's acting that he doesn't seem to know very well the role he's been playing until the last moments.At the end of the work, another meeting between the cyclical extremes of the work. Two men embittered by the loss of their respective sisters. No innocent, but one more malicious than the other, is reunited in the first place where they were connected in their lives. This time, for the same motivation, but with intensely different purposes.With one coming to kill and the other trying to just live, doing everything in his power to do so, yet another set of personal choices and attitudes is connected in this set of stories in which, apparently, there is no connection, and certainly not there is no benefit.A growing energy that does not draw a straight line, the film ties the pieces of a puzzle together in a single line forming a very well-assembled circle, connecting each piece in a way that they meet in the most fierce and imperceptible way possible.Murdering Manichaeism and presenting us with a vision purely based on the pleasure and flaws of his fanaticism, whether worldly or religious, in none of them in the plot of The Devill All The Time, any of his characters can have a seal of ""good person"" ""Assigned to you in any of your days."
512,"A well directed and well acted Netflix production. Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson are outstanding in their roles. Don't let that draw you in The story itself is twisted and sadistic analysis of religion in the lives of an ensemble of characters. Once you realize the nature of the film, you can predict all the devilish turns it will make."
513,I'd never thought mocking white hillbilly Christianity was a thing until now lol. The writer and director of this movie are the mentally unstable ones for making this trashy ass movie. A complete waste of time watching and no I'm not a Christian either.
514,"It isn't good. I am writing this an hour and 40 minutes in just still lost on ""why was this movie written"" and ""why are we supposed to watch it/care?"" Yet I am still watching. So I guess that speaks to the actors."
515,The Terrible movie all the time!!! Boring story...hopeless.
516,"You can tell from the opening seconds of this film that it desperately wants to be taken seriously. Any time a film has an interconnected narrative that time jumps without a word, just screams ""take me seriously!!"" But I just couldn't.First of all, Robert Pattinson's accent should have been given its own billing in the credits, because it was a stand-alone force in the film by itself. Not in a good way.Everyone is just so ""bad"" all the time in this film it just becomes ludicrous and unbelievable. No, in history there never has been a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" serial killer team where one is a necrophiliac, and the other is a pretty girl who acts as ""bait"". Every time I saw them on screen I just rolled my eyes.Looking back, I still don't completely understand the broken timeline, and the inclusion of a narrator highlights the fact that how the story was told was to its detriment, because a narrator had to be included solely to help the audience understand what was happening (even worse, when a narrator tells you what a character is thinking, it's a failure in the narrative itself, as a film should never have to do that for you to ""get it"").It's a mostly boring and predictable ride that takes itself way too seriously, and I gained nothing from seeing it (other than now being very nervous about Pattinson's take on Batman)."
517,"It's very boring
I thought it's would be some kind of horror movie"
518,By far the weirdest movie I've watched but very interesting. Love it
519,"This is the classic example of critics hate it, audiences love it. The movie is not perfect but is waaaaaay better than, let's say Cuties, most marvel superheroes movies, the new Stars War trilogy and new Mulan. Let that sink in."
520,"Great movie, amazing acting! Please Netflix, continue like this... :)"
521,"Well not all over, as the movie states right at the beginning, we do have a certain area that is being the center of it. Even if that area or rather the cities themselves do not exist. But that is of course for the purpose of the movie and to be as vague as possible as to people not being offended ... like if their town/village name was mentioned.Acting wise this is amazing. The script is also quite something. Having multiple characters, many timelines (or rather periods) and so much more to keep track of, this does warrant multiple views. Even so, it is a fine watch, with extreme violence and many other disturbing things to boost. Many have stated that they haven't seen Tom Holland like this, and I would agree Spiderman probably would not approve of some of the things he does here. Then again, Spidey would have a different set of attributes and possibilities.That aside, there are so many great actors in this, you may get dizzy after you watch it the first time! Really good stuff, if you are not too squeamish ..."
522,"I really enjoyed (in lack of a better word) this one.
Great acting all the way with Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsgård being at their pinnacle.A very simple but well written crime story that depicts how wrong religion can go."
523,Finally a really good movie and a true masterpiece. Really loved the way this story is weaven together and how everything adds up and interrelated. Very nicely paced and perfect scenes. A true masterclass.
524,"To be completely honest, I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. Obviously I had issues but it doesn't take too much away from what the film did well. An issue I had with the film is the pacing. Certain plot points in the movie feel rushed as if it was a check in the box and not something the Director cared a lot about it. It was a lot worse in the first 45 minutes because everything happens so fast that it's hard to care about some of these characters. Once Tom Holland shows up though, the film gets drastically better. Tom Holland does an excellent job here and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance. This is easily his best performance to date. This is the same for Bill Skarsgård. I love him as Pennywise in IT but I found his performance here to be much more engaging. Robert Pattinson is excellent as always and he did a really good southern accent here. This is definitely a Top 5 performance from him but not my personal favorite. Everyone else here did a good job but it was harder to care about their characters than Holland, Skarsgård, and Pattinson. Some people might be put off by the narration but I didn't mind it because it was narrated by the author of the book that this film is based on. It gave the film a book like feeling which worked for me. The directing by Antonio Campos is pretty great. He definitely has a great visual style and voice here and he is great at showing these themes of religious extremism and trauma. The cinematography and score also really added to the experience here too. Go check this out on Netflix if you want but beware of it's very dark themes and violence."
525,This movie kept me watching but only at the ending I was on the edge of my seat. It just lacked something in the story overall. I loved the way it was filmed and the actors were say the least talented!
526,"""Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
The Devil always builds a chapel there;
And 'twill be found, upon examination,
The latter has the largest congregation."" Daniel Defoe, The True Born EnglishmanThe devil is indeed omnipresent in Antonio Campos' The Devil All the Time, an Appalachian noir a bit of Coen brothers with much James Dickey. Not that there is even a smidge of humor; it's just that the Coens and Campos are deft at showing local West Virginia and Southern Ohio to be murderously folksy, a little like the devil in Prada allure.With a cast that seemed to be consciously gleaned from franchises like Spiderman (Tom Holland as Arvin) and Twilight (Rob Pattinson as Preston Teagarden), to name a couple, adds to the lost innocence motif from rape and murder that defile the pristine backwoods of those beautiful states. It is as if the devil can't be stopped until every malefactor experiences the vengeance of the Lord.The instrument of retribution is mostly Arvin, whose father, Willard (Bill Skarsgard) carries terrifying images from Vietnam given to his son in the form of crucifixion obsession that is more hell bound than heaven. The scourge of that war and its repentance is an undercurrent throughout this gothic thriller. While predatory preacher Teagarden is targeted for penance after his first seduction, itinerant married couple Henderson (Jason Clarke and Riley Keough) feed off the photos they take of young men they murder for the sake of sadism.Which is to say murder is the operative punisher, a pattern that contradicts the Bible thumping righteousness of the church service never seeming to be truly Christian anyway. No real goodness, except maybe the love of a baby or a grandma, resides in these dense woods, soothed by a fine selection of popular hillbilly ballads punctuating perfectly the lamentable lack of moral compass.If any weakness manifests in this bleak thriller, it would be the relentless accumulation of deaths and the desperate connections of people who are driven by amorality and ignorance. Even urbanized moviegoers might balk-let there be more forgiveness, let there be more light. But, hey, that's film noir whether it's Chicago; Knockemstiff, Ohio; or Coal Creek, West Virginia."
527,"Antonio Campos' THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME is the newest star-studded Netflix Original and the kind of film we don't get to see often nowadays.Campos tells a dark and dramatic saga set in rural West Virginia and Ohio in the 1950s and 60s. Pretty much all of the performances are great and the narrative balances the characters' relations nicely and never looses sight of the bigger picture, even if the first act might seem a little overblown and it certainly takes some time until Tom Holland's protagonist even appears on screen.My main problem with the film - and that's somehow strange to say - was its gruesome and bleak tone. I'm usually all for dark dramas, but basically every character here is morally corrupt and acts reprehensible to an extent, where it can become implausible. The one-dimensionality of most characters, who are solely defined by being hypocrites, rapists, murderers or psychopaths, and the excessive use of voice-over certainly add to this overall impression.I would ultimately suggest watching THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME because of its obvious merits. But the film's goal of depicting a vicious circle of violence cannot avoid the impression of being an end in itself."
528,Yes great actors but they portray Christians as a bunch of hypocrites and the worst kind of people. I go to church every Sunday and these are not the people that I see at church that do these heinous things and this is not how my parents behaved either who lived through the setting of this movie
529,"It looked good. Production values and cinemaphotgraphy very high. After twenty minutes I gave up, no story outline, no point, lost interest. thumbs down."
530,"I wouldn't recommend this as it wasn't pleasant to watch and doesn't particularly entertain.I don't know if the writer/narrator was trying to make any sort of point but it's full of religious weirdos spouting religious claptrap and the rest of the dialogue is very weird too.There are no redeeming features of any of the characters in it so it was difficult to care. I'm glad most of the evil ones got their comeuppance in the end but it would have been even better if an atom bomb had been dropped on them all, the writer included. I hope the writer never writes anything else."
531,"The Devil All the Time is a well directed, acted and shot movie. But it wasn't the movie I expected it to be. I thought I would see a film along the lines of Lawless (2012), as the movies appeared to be similar. While this film is wonderfully made, it is, so........boring. I found myself drifting off around half-way through. The pacing drags, and at times it can be difficult to follow. The plot bounces around, and it isn't until about 30 minuets or so from the ending, the film begins to pick up pace.
The cast is great, every single actors brings their all to the table, with the stand out being Tom Holland, even though he is barely even in the film. Robert Pattinson,is also brilliant here, with a very convincing accent, but he is underused and doesn't appear until far into the movie.
This film will appeal to a certain viewer, but I found it to drag at places,and found the plot to be boring and uninteresting.
4/10"
532,The plot of the movie is very dark and so it's not fo everyone the subject it's controversial but it's the truth and the way this movie does it is amazing the acting was on point with everyone who participated in the movie but props to Pattinson what a legend it's time for him to break records.
533,"Overall, a pretty good original movie. First 45 min was slower than it needed to be. The progression of the plot was fairly predictable. However, the acting by everybody, particularly Pattinson, was top notch. After the pace picks up, the storyline is engaging with a nice, original, yet simple interweaving narrative. If you're anticipating a best picture drama/thriller, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a slow burn with unique storytelling, you'll enjoy. 7.5"
534,"I was excited for The Devil All The Time because I like Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Sebastian Stan. However, I don't watch much Oscar bait.The cast was great mainly Holland and Pattinson but they don't show up for awhile. Holland will always be known as Spider-Man but he should continue playing dark characters. His character is a tough guy protecting his loved ones. Pattinson's character is a charming, sleazy preacher. He'll kill it as Batman next year!The film is slow mainly the first half. Yes, it meanders sometimes. Donald Ray Pollock, the book's author narrates sometimes. His narration is fine but I don't think it's essential.The film is grim so you won't feel happy. It's really violent so a lot of people will feel disturbed. I think most people will see it only once."
535,Someone let Tom Holland bury the dog or else he'll kill all of west Virginia
536,"... now reaching for the paracetamol.Bible belt America, serial killer and cousins in love, though thankfully not a banjo in sight.Save your time, save yourself and avoid."
537,"Love Tom Holland, and some of the other actors, but just couldn't get into the story.
Felt slow and too long. Wouldn't recommend😕"
538,"The Devil All the Time often feels like a parody of a southern-gothic epic. The plotting & performances are deeply engaging, almost masking how shallow the themes & morals are; a scene of brooding violence & cynicism will play out with more than enough surface-y cinematic competence to trick you in the moment of its ""brilliance"", but once it's over you realize nothing of substance actually happened. It's a movie that desperately wants to be taken seriously, but all-but falls apart when held to that standard."
539,"This is a movie where every person is irredeemably awful. A LOT of bad things happen and that's basically the movie. Surprised at the high ratings.
While I agree that it's well acted and well made, it's completely over the top in its depiction of the evilness of man and just pummels you with violence and death, with no counterbalance."
540,"The Devil All The Time takes its time to introduce its characters however once all said characters are introduced, they all tie together beautifully like a Quentin Tarantino movie."
541,"I cannot think of a reason anyone would enjoy The Devil All the Time. It has a great ensemble cast, and it's fun to see Tom Holland in a darker role, and Pattison is always good, but the script is so terrible that there's nothing the actors can do if their characters and motivations are utterly uninteresting. Maybe people like that it's a dark movie for the sake of being dark? It certainly doesn't shy away from violence, which I don't mind at all, but the fact that it's violent doesn't make the movie good in and of itself. There are so many problems with this film, but I don't want to spend more time thinking about this dreadful film than I have to, so I'll be brief. The biggest problem: the film is extremely dull and tedious. The characters are even worse than one-dimensional caricatures; they actually have no dimensions, no reason to engage with them or care about their journey. The violence serves no purpose, the characters don't have to wrestle with anything psychologically, and deaths have no consequence to anything that happens - they happen and then we move along as though they never happened. Campos clearly wanted to make this a story about Christianity gone awry, but when there is no hint at any character psychology and it's obvious the characters feel no inkling of moral misgiving about killing people, that message is worthless. The voiceover narration is terrible, adding nothing to the film and heavy handedly stating points that a competent filmmaker would show subtly in character actions. The nonlinear storytelling adds nothing at all to the story, as the nonlinear bits are edited together when they are completely unrelated, so when we come back to a scene we saw earlier there is no new information to consider, it was merely a pointless diversion. The dialogue is laughable, with very few conversations that could plausibly have taken place between real, normal people. I will say that the church scene between Holland and Pattinson was fun, though again it ended in the same silly, meaningless violence the movie is filled with. I also like the idea of Holland standing up for his sister, though the sharp dichotomy between the confidence of the boys by the school and then their fear and lack of fight later is a bit ridiculous. There are plenty of technical issues and frustrations, but more than anything this film is ruined by a terrible script devoid of thematic depth or any direction at all, which makes the film an absolute chore. I was so eager for it to end because I simply could not care less what happened to anyone in the film. I regret watching this movie as much as any I've watched all year and would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to stay away."
542,"Depravity and delusion coarse through this movie. Radical religious figures suffer punishment. Decent folks in unfortunate situations suffer punishments. Murderers suffer too. In this story, there is only pain and suffering. That, and death.I suppose the movie delves into the troubles that arise when faith morphs into fanaticism. The story also examines blasphemy, religious corruption of the highest sort. Some of these explorations appear deep and artful, but I'm not so sure. After doing some exploration of my own, I could not find any clear messages, lessons, or meaningful conclusions. As far as I could tell, the religion-laced intertwined tales do nothing more than present brutality and misery for the sake of... entertainment? This is no wise sermon. It's unpleasantness for unpleasantness' sake.Ultimately, the move suffers from its overstuffed plot. The effort put into establishing multiple characters whose fates eventually intersect years down the road is all for naught. The moment when the characters crash into each other is meant to serve as the ultimate payoff, but since not enough time is given to the supporting subplots, the climax feels a little undercooked.There are times during the movie when I believed I understood the meaning, when I felt I grasped when the writer had in mind. But that feeling always faded away, and the messages only became murkier."
543,"This movie was a disappointment for me. There definitely was a great cast of actors for the film and they did a fine job acting but the actual story was not for me.A see a lot of comments about this being a Tarantino-like film but I totally disagree. Tarantino films are entertaining and gripping. This film is neither of those.The story is dark, morbid and senseless. The film was very slow and dialogue moved slowly.Upon the ending of the film I was left unsatisfied and also with a feeling of dread. This is not a feel good movie but it wasn't entertaining either so it wasn't for me."
544,Story was predictable. Slow and boring. Good acting (sorta). All white cast. Seriously was boring.
545,The story doesn't know what it wants to be. This film is all over the place. It is ambitious but lacks depth. It wants to have meaning through imitation and lacks any real meaning. Over-baked and over-puffed nothingness.
546,"What was the goal of this movie ?
-showing accurately how americans lived in the 50's
-to ridicule people that believe in christianism
-or maybe just showing weird and disturbing things leaving you with a disgusted feeling
I'll go for the last and wished i could erase what i saw from my memory.
Although, I can't criticise tom holland performance, he really carried this movie"
547,Some of the worst acting I've ever seen. You can tell none of these actors are southern and bad story.
548,"I just kept waiting for one of the story lines to grab my interest. Forty five minutes in I tell my self well there is just a lot of set up - this is okay - I like the back stories .... with 15 minutes left ... I was still waiting for something to grab my interest. I have been anticipating this movie but was just not impressed. All the actors and actresses played their characters well - I especially enjoy Holland, Pattinson, Stan, and ANY Skarsgård LOL I hope you enjoy it more. Just not for me"
549,"This movie was sickening. I can handle a phycological thriller. This was beyond that. I was disturbing (and totally unrealistic, by the way) from the beginning. I kept watching it, due to the stars that were in it. I thought it had to get better.It didn't. Revolting and depraved are the only ways to describe it. With nothing redeeming (that I was searching for). I wanted a character to believe in/like. Someone to root for, or hope prevails. No such character exists in this movie.I have no idea why someone would watch this till the end.Oddly enough, I didn't think there was something that would upset me this much. Yet, here I am."
550,People like this movie because they are told too like it and if you dislike it you're trying to play devils advocate. This movie was a mess. The timeline and way to many stories going on at one time. Acting is the only thing good but everything else is a mess
551,"This movie has a ""life comes full circle"" story line. Although, the focus was death, not life. The movie showcased several sad, hopeless lives that culminate in death. There was an overtly religious tone that portrayed godless churches and preachers who preyed on the needy rather than praying for them. It was a sad movie without clear direction. The message may have been lost on me and seemed to only want to convey that sadness, violence and death is genetic and follows families for generations.Tom Holland's performance saves this film and makes it worth watching. Perfect casting for his character. He was excellent! Better than average filmmaking from Netflix. With a few tweaks this movie could have been much better."
552,"I'll confess, bad accents ruin movies for me. Poshos doing working class, Americans being Brits, and Brits being Americans. So with this movie I found myself getting drawn away from the action and wincing as the Brits accents criss crossed the Atlantic. Added to that, I really didn't care about the characters, none of which were developed. It is definitely worth seeing, as we are short on good movies in a Covid world, and this is just about a good movie"
553,"The Devil All the Time is a film I've been looking forward to ever since it was announced. One of the producers is Jake Gyllenhaal, the director is Antonio Campos, as well as that impressive cast was easily enough for me to have it amongst my most anticipated films. Also, the book it's based on happens to be highly appreciated too, and sure sounded like something I would like. Now having recently seen season one in particular of True Detective, even more so. Turns out I was so right in expecting a strong movie. The Devil All the Time talks very fascinatingly about topics which rule America, and much of the world in general. Degeneracy, reversing of morals, mass trauma, dysfunctional families, people going utterly mad in a world they cannot understand, pedophilia, etc. The theme of religion was tackled interestingly as well. I'm not even quite sure if the film made a statement about Christianity or if it simply showed what happens to folks when they misinterpret, obsess over, or purposefully impose their will on it. I'll definitely revisit The Devil All the Time to understand more clearly what its stance is. To make it short, this is an excellent dramatic thriller which thoroughly feels set in its time, is beautifully shot on film, offers an amazing cast full of many of my favourite actors, is not afraid to take chances, has an odd yet well-executed structure, and is a piece of filmmaking that'll leave you wondering when the credits roll. And I am sure it's supposed to be just that way. Life often is a mess because the world is inhabited by many people who've given in to hate, since it's all around us, therefore it can be hard not to, especially if you never had a real chance to see it in a different kind of light."
554,"It started out good but about 30 min in the family dog is ""sacrificed"" to god. That was too much for me. May be hard for animal lovers to stomach"
555,"A bit too much plot/too many plot lines, but I didn't read the book.
Fantastic acting all over, but Pattinson, as usual, steals the film."
556,"Leave your self a couple of hours, its long but not boring! Superb acting and a great film. Don't take any notice of the negative comments. It doesn't have a second that is boring!"
557,"Favorite scene withCharlotte (Haley Bennett) -
Meeting Willard at Work in the Diner and then in the alley during her Break.Helen (Mia Wasikowska) -
Her murder/death scene.Lenora (Eliza Scanlen) -
In the car with and being seduced by Preacher Teagardin.Sandy (Riley Keough) -
Being visited and questioned by her brother - who is the town's Sheriff."
558,"Yes the acting is sound, yes their accents are good, yeah they're all psychos but it's such a nothing film. Do not go out of your way to see this. Far better movies out there. 2+hrs you'd wish you had back."
559,"The best thing about this movie is the acting, hence the 4 stars. Other than that it is pointless, predictable, unoriginal and extremely pretentious.It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. If you're used to watch movies you can pretty much see every situation coming from a mile away. It is very poorly written with inaccurate dialogues for the time it portrays.The only thing I'll really remember of this film, is the feeling of me wanting it to end."
560,"The novel was good, but unfortunately, as is usually the case with movies made from novels, the movie falls far short of the book. They tried to cover too much ground in too little time. The first half is really choppy, jumping from story to story, time period to time period. The second half flows a little better, but doesn't make up for what was lost earlier. All in all, it's a disjointed mess."
561,"You expect it to build but it doesn't until the last 30 mins, and then somehow it's still rushed with almost 100 minutes before to set up."
562,All that sick stories because of a grandma couldn't keep her promise to get her son married with certain good girl. This movie also show you how damned a holy man like priest could be. Conclusion: good movie filled with a great cast and almost perfect story. Very enjoyable from the start till the end.
563,"... and it was good. At first, I couldn't follow it. And then I could. I think this movie is going to stick with me and I have no idea why. Maybe it'll come to me eventually. But something ... something kept me watching and not many movies keep me rapt like that. So watch it. If you get confused, stick with it. You'll eventually figure out who everyone is and how it all comes together. Yes, it's violent. Yes, there's a lot of disturbing images. Yes, it's raw. Maybe that's what it is. All I know is it's better than that wretched ""Ratched"" on Netflix."
564,"Not as good as the original Fargo, but an excellent job here too.
First, acting is good. Real, raw and well performed by all the cast. Second, the settings are the best. Ambiance is excellent and pretty well executed. Last, script is pretty well adapted from the book. On the other hand the pace is extremely slow and 2h 20 is too long for the story. But, overall a pretty good thriller that could have been a masterpiece including a faster pace and more action."
565,"From Watching Tom Holland and Sebastian Stan together in avengers to watching them in this movie you can't help but notice how versatile their acting has become. Every character whether the role is big or small has tremendous significance and ever actor has played their respective parts Brilliantly.GOD is indeed a sensitive subject but a true believer of God is someone who knows where to draw the line, I am a true believer in god myself but just like me, we all know that certain people around us misuse the belief of god for fulling their personal agendas and some credulous people coexist for all of it to happen. The movie revolves around the same subject so what could be the Ramifications when God is Misunderstood and Misused? This subject with a touch of Karma is what makes the storytelling of this movie very intriguing.The movie starts slowly and I honestly felt that the movie could have been trimmed a little bit. 2 Hours 20 Minutes is probably a little too long for this movie. Nevertheless, The Devil All The Time is one of the best movies that Netflix has added in recent times, and it's worth it."
566,"Though a tiny bit slow to make a circle for its third act, the movie was still successful in delivering an intriguing and exciting fast-forward story through crosspassings of its complex characters."
567,"The Devil All The Time: A dark thriller set in Ohio and West Virginia, this is Hillbilly Gothic at it's best. A couple of serial killers, Carl (Jason Clark) and Sandy (Riley Keough) roam the highways between 1945 and 1965, picking up and murdering hitchhikers. This sets the background for a tale spanning two generations of families living in the two States. We have a venial, corrupt and murderous Sheriff, crazed preachers showering themselves with poisonous spiders, lecherous preachers and people driven mad by grief. Some shocking scenes, perhaps the worse though is when Willard (Bill Skarsgard) relives an episode from WW2. His son Arvin (Tom Holland) carries on his struggles against bullies and those who harm his stepsister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen). Great performances from an ensemble cast which also includes Robert Pattinson, Mia Wasikowska, Sebastian Stan, Harry Melling and Haley Bennett. Directed by Antonio Campos, co-written by Antonio and Paulo Campos. On Netflix. 8/10."
568,I haven't seen a movie this good in developing all the stories and linking it back to the very first one. All the actors do an amazing job and take you into a first hand experience of what it means to live in this harsh town. The events unfold as we go into the characters' dark world in unforgiving times where power and sin reign supreme.A very strong ending that will give you a sense of peace l despite all the hardships.
569,"It makes you think, who is good and who is bad I love movies like that. This movie is not for the faint of heart."
570,"Good acting, good story and at last a good movie. I Enjoyed it."
571,"Just watched this new release on Netflix. Took a shot on this one (out of my comfort zone) because of it's strong cast. I mean, look at that cast!
WOW! Holy Cow! Did I say ""WOW""? I love period pieces, but this was a strong family story intertwined with a twisted serial killer story. It may have too much sexual content for you, tho. Was adapted from a novel."
572,"The devil all the time is very slow, meandering and poignant. However, it does engross the viewer with its stunning cinematography, performances, and direction. Nevertheless, all of this might have equated a superior miniseries rather than an inferior feature film."
573,"This movie is full of ickiness. However, in the midst of all the ickiness are captivating performances by a capable cast. Tom Holland, which we are most familiar with in the latest iteration of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman, does well in shedding his clean cut high school genius image here. We see him as a good person who finds himself in bad situations he didnt ask for. He is emotionally damaged from horrible things he had to endure, but the good in him still fights for the spotlight. Robert Pattinson on the other hand, is no longer that sparkling pseudo-vampire of the 2010s. Here, he is an opportunistic, manuplative, and condenscending preacher, who gets you to squirm in your seat from how sleazy he is. Although his charater has little to no redeeming qualities, you cant help but appreciate Pattinson's performance. Bill Skarsgard is another of many impressive performances. One cannot help but share his joy and his pain. Others include the always convincing Harry Melling, and Mia Wasikowska, who share what I believe the craziest and swiftest storyline of the whole movie.
This movie is violent and dark, and will most likely leave some unwanted images in your brain. However, its many characters and many storylines spread over a number of time periods, which could be confusing and altogether an unnecessary way to stretch the runtime. It could have been 20 minutes shorter.
The movie's blindly-religious overtones, and little Appalacian town in the middle of Nowhere, USA setting are bold and intriguing, and it is generally a pretty well-done movie."
574,"'The Devil All The Time' is one incredible thriller film of 2020!I absolutely love Tom Holland's performance and he looks more handsome for the main character.The casting was very talented; the plot is terrific; the cinematography was great; and the setting was perfect.Netflix has done it again with 'The Devil All The Time', the finest thriller film of 2020!"
575,"The Devil All the Time is a pointless and poorly directed ultraviolent telefilm with the retention of being an intelligent criticism of war and religion.What is memorable about this film is how well Antonio Campos, by miscasting, wasted the talent of some good actors. Especially, Tom Holland, who simply can't get the accent properly. In general, you aren't gonna turn a British actor Ohioan by putting ""ain't"" at the beginning of his sentences.This movie tries to be A River Runs Through It and a good thriller at the same. Ultimately, it fails at both."
576,"The storyline and scenery is perfect. Bill Skarsgård is my favorite in this one, truly a professional"
577,"""The Devil All the Time"" is about the story of people who believed they're doing good in the name of God but it was just the devil... all the time. The first half of the film is slow pace, with the direction seemingly going to no where. The second half started with interesting turn of events filled with drama, tension, intensity, madness, and wickedness that led to a worthwhile ending. Too much score had been used throughout the film that gave mixed feeling, with some score being out-of-place and the others are just fine which granted a good view towards the show. Actors did a very good job, with Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, and Hary Melling being the best performers from the film. Overall, this film is a good neo-noir that you'll surely love after watching, just be patient on seating."
578,Found it rlly boring at first and it start interesting when arvin is growing adult
579,"I was in two minds about watching this as Netlfix doesn't put out movies I like very often and because it is quite a long watch. It was worth it though as this is truly one of the best films the platform has to offer, enjoy."
580,"It's a really good movie with a good plot and amazing acting by known and loved actors , you need to watch it right now ."
581,"Brutal and joy depraved film.This film is one of the best (because of the strong acting cast and the story) of this particular genre.
There is something very deeply unsettling and tragic about this movie. The violence is not gory but more melancholy. Every character is lonely in their own sense. Although, all of this have been picked up from the novel but this film picturizes those emotions very well.
Special mention for the accents, none of the characters being American, actually did a decent job in portraying the particular southern drawls they were enacting.
Overall, a really nice film."
582,"Not buying even one of the characters. Hammy acting and dreadful accents.All of my Appalachian ancestors, on both sides, going back to pre- Revolutionary times are spinning irritably in their graves."
583,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.. Not at all what I expected. It was interesting, complicated in a good way, and the characters were great. The casting was incredible! And damn Pattinson's acting was amazing! Everyone's really, but daaammmnn he blew me off my seat. Great movie"
584,"""The Devil All the Time"" preoccupies through a captivating narration. It circles around two generations over with a diverse set of people and their corresponding backstories. Stacked up with ravishing performances; the closing impression turns out to be rewarding.
The way this story takes over your subliminal self is truly enthralling. Speaking of all the vile intents we hide within our narcissistic minds. How we all comply to some degree of evil, in order to get our deeds done. Holding a righteous mirror; reflecting the true nature, we are so unmindful of.
As the title advocates, The Devil lives on.A star studded cast forming up with the likes of Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Bill Skasgard, Jason Clarke, Riley Keough and more. With that many renowned personalities onboard, the performances were destined for greatness.
Cogently bolstered by a felicitous Soundscore with a melancholic touch; resonating well with the on-hand script. A competent cinematography succeeded in maintaining the unsettling connotations.Beyond shadow of a doubt, this is not everyone's cup of tea. But those with unyielding cravings for social dramas would infallibly appreciate such brilliant piece of a work."
585,"The plot is well written about people who lost their sanity and those who are affected by their actions.the question is are humans dragged to do awful things ?
What happened to the people who make out life better ?"
586,Above what I expected. Pretty good. The tension created is beyond every emotion displayed in the plot.
587,"Pretty good. Great direction, cinematography, editing and writing. Amazing cast and everyone did a great job. I'm not a fan of narration, but this is an exception because narrator wrote the original book, and also i don't think ending would've worked as good without the narration. I only have few minor things that i didn't like. I know this movie shouldn't be funny or fun, but it is too depressing, i don't think there is a single joke in this movie. Some things felt rushed even tho the movie could've been and should've been shorter.TL;DR: Great movie, would recommend it, but it's not for everyone. Only had a few problems with it but it's not that big of a deal.
8,5/10 but bcuz there's no option for it, a 9."
588,"German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote around 1900 in his works: Everything is an eternal return (Alles ist ewige Wiederkehr.). This could be the leitmotiv of this wonderful and precious movie, which is full of excellent actors. The film tells an American family story that begins in a place of horror in World War II and runs into the 1970s. I can recommend the film strongly to everybody who is interested in family history, but also interested in the question, how fragile every building of happiness we try to build is, how fragile everything is that we can create in a lifetime, and that often the others who infiltrate into our lives, destroy to dust what we are building. This cycle of creation and destruction is the metaphor of this film, which underlines the leitmotif once again. Outstanding are Riley Keough and Robert Pattinson representing an excellent cast. The direction is heavily focused on the actors' work and the transport of the plot. The camera brilliantly captures the light of the Midwest. The film dramaturgy and the script are outstanding, telling us the lives of two generations compactly and vividly in two hours. Highly recommended."
589,"Really can you imagine a film set in Yorkshire England wit the dozen lead and principle cast all natives the US, Canada, Australia and Ireland, doing their dialogue with heavy handed and distracting fake Yorkshire accents?OK I get it, British and Australian actors working in the US get about 1/3 the wages of same level US actors. But the Appalachia setting is so central to Devil All the Time, that this is just inexcusable and makes for a jarring experience."
590,"It has it's moments but not enough to lift this movie even higher unfortunately. Nothing, and then i mean nothing to complain about with the actors, really good acting from all of them. As i said in the title it works fine for most of the people but it's not for everyone."
591,"The main actors put in great performances, but the narrator spoils everything before any real tension or surprise can build, so it ends up feeling like one LONG ride, that's overwhelmingly upsetting. Definitely worth watching, there's some great cinematography and some even better acting, but at the end of the day, the writing and direction really lets this down."
592,"Very well produced film, but with some good scenes that loose their impact with the following. The narrative gets tepid in the most part. Totally found it wrong to choose Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson for their respective roles (Pattinson even more, Rolland gets more fitted into it with the final). The recurse of the narration is well used and the way the characters connect between themselves is satisfactory."
593,I guess watch it because I put a 7 out of 10 but honestly I might change it to a 6
594,"So I just watched The Devil All The Time and it is my favorite movie of the year where to start on this movie the cast I was a bit skeptical going into the movie because of Tom Holland who I love as Spider-Man but in other movies like The Impossible and Edge of Winter he was alright but nothing special and in this movie he is great I would actually say he gives the best performance in the movie which is especially impressive considering no one in this movie gives a bad performance. In this movie there are a lot of characters and they are all pretty good especially the most important ones and although there are so many that it can be hard to keep track of all of them they all are important and add something good to the movie. The action in this movie is very exciting when it happens it is brutal and unpredictable and that makes it even more exciting. Like I said when talking about the action in this movie this movie is far from predictable and that made me like the movie even more but I think another thing that made me like it even more is the serious tone and it constantly stayed that way which makes this not a movie for everybody but I really liked it.
Overall The Devil All The Time is my favorite movie of 2020 so far and I'm giving it an A."
595,"One of the worst things I have had to sit through, incredibly bland and dull. Was this meant to be entertaining in the slightest? The worst part of all, wasthe acting, I had expected something of high quality, but unfortunately the acting is atrocious.
1/10"
596,"An hour and twenty minutes in and I wonder how I lasted this long. It achieves nothing for its two hour twenty minute run time. The subject matter doesn't bother me. The boring story, dull characters and lack of focus does.Essentially a pointless flick."
597,"The Devil All The Time is a slow burn, gritty and psychologically diabolical movie. While it does take its time to set the pace of the film, the payoff at the end is beautiful and worth it.The movie consisted of 3 different person's stories that tied up really well in the end and in a way you won't see coming.
For a majority of the time, you won't really understand what the movie is about.
But as time passes, you realize that this world is rife with deception of faith. It makes you question and judge the very foundation of religion.
The very heartless alteration of faith that is vastly abundant in this troubled Midwest belt of the 60's coupled with some terrifying acts.It definitely is one of the better movies released by Netflix this year. This may not be for everyone as many might not be able to handle the slow pace, but man, is it worth the watch."
598,Never ever question the acting abilities of Robert Pattinson or tom Holland.I'm not even done watching this movie and I'm blown away by their acting abilities😱😱😱
599,"Whilst certainly a great looking film, the rather episodic depiction of the ultimately interweaving threads to this story is really disjointed and so make this a particularly pace-less film that really only comes alive in the last half hour. In as near to a nutshell as this meandering plot will allow, the gist is that we start off with Bill Skarsgård, happily married to Hayley Bennett until she becomes stricken with an illness that tests to the core the man's obsessive religiosity - a test he also subjects his young son ""Arvin"" to, too - with rather harrowing effects. Simultaneously, we are introduced to the rather curious pairing of Riley Keogh and Jason Clarke who spend their time trawling the highways trying to ensnare young men into their rather brutal photography sessions, Finally, Robert Pattinson arrives in their Ohio backwater as a somewhat puritanical preacher with quite a few flaws of his own. The story evolves over quite a long period of time as ""Arvin"" evolves from Michael Banks to Tom Holland - and it's really only once Holland appears that the story gathers it's pace and the menace and complexities start to conjoin. Pattison is super as the fervent pastor as is Skarsgård as the equally fervent father, and there are some decent contributions from Harry Melling and Sebastian Stan, but the thing all just takes far too long to get going and once it does there is an inevitability about it that, I found, made the whole thing more about assembling a strong box-office cast than about constructing a cohesive or compelling story. It certainly doesn't lack imagination, and the attention to the detail in the presentation of an immediately post WWII America is impressive but in the end it's all about the story - and for me that just fell well short."
600,"Superb acting. No story until the sister dies, then it all got predictable from there."
601,"It felt like yesterday when I found out that my favourite book was being turned into a movie and this film became my most anticipated of 2020.But today, I finally was able to see the film and I can't help but feel somewhat happy but also somewhat letdown.I'll say that every performance is excellent. Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland were most likely my two favourites. When I was reading the pages of Donald Ray Pollocks writing, it almost seems like he was writing about Skarsgard and Holland. They embody the characters of Willard and Arvin perfectly and I will continue to imagine them as the father and son. Holland shows some real acting chops here and I truly hope he gets some awards attention for his great performance here. I hope that he takes more roles like this in the future and doesn't just stick to big budget lifeless Spider-Man movies, I'm excited to see him in Cherry, if that still releases this year.The cinematography was great and the 35mm feel to it all worked seamlessly to set the old Southern tone of the story. I really respect the choice to shoot on film and when you watch the film the grain covering the screen almost comes across as dirt or dust and adds so much to the style of the film.The main issue I have with the film is the use of a narrorator. This films use of narrotation is the laziest choice I have seen in a film in recent memory. I honest to god would've given this film a much higher rating if they just removed the absolutely pointless narroration. You can tell what the actor is feeling, I don't need it explained to me that Arvin is feeling sad, I KNOW HE'S SAD! I'm also well aware that the novel had a narrorator as well, but there's a huge diffrence between writing a novel and writing a film. You can't see a character walk into a building in a book it's not a visual medium, in a film you can see an actor weep or show the emotion the narrorator is telling the audience they're feeling. There's a classic rule to storytelling which is to show, not to tell. This film attempts to do both and drags the excellent quality of the rest of the film down substantially.I'm also torn on the changes to many elements of Arvin's motivations here. In the book there was a real sense that Arvin not just had a sisterly love for Lenora but also a sexual one and I didn't really get that impression here. I know it's weird, but I felt the film cheated a bit not including that element. Also, the changed circumstances behind the films final act and the character of Roy are strange to see be changed, but I do not hate the differences here as they do progress the story a lot faster than the book.In conclusion, The Devil All The Time has some wonderful performances, ideas, cinematography and directing, however unfortunately the film doesn't entirely live up to the incredibly high standards of Donald Ray Pollack's masterpiece novel and the inclusion of narroration to dumb down the story is a very bad decision.Honestly, someone needs to make a cut of this film without the narroration and it would honestly be a substantially better film."
602,WTH!! I'm not even half way through and I'm sitting here shaking my head!! WTF!!! I didn't read the book....maybe that's my mistake!! This movie is the worst! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
603,Do not under any circumstances watch this film. 2 hrs 18 mins and 43 seconds of your life you will never get back at some points I was wishing I went blind so I wouldn't have to watch any more.
604,The lack of a military advisor during the making of this movie hurt it in overall. The mistakes made it hard to watch.
605,"The Devil all the Time was a good crime thriller that had a great cast full of talented young persons that showed how they will be a great group of stars in a future.The biggest surprise to me was Tom Holland,he was great as a more darker and serious character and he proved that he can be a very good actor to,and not just Spider Man.Pattinson and rest of cast were also good as their characters and they sold their screentime very good.Sometimes story become little messy with to many storylines and characters in it,but in end i was more or less satisfayed with this film"
606,"Director Antonio Campos has delivered one of my favorite films of the year with #TheDevilAllTheTime. I expect the movie will divide audiences, but this violent, provocative story of murder and mayhem held my attention from start to finish."
607,The movie was enjoyable.Tom Holland & Robert Pattinson were great.It was a pretty good cast and worth to watch and I think this movie was the best Netflix thriller movie of 2020.But the movie was excessively grim and violent and because of that maybe some people will need some guidance but at the end I want to say that the movie was great.
608,One of the worst movies I ever seen! The room is a 10 compared to this!
609,"Antonio Campos's The Devil All the Time is one of the most ruthless, yet gripping of 2020.
The cast shines in these sinister characters with awesome performances, with wonderful direction and writing by Antonio Campos."
610,"A stellar cast and some unforgettably chilling moments make #TheDevilAllTheTime one to watch, even if the story is uneven.In this thriller, sinister characters converge around a young man devoted to protecting those he loves in a postwar backwoods town teeming with corruption and brutality.Despite reviews from my colleagues, I quite enjoyed ""The Devil All The Time"" for the most part. I did think it dragged on at points but the cast and elements of the story kept me wanting more. Robert Pattinson is incredible in yet another supporting role and Tom Holland drops his Marvel charm for this big boy role like you've never seen him before. I loved the incredibly dark aspect of the film but the story was all over the place. It needed to be concrete and less washy. Overall though I still think it's worth a watch if you can handle the film and all it's sinister tones.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
611,"Sorry, the first two hours were slow, boring and depressing. The last 30 minutes were very good. I would give it an 8 if the movie was one hour shorter, but no. 6,5 is what it is worth in a whole."
612,"This slice of Southern Gothic is certainly novelistic--even for a movie adapted from a book. There's the omniscient narrator in the voiceover untethered to any character. His narration jumps back in time and back and forth between various characters and subplots that at first seem unrelated but are eventually all weaved together. Some well-known actors anchor some of these threads, including Spiderman Tom Holland in the hero's arch. Also, sparkles the vampire Robert Patterson plays a preacher, which should raise some alarm. Consistent themes, such as the sinful religious stuff and violence and, to a lesser extent, war, politics and crime, and thoughtful dialogue are further reflections of the prose origins. It's masterful storytelling, really, even if there's not much in it that's more appealing than the fascination with the grotesque and the pulp.Reportedly, even the murderous photography business is from the literary source, which is kind of shame. If the god-like narrator is the novelist (literally and otherwise) and Holland's character is where the spectator places their emotional investment, then the photographer is the filmmaker--posing characters in sexually compromising positions and killing them off one by one. Director Antonio Campos probably deserves some credit, too, if only for allowing the actors and pacing room to breathe."
613,"What a shame. It isn't necessarily what is wrong that's disappointing; it's what it could have been. This had the potential of genuine greatness, held by an absolute stellar cast that do a vast majority of the heavy lifting, but the noticeably sluggish pacing and occasionally ridiculous cuts really brings it down drastically. There could have been at least half an hour of this final that definitely could be left on the cutting room floor, and unfortunately the only thing that kept me watching until the end was its talented on screen ensemble, especially Holland and Pattinson."
614,"This is a drawn out story with a decent cast. It completes all of the stereotypes that you would guess that come about from a film of this type. It's not all that good as most of the reviewers are raving about. I can't see any evidence of a oscar winning performance as there are so many characters flown across the screen none of them have any consistent time.It's a movie you'll watch but end up most of it on your phone, or cleaning the house, washing dishes and doing laundry. Then at the end you'll have a warm feeling of actually finished some chores and think that the cause is this crap movie."
615,"This film is narrated by the man who wrote the novel. It quickly establishes the purpose of the tale complete with map and foreshadowing of the intertwined character troupe. The hook is great. The setting is perfect. The acting is fine. The connections work well. The characters are decent. I thought this film had a lot going for it. The story doesn't try to explain human depravity....it only displays it. Unfortunately, this isn't anything new and sort of lost me. There was a lot of sadness and loss.......but I wasn't invested in the characters so I found myself not caring about them.The title never really tied into the film. It just sort of introduced devilish characters with very little explanation concerning their actions. Overall, it had some strong points, but I seriously doubt I will ever tune in for a second viewing......"
616,"Boring and just flat. Go watch some European classics about the topic and see for yourself. An American cliche badly made. Acting was very good, though. Total waste of good actors talent. Directing and cinematography way below par. All in all a dumb movie for dumb people. Total waste of time."
617,"A favorite theme and it is throughout this film to the extreme. I watched because of the stellar cast that was advertised. Tom Holland did get to flex his acting chops and he was excellent with a sorry script. I never cared for Robert Pattison and his mumbling southern accent and his portrayal of a reprehensible preacher was very off putting. The rest of the cast did great with the tired, ugly script they were given."
618,"A cast of oddballs in Virginia who believe they can have their sins forgiven if they pray hard enough and go to church. Progressively violent and creepy along with a soundtrack that attempts to soften the scenes of murder and abuse. Narrated by the author who wrote the piece the film is based on. The oddest casting is Pattison who made so much money from Twilight he can make ridiculous, downer movies like this."
619,"I'm not a fan of Tom Holland, but I can see he has a lot of potential and he shines in this movie. No doubts! But even with the great acting and other points, I think the movie wasn't that good. I'll see it again other day just to make sure if I'm wrong or not about this work."
620,Was waiting for this movie for a long time and I am happy to say that the hype is worth it.
621,"Best movie i have ever watched and that's coming from someone who's seen practically everything. i don't have the words to explain how insane and meaningful this story is. i've learned a lot, and have taken most of the scenes to heart. i'm telling everyone to watch this movie, without a doubt! also the cast is full of amazing actors and actresses!!"
622,"The devil all the time
2020
18
Director: Antonio Campos
Starring: Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgard, Robert pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Harry Melling, Jason Clarke, Eliza Scanlen, Haley Bennett, Riley Keough, Mia Wasikoswka etcOverall rating 26/100The devil all the time is about a group of sinful and sinister people who all are linked, and target one young boy devoted to protecting his family. The devil all the time for me was just nasty and horrible to watch and there were not many good elements for me sadly, let's talk about this more in detail.Let's be nice and start with a few positives, I liked the narration, character background and the performances were particularly good. The use of narration was done well to make you understand how the characters were feeling as well as adding some background and development to them as well. I also thought the movie spent a decent amount of time on most of the characters backgrounds. The movie spent a lot of time developing characters pasts to make you understand where they were at the present time which was well done and a good amount of time was spent on it making it not seem rushed. The cast and performances here was also very good, I have to say the cast was very impressive, and despite me not liking any of the characters ( which we will get into later ) all the cast did a good job with what they were given, with intense and unsettling performances that I haven't seen from some of the actors involved here before.However, my first few negatives would be the unlikeable main character, slow pacing, and disconnect from the plot and characters. The movies main character was incredibly unlikeable, the director somehow thought that him killing a load of bad people would make him likeable or someone to connect with but no it achieved the complete opposite. Making him just as bad as the other characters despite Tom Hollands commendable performance. The movie was also very slow paced. The movie in general was just very dull and slow paced, and I often found myself losing interest, due to the lack of anything really going on in parts, the interesting things that happened in the movie weren't consistent enough at all. Next I had no emotional connection to the movie or any connection to the plot and characters. The movie had so many deaths that it was hard to keep up, and due to how sudden they were with practically no depth, development, or real reasoning I didn't care about any of them. I just found the character work and the plot terrible and not something that I could connect with at all, and the movie did nothing to make anything positive or after a while interesting to watch.My next few negatives would be the poor roles for women, how over the top the movie was and the overly dark tone that didn't work. The roles for all the women in the movie was terrible, I get it was set in the past but so many movies like this still give substantial roles for women, they were all killed off, had no development or depth for them and were practically just there to please and look after the men, the movie was also incredibly over the top, no offense to some of the actors involved here but a lot of the accents were terrible, I was often laughing out loud when I wasn't supposed to and they had so many dark moments that it just got too much and more and more ridiculous that they just lost their impact completely. The movie also had a way too dark tone that did nothing. The movie was incredibly dark and disturbing and if done right can be great within a movie. But in this case they served no purpose to the overall plot whatsoever. The movie was just going for shock factor but failing to link it to the actual movie, making it basically just a load of messed up people killing each other, it was just really poor.My final few slight positives would be the set pieces, the equal amount of time and connections between characters as well as some chemistry between actors. The movie did a good job at making the set locations look like the desired time period shown throughout, and in general there was some interesting and visually pleasing filming locations. I also thought the movie did a good job at splitting it's time equally with all the characters, giving everyone an opportunity to have their stories told, and also I liked how a lot of the characters were linked together in some way despite it not always being enough to justify them being connected I appreciated the effort, and some of the actors had believable chemistry that worked well on screen especially from Tom Holland and Eliza Scanlen.However, my final few negatives would be lack of depth to the plot, as well as it's lack of cohesiveness. And finally, the dull ending. The movie had no depth whatsoever apart from surface level karma and people fighting demons. The movie didn't even attempt to go deep into the characters, and the plot just lacked any form of cohesiveness, it felt like separate stories that were lazily linked together just for the sake of it. The ending was also extremely dull and left me feeling nothing for the movie, they didn't have any satisfying character arcs hardly any of the characters were alive and it was just an unpleasant hard to watch final act that never went anywhere beyond a few mediocre kills.Overall, despite boasting an impressive cast with great performances. The devil all the time is a bland, lifeless, depressing, over the top and overly dark film. That has nothing likeable or compelling going for it and was honestly hard to watch until the end due to the lack of effort put in."
623,"If you have even a smidge of empathy, then I suggest you not watch this movie. This is the kind of dark movie that gets more horrible the more it goes on. It had no redeeming qualities other than the acting itself. It was made even worse by the time period that it was set in and the way they produced it to add insult to injury. If you want a movie that will kick you while your already down, then this movie achieves that goal. Otherwise, it should be avoided like the plague."
624,Violence as deus ex machina. And all the actors slumming for critical chops. Blah.
625,"Everyone ends up in the same damned placeThere is some phenomenal acting in this film, particularly from Bill Skarsgard, he really stood out for me.
It is also nice to see Tom Holland take on a more serious role rather than everyone still seeing him as the kid that plays Spider-Man. I'm glad he's branching out.
I enjoyed this film, there was ALOT going on but I think if it was longer it would of dragged and turned into a 'how longs left' kinda film. Overall an okay film with an amazing cast.
2.5/5Sidenote: why does Sebastian Stan die in everything I've seen him in?"
626,The acting is great and so is the production value. The story itself is interesting but the way it's told is boring.
627,"Don't get me wrong, the acting was great, without a doubt, but the story was lacking a spark. Very predictable, you can see what is going to happen a couple minutes ahead. There wasn't really anything incredibly entertaining in the story, it wasn't really attaching, even when the multiple ""storylines"" collided. Sometimes movies that have a slow paced story, like this one, are still very entertaining, by virtue of great camera work, creating a peculiar atmosphere to the movie, or by creating very vivid and entertaining characters, but not really this one. The only redeeming feature this movie has is it's truly great acting, which could be enough for some to enjoy the movie. I recomment this movie to those ready for a long and not necessarily engaging story in the name of good acting."
628,"Several interrelated tales of corruption and wildly insane religious passions come together in a small backwater of 1940 Ohio leading to sexual abuse and , violence.Despite some strong performances, particularly Holland and Pattinson, this is a relentlessly depressing experience which in the end, rather too neatly and hastily brings everything to a head."
629,"I thought this film would be right up my street. A gritty drama with great cast. You know what though, it was 2h20 of not a lot. I don't think I've lost 2h20 of my life but don't feel I was massively entertained with this film."
630,"Some of the themes and concepts I found to be
compelling: violence begetting violence; eternal recurrence; the fatalistic structure of the plot; and the powerlessness of being a slave to some divine blueprint. The film tries so hard to replicate the magic of Miller's Crossing and the Coen formula. Ironically, it probably would've worked better if it had been more like its inspirations and doubled as an absurdist comedy. Its nihilistic tone felt flat without any semblance of dry humor to augment the violence."
631,"The performances in this film were excellent. I actually found myself hooked in the first 25-30 minutes of the film. I just honestly don't know where it went wrong. I found it depressing and aimless. I really wanted to enjoy it, or to feel rewarded but instead I was happy it was finished.I was struck while watching it with the thought ""This is not a re-watch for me"" and I couldn't believe it when my wife said the exact same thing when the credits rolled. I just wanted a little redemption, was that too much to ask?"
632,"Fantastic acting, overall pretty well written, but in the dark and gritty story, the film just leaves the audience with the question of ""what was it all for?"" and I wouldn't say the film ever even attempts to answer that, which may bother some. It feels like the movie would've been better suited for a mini series with multiple episodes centered around each main character / character set. It would've allowed more depth and explored the ideas of death, life, religion, the cycle of violence, and what the real point of it was.Positives: acting, time period felt natural rather than fabricated (costume / set design / cinematography)Negatives: one-note characters, same song plays throughout most of the movie, lots of voice over narration to tell you about the story instead of showing it to you or allowing the audience to discern / interpret the characters themselves."
633,Three stories.. all together at the end. Not a perfect one but its a mixed bag. Great performances with poor characterization. First hour is too slow. when Robert and Tom both had a chat in church.. the flick picks up the pace which was much needed. Second hour is all blood soaked and Artistic. I was dissapointed with the Narration..When u see the things which are happening why do u narrate then. we expect atleast a back story and how does the character feel. It hardly gives us time to think about the characters or scenes happening. Tom always wanted a proper burial to his dog. He finally does it and yawns. This is not a horror movie neither thriller nor a revenge drama
634,Basically i saw the devil if it was white and boring
635,45 mins in I decided I had no desire to spend another 90mins of my life watching a fictitious movie about an improbable confluence of religious psychopaths. I've no love for religion but do not understand what would motivate someone to craft such a story. Maybe there's something entertaining in the darkness but that's not my cuppa tea.
636,"So much religion, so much crazy. If like me you dislike any kind of religion this is not enjoyable, I guess there is some point about the hypocrisy of religious people that are often the worst human behings but I don't care for these people and the movie makes them unrelatable for a normal person, I don't want know these people, I don't care for them.The script is bad, the acting is ok, the movie is trash."
637,It's a well made and well acted movie that runs nearly two and a half hours.That's an hour too long.The movie is slower than you can imagine and just plods along.It needed way crisper direction and loads of cuts..
638,Poor story. Bad accents. Surprisingly big actors took in some of these rolls. Don't waste your time. I'll never get those 2 hours back.
639,"In fact, this film may seem like a psychological-criminal trailer at first glance, but in fact, in my opinion, it has a critical and sharp look at very religious and thoughtless people, but it could have taken a deeper look at this subject to a great film in Turn this look
The excellent performance of Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård in this film should be mentioned. Meanwhile, Tom Holland can have high hopes for success and shine in Hollywood in the coming years. Also, although it is still early, Robert Pattinson can take a look at the Oscars Have other prizes
Also, in the end, we should mention the weakness of the script, which could have been better"
640,But didn't like how the sheriff still tried to kill the boy after the sheriff found out his sister is a serial killer. He should have let it go since he is crooked too.
641,"Long & boring
...just a bunch of senseless murdering and pointless, excessive bad language"
642,"What in the world has the world come to giving this movie such a good review? Ok the acting was good, I'll give them that but the story was going all over the place and found myself thinking what is the purpose of this movie?I think if they compressed this to an hour and a half, it could've been better but I certainly would not watch anything similar to this film as I've felt like I wasted 2+ hours I'll never get back."
643,"Just what you need to cheer you up during a lockdown, thanks Netflix! A bleak, depressing tale without a single redeeming feature."
644,"Several parallel stories told in the most boring way possible. Time jumps to make it all come together.
If you ever have trouble falling asleep,try this movie."
645,"The movie is so good. The narration, the story, and the acting is top notch. The continuity in the story from past to present so neatly done..
Tom Holland is superb throughout the movie.."
646,"Movie was OK, but did what seems like every single scene require *dogs barking in background*?"
647,"4 out of 6 of my family went to sleep before getting halfway of this movie because it was just too boring. Boring plot, going nowhere until the end of the movie. And tbh nothing new about that religion can go/or have went too far with some bad/sociopathic people. In The end bad people got what they deserve and that boy finally got his sleep after. Facepalm. Big movie dissappoitment for me considering the reviews were 7/10 when we decided to watched this."
648,"The film is CERTAINLY NOT ""a sweaty mess from start to finish"" or a ""colossal misfire"" as the first critiques said. But for me it was between ""ehh"" and ""good"".
I think the biggest failure of the movie is that the storyline is ""unsuccessfully"" extended. I think if the movie was cut from still scenes to around 1 hour 40mins from 2 hours and 18 mins, it would give a much different watch.Because the film was meant to give a thrilling atmosphere, but instead a quieter ambiance emerged. Crisis scenes are weak and turns to stillness right away. When that is the case, the movie gets still before you get enough thrill and after a while, you get the feeling of ""I wonder if nothing will happen?"". Maybe, apart from shortening the film, this problem could be solved by giving stronger crises one after another in the middle of the film and maintaining the tension. They could push the limits a bit harder for longer and more disturbing scenes for the movie's theme and taste.It is definitely a movie in which the actors' influence is noticed. I think the movie would be a little more boring if the actors were different. I especially liked Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling (although his name was not on the poster), because they successfully pulled off characters we had not seen on them before.But it's also true that the rest of the cast don't have roles in which to perform hard. I don't know if this is a bad thing, but it is certain that the rest of the cast can succeed at much more complicated roles.Apart from these, I liked the soundtracks and the story. The general theme of the movie was interesting. It does make you watch. But it's a movie far below its potential. I think that's why the critics were buried it too much on the first reviews. And it's not as disturbing as it was told in the media. It strangely seems to me that they're running a commercial with this on the movie 😬 Or maybe I am turning into a psychopath..."
649,"This captures several other movies you don't feel like rewatching and balls them all up into a boring, pretentious, forced, not-so-dark pointless waste of time. I found the whole drawn out story over acted, pseudo dramatic, with an unimaginative film score and not a character worth investing in. With such a stacked cast, I can only sum this up to one non-existent word: unentertainment. Undo it."
650,"Just like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,Missouri,this film also tried to describe a whole colony consist of real roles.I think the director didn't just want to make Tom to be the protagonist,the protagonist is the whole people in this movie.That's the most significant part of this movie to me.Maybe this is a new way to movies in the future."
651,"That's the one for the history)It is not an easy to watch and to like movie.Very tragic situations and circumstances ...I don't want to talk too much,as a film like that ,everybody has to discover on their own..."
652,"Oh America, where are you going with your dubious morals and your glorification of violence? It's no use wrapping them up in art, murder is murder. In our example here, you lose track of the corpses you see. Somehow everything is intertwined and then again not. The story, which is held together by a narrator, is supposed to suggest something like art. In reality, ""The Devil All the Time"" is a pompous and boring film, and in parts badly played - Robert Pattinson is an imposition - that makes you wonder why it takes a film so long to tell its minimalist plot. All this would have been accommodated in an hour. And it still wouldn't have made a good film because the story is full of holes and is far-fetched. Without a motive, people are murdering each other through the landscape. Because they are evil? Yes and - why make a film about it?"
653,"This film is freakin awesome, Tom Holland, Bill Skargard and Robert Pattinson, what a cast. they were awesome, the story is awesome. i loved tom Holland in this film he saw so many bad things he was a bad ass character they made him so good. Bill Skargard was mind blowing, same thing for Robert Pattinson. the thing is that the film is too long but anyways i didn't feel like I'm bored like i felt in films like I'm thinking of ending things. so i loved it."
654,"Extremely well crafted and superbly acted .
Not for the faint hearted it's gritty violent i in n parts disturbing overall absorbing like a good book couldn't put it down"
655,"It does drag on then bang everything connects, but not in a clever way... Just kinda happens because the script says so:)It is OKish, after I finished watching it, the 2 hours of it I didn't know if I liked it or not. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know because it was witty, fun or exciting. The Gentlemen was and that is why I did recommend it.If someone asked me how was the film, my reply would be ""it was ok, wouldn't watch it again though""."
656,It's comforting to see a version of this world where this pandemic isn't the worst thing that could happen. Let us ensure humanity's survival by not all thinking the same thoughts.
657,"Interesting portrait of the Appalachian reality. A corner of USA normally ignored, the best stories are from that place. The movie depicts the saga of one family, but focus on one kid named Arvin, who despite being surrounded by awful people, he grows up fast and takes care of himself.Interesting enough, one of the elements some military fans will love is the Luger pistol. For some reason, German weapons (and uniforms) have an international appeal because of their design. That pistol is so intriguing and gives some extra sophistication to the movie."
658,This was really truly unexpectedly fantastic! The acting is superb! Amazing storyline! Excellent camera work. Love everything about this movie. Great job!
659,"I was expecting a slow start... with significant development, BUT at halfway i was so BORED by the way the story was being told to the viewer i JUST DIDN'T CARE if the DEVIL itself came down to earth made everyone pay for their sins!Performances are mediocre, trying to pull the hell out of the actors, but the emotions don't get through to the audience.It's a hell of a BORING MESS. Maybe i'm affected by loneliness in this pandemic year, but watching (almost all) of this movie was a hell of a waste."
660,"Everything converge to make a masterpiece out of this movie. Performance, cinematography... death is present in many aspects: the horror is it can be justified by religion, philosophy, war..."
661,"Picked it up without having a single clue what it's about. Ended up actually liking the movie, even though nothing actually really happened. It doesn't the 'Heroe's Journey' component, it's just a movie, with FANTASTIC actors, who delivered perfectly and that's it.If I could complain about anything, it would be the length. I think it could've been 15 or 20 minutes shorter.Holland, Pattinson, Skarsgard, Clarke, Stan, well.. Everyone did their job well, and made the movie worth watching."
662,"I really liked this movie!
Everybody's acting is so good good good. Love finding movies like this ."
663,"Just by the title I was expecting a horror movie, but it's a crime/drama, even though you could concider it as a horror since it's very religious and what is more horrorful than religion? The Devil All The Time is a quite long movie but it doesn't feel like that because there are multiple stories that in a way are all connected to each other and they are all very captivating to watch. The cast is excellent, with a lot of good actors like Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Eliza Scanlen etc. Robert Pattinson, once an actor I didn't really appreciate (probably because of those dumb Twilight series) is a totally different actor now that did a very good job playing his character. This movie has different stories and they're all very religion themed, what makes it interesting to watch. As an atheist I always find it fascinating to watch very religious people believing the most idiotic things and in The Devil All The Time you get a lot of those scenes, if not all of them. There's a fair amount of murdering so it's more a crime than a drama and that's what makes this movie worth watching."
664,"Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson did a great job
Last 30 minutes of the movie is too Satisfying 🔥🔥🔥🔥"
665,"I was looking forward to watching this for a while, I wasn't overly impressed to start with, very strange but had a great cast. It is slow and never really picks up until the very end but somehow keeps you engaged and wanting to watch and find out what happens. Its worth a watch but don't expect massive amounts from it in my opinion."
666,"It was so exciting
I really enjoy it but i was shocked when i saw this movie..!"
667,"The Devil All the Time
Directed by Antonio Campos. Written by Antonio Campos and Paulo Campos
I will say in the spirit of Not Christmas(Don't blame me for the lack of creativity, it was a black out kind of night) I was aware of my first and second picks. Antonio Campos is a fascinating director who likes to pick apart characters piece by piece. He did this tremendously in 'Christine'. Rebecca Hall helped fill out what might have only been between the lines of Christine Chubbuck, the script and the real life events.The Devil All The Time is a horse of a different breed entirely. It is no longer focusing on one particular character. It is focusing on generations of family members and the evil that might be drawn to them in their efforts to live a life according to God while also trying to push down their human emotions and desires. They live in an extremely small town. Everybody congregates at the church and everybody knows each other's names. It seems less like there are opportunities there and more like obligations. You stay because you have to and you stay because you know nothing else. Simplicity can work to declutter one's life.However that is not necessarily the case. Evil lurks behind seemingly innocent people. Evil lurks within the confines of the church. Death can be random and chaotic. One action trying to save your family only manages to put them in danger elsewhere. This really feels like a series of vignettes. They are interconnected and we have a folksy narrator there to put things at ease but ultimately not enough is known about any of them outside of the illusion of civility. Something we on the internet are all too aware of. The illusion of civility.The performances are all as good as they can be. Most of the women in this film are quite meek and subservient. The culture presented in the story lends credence to that way of thinking but they do push back when they're forced to and there is a calm and beauty in their eyes and their simplicity is something that is being strived for by the other characters particularly in Eliza Scanlen's character Lenora. She was born from violence but she has a hope that you just know is not long for this barren place. Barren not in scenery but in hope and joy. Everything creaks and groans. The salt of the earth permeates every article of clothing and in the bare bones homes they maintain.Tom Holland(Spider-Man) is taking his inherent boyish innocence and his bravado to a quiet place. He takes in these tragedies and he is trying his best to protect his family what is left of them. He is sacrificing his own potential future for them. A future he doesn't even know he has. He is quite good at showing the turmoil inside of him and with each decision he is forced to make.This is a quite long movie especially because of the episodic nature of the plot. It runs over two hours and we don't spend a significant amount of time with anyone. You learn just enough about them to understand the position they're in and whether they understand why they're there. If they're hiding behind the veneer of a preacher, or friendly travelers or the law, they're holding back some force of evil. They prey upon people who simply wish to live their life.I give this one a C."
668,"So here we are and it's 2020 and well, life is hard for many of us.It's uncomfortable to feel for all but a scant few of the characters in this movie (you'll know who once you've watched it) but I can guarantee you one thing, you'll relate and be moved by the struggle that the main protagonists face, whether you've had the same experience or not.There's great people in this world and there's people who believe they're doing good, but are well... horrifically evil.There's nothing to pick apart here, the cast, the production value, the direction, it's all exceptional.Ultimately this movie is a celebration of the good and a warning of the bad. An adult fairly tale. A reminder to take care."
669,"Many positives here - the acting is superb, especially Skarsgard, Pattinson and Holland. The sets are rich and the themes of religion, faith and prayer are impactful. However, the violence is excessive and the plot is so dark it makes one feel depressed. Loved the acting but had I known the plot and violence I would have passed."
670,"The Devil All the Time won't be the most uplifting film you'll watch on Netflix this year, but it may be one of the more interesting. Featuring a massive cast of Hollywood's darlings, this grim ensemble affair takes place in a microcosm of God-fearing Ohio towns from the mid '50s to the mid '60s, a world bearing the lacerations of World War II and drawing ever closer to the horrors of Vietnam.
Directed by Antonio Campos, the film features narration by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book upon which the movie is adapted. His Sam Elliottesque drawl gives the movie a literary, fable-like tone that contrasts with the grimness of the material. It has a Coen Brothers meets Cormac McCarthy atmosphere.
In a range of obvious ways, The Devil All the Time is about the stunning hypocrisies of the devout, and God's word is used as a justification for a range of atrocities throughout, that punctuate the running time like stabs to the gut. The Devil is everywhere, all the time, and one might wonder how the behaviour of these characters would differ if they were Satan worshippers.
While being finely acted, the movie falls short of greatness. The film is crowded with characters across different time periods and Campos' screenplay seems more concerned with the interlocking of the narrative than the inner lives or motivations of its subjects. There are memorable scenes - many, in fact - and then others that, in hindsight, feel entirely unnecessary. Wasted screen time.
The film could have, in fact, been much longer, to put more flesh on the bones of its characters (flesh likely contained in the more expansive novel). But the main drive of the story, that of the connection between father and son played, in different time periods, by Bill Skarsgård and Tom Holland respectively, fairs better than other threads. It's the spine of the movie, the depiction of the cyclical nature of parental trauma. That said, the film stubbornly avoids the ending that would have best served the material.
While Campos shot the film on 35mm, and the graininess is welcome, The Devil All the Time still has the brightly lit small-screen scope of, well, most Netflix movies. A little more darkness might have matched that within the screenplay."
671,Great script first snd foremost. it's good to watch a movie with a great story and this one has an ensemble cast with lots going on that all comes together. It's a bit Greek tragedy but without the downer ending. Great cast and directing. A very well thought out tale.
672,"A story about war,loss, innocence, lust and revenge perfectly bound together. I've only known Tom Holland for spiderman movies but this movie is a whole new level.. you can feel the rage when he hits and his emotions for the thing he loves makes this movie the best.
And the cast Robert Pattinson did a great job as a villain .
Tom Holland did great and this movie will be remembered."
673,"The Devil All The Time is one of those movies of 2020 that I hoped to be entertained enough to save a year without cinema. From the first act I was totally hooked, the story seemed complicated enough to get me interested and every interaction built a nice tention that made me expect a great storyline. Going into the second act the movie starts to be a little more shallow with many things that feel a little too much, there were some great moments but many more that needed better execution. All of that, concluded in a confusing and bad last act that more or less dropped the quality of this film quite a bit. The story builts step by step a very dark society and doesn't live up to this in the end so I was kinda disappointed on that. The acting was the highlight fore sure, Skarsgard, Pattinson, Holland and many more great actors that were a part of this movie were absolutely amazing, great and accurate accents, emotional scenes, deep and meaningful interactions, everything felt realistic and this is an achievement totally earned by this terrific cast. The direction in okay, nothing too unappealing but nothing extremely interesting, a classic take without any visual storytelling. The main problem of this movie besides the ending is a side-plot that makes no sense and isn't needed at all in the movie, it serves nothing and it just cause shock, that's all. Finally, this movie is good, it might not be the savior of this year in cinema but it's a nice choice to spend 2 entertaining hours and I would say that it deserves a chance to give you a different more pesimistic experience than most of the new movies."
674,"""The Devil All the Time"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a story of a man who is returning from the war and trying to find his place in the world through god. He starts a family with his loved one but many things will change in his life and his family's too.I liked this movie because it was a big surprise for me since I did not have high expectations. The plot was very interesting and it was consisted of many good scenes with much of suspense which were combined very well with drama. The interpretations of Bill Skarsgård who played as Willard, Tom Holland who played as Arvin, Riley Keough who played as Sandy and Robert Pattinson who played as Reverent Preston Teagardin were simply amazing and very different from what we have already watched them play. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Jason Clarke who played as Carl and he was very good at it. Lastly, I have to say that ""The Devil All the Time"" is a nice movie and surprisingly good, I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
675,"Much like fate bringing together two strangers, The Devil All The Time attempts to do the same with its muti-layered story. The Netflix film starring Robert Pattison and Tom Holland begins with Willard, played by Bill Skarsgard, who returns home from war and starts a family. After marrying and having a son Arvin, his wife suddenly falls ill with cancer.Willard prays for his wife at his makeshift church in which he calls a prayer log. This is where he first teaches Arvin how to pray to the lord. In hopes of God answering his prayers to heal his sick wife, Willard sacrifices the family dog, breaking young Arvin's heart. Once his wife succumbs to her disease, Willard kills himself and Arvin is sent to live with his relatives, and is introduced to his step sister Lenora.Years pass and Arvin is now a young man, portrayed by actor Tom Holland. One morning at church,
the family is introduced to the new Reverend, Preston Teagardin, played by Robert Pattison, who gives his best attempt as an evangelical southern preacher. Tensions are raised immediately when the Reverend embarrasses Arvin's family at a service, and continues by taking advantage of Lenora.The story of Arvin and the Reverend is the main story while in the background we follow around a murdering duo who travel along the highway picking up unsuspecting hitchhikers and killing them. If it sounds out of place, thats because it is, and unfortunately acts as a separate film altogether until the final act. That's not saying the duo don't have their purpose in the film, including a memorable scene in the beginning in which a preacher lands in the duo's clutches and comes to face his own mortality.The Devil All The Time has many themes such as religion, god, redemption, and betrayal, but unfortunately never ties them together to make an impactful story. There are other films which tackle that subject better such as John Huston's 1979 film Wise Blood. In that film Brad Douriff plays a man eager to start his own Church and reveal Jesus is not the son of God.Much like the murdering duo's story that could be in a separate film altogether, The Devil All The Time seems like pieces of a story instead of one complete one. What stayed with me longer than the film was the wonderful soundtrack filled with classic country songs which had me pausing the end credits for nearly a half an hour researching the tunes."
676,"Damn nothing happens, and everyone is british? everyone"
677,"There are many positive reviews here. I do not agree. Let me explain why you folks are wrong.Narration works when there is a character living through the events. It jumps from story to story, character to character, with the narrator leading the way. That's like walking through a zoo with a guide. You'll learn but not on your own. I do not like being told what to think and what I see.Why is it every main character in this movie has such a dark side. It seems like if you grew up in that time frame and are from that area you're a terrible person. Every LEAD character had dark tones to them. It is insulting to folks who grew up in those conditions.Folks are so poor in this movie yet they always have gas, cigarettes, and plenty of bullets for a German gun. I dislike it when logic gets thrown out the window.Lastly, it felt like so much build up in the beginning to make a point about the towns being connected and all sorts. However the only connection was Tom Holland's character who grew up in both towns.I told you I was going to rip this to shreds. 5 star rating because I'm not a monster like the photographer."
678,"The pros of this movie is the good acting from all of the cast, I especially liked Pattinson as the scummy preacher. The downside to this movie is that it is extremely slow especially in the first half. Tom Holland isn't even introduced until 45 minutes in. The movie is extremely boring for the most part but after his ""sister"" accidently kills herself it starts to pick up and the storylines start to come together. In the end everyone's story comes together in some ways but there are still events that don't really matter scattered throughout the movie. The ending left me with a sense of that was interesting but not really good or great."
679,"In short, great acting, horrible film, good ending, the end."
680,"Bible hating writers making a show about deplorable people.In any case, the main character dies within 15 minutes and after that the film fails to pull any interest from me.3/10."
681,"I wasted my time because of the good reviews.
It simply doesn't fit my taste
I feel nothing special after watching this. This is just an ordinary movie. Neither good nor bad. peace ;-)"
682,"The movie isn't going anywhere.
The acting was great. Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson did really good in this film. The sound was good, but the movie didn't have a direction. Holland and Pattinson saved the movie with their performances."
683,"The only interesting parts about The Devil All the Time is its title and the third act; everything else was just flat. For nearly two hours, the movie was building up for a grand finale, but those near two hours could've put almost anyone to sleep.There were so many subplots and characters that the movie didn't have enough time to develop one good solid character. So for most of the time, I was just watching these characters that I don't care about being depressed. There was only one notable subplot, and that subplot being the one with Carl, the serial killer. The slow pacing also doesn't help the film whatsoever, because I'm already stuck with underdeveloped characters, and now I have to watch them do the most subpar things.The acting was the best part about The Devil All the Time; it's just unfortunate that the actors did a better job at playing the characters than the writers actually creating them. Like, why did everybody have to be the stereotypical 50's character; where they praise God for almost everything. And I know that this movie is about religious people, but why didn't they just give a reason for every character to believe in God so passionately. That's why Arvin Russell is such a good character when compared to everyone else; he has reason on why he's not religious.The Devil All the Time is a slightly above average movie. I don't know if it's just me, but The Devil All the Time feels like it's Oscar baiting all the time. This movie feels bland and lifeless. The only time that I could see/feel passion was in its performances. But for what it's worth, The Devil All the Time is a skip for me, if it wasn't for its long runtime, then maybe not."
684,"'The Devil All The Time (2020)' is an incredibly uneven experience. At times, it's atmospheric and compelling; at others, it's dull and undisciplined. Essentially, it follows a few different story strands featuring characters who eventually cross each other's paths in relatively intricate ways. It also jumps back and forth between a couple of time periods to provide backstories for some of its major players, focusing on their parents in order to give you a better understanding of what makes them tick. The picture deals with things such as faith, sin, delusion, fate and family, positing that violence always begets violence but sometimes can't be helped anyway. Occasionally, it's interesting and well-conceived, but it's just as often uninspired and clumsy. This is frustrating, to say the least. There's persistent narration (from the source novel's own author) that initially seems like a way to add flavour and condense the flick's lengthy set-up (seriously, it's about an hour long) but eventually evolves into a way for it to simply tell us what its characters are thinking. It isn't awful and can sometimes be rather atmospheric, but it feels somewhat intrusive and, frankly, unnecessary. Sometimes, it's almost like the movie is supplementing the narration rather than the other way around. Another issue is that the film feels as though it lacks a solid through-line. Even its individual stories seem like a series of isolated events until they suddenly start to come together towards its conclusion. It's in its final movement that the affair finds its most success, as its stories start to satisfyingly intertwine and a strong sense of foreboding creeps in. You're never quite sure how things are going to end up, which makes for a fairly tense finale. Overall, the film is a mixed bag. It's atmospheric, well-made and often enjoyable. It's also long, unfocused and relentlessly grim. It could have done with a bit of tightening up, to be honest. However, the further away you get from it, the more fondly you remember the experience. Perhaps that's primarily because it has such a solid third act. It leaves a stronger impression in retrospect than it does in the moment. In the end, it's a good movie that's dampened somewhat by its flaws. 6/10"
685,"Arvin Russell confronts an evil that seems to haunt him since childhood, in the small town of Knockemstiff, Ohio. High expectations, huge disappointment. The cast is certainly talented, but with such a dispersed and somewhat linear narrative there is no place for any memorable interpretation. One of the problems of the film is the excess of information without the proper background, which leaves the characters incomplete, without the depth needed to understand their true intentions. Having a narrator (the author of the novel, in case you didn't know) throughout the film does not make sense for the story, and is a distracting factor at times. It is a kind of modern 'Magnolia', but pretentious and poorly directed. Netflix needs to step up their game, fast."
686,"Why are there so many good reviews?? I'm 45 min in and just hate it, there's no real plotline, just some crappy religious background. I really can't understand the hype, not even for those actors.
I expected something else, something that keeps the interest to watch it but I'm close to just stopping it. Why was this movie even made? Some religious shocking thing? idk. I just....disappointed for the wasted time."
687,"If you ask me, id say the other reviews are mostly lies. So why believe me? I dont know...This movie was horrible.The other reviews did say it was dark, and the acting was good... sure thats true. They did act out their characters correctly in this dark, slow, boring, pointless story.There was nothing new in this story, no interesting point in the story, no meaning, no message. Let me tell you that when this movie ends you feel ripped off, cheated; they've wasted your time.Two stars for acting out this boring, sad, pointless story."
688,"It reminded me of Fargo & O Brother where art thou? Though not to that standard it has a quirkiness similar to both. Whilst the acting is good in most places, the story doesn't explore the motivations of the characters...the reasons for their actions etc. I thought the soundtrack was great...lots of songs from the past. Tom Holland was the stand out actor...underplayed yet spot on. The film lacks pace...excitement etc....and as such just ambles along. The worse thing about this movie is it's length. It is way too long ....especially after the first hour...you're Thinking...what another hour to go! Best to watch in two or three viewings in my opinion. I won't be watching it again...it is ultimately forgettable."
689,"This film start with a father ""Willard"" praying with his son ""Arvin"", and the flashbacks of Willard killing a man while serving at the war scene! As turnout, this film is about Arvin need to revenge for his suicide sister ""Lenora"" by killing the priest ""Preston"", who impregnate Lenora, and a serial killer ""Carl"", who murder Lenora's father! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the singing scene, and overuse of the narration scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene in the film also portray by sideways! Make the film quite frustrated to watch! Barely intense scene is, Roy stab Helen with a screwdriver, and try to resurrect her after that! At the end, Arvin killing all the people involve in Lenora and her father death! Arvin yawning in the car at the very end! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"
690,"Boring, pointless, depressing, remash of a bunch of others."
691,"Every aspect of this movie seems to be almost flawless. The script, acting, cinematography.In the first ten minutes I wondered how they were going to weave it together, but the story flows effortlessly, bringing together their individual stories to diverge into one.Being over 2 hours might make you hesitant but if you have time, i would highly recommend. Some movies of this length may feel like they are dragging on but there isn't a single dull moment and they made it well paced.On a final note the acting was superb from highly recognised and talented actors/actresses. (although a particular accent made me laugh when i first heard it). This is of course helped with a wonderful script, where dialogue and scenes are written beautifully."
692,"One of this film's enormous mistakes begins immediately with an overlong voiceover narration from an anonymous narrator, an irritating feature that continues throughout the film. When utilized skillfully, a voiceover can enhance a film (i.e. ""The Shawshank Redemption""). Here, it serves no purpose, sometimes even describing in excruciating detail the events that are literally occurring onscreen.The cinematography is excellent, and the film is visually compelling, with near perfect lighting and framing - which makes the unnecessary voiceover even more frustrating; leaning on those strong visuals and forgoing the novelistic monologues would have made the experience much more enjoyable.While a lot of the performances are great, the film features an overwhelming number of well-known actors including, but not limited to: Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Mia Wasikowska, Bill Skasgard, and Sebastian Stan. For a film focusing on small, rural communities, it perhaps would have been more interesting and original to cast lesser known or debut actors, especially for the young male lead played by Tom Holland.As a whole, this film didn't really know what it was saying. It spent over two hours ambling on, trying to find its voice. None of the characters really exhibited any motivations or arcs. There were so many tropes and themes that didn't offer anything new and were simply done better in other instances:An unhinged preacher who claims to have the power of divine healing? ""There Will Be Blood"" did it better.Small town folks conflicted by their religious culture? Literally any Flannery O'Connor story did it better.A reverend suffering from insatiable lust? ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" did it better.Someone murdering their wife with an unconventional weapon? Sweeney Todd did it better.So if you have almost 2 1/2 hours to kill, I guess give this film a watch. If not, you're not really missing out on anything."
693,"The three stars are for the acting by the 3 leads. This highly contrived, sordid tale of hapless victims and vile predators wastes the talents of all those involved. This is simply miserable offal offered as entertainment for folks with nowhere to go like cruise ship passengers trapped in a voyage of the damned."
694,"""The Devil All the Time"" just barely squeaks by with a 6 out of 10, only because I can't give 5.5's out on IMDB. And I give it that because of the satisfying cinematography and outstanding performances. But other than that, this isn't that far above average, and the 10 out of 10 raving ""OMG"" reviews are way too much.Like many, I was curious because of the stellar cast, but even the first 45 minutes with Bill Skarsgard's character could be cut out entirely, with all of what he taught his son and what he did in the past being condensed into a gripping monolouge delivered by Tom Holland's character speaking about his past.I get that this is a bleak story, but the likelihood that the area around ""Knockemstiff"" is *this* filled with corrupt, sociopathic lunatics is a lot to believe and very convenient. We get it: everyone around here is an awful person. Nobody has dreams, ambitions, defining traits or characteristics, or anything else much significant about them aside from their worst tendencies, which makes every character feel flat regardless of how great the acting is.
Spoiler alert, but the (arguably) film's only sympathetic character of course still gives into grief and tragedy, regretting her suicide attempt only to accidentally kill herself, which again, completely defines her by the most bleak, depressing thing the writer could think of. On top of all of the other constant misery in the story, it gets a little silly at that point.The movie shows us that faith can be abused and misused, but even from an atheist's perspective I felt this went too far. Like I said earlier, I get it. Now try to show us a three dimensional argument or viewpoint about religion, or how it affects character development. Nope, it's just used to make the characters do bad and crazy stuff.A lot of storylines such as Sebastian Stan's corrupt sheriff character only meagerly contribute to the plot and overall feel. If the scenes of him interacting with the local crimelord were cut from the film entirely, it would still make sense and still give the same conclusion. A slick con-artist of a preacher manipulating a town with one man knowing the truth, a pair of married serial killers, a corrupt sherrif trying to do the right thing, any one of these ideas could have been fleshed out into a whole movie, and this one gives us flat versions of all of them at once.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a total waste of time. The stellar and committed cast bring this imitation, dollar-store brand No Country for Old Men (an actual nihilistic crime thriller with a credible protagonist) up a notch, and like I said, the camerawork and soundtrack bring it up a few more notches also. No Country for Old Men or Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, or even Lawless with Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf are all far superior rural American crime thrillers that have much more human characters and coherent stories.Devil All the Time? Nah, I think even Satan takes an off day every now and again."
695,"The sort of movie that will gather much favor because it has a few A list celebs portraying characters far from their usual efforts, which is unwarranted, I'm sorry to say. While it's true the cast does a commendable job, they can't hide the facts: this is a hollow film. the narrative depends heavily on the shock value of murders, suicides and a few grizzly images; yet, the heavy handed story and ponderous, slow way it's told is a tedious thing indeed. The first hour feels like an overcooked introduction to a very lengthy narrative, that ties everything up at the end: it does not. It all falls apart into meaningless, lazily connected chapters. Perhaps the source materiel could have worked in a series or something. As is, it's a waste of your time."
696,This movie portrays ALL the characters as Christians that are crazy psychopathic murderers. If your a Christian you will find it so offensive.
697,"I have long been a fan of the Southern Gothic genre that critiques what we accept as normal while also telling a good damn story and this film has done both. Loved Tom Holland as Arvin and the chicken liver scene was one of my favorites in recent history. The omniscient narration made it feel like the god - who seemed to only betray the characters of this movie - was actually there watching all along and making sure things went down the way they had to.8/10 because it seems out of place both in 2020 and in the setting of the 50s and 60s not to deal with racism or even have a Black character. Also, Pattinson's accent was atrocious and took me out of the movie at times."
698,"Finally! FINALLY!! I'd just about given up hope of any film of quality being made anymore. There's that much utter dross about these days - if it's not a Superhero film, crammed to the gills with CGI or so vapid that only those with the intellectual capacity of a goldfish will enjoy it, it gets panned as ""boring"" or ""too slow"". Perish the thought that you may have to actually think about it a bit, that it isn't all served up on a plate so you don't have to look away from your phone. This film restores a bit of faith (no pun intended)."
699,"I am not surprise to see another anti-religion film on netflix brought to you by the marxist Obamas and other limousine elites who pontificate their perverse version of morality by telling you how immoral you are.
The acting is good, but the plot is pure gore and a hit piece on religion.
If you like gratuitous gore, a senseless plot, and religion-exploitation, then this is your film. But beware, you are wasting your precious life watching this crap. While the producers of this film are getting rich off your dime, all you attain are horrific images you can't erase from your mind ever, and a loss of 2 hours of your precious life."
700,"Solid acting, decent photography, proper music/ambiences to set the action and the mood (finger at you nflx productions, the worst movie soundtrack selections in movie history!).
Finish with a compelling story and competent director and we've got ourselves a good movie!
The characters and plot were properly built throughout and that alone helps you bond more with the movie and allow yourself to wait for scenes to develop where otherwise you would feel bored."
701,I didn't make it until the end..just depressing disturbing and boring. It felt like a very poor copy of a Tarantino plot
702,"SPOILERS!'The Devil All the Time' is an interesting film with fantastic acting all around. It is engrossing in its Southern-Gothic style and themes (even if it's partially set in Ohio). And it is one of the most disjointed, meandering films I've ever seen. Yes, the through-line is faith, the faithful, and how that is distorted and turned into evil by fallible human beings, but the variety of subplots -- trauma passed down from father to son, a serial-killing couple, a corrupt small-town sheriff, orphaned children, misled churchgoers, and immoral preachers -- yearn to be fleshed out. There's just too much happening in this film for even its two-hours-plus running time.You'll likely want more: more of Tom Holland, more of Bill Skarsgard, more distinction between the two settings, more backstory about the role of faith in the residents' lives, more explanation of the corruption in the town and its connection to its fixation on religion, more about the serial-killer couple, etc. There are so many threads and great stories in this film that it could sustain at least a season of a limited-run series, and probably much more. Look at the sprawling 'Castle Rock' and imagine what could've been done with this story, which I think could be much more affecting. Even the briefest subplots -- the corrupt sheriff and his relationship with organized crime in his town -- would make for a terrific, 'Fargo-' like criminal landscape that would enrich this tale.And the narration, while charming and well performed by writer Donald Ray Pollock, is intrusive in the space of even over two hours. I kept expecting to hear, ""The Duke boys sure were in a lotta hot water after killing that preacher!"" when the narration would unexpectedly kick in, and one shouldn't be reminded of that in a story as heavy and complex as this.MAN, I wish they'd do a series based on this story! I am now interested in tracking down Pollock's novels, but I'm still left with a bad taste in my mouth from the way this film's storytelling was bungled. Thank goodness all actors involved did a fantastic job -- because of them, elements of this story will stay with me. As they should."
703,"Well-made in almost every department, The Devil All The time somehow remains just a little meandering, distracted and dull the whole way through, which must be hard to accomplish with such dramatic source material. There didn't seem to be any reason to tell this story, other than Netflix wanted another movie: at no point did I ever connect with, warm to, or become intrigued by any of the characters, or care about what would happen to them. They all just seemed like temporary props I was looking at while waiting for the actual story to begin, and it never did.The wheels really start to come off towards the end with a conversation between Tom Holland and the preacher that feels entirely out of character and thoroughly unbelievable, given the time, the setting and his character's age. A twist to do with a gun shooting blanks is also far-fetched and unneccessary. An obtrusive voiceover continually attempts to link up and explain what the script and performances can't be bothered to. It's all lazy and boring and, as usual, half an hour too long.I've been trying to fathom the factors at play in what has gone so wrong in the cinematic age we're all living through - obviously there's the increased valuing of political virtue signaling over story, character and believability, but I've been wondering if another one of them is the amount of time people are spending in the world of video games, where they are becoming accustomed to 'story' being just a series of busy, exciting moments with no connective tissue. When someone tries to kill you in a first person shooter, it's not considered at all important why that person is doing it: no energy is given to trying to understand the internal causes of any actions or behaviours, past simple fight or flight level responses. What any of it means. To do so would actually be detrimental to the mission and just slow the game down.So there is increasingly zero depth or reflection expected, no space to breathe, contemplate, think... but this absence of actual story is what more and more people are becoming accustomed to calling story, to the degree they don't really realize there's anything missing. This was also the great flaw in Joker, an otherwise gorgeously made and acted series of moments that never added up to anything that made sense or meant anything. The essential impression with all these films is that they are colourfully painted empty shells: there's no ""there"" there.It's a trend I've been seeing more and more, especially since the lines between film and TV have become so blurred - I first remember noticing it with shows like Boardwalk Empire, which had fantastic production values, acting and period detail, but seemingly no idea about what story to tell: it simply meandered along from one situation to another with no real point for existing other than to be an entertainment product that looked like a movie. Well, now it's ever more common to see movies that don't seem like movies, and The Devil All The Time is sadly just another one of those."
704,"Where do I begin? There's extremely unnecessary narration through out the film that reminds you of a cliche 90's or early 2000's movie, it just doesn't fit at all. The direction of the movie is confusing for the first hour and 20 minutes, it's like the director was either trying too hard or not confident in what he wanted to do. All the waisted time in the beginning could've been used to develop certain characters but it wasn't so certain events felt rushed/forced and the main characters felt hollow. Also the story ultimately could've done without the excessive religious stuff, it ended up doing nothing for the plot. This film had a lot of potential because of the great cast but fell extremely short imo."
705,"Good acting from everyone, but the plot is not clear"
706,A pure wasting of time. Just a story of poor & desperate people. Than that narrator voice... very annoying.
707,"When you know what will happen before it actually does the filmmakers have failed miserably. The dog's fate and the preacher with the young woman are examples. Moreover, having the dog visually hanging on a cross was horribly disgusting and not necessary as the film makers went for cheap shock value instead of allowing the viewer to use their imagination. Frankly, I question if that portion of the story needed to be transferred from book to film in the first place. Graphic gory scenes are the laziest way to convey plot points. Think Psycho versus Friday the 13th. The acting was good enough, but wasted on a bad adaption."
708,"I'm just so upset. I love Scarsgard and was thoroughly enjoying this film before bed but one scene has left me sick to my stomach. If an animal death is hard for you then caution, nothing graphic but disturbing nonetheless. Please Hollywood, stop killing the family dog, it adds nothing except upsetting your audience. I was really loving this movie but now I'm, ugh! Maybe I can finish tomorrow. I'm not a crazy liberal either, just happen to really love mans best friend"
709,Bad story. Only god god stories. Lots of good actor/es but this movie is waste of time. Dont look.
710,"In a desperate attempt to make something epic, it turned out to be mediocre"
711,"I lived and worked in Pittsburgh for many years and people would tell ""West Virginia"" jokes from time to time that generally dealt with incest or ignorance. This film is an extremely dark representation of all of the social ills that those West Virginia jokes dealt with. The characters and vignettes are so bizarre, it is difficult to determine whether the acting is good or not. The camera work may be good, but the film is so depressing it does not stand out...there is no beauty. Poverty and filth only add to the horrible existence the film portrays. This film does not take the viewer anywhere positive. It is hard for me to understand how The Devil all the Time is so popular. It was so depressing, bordering on offensive, and it took me several attempts to sit through it."
712,"If you enjoy watching abusive, hypocritical, illiterate Christians bowing before two pieces of wood nailed together in the woods and yelling at their god, and killing the family dog in front of a young son as a proposed exchange for curing cancer, then this flick's for you. You may also like seeing a war veteran slashing himself with a razor and letting his child find his corpse on the evening of his mother's funeral, or a preacher man taking his loving wife out to the woods to pray and stabbing her in the neck with a screwdriver.All that happens within the first 38 minutes, but I can't tell you anymore because I saw more than enough of this pointless drivel and those were 38 minutes too many."
713,"Enjoyed the plot till the end. Pattinson, Holland, Clarke and Stan did great job. At first, I thought the stories would be dull but I am wrong! Just watch till the end, and know that everything will put on justice by accident... As Pattinson said in the movie : Delusion!!!"
714,"The devil all the time is a slow-burn crime drama movie that was awaited due to the promising and talented cast, and it takes place in 3 main arcs, arvin's (tom holland) arc the hot blooded young man, the preacher's arc (robert pattenson), and the serial murderers and sherrif arc.I liked
Tom holland's, bill skarsgard's and robert pattenson's performances and i think they are the mot memorable thing in the whole movie.Cinematography was beautifully done.But i think that is just it?
I didnt like that narrative in every break between scenes, i feel like there are some scenes if left to the audience to figure it out it would be more interesting, also there was some backstories that i think was just meaningless? I mean ik that everything is supposed to be connected but that was bizarre and i didnt really see the point in the whole plot with the last act and twists being quite predictable.
I think there was more potential to that movie than what were shown to us but i really liked the performances of those young actors whom we are gonna watch a lot in the next decade or so."
715,"The premise of this movie is that all Americans are evil, besides the main family, all others are evil maniacs, criminals, psychopaths. And poor people are quite dumb. Religion is bad ( I agree with that), and guns are useful only in the hands of teenagers. I didn't like it, I didn't like Pattinson to much before, now even less. I don't know why good actors accepted the roles, because it did no good to their career. In a hope for an Oscar I guess. Life is depressing anyway, this kind of movies makes it even worse."
716,First of all the story sucked my eyeballs in watching. the cast was good overall. kinda hope a happy ending for Arvin.
717,"Not a great story, but ordinary. Robert's work make me feel like he's really a great actor but not being given the right role."
718,"The Devil all the Time is the type of film with all the potential ingredients to make a haunting experience that would make Fincher proud, but never manages to make it a memorable meal.Performance wise, the flick packs a mighty punch. Tom Holland has to convey so much with his portrayal and manages to not only convince an audience, he demands appreciation with his work here. His character is many things in the film: caring, troubled, stoic, intimidating and yet good-hearted. All of these aspects to the character are made or broken by the performance, and Holland nails every step of the way. Consider this a throughline in the film, as all of actors put in their best effort.The plot itself comes across as honest and grounded. It feels authentic in showcasing the best and worst of its characters and events. You'll feel uncomfortable and charmed while the switching back and forth between these two emotional states feels earned and natural.Unfortunately, the stellar performances and mature plot crumble under the weight of the cheer length of the flick. At two and half hours, the feature needed more to earn my investment. Several scenes and plot points felt predictable. The numerous plot lines and their interconnection were cleverly constructed yet unsurprising. Any challenge for the audience to read between the lines or the nuances in the actors' performances, is negated by overbearing narration that spells out anything and everything that could've been picked up by an invested viewer. It's pretty cool that the author of the novel the film is based on, is the narrator but it ads nothing to the story or characters.In the end The Devil all the Time is a film that can be appreciated for its honesty and performances, but will be forgotten because of its lack of memorable scenes and impact."
719,"....and what made/makes The Manson Family possible (only) in the US.
Why the violence in this film? Why the religion? Why the war, the handguns, the religion, the false prophets and the serial killers?
Here's why:
This movie is a portrait of the US.
A bloody history-lesson even.
This movie is the story of how a country and a culture build on a) violence and war b) religion and sacrifice and c) false prophets, be it Christ, fathers, preachers, presidents....makes the Charles Mansons (the false prophets, presidents, murderers etc.) of the world possible. Or rather: The story of why people follow them. What it takes. What kind of culture and upbringing makes it possible for people to follow them - and kill in their name.
The movie is about a) Family and b) Tom Hollands character is named Atkin (like Manson Family member Susan Atkins) and c) Holland gets into Mansons VW bus in the end, driven by Manson himself (check out the bus online, if you doubt me).
SO in a nutshell: It's about the history of the US - and why it is politically, culturally and pop-culturally (the serial-killer duo - another US-trademark - likes photography) so f...... deranged.
Peace out,
Filmgospel."
720,"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill Skarsgård) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy.This is a jumble. There is a lot here. There are some good performances. Skarsgård is especially good. The cast is terrific. There is a sense of places and times. It would be nice if the story could be simplified to just Arvin's life. There is too much story with too many characters although it's never confused. I love the themes of religion and death. I also love that this movie is going for something expansive. It's probably going for too much."
721,"#MovieReview #TheDevilAllTheTime #TomHolland #RobertPattinson #Netflix #SpoilerFree #HollywoodThe Devil All The Time is a disturbing, downright haunting film narrating the life of a young Mid-western orphan (played by an exceptional Tom Holland) who has to face tragedy after tragedy in his life.Despite its unpleasant storyline, captivating performances from Holland, Bill Skarsgard, Eliza Scanzen and, a bone-chilling antagonist played by Robert Pattinson give an edginess to this thriller.You are appalled at the sheer cruely and unfairness of it all but unable to look away at the same time.Director Antonio Campos deserves praise for weaving a narrative that is bleak and depressing, yet gripping the viewer with a thread of hope here and there.Not for everyone, this one. If you like dark thrillers, this might work for you."
722,"You know little tubby Dudley Dursley from Harry Potter? Well I just did :)
I think his (short) part was more believable than Patts, although patts still was pretty good.Tom Holland steals the show though in this (not necessarily new), but great movie.A dark tale interwoven nicely with different characters' stories, I'd recommend it to people over 25, anyone younger might find it a drag."
723,"The Devil All the Time creates an intense & oppressive atmosphere. Basically, the wheel is not reinvented, you have already seen a lot of things, but the shown is still convincing and everything is well and valuable staged.Religion and its influence on people is a central part of the film (is not everyone's cup of tea). Several storylines tell the story of individual characters, which are brought together in the course of the movie.Some of the storylines are predictable and due to the short screen time of some characters their backgrounds will only be scratched. Nevertheless, the characters are interesting and well set in scene.I was skeptical at first and did not have high expectations. All in all The Devil All the Time is a solid & convincing thriller, which I would definitely watch again."
724,"Man, that was tough. Campos' The Devil All the Time is a heavy and difficult film to watch. It's long, it's slow and it's filled with one horrible character after another. Yet for some reason, I couldn't turn my eyes away.I really don't know what it was. This is exactly the type of movie that I would nine times out of ten, find to be extremely boring. It's almost excruciatingly slow throughout. Nearly every character just becomes worse as time goes on. This film also lacks a clear ending and beginning. The story begins in the middle of an already ongoing story. And it ends without giving any closure. Indeed, this movie is nothing but a mere 138-minute snapshot of the lives of a few characters living in rural America with nothing but themselves and their faith to live with.It's not just the slow-moving story, or the long runtime, or the awful characters, that make this movie a difficult watch. The Devil All the Time is full of disgusting acts committed by nearly everyone. It's brutal and real with how it deals with these acts. Yet for some reason, I was glued to the screen and I can't tell you why. Perhaps it was the amazing performances by the unbelievably star-studded cast, or perhaps it was the beautiful cinematography or the score that seemed to make every scene that much more powerful. Whatever it was, it affected me. It made me appreciate this movie against all odds.I really don't know who I would recommend this film to. Like mentioned, it is a hard watch. It takes its time and never really satisfies you, but I found it to be powerful. And I think that this is going to be a very hit or miss film. Either you are going to like it, or you are absolutely going to hate it. I would take that chance though, because if you do end up liking it, it will be an experience, to say the least."
725,"I went completely blank into this movie. Didn't even read what it was about. And damn..... Indeed the devil was there all the time. I was surprised about the acting, good cast(!) And it was okay, patterson felt 'forced' at times trying to nail the accent and his character, but again it was ok. For some reason, this movie hit a nerve with me, with the whole God worshipping folks and people taking advantage of one another""in the name of the Lord"", but that was the point right. A lot of realistic bad things that can happen in your life and subjects you can relate to. Movie was nicely shot and the nice quiet places (woods, lake, etc...) Just adds to the sickness. The characters were build up fine, sometimes I lost the red line of the story because there was a lot going on."
726,"This is one hell of a depressing movie. The title is fitting. There is hardly a pleasant character in this movie. There's a corrupt cop, gangsters who buy him off, murderous religious nutcases, a serial killing couple, a perverted preacher.About the only two characters who register as decent are just born to be victims of this violence and corruption, and you know it is inevitable that they are going to start using it, either on themselves, or on each other.This is a movie where I kept looking at the timestamp on Netflix to see how much longer there was to go, not because I was bored, but because I wasn't sure how much longer I could stand the horrible bleakness.I stuck it out though. I'm glad I did. The strength of the performances carry you through, and I suppose we all have a perverse fascination in seeing just how much more messed up it can get."
727,"Great direction. Great script. Great cinematography. Feels like a Coen brother adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel in the first half. I was thoroughly impressed until the third act, which I think the film loses its focus and resolves weakly. Quite a shame because the final product shows a lot of potential. Had the ending been better, and the focus on established themes continued to the film's final moments, this could have easily been one of the best films of the year.SPOILERS
While heavy handed in it's delivery, the film shows from many perspectives how corrupted religion can become and how it destroys lives. At the end of the film though, the main theme somehow becomes fighting the evils in the world in general. This peculiar shift in focus is the film's major problem, and it also applies to Tom Holland's Arwin being the centerpiece at the end while shunned for a more sprawling narrative for a big chunk of the movie. While I'm not against Arwin surviving, I'm certainly not in favor of the direction it takes to keep him alive. The film does not want to kill their prized star. They make it very obvious and it is disappointing.Another gripe I have is how the film explains it's plot and themes to it's audience - it holds your hand instead of letting you decipher the ideas yourself. ""This person is no good, and also that person."" Look, I get it, you clearly showed it in your many other scenes. Why said it out loud? Those short flashbacks are also superfluous. Not everyone in the audience has goldfish memory, although the director thinks we do.Overall, Tom Holland's performance is good but rather inconsistent. Patterson did an excellent job as the pastor, although his terrible accent did stick out at certain moments. This pretty much sums up all my major problems with the movie. I still like it a lot though, because the direction and dialogue are truly above average. I would imagine the Coen brothers taking on the same material and deliver a very similar but slightly better work. Lots of unrealized potential."
728,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWillard Russell (Bill Skarsgard) returns home from World War Two to his small rural hometown in America, only for his beloved wife Charlotte (Haley Bennett) to develop cancer, pushing his grip on sanity over the edge, and forcing his son Arvin (Michael Banks Repeta) to pray with him for her recovery, even sacrificing their pet dog in the hope, only to no avail, resulting in his suicide. Years later, the grown up Arvin (Tom Holland) looks out for his adopted sister, the devoutly religious Lenora (Eliza Scanlen), only for her to fall prey to the charasmatic, recently arrived Reverand Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), putting him on a collision course with serial killer pair Carl (Jason Clarke) and Sandy (Riley Keough.)The 1950's was a very transformative time, in the chain between the present day and the outwardly puritanical years before them, during which two world wars condemned a generation of men to an air of unresolved trauma. While 'Elvis the Pelvis' caused a stir in popular culture, those raised with the traditional values of years past struggled to adjust to the changing new world. And so, it has, and always will, provide a perfectly suitable, lingering backdrop for misty film noirs, such as this effort from writer/director Antonio Campas, and narrated with the dark, gravelly drawl (giving it a Big Lebowski vibe) by Donald Ray Pollock, who also wrote the novel the film is adapted from.The retro 50s soundtrack is almost identical to 1997's unforgettable L.A. Confidential (most notably Kay Starr's harmonious melody Wheel of Fortune), and invokes pleasing memories of that great film. They're both fairly similar, in their attempts to lift the lid off the still seemingly innocent and wholesome 'American dream' of the time, and TDATT certainly has the scope and potential to weave an intriguing and complex tale. It's downfall is maybe being a little over ambitious, and as such ends up losing it's narrative focus somewhat, leaving you with too much to take in and losing grip on the main arc it's exploring.Cast wise, Skarsgard capitalizes on his post Pennywise fame, and uses the first half of the film he occupies to broaden his range, while Pattinson, probably the second most high profile cast member, demonstrates a sharper range than another Twilight film, in a project where none of the cast, especially not Clarke and Keough's eerie serial killers, hit a bum note. But, ultimately, Derek Cianfrance's quite similar The Place Beyond the Pines nails the 'sins of the father' theme more successfully. ***"
729,"The Devil All the Time's social commentary on religion being an opium of the people is really visceral and raw, that when you finish watching the film it truly
encompasses that even in a house of worship, it is highly possible for a counter force to be at work, in this case, it being the temptations of evil and the corrupt devil. There's so much corruption and toxic wrongdoings that you end up rooting for solely one character, who is the metaphorical driving hope in the film despite the town's strenuous complexities.It offers great narration and also a great exploration of how each character's stories overlap with one another, fully bringing their small community and world to life gradually on film and motion picture.It is a great synergy of genres, namely drama and thriller, as it somehow always sneaking in an unnerving feeling of lack of trust in the citizens of the town."
730,"Looks like this movie is getting a lot of mixed reactions and I can understand why. The themes in this story have been explored in very similar execution before. The idea that the sins of our parents can be passed on to us and create a sort of cyclical effect is not a new one. The Place Beyond the Pines comes to mind. Where I think this particular movie excels is, for one, in the performances. Robert Pattinson is definitely a stand out for me. His accent makes his voice so interesting to listen to. It's smooth yet slightly high pitched and weasily at the same time. He was totally believable as a slimy preacher who could charm a crowd with his words. But the performances are rock solid across the board. Tom Holland is great as an angsty teenager with a strong sense of right and wrong and a resentment for religion. Jason Clarke as a creepy photographer/serial killer was great. Bill Skarsgard, Haley Bennett, Sebastian Stan and all the other side players are perfect for their roles. There's not a weak link in sight. Not even the child actor.The music is consistently forboding, which I love. It builds the tension in every scene so well.And although these themes have been explored in more or less the same way in the past, it doesn't make some of the scenes any less impactful. The violence is brutal but it never feels pornographic (aside from the pornographic serial killer subplot of course, but even then it's played as unsettling rather than ""cool"") And of course there is the idea that violence begets violence. And that's here too. But I think Antonio Campos is a very capable director and in his hands these scenes play out with such a human touch that I can't help but imagine their worlds and lives outside of the scope of the film. They feel like genuine people to me.The way Antonio Campos frames the beginnings of these intertwining lives in the 50's feels nostalgic and deceptively calm. This is all of the love and happiness that preceeds all of the tragedy.I loved Christine. I really enjoyed this. And I look forward to seeing what Antonio Campos does next, especially seeing as he's able to pull in much bigger named actors now."
731,"I'll remember the name Antonio Campos, and I urge you, reader, to do the same... So that we can avoid everything he ever lays his hands on for the rest of our days.Gratuitous, vacuous, and vile, is as descriptive as I need to be. A pointless plot with hideous imagery, and nothing to offer the world but bile.I strain to think why these actors would have chosen to partake in this feature, and I strongly hope that seeing the final product for themselves will help them to be more discerning in the future.ADVICE: AVOID ENTIRELY"
732,"I can't believe all the other reviews. Did they see the same movie I saw? This movie had No Redeeming value. No enjoyment. Basically a movie about sick and deranged characters. Not a dark movie, just a sick movie. What a waste of good talented actors."
733,I could not continue beyond 30 minutes...too dark and sad and scary..That's probably how good/bad the movie gets as it's too much for some viewers.
734,"It's a well made flick. It just seems like it's trying awfully hard to make the point that Christians are evil and/or stupid, and God is a myth.
There are so many movies like that now that it just makes me roll my eyes."
735,It was actually good. A bit too long. Disturbing and controversial. Seems like Tom Holland is the only one with good aiming in this movie and also what is with the big yawn in the end it's kind of how I felt about this movie.
736,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Not completely successful in its adaptation, the film still has many redeeming graces.JIM'S REVIEW: Except for a Bible-spouting grandma, there is nary a saint in Antonio Campos' film, The Devil All the Time, but the town sure has plenty of sinners to go round. All of these blue-collar townsfolk are desperately in need of some instant prayer and lots of diversity training. In this ambitious film adaptation, this poor and very white population from the areas of Coal Creek, West Virginia to Meade, Ohio certainly need God's intervention. Stat! It's not a town where one wants to hunker down and this film is not a movie one can truly enjoy either, with all of its flawed characters and violent codas. Call it a white non-privilege community, or a William Faulkner tragedy of errors, or a Lake Wobegon rural town gone mad. The movie wallows in their despair. In fact, the film has some wonderful narrative voiceovers delivered by the author of the novel, Donald Ray Pollock, which supplies more of the atmospheric gloom and fills in the gaps of the non-linear storytelling with his colorful and insightful prose, the film's chief asset.Ye sinners, take note! This just may be your kinda place. Sex and all sort of lurid acts run through the towns and its people, as we follow a multi-generational plot that spans nearly 30 years. This town is brimming over with fire and brimstone with its fair share of crazed evangelists, mean bullies, serial killers, corrupt sheriffs, and various forms of fornicators. There is much to ingest in this piece of deranged Americana. Perhaps, too much. Yes, there will be blood in this melodramatic hotbed for wayward travelers. But we all know that sacrifices must be paid onto the Lord and that is a foregone conclusion, right? Do I hear an amen, brother?The film is much lofty storytelling that never quite gels into a cohesive script. As a director, Mr. Campos captures the hopelessness and futility of the characters beautifully with his images of poverty and emotional distress. He also creates some violent tableaus that are sudden and highly effective. But as a writer, both he and his brother Paulo, are not very successful in condensing the multiple story-lines and dense plotting without the entire saga becoming contrived.We follow the film's main character, Arvin Russell (Tom Holland), and his tale of personal woe while meeting other secondary characters who fall into his orbit. His kinsfolk are introduced and quickly dispatched with shocking bloody glee. As Arvin's story continues to unfold, the jarring use of their backstories doesn't help much. Editing becomes very episodic and uneven. While the reasons for the characters' interactions become clearer and finally waylays any story confusion by tying up all the loose story threads nicely, the flashback plot device regularly interferes rather than structurally advancing the narrative. There is enough exposition for three movies with all of the excessive sub-plotting going on. Less would have been more.One cannot fault the actors who are very fine in their stock roles. Mr. Holland is excellent as the sad sack Arvin and he gets strong support from a cast that includes Bill Skarsgård in his far-too-short role as Arvin's father, Eliza Scanlen as his deeply-religious stepsister, Lenora, and David Atkinson and Kristin Griffith are his adoptive parents. Also on the sidelines are Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling as two seriously flawed preacher men, and Jason Clarke and Riley Keough as the aforementioned murderers are truly menacing. Add to that, Sebastian Stan who plays an amoral lawman well and Mia Wasikowska rounding out the ensemble by making her wounded character quite memorable as one of the town's few pious victims.The Devil All the Time telegraphs its sins of the father scenario a bit heavy-handedly, but one can easily admire the strong cast and the filmmaker's noble vision, even though I cannot fully recommend the film itself."
737,Yes! Tom got out of just being spider man and demonstrates that he can act in a completely different role of being an dumb and shy adolescent to a more serious character who actually shows feeling and trauma. Great stuff hope he keeps up the good work.
738,"When we think of movies dealing with the consequences of using religion to hide your faults, the perspective is usually told through one tortured individual. However, in the case of the film The Devil All the Time, based on the book of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, the entire story is simultaneously told through the life of a disturbed war veteran, a serial killing couple, a false preacher and an anti-biblical young man in post-World War II Southern Ohio and West Virginia. Now that the film is on Netflix for all to see, how exactly does it fair out with an ensemble cast like Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Sebastian Stan?From the title alone, the main theme behind this movie is the internal evil that comes from within people based on how far they will go in their beliefs, especially if centered around their own religion. As almost everyone in the film is a Christian in some shape or form, they all fall into distinct yet similar rise and fall stories in which their individual demises all linger up to the end. Even though the plot does drag on at points to really get going, that's all intentional so we can let each character experience their own fates at the right time. What could have been overwhelming in any other movie winds up working so well in this film considering just how much evil there can be in even just a few people around the world. The shere darkness in all of humanity is not only shown throughout the film, but in multiple ways, whether it'd be around trying to resurrect a dead relative, or a sinful monster disguised as a spiritual priest, or even the abuse from one's power of the law. No matter how bleak the film gets, it's all done in a way to rightfully show perspectives we as viewers might not be used to in other thrillers.Now in spite of its unique structure, what does keep the film from being able to resonate with broader audiences is its lack of proper reasoning. While the film does show us all bad behavior from the individuals, it ends up spending far less time on what actually makes these sinners tick. Because of that, it makes any potential curiosity from a viewer almost sidelined for what ends up feeling like a narrative consisting of Sunday School lessons. If you're going to tell all of these different narratives, give at least somewhat of a reason as to potentially understand the other side of these characters so that the viewers could actually gain more substance from them. Yes, all these stories tie together in the end for a satisfying conclusion, but there should have been more depth into these narratives behind the darker sides of humanity. On the plus side, the authentic country dialogue, cinematography and music score do give off the intentional creepy aesthetic this thriller is going for, so even with the criticisms, at least you'll have some nice little details to take away from.In terms of other appraisal, the performances are quite spot on, especially from the main cast. Tom Holland's character of Arvin Russell is probably the most morally sincere of everyone in the movie, but even then one can feel for how hard he wants to do good in spite of terrible situations he's placed on. Robert Pattinson does such a good job at making even the most sweet looking people seem intimidating, especially as the dishonest reverend Preston Teagardin, as well as Sebastian Stan presenting the pompously shallow sheriff Lee Bodecker. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke have just as much pathos as they have chuckles playing Sandy and Carl Henderson, so their arc ends up playing a much bigger role than first expected. Given that the film takes place in America in the 60s, the more impressive talents come from foreign actors like Bill Skarsgard, Eliza Scanlen, Harry Melling and Mia Wasikowska playing southern country folk. Given that the movie is a character study on multiple individuals, the cast really knew how to make the most of these delusioned eccentrics.So in spite of its narrative shortcomings and dragged out pacing, The Devil All the Time has just enough thrills, solid performances and intriguing perspectives on natural evil doings to make it an intriguing watch, if nothing else. If you're looking for a flawed but still fascinating look into internal immorality, then this is a good recommendation for the month of horror on Netflix. It's a good thing we're still getting cool thought-provoking movies like this on streaming services instead of movie theaters. As of now, it looks like we're in for a wild ride for what's yet to come on the horizon."
739,"The Devil All The Time is an ambitious film that any cinephile can recognize as a ""pursuit of perfection"" in by the writer. What makes it fall very short of the mark is its lack of originality. What's essentially a 130 minute long metaphor, that aims to use a single character as a vessel for good vs. evil, is simply basic and drab when it draws to the conclusion. Its American Gothic style bows at the feet of giants who have mastered it before such as Paul Thomas Anderson and the Coen Brothers. It does come with some gems though, such as a stellar performance from Robert Pattinson and an even better one from Tom Holland. It's a film that keeps your attention, even though it's terribly predictable. It's entertaining, but not an awe inspiring tale that Netflix and all other parties really hoped for. All in all it's certainly worth a watch, but it's doubtful you'll ever want to partake in another one. 7/7"
740,"Violently grim and intensely depressing; ""The Devil All the Time"" is a harrowing and dark journey into a story that's void of almost all movie going enjoyment."
741,"Americans are messed up. oh, it's just a movie! you'll say. well yeah, but i fully believe something like this could happen in america and there in lies the problem, doesn't it?the actors sell the story (wouldn't have watched it otherwise), although it's entertaining in like a morbid (at times straight up schadenfreude) way."
742,"I don't understand how these mega platforms actually manage to create bad movies when they have such good cast ! Loved the performances but plot is empty and the catharsis is nowhere to be found. After watching the movie all I thought was ""so..?"" . Wouldn't recommend!"
743,"The movie has a lot of big names, i liked the story but the way that they used someone in the background to explain stuff not needed in my opinion, it wasn't much of a Thriller to me but over all it is a good one."
744,"Brilliant story telling, great acting. My only issue was that the ENTIRE movie was orientated around one BAD male after the other, it was relentless. There was one bad blonde woman but she tried to come good in the end so that was neutral. So a brilliant movie which could had been a solid 8 I rated at 5 but settled on 6. Stop making ALL men look like violent sex murdering maniacs. Atleast balance it out a little for the love of apparent so called EQUALITY give it up!"
745,"I LIKE Tom Holland as an actor, and the rest played it well too, therefor not 1 but 2 stars. But i have never seen such a boring movie."
746,I rarely stop watching a movie after 45 min plus i'm a fan of Southern gothic and horror. But these characters are so way below any mentionable human existence without any other reason than their bottomless stupidity that it is not worth watching. I can hardly see any artistic or moral gain by continuing.
747,"This is a movie that is simply suffering from the lack of a real story and well developed characters.
All the acting in the world won't help if your characters are nothing but 1 dimensional characters existing to show how dark and gritty the story is and also insure that we get the message of how a certain people are bad and insane.
The amount of cliches and just corny plot elements is off putting.
But even if we ignore the plethora or cliches the movie has nothing to tell.
Arvin is the closest character we get to an actual character and even then he is boring and simply to undeveloped for me to care about him.
Oddly enough with both a big cast and a 138 runtime it is still boring and when the movie makes a cut from plot A to plot B I'm equally bored by both plotted and feel they offer as much appeal as a week old piece of moldy bread.
The overall gritty take is not flawed here because it's not that it's dark.
It is meaninglessly dark. That's the problem.
I don't want to talk in length about the ""moral"" of the movie as it is obviously trying to hammer in one point with a total disregard to nuances or how to build a story that does not seem to be just direct preaching.
Now it is true that the acting here is excellent. But I'm not interested in mere acting. I want a movie.
Even the cinematography is a meh. And the soundtrack is again average.
All in all I won't recommend this to anyone."
748,"NeoMarxist Netflix propaganda for simpletons.
Standard cinematography.
Predictable boring movie."
749,"This film reminded me of out of the furnace. A movie that presents itself as layered, but offers little substance. The way the film is shot, along with the performances, gives you the impression that if you stick out the slow pace you will be rewarded. Unfortunately, when the film ends it fails to provide a purpose for what you viewed. Normally, when a film evokes sadness that evolves into a borderline depression, I can appreciate the emotion the film provoked and praise it for its effectiveness. By the end it didn't feee effective. Like Out of the Furnace, I couldn't help but feel that what I viewed failed to offer any value. Exceptional performances and a professional ascetic couldn't make up for the frankly outlandish jumble of characters this film presented. Deeply depressing with no silver lining. Nonetheless I would recommend this film for its ability to truly get under your skin. Holland, Pattinson and Skarsgard were great in their roles as well and make the viewing a little more enjoyable."
750,"I'm confused and bored. Acting was good, but I honestly don't see the point in this film. I just feel like the majority of the scenes were pointless ... really disappointed because I was looking forward to watching it."
751,"First of all, despite my title, I have to say that the acting for the most part was fairly good. Unfortunately the story plodded along so slowly that, although I do not have ADD, I kept losing interest in the movie and my mind began to wander as I was watching.Add to the fact that the narration was quite annoying, sometimes narrating something you were actually watching unfold, therefore negating the need for the actual scene since it was being explained to you in detail.All in all not something I would recommend."
752,"Too many plots leaving too many holes. By the the time they finished telling everyone's story and how each person was somehow connected to each other, the movie was over. Acting was great as expected from tremendous actors."
753,"I had different expectations of this movie. It's beautifully made and played. All were great. The story however is just a sloooooow drama with a lot of pointless. The end. I can try to squeeze something out of it,but I just can't. I don't think the story is bad,but it's just not for me. I like a concrete story with ending and clear narrative and this is not even close. It's a bunch of stories clipped together. You can actually make a TV show out of it, showing the lives of all you've seen. There's also very little time to develop any connection as once you do, it's cut and you are seeing a next storyline. Would I see it again, no way. Was the movie good? Sort of yes. Go figure..."
754,"I wish they'd pay attention to the detail with the cars 🚗. as an automotive expert and automotive enthusiast, the truck Willard had sported rally rims that were not available until 1967. Im sure the automotive community could agree.
Hire an expert automotive advisor."
755,"When you see a young actor go into the harder, often violent, often hard to take film it's almost certain for a barrel of question with most of the answers heading towards, can they really pull it off? Tom Holland is that young actor in question, now 24 years old and acting since he was a kid (not that long ago) and the lead actor in a major MCU franchise, well it's almost as if he might not pull it off, the film being mostly set in Virginia the accent might've been hard for a British actor to pull off. Well he does it all in spades, here he is Arvin Russell the only place The Devil All The Time goes as for a good guy character (though not really that good if his past has anything to do with it), Holland's performance is exceptional his co-stars are good especially an always on form Robert Pattinson as the untrustworthy preacher. But it's Holland's performance that really gathers all the plaudits, and yes he pulls it off in a film that's so violent so unforgiving in places that it's almost punishing, it's very hard hitting. And Holland is remarkable through it all, in fact you could almost say The Devil All The Time was made for him. But unfortunately the cast and the stellar performance seem to be the film's strong points sure it packs a punch, but when it comes to the narrative it could be better. It sometimes goes from one place to another really quite quickly and it seems that when it deviates between characters it seems a little rushed. And that, unfortunately is the film's fall point, the atmosphere is good as director Antonio Campos really sets the tone for the gothic presence but unfortunately with the tonal shifts and missing narrative it seems like The Devil All The Time is really just a film to watch maybe once. 3/5."
756,Naw. We wanted to like this and you pull for the main guy but it spins into depressing trash pretty quickly. Can't recommend this junk
757,"This just baffles my mind, they keep pumping out these garbage movies at Netflix and somehow every single one of them has multiple great actors in them which goes to waste totally. My wife and i could barely watch the 1st 15 minutes and then we just turned it off all together. By the looks of it, its just a long dragging boring pointless movie like we have seen to many already from Netflix"
758,One of those movies where you're actually relieved when it finishes. It occurred to me the main purpose of this movie might be for Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson to include in their respective showreels so they've something jarringly different to include compared to their usual fare.
759,"One has to be careful when coming across films with a large ensemble of great actors nowadays. It's almost as if the writers and directors think they can carry the movie no matter how bad it is. What seemed like a promising beginning ended up going no where until the end. The main plot points in this movie boil down to just simple convenience. How is it that Tom Holland's character's car just breaks down at the right time to allow him to wait by a street to get picked up just to encounter Sally and Carl? Is the officer really going back to that place where he first found Holland's character as a child just because he has a suspicion? Anyways, what even is the message behind this story? That killing is fine so long as it's backed up by revenge? There was nothing driving the film forward. It was just a bunch of evil individuals living their lives. Which I guess is fitting to the title..."
760,"Honestly, the cast is great, Pattinson steals the show. But pacing is all over the place. Too long in the beginning and rushed in other places. Bad script. All in all it's really a depressing movie. User score section is full of obvious bot reviews, so the audience score is misleading."
761,"I don't know what I was expecting to be honest, but this was way too slow and all over the place. According to the ratings my taste is a bit off, compared to the masses. No biggie, but I won't be watching this movie again."
762,"Yes, I'm a sucker for the crimson stuff, and that's why i watched ""The Devil All The Time."" Several reviews I've read (""The Guardian"", ""CNN"") had emphasized this. I was hoping to see something as dark as, say, Guy Pearce's ""Brimstone."" It wasn't. ""The Devil All The Time"" was just north of PG-13 into R territory, if you ask me, but then, with young faces in the film like Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland, the movie makers couldn't anger and turn the stomachs of those matinee idols' teen fans. In the end, ""The Devil All The Time"" simply falls in line with a ton of flicks where the preacher/priest turns out to be corrupt mas hell and religion was, once again, used as a weapon or cattle prod to keep people in line. Generally, the all around acting and cinematography was serviceable. See it if nothing else is on."
763,"At the hands of an all Star cast these Stories of Sin and misery are told in a harrowing way which is a treat for the audience, tom holland Shines especially bright in this role Showing his true potential away from the marvel role he is known for, Robert pattinson's ungodly preacher was Well wrote but pattinson's Performance wasa tad bland and unconvincing. Overall this feels like a highlight on Netflix's Catalogue and well worth investing in the 2 hour plus run time."
764,"In backwood towns of West Virginia and southern Ohio during the mid-60s several characters converge around a disillusioned orphan (Tom Holland) devoted to protecting those he loves.""The Devil All the Time"" (2020) is a slow-burn Southern Gothic psychological drama with crime thrills in the mold of ""Undertow"" (2004) mixed with the dismal rural tone of, say, ""Winter's Bone"" (2010), ""Mud"" (2012), ""Joe"" (2013) and ""1922"" (2017).The bleak story emphasizes the deep mysteries of life, like man's brutality to fellow man, premature death, unanswered prayer, religious misbelief/error, justification of sin, corrupt authority figures, the downward spiral of a criminal lifestyle, divine justice (whether you perceive it or not), hope and, maybe, redemption.Some complain that it's ultimately pointless, but it's not. It may be meandering and ambiguous, but it's not pointless. You just have to be braced for a slow drama, degenerate characters, lots o' narration (by the author of the book), time jumps, convoluted storytelling and a muted emotional payoff. Another thing to consider is that the story doesn't become compelling until the last 50-55 minutes.The movie doesn't ridicule people who believe in Christianity, as some have criticized, but rather realistically shows how certain individuals with mental issues can misinterpret the Scriptures or the Spirit's leading, as well as use their position to serve their carnal interests rather than serve people.There are weird and disturbing aspects that are gut-wrenching or disgusting, but the author based these things on real-life cases.It's a quality production with convincing acting/costuming/sets/locations, but the snaky downbeat story isn't for everyone.The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes and was shot in Alabama (Anniston, Montevallo, Birmingham, Oak Mountain State Park and several other points in the area).GRADE: B-"
765,This film is not for everyone. The film is very slow but keeps you thinking about what will happen next. The performances of the cast are great. Tom Holland does great in this role. Robert Pattinson doesn't have much screen time but does good.
766,"The title really had nothing to do with the movIe itself🤔
It was watchable.. But nothing big. Not scary or horror or bloody.."
767,"I follow Robert Pattison to see what films he is in, knowing that he will deliver a solid performance.Ironically, in this film, Pattison delivers, but he doesn't steal the show. Great acting, and directing made this a fantastic thriller.Brilliant writing as well. Unique story. You won't be able to figure this out, and the story just sneaks up on you. Very interesting. Worth watch again to put things together."
768,"The Devil All the Time is a 2020 slow burn American psychological thriller film directed by Antonio Campos. Contrary to the connotation of the title ""The Devil all the time"" which excites the thrill of the unknown, the movie is slow going and dull in some instances. This movie has numerous highlights like the acting of Robert Pattison, also the performance by Tom Holland is great, the way he enacts the character of a boy whose life has just been filled with challenges and setbacks was commendable. Moreover, this movie has a very refreshing screenplay. But all these highlights are overshadowed by the pace of this movie. It is very slow and this slow-pace drags the whole movie down. But thankfully after the hour mark, the movie starts gathering pace and becomes very intriguing as all the good things start to grip together.
This movie is a solid 7/10, with a great cast and strong screenplay, but the unrushed direction kind of brings down the flow and leaves the movie being above average."
769,"The movie is fantastic, while it might be true that it's not for everyone as it is very dark and there are a lot of killings.
But the cast is amazing!! The acting is one of the best I've ever seen."
770,"The Devil All The Time is a nice break from all the ultra-commercial blockbusters with great trailers and lame stories which are all the same.This is hardly an exciting movie. It's slow, long and weird. But if you appreciate high-quality acting and are up for watching a brutally honest story about a very, very good family surrounded by horrible, horrible people, then you will like this movie.Imagine a Tarantino movie - only graceful."
771,"Tom Holland, perfect for the role. Kept it thrilling and to the mark. Not forgetting the others though. Loved how the director completed some early scenes later in the movie which we had first seen from a totally different perspective. How everything changed into a completely different story, putting up a lot of questions to reality and how people perceive things. Messy ways for people to die, in such different sorts. All put together so well in perfect sync!"
772,Geeez Tom Holland truly shows in this movie that he is more than a whiny teenager and that he can show depth and pure hatred when acting. Most of the acting in this movie is spot on and it really makes you dive into the scene. The story of each person was great and I loved how it all connected at the end. There was just a few speed bumps and pacing issues along the way but it was a great ride from start to finish.
773,"I could give you a long list as to why this movie got 10 out of 10 for me... But I will just stick to these few points:The acting was brilliant. Not only did this film kick Holland up a notch in my book, but the supporting actors added the right amount of crazy to an already crazy storyline.It was very well written. Having not read the novel, I can say that this movie got me wanting to read it... And usually it's the other way around. Very well adapted. The screenwriter did an amazing job.The pace of the film as a whole kept you in your toes without giving you too much whiplash. The speed of the story was just right. It's a longer film, but you would never notice it until it's over and you look at the clock. It's that engaging.If you like a bit of mental entertainment with a dash of phenomenal acting, try this one out. It won't disappoint."
774,A gripping southern gothic tale with a stellar task playing against archetype.
775,"To be blunt, Antonio Campos is intense. Not only did he direct, but he also adapted to the screen a book so rich in content, that this was just begging to be a mini-series. Then again, what he attempted here is not impossible. Just look at masterpieces like ""Crash"" or ""Babel"". Needless to say, it's hard to pull it off. Those movies are what they are because they are wrapped in a greater idea, this is not.The movie takes place in a timeline spanning decades after the Second World War. It is cruel not only to its characters, but to their children too. It is a movie of fathers and sons, and how ignorance and aesthetic beliefs can destroy men, women and children alike. But this is not a greater idea. There is no discussion in this. Instead, it's just actual physical actions directing natural selection. The movie is labeled as a drama--and it definitely is--but it also has countless moments of humor. They are all topped off by Donald Ray Pollock as a narrator. At first, this felt like a cliche, but the way he delivers the ridiculous actions done by some of these characters which an unbridled seriosity, feels like something straight out of a Coen Brothers movie. And I swear I could mistake him for number 1 mustache man Sam Elliott.I will not go into the details because I don't want to spoil anything. The point is that while the first generation, fresh out of the Second World War is hellbent on religion, the second one is on its own survival. It makes sense. Campos takes a trip through the American badlands, both in terrain and spirit. Yet by stretching out this trip across not only space, but also time, he is missing out on a lot. Then again, he does get his concept across. Death surrounds everyone. But everyone had it coming. While the post-WWII Americans were killed by their own obsession with religion and ignorance, their sons and daughters were also killed by their own evil.This death-cause-evolution is a welcoming addition in a movie which began by seeming like a parody to Christians--it isn't. The pandemic of evangelism that swept rural America in the 1950s was not surprising for a world who just a few years earlier had a brush with mortality. Campos respects their beliefs and respects its characters, but they are made in such a way that they cannot help but getting into trouble. This seems more of a test of what actual faith implies. No extremism and no stupidity--it is a well-known idea among millenials and gen-X-ers yet one which hasn't been presented in movies until now.Well, there you have it, as much as it brushed past nearly everything, this movie at least slows down from time to time to make sure we get its point. But it's abundance of events sadly does not allow it to sit down and ponder over it just enough to achieve greatness. It's being chased by itself. The best part of it, though--Tom Holland in his least Spider-man-esque role humanly possible."
776,"The screenplay was sloppy but the acting and cinematography were both pretty good. Good enough to get you through the long runtime to an ending that, more or less, ties everything together for a pretty satisfying film overall."
777,"So, initially it was the celebrity caste that attracted me. But is he justified? I think no. It seems to me that such a caste is appropriate in larger films with a strong plot. Or in films where the action develops more smoothly. Here the plot is very fragmentary and seems to be glued together from short films. An attempt to show the relationship of all the characters led to the fact that there was not enough time to prove themselves. The only one who made me feel emotional was Pattinson's character, a local preacher. It turned out to be so skillfully vile that it evokes genuine hatred, that is lively emotions. The rest of the film somehow did not catch me."
778,Could have been 30-40 mins shorter and packed alot more punch. Being so long and drawn out gives the viewer so much time to think that it's trivial to join the dots. Very good acting by all concerned. Worth the watch
779,"This movie is slower than molasses.
PRO: It's a thriller movie told in a different way
CON: It's long, slow, and the ending is just okay.Low scored because I expected better based on ratings and I was very disappointed."
780,"We didn't know anything about the film before we watched it we honestly watched it because of the title and thought it was going to be a ghost/horror film.
we was sure that after the mum died and the dad sacrificed the sons dog it was gonna start getting ..well you know ..spooky . we sat there taking guesses on if the mums going to come back from the dead or the there's going to be a ghost dog or the woods are haunted and the dad opened up the other side by praying like a mad man against a log and got through to the devil instead ,we even joked that when the son went into the woods before he finds his dad dead you could hear a dog barking in the distance and we all said ""pet cemetery !! the woods brought the dog back to life"" but nope we were nowhere near ....
it turns out it's just a very dark story set out in the sticks and its most of its residents are scum of the earth. you have a couple of serial killers a religious nut who kills his wife believing he can resurrect her, a crooked cop, sleazy club owners, school bullies , perverted poachers a pedophile preacher the list goes on..
even though it didn't turn out to be a supernatural movie like we hoped we still found it very entertaining even if the plot was a bit predictable. the actors did a great job and was a good waste of a couple of hours ."
781,An absolute masterpiece. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. So moody and sexy. Drop everything and watch this now.
782,"The film is very bad.
A stereotypical act whose purpose is to attack believers and the church.
Boring, drawn out, uninteresting. Once you realize that the film has no other purpose than to portray religious people as the worst and meanest beings on the planet, it is very easy to predict what will happen next.
One of the worst movies I've watched in this century."
783,"For some weird reason, all criminals in this movie are males. At some point in the movie you ask yourself why some actors accept rolls that are created notably to diminish men... It's not a serious movie. If feels like all women in that particular world are immaculate saints."
784,"A preacher with morals that disappear in convenience is posted in a small town in nowhere America and a Pandora's box of unsightly events burst forth. Ugly and grimy barely literate rednecks, Southern drawls galore, unhinged bible-thumpers and serial killers in a plot on a road to nowhere and you got a pc version of Southern Gothic. Robert Pattinson must be hard up on quality scripts to appear in this C-grade millennial charmer. It's funny how in one of the few mainstream flicks of these times where the entire cast is white you got characters straight out of the Twilight Zone. Considering who released this film it's no surprise. A shame, as the acting is good and the story had potential. Liberals and the chemically imbalanced will love this."
785,I lost interest very fast. I was expecting something darker with all these actors but I guess the director felt like he would rather waste the talent he had on screen. But honestly that's just my opinion.
786,"This film for me was all over the place, the acting was incredible the accents were splendid.However there are many scenes in which rob pattinsons Character ""Teagardin"" was spouting pure nonsense most of the time even in one scene with a girl he is being very inappropriate too remarks he isn't making any sense and he just goes on another tangent.It's a funny nonsensical film in parts with quite a gritty storyline behind it!Not a film I'd pay to watch so I'm thankful for Netflix!"
787,"This movie doesn't live up to the hype created by its glittering cast. First of all the content of the book has been changed to cut off the most interesting parts. The most interesting characters die early in the movie. There is no back stories of the characters which completely ruins the story. Few of the characters which were supposed to look one way look completely opposite in the movie. The acting seemed over the top. Even the much hyped Robert Pattinson couldn't save this mindless adaptation. I couldn't go even half way through. Just getting famous actors won't save a bad movie. The direction seemed to be going everywhere without any direction. The only good thing about this movie is Harry Melling, who was just watchable but even he wasn't convincing.
To conclude, don't watch it. Save your energy for a better movie."
788,"This was an interesting film with a great cast but like most of his movies Robert Pattinson gives an other mediocre performance. Tom holland, Sebastian Stan and Bill Skarsgard were great and the story was interesting."
789,"I was really excited to see this. The stellar cast and story had me intrigued. After seeing it, I have mixed feelings feelings about it.The Devil All the Time has multiple storylines and follows a man who tries to protect those he loves from evil people he meets along the way in a town filled with violence and brutality.What I really liked about The Devil All the Time was its tone and cinematography. The film has a very dark and miserable tone to it which managed to stay consistent throughout. It gave the town a bleak atmosphere that fit really well with the story's themes. A major part of this film is narration and I don't think it was used that well. Whilst the narration seemed integral to this story, there were scenes where I thought it wasn't necessary. The narration would sometimes reveal traits of a character like Jason Clarke's too early. It would have been better if the film developed it as it went along instead of telling us when they're introduced. An editing choice which bothered me was when the film would reincorporate scenes from the beginning. Once again it didn't seem necessary to cut back to previous scenes as I think the film would have benefitted without it so we could establish the link between those scenes.The production design is really good. The old cars and houses matched the time period it was set in perfectly. I feel a big problem with this film was its runtime. The film is 2 hours 10 minutes long but it doesn't feel justified because of how many characters and storylines there are. I think it would have been a better decision if Antonio Campos adapted this into a mini-series so that every storyline and character get fleshed out completely.I thought the cast did a great job. Tom Holland impressed me and I thought his accent was well done. I hope he does more serious roles like this in the future. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke did a great job together. Eliza Scanlen and Harry Melling were also great and Robert Pattinson delivered another splendid performance. Sebastian Stan was fine but there wasn't much for him to work with.Overall, The Devil All the Time is a fine movie. I liked the bleak tone of it all but some of its editing choices, narration and short runtime didn't work for me. I don't think it's particularly memorable and it doesn't stand out from other hyperlink films in the past."
790,"What works in a book does not necessarily work in a movie. 'The Devil all the Time' reinforces this statement, by carrying an abysmal amount of narratives that do not end at a specific point and do not really have a route to follow. It probably would have been better in a Miniseries formato.
Despite its flaws, it features powerful performances and a church scene near the end of the film that is extremely chilling. Impressive Robert Pattinson."
791,"Boring, boring, boring. Actors played a good roll, but if you're looking for something to entertain you then go elswhere. I fell asleep after an hour of watching this, and that's literal"
792,"The story is all over the place and its a bit depressing, slow going at times, dark, moody and broody and you feel every bit of that 2 hr 15 min runtime, however, I must admit I applaud the director - he's taken his own path to deliver a film that's so much more than the sum of its parts and quite unique, I've never really seen many films quite like it and if your religious, its probably a quite uncomfortable watch. Then we have the cast, each and every one of them deliver a stellar performance and to single anybody out for individual praise would be wrong - its pretty much an acting masterclass. All the plaudits aside, this film isn't for everybody - you will either love it or hate it."
793,"""The Devil All The Time"" is well enough acted and shot to earn at least most of its runtime. But what was the point of this film? There was no message or moral to be found throughout the entire movie. It's dark and disturbing, which can be very compelling factors for a movie IF THERE'S A POINT (I.e. Requiem for a Dream). But there is NO point whatsoever. Every single character, with the exception of the protagonist and a few supporting characters, are terrible people, and they make irrational and terrible decisions. And nothing is to be learned from their actions; there is no underlying theme that the movie is attempting to get across. It left me very uncompelled. Not to mention, ""The Devil All The Time"" criminally underuses Robert Pattinson, while leaning too much on Tom Holland, who simply isn't a believable dramatic actor at this point in his career. All in all, visually appealing and featuring several good performances, but otherwise a waste of your time."
794,"BUT ...to put it bluntly Netflix products are overly violent---seems like 95% of their movies are violent---and this movie is a joke, with it's use of sudden death as a way to keep it going---at the end, he is finally able to let his guard down in the hippie's VW bus---everything else---preachers...cops.....all are evil.....HUH?"
795,"At first, to see this movie i was really attracted by the cast who was really rich of potential and i dont thinks thoses actors have signed for another bad netflix film. And a friend asked me why was the film called like that so i tried to understand the answer behind this.The film is separated in two parts, two générations to be more clear who we can « delemilite » by the two pastors. The first is about fear and the second is about lies and this is going to make the continuity of the film.
During the film, a narrator guides viewers to tell the story and describe the characters. The narrator disappears after the death of Robert Patinson, when the character shows this part of devil / evil in him. He can be violent throughout the film, but these actions are driven by the love he had for his family, unlike the other characters.,In the film the characters make 2 types of mistakes, there is first of all the ""failure"" in religion or in humanity,
for example Jason Clarke fails in humanity, Tom Holland fails in religion but not in humanity
Then, two types of actions are made, the criminals and the human ones (the ""human"" action can be a criminal action but they are more empathetic and understandable) for example in the film Sebastian Stan does not want to accept the truth about his sister even though he has seen the photos of his crimes, he desperately wants revenge even though he knows that Tom Holland is right in his defense.The meeting between the character of Tom Holland and the couple was in my opinion a bad choice for the script, I found the coincidence really exagerated, as if they wanted to end the film quickly. This scene is meant to be the thing that connects the characters that we've seen evolve and move during the movie and I see this scene as just an easy choice of storyline. Right after that, in the car, there is the conclusion of the couple's story in some sort of Mexican standoff scene (a scene where all the characters are trapped in a menacing death, they all point a gun at each other. ) I liked this scene because I find it quite unexpected and surprising.I expected the film to be more concerned with the character of Tom Holland who was afraid to become like his father was in the past. Speaking of the father I found him to be the most well written character in the movie, the whole introduction at the end of the war was captivating and got me immersed in the movie instantly it was for the best part .I really don't like the music in the movie, I found it repetitive and all the songs were basically the same with the same melody.
But besides that the scene in the cars was really good, I was really convinced of the moment when the movie was about with the cars, the music on the radio etc.Note:
I gave this film a 7 because I gave three stars for the script, two for the acting, three for the immersion (costumes, atmosphere, etc.) and one for the music and a bonus. So 2 for the script, 2 for the immersion 2 for the acting and one because it was an exciting film."
796,"This movie is like a journey, with beautifully written and acted characters.I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters have done justice to their role, this is one such movie.Highly recommended."
797,"The Devil All The Time follows an interconnected cast of characters over a number of time periods. The film opens with Willard Russell, back from World war II, falling in love, buying a house in the middle of nowhere, and having a son. We see the effects the war had on him, as well as his sometimes ruthless (but barely abusive) treatment of his son Arvin, as they endure the sudden sickness of wife and mother Charlotte. Interspersed is the story of Helen who lost her parents in a fire, and Roy, an enthusiastic new preacher with a penchant for spiders, and their baby daughter Lenora, who ends up being looked after by Willard's relatives when both Helen and Roy go missing one day. Added to this is the story of Sandy and Carl, who meet in a diner and make annual road trips where they seduce, photograph, and murder young men. As the movie goes on the timeline jumps forward, focussing more on Arvin and Lenora as young adults, contending with an abusive preacher in Reverend Teagarden, as well as Sheriff Bodecker, older brother of murderous Sandy. The story grabs this large cast of characters and throws them together at various points in time, until the film's final act that sees Arvin on the run for an increasing amount of somewhat justified murders.There's a hell of a lot of story to this movie and it can be really hard to follow and piece together, especially early on in the film's runtime. I actually had to pause it once or twice to talk it over with my wife and make sure we were both following what was happening. It doesn't help that the film is told outside of chronological order, throwing scenes and interactions in way before they're actually relevant. For instance we see Helen leaving Lenora with Willard's relatives before her and Roy drive off, while the narrator tells us that that's the last time anyone saw her, and her body was discovered seven years later. That's fine. Maybe a bit before it's relevant, but fine. The problem occurs later on when we jump back to Helen and Roy prior to, during, and after the incident that left her missing presumed dead. It makes the earlier scene not only needlessly confusing, but also completely redundant. The very minimal aging of the older characters certainly doesn't help either, making the story of Sandy and Carl a bit tough to establish precisely when they occur in the grand scheme. They meet before Willard even meets Charlotte, but are still around and killing, seemingly unaged, nearly twenty years later.The movie clearly has something to say about the effects of religion on us, from Willard's desperate pleas to god, and crucifixion of the family dog, to save his wife, to Reverend Teagarden exploiting his church for lustful gains, to Roy's delusions of god's power, from Carl treating his murders as a religion unto themselves, to Arvin's complete unacceptance of religion as an impactful part of his life at all. But ultimately it feels too on-the-nose and like it's being whacked over your head. Religion is bad, or at least the people who become obsessed with it and exploit it for their own gains are bad, and that's pretty much where the film's exploration of religion ends. There's no grey area, no questions asked. Just, look at how terrible these religious people are due to religion's role in their lives.Another big problem with how the movie presents its story lies in its pacing. It is a real slow movie, meandering around seemingly without point for a good hour and a half. So much time is spent on Willard and his raising of Arvin, short-changing the debatably more interesting characters. How and why did Sandy and Carl start killing people? This is something that's apparently filled in by the book, but the book shouldn't be necessary for full character development. Sheriff Bodecker also lacks much of a personality at all, and his little sub-plot is completely irrelevant to everything else that happens before or after. Helen and Roy have interesting things going on, but the movie's done with them in the first half hour or so. And despite all the character building we get of Arvin, his relationship with Lenora is surprisingly hollow.
That said the acting is fantastic pretty much across the board. I didn't notice any weak links at all, which shouldn't come as a shock considering the absolutely stacked cast of talented actors. Tom Holland shows the wealth of potential range he has beyond Spider-Man (something that was never in doubt, might I add), taking on a much rougher and more morally ambiguous role. Robert Pattinson shines as possibly the most detestable character of the film, single-handedly elevating the entire movie once he gets introduced. Bill Skarsgard carries the film's first act on his shoulders, fully embracing the PTSD-fuelled desperation and careful to toe the fine line between sympathetic and antagonistic. Harry Melling is probably the biggest surprise for me. We all know him as Dudley, and his recent role in The Old Guard didn't exactly show a new side to him, but here he managed to give us a crisp and fully developed character in his performance alone. He's still not a particularly nice guy, but this time it's through genuine madness and tragic delusion, rather than just flat-out villainy. I never thought I'd see him be so convincingly sincere and apologetic. Haley Bennet (as Charlotte), Mia Wasikowska (as Helen), and Riley Keough (as Sandy) are also all great despite their limited screen times, but up-and-coming Eliza Scanlen really impresses as Lenora, torn between doing the right thing and pleasing those around her. Sebastian Stan, Jason Clarke, and Douglas Hodge round out the impressive cast, all of them bringing some pretty decent performances as well.There's a lot to The Devil All The Time, but at the same time there isn't really much at all. It's a complicated and intertwining story of multiple characters through multiple periods of time, but it lacks direction for much of its run time, and interactions between different sets of characters are so few and far between that each separate story can feel super disconnected, until they crash into one another by chance and happenstance. The theme of religion loosely ties it all together, but as forcefully shoved into our eyeballs as it is, some of it feels shoehorned in just to make it all feel connected (Carl's murders apparently being a religious act for him, despite nothing actually being shown to imply this at all). I didn't hate this movie, I can't say I was ever particularly bored, and there are some damn impressive performances on display here, but it lacks in almost every area it matters most; badly paced, sloppy narrative structure, disjointed sub-plots, character favouritism, and beaten-over-the-head themes. I give The Devil All The Time a strictly fine 6/10."
798,The narration ruins the whole cinematic feeling. Every time the guy spoke I groaned.
799,"It may not be the Oscar winner it hopes to be, but it's intriguing. The movie is a character study and doesn't need a strong plot in my opinion. I think Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland nailed it. All of the acting was great. Accents were okay though. Decent."
800,"Very well acted by everyone, but still missed a few things from the book. Would have been hard to add everything in , so a job well done. Solid 7.5."
801,"While I love Tom Holland and thought that the acting in this movie was overall quite good, I was completely uncomfortable for the duration of the film. I have not felt so utterly disturbed since first watching Angel Heart. My skin was crawling for the entirety of the film and I literally had to go and watch a couple episodes of Bob Ross to get rid of my heeby-geebies.Again, the actors were great and the storyline was original-but that won't do a lot to help a movie when you can barely stand to look at the screen."
802,"Good lord I hated this movie. This is a slow, near pointless, meandering mess of mediocre acting and over indulgent writing. It does teach us some things though.First, having a big cast of talent does not equal a good movie. This is especially true when you get a cast comprised of primarily European actors trying to do an ""Ohio"" accent. Pattinson is among the worst here and every time he spoke it was like nails on a chalkboard to me. Maybe it's because I've lived in the Great Lakes region and I know that's not how everyone talks! We also get Sebastian Stan who I'm guessing has cotton in his mouth because he is looking extra jowely and sounds awful too.Second, the overindulgence. This thing clocks in at 139 mins and frankly you could cut the first 45 off that and not change the movie. In most places, Holland is the top billed and he doesn't even show up until around the 47 minute mark. But no, this is far too pretentious and unfocused for that.Thirdly, there's an old film adage, ""show, don't tell."" This is clearly something Campos, the director, is unfamiliar with because the narration is near constant. It's so overwhelmingly throughout this movie in fact that as of this moment the IMDb has Pollock listed as top billed and when the narrator is top billed that's a pretty big problem.There's more I could get into here, the way characters are treated as lemmings, dying off constantly and seemingly without purpose. The plot convenience of an untested boy somehow never missing while simultaneously never getting touched even in the most absurd circumstances. Just... UGH! I couldn't wait for this to be over and if not for the completionist in me I would have turned this off about a half hour in.Bottom line, this may have been a great book, that I will never read, but books are not movies, no matter how desperately this wants to be just a visual book reading. Holland is the only decent thing here and he is surrounded by so much awful that even his performance isn't worth it. So, if you're desperate for something that tells you everything is awful and the world is a terrible place... Honestly, just turn on the news and save yourself the trouble.What a disappointing mess."
803,"4 worst things in a world in one movie: war, god, cancer and americans. No thank you."
804,"Usually concepts like this fail, but this film truly shines. The concept of showing the town full of evil humans and events which lead to violence and something more evil is not often well executed. This film on the other hand was well done. Firstly, amazing cast, this film is full of A-listers, who did great performances. Secondly, this film does not try to be over-the-top hardcore as most films with such concept try to be. It's subtle, but strong does enough to feel very rough, but does not overtry. To be honest, I like this a lot more than There Will Be Blood or No Country for Old Men."
805,"U can just skip first 40 minutes... Also too much side characters... Plot could be better. DIdn''t understand sheriff and his sister with her husband story, it was unnecessary. Movie is really well done, but story wasnt the best."
806,"Despite good acting,this is too bleak for my taste..
Too slow.. too grim.."
807,"It's very well acted by all the actors. The plot is okay. There's enough event to keep the story going. But for me, it takes a long time to get me actually hooked. It feels like a 3 hour long film. At some point, all the characters become one dimensional and the plot become predictable. And when, the plot gets interesting, the climax is somewhat lackluster.
This film kinda reminds me of There Will Be Blood, with less quality. It's definitely watchable, but i wouldn't expect much."
808,"The base story-line was not strong enough. Felt like a bits and pieces script. Felt like stories of a couple of good movies, were bundled in a single script.But the acting and the narrating of the story was really good. Every scene that meant to touch the heart of the audience, really touches their hearts.Had a dark, eerie vibe, that I think was perfectly crafted."
809,"Where to start. The acting was of course, phenomenal. I think Bill Skaarsgard was heavily under utilized butt it's very hard to argue that every actor did not do an excellent job. Directing was also excellent along with editing and location/scenery.The story line is where I think the least effort was given. By the end of the movie, it felt as-if there should have been a second part and I had to ask myself... ""what was the point of it all?"". I don't really have a complaint about the story line aside from believing it was driving somewhere only to end without ever reaching the destination.It seemed like an incredible waste of talent to deliver a movie that really has no point whatsoever except maybe that ""all people are evil?"".Worth the watch as the talent in this movie excels to the level of ""There will be Blood"" even if you're asking in the end.... ""is that it?""."
810,It was okay until he killed the dog.why is this necessary??
811,"I have trouble thinking of a film I disliked more than this one. Pathologically violent, misogynistic to a fare-thee-well, and utterly devoid of hope."
812,"I just had to, a cast with Bill Skarsgaard whom I love ever since Hemlock Grove, Sebastian Stan AND Robert Pattinson, what could go wrong?Well, let's just say, the story is freaky. A little too freaky for me, unfortunately. But it is made with love, very detailed."
813,This should have been so good it certainly had some fine actors in it but it was so disjointed and No real characterisation. With the narrator you'd hardly know what was meant to be going on.
814,"Let's face it: most Netflix produced movie have a cheap patina.Not this one: it is on par with top notch productions.The story feels contrived and the runtime is too long. There is a difference between ""slow burning"" and ""not getting to the point"". I almost lost patience at times. The story makes little sense: each scene seems to have the sole purpose of getting you to the next scene.Who writes this stuff? Don't believe that because it quacks and walks like a duck, it must be a duck. Story telling is much more than that.But the cast was so good that it almost made up for it.Tome Holland appears around 45-46 minutes into the movie and you readily see that the guy has got it all... What an actor... He literately carries the film from that point on.Production values: 8. Acting: 9. Story 4. Holland: 9.5"
815,"A deeply dark and disturbing tale of a southern town plagued by extreme blind faith in God...and it was a good time! The ensemble cast, as expected, were excellent. You got Bill Skarsgård (Pennywise), Robert Pattinson (Batman), and Tom Holland (Spider-Man), but all with southern accents. Yes, this is a slow burn of a movie, but by the halfway point, things begin to heat up. It wasn't until the last 30-45 minutes that everything started to come together in a largely satisfying conclusion. But I admit, the movie is too long, and would have probably made for a better miniseries. And at times, it can feel like you're watching a book, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Besides an unfocused first half, the characters were interesting, the setting was haunting, and I had a better time than I thought I would.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of the star-studded cast, fans of dark and disturbing southern dramas, or fans of seeing the closest we'll get to from a Marvel/DC crossover."
816,"What attracts you to the devil all the time is its star cast. Spiderman, batman, winter soldier(chris evans was supposed to play the cop but left because he was busy with defending jacob and recommended stan for the role) and pennywise. Film starts with a detailed childhood of the protagonist with other subplots too establishing the characters and setting. Talking about the acting, i liked bill skarsgard, riley keanough and robert pattinson's performance. I don't know whether stan put on weight or used prosthetics for the role or not.
Film's cinematography and art direction was impressive capturing the essence of 1950-60s.
Here are the drawbacks. Film is slow paced, dark filled with brutal violence, portrayal of christians in bad light and you wont feel for any characters when something bad happens to them.
On the whole this film is not made for everyone."
817,"I can't say that I'm a huge fan of movies about senseless killing but I have seen my fair share of them over the years. The casting for this film is excellent and was shot beautifully. A dark sense of dread lingered throughout to help keep the creep factor set to high. Nonetheless, it's just another flick about senseless killing in a cruel cruel world. Tom Holland's performance and a decent ending within the last 30 minutes saved this film for me. The director is clearly a fan of this genre and has refined his approach over the years. I prefer a previous work of his titled ""Simon Killer"".If you have Netflix or can view this movie for free then give it a go but I personally wouldn't have felt satisfied had I rented it for a few bucks nor do I think that I'll ever watch it again someday. It's a moody film about senseless killing with a star studded cast that's best to watch on a cold rainy lazy day and not much more."
818,"First off I want to say the acting and the cinematography are phenomenal. I feel like this could have truly been a great TV series. But i'll be honest in saying this movie falls flat. Drags on and on. It feels like it is dark just for the sake of being dark. So many depressing moments. I feel as if the story teller didn't know what story he wanted to tell. It's too much contained in 2 and a half hours. A jumbled up mess. 3 out of 10 for the movie as a whole but I would give the acting a 10. If you want to bore yourself to death or fall asleep, throw it on."
819,"I don't have a lot of time for movies anymore, so I'm really picky when I decide spend my eve in front of the screen. This had a great cast, great job recreating post-war, Appalachia setting, and great acting. Buuuuut, I wish I never watched. Very depressing, gruesome, and I'm pretty much done when you go after the poor, loyal doggo 👎🏻 I love a good yarn, love different era, and always love a good thriller/mystery. This moving played like they had all these gruesome scene ideas, then just made up the movie around it."
820,"It's a good old movie that you can enjoy watching, probably recommend to a friend (because it's new and people have to watch stuff).. and maybe even forget it exists the next day.There is no stand out role, but every actor does a good job. Everyone in it is quite experienced and you couldn't/shouldn't expect any less.The story itself is rather predictable in structure and general plot.. but not on the specifics, so you can be sure you will be immersed throughout its runtime.I expected more horror or drama, but it starts very slow in a deliberate pace to setup the story. It was fine and I enjoyed it."
821,"I stopped the movie about 20 minutes from the end and just looked up what happened. I will never get that other 100 minutes back, but it's the little victories. This movie used lots of great actors doing great acting. But why most of the characters do anything (except for Tom Holland's character) never quite add up. The movie spends a lot of time telling us things (via narration) without showing or earning anything. Many of the characters are bad people. Why? Because bad people exist. Do good people exist in this world? Sure. They get to suffer at the hands of the bad people. And some people see someone do something terrible and just move on. One character watches another do something terrible and then just covers it up. Why? I don't know either. Everyone tried on this movie. It looks really good and the noir atmosphere is there. But the people are not people. They just do stuff because the script says they do it. Don't waste your time. Unless you really love really depressing movies in which motives are not important. Good luck. But remember, I warned you."
822,"Not my thing. Too boring. Just old school and stupid. It wasn't something I want to watch from the start. With the star power, they could have made something great. I don't know, didn't even watch it fully.Wouldn't recommend4 stars"
823,Weird in a bad way. I would say that biggest problem of this movie is its tempo. It just was uncomfortable to watch. Boring photography and narrative. I didn't understood the message or understood and didnt like it. I dont mind depressed exposition at all but here it is combined with boring script i think. And actors are kind of not playing it. Just walking around emotionless. Maybe it is a part of such style but i didnt get it. Ending is disappointing. It is just wrapped - not finished. Strange film for niche audience
824,"It's disappointing to see well casted movie, therefore
unsteady,shaky and inconstant."
825,"In the ""Fargo"" tradition this film is a delight to watch with all the corny music and irredeemable characters. Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland show considerable acting skills."
826,"If you're truly a born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, I'd say this movie is not worth your time. If you're someone who takes Christianity lightly or have had many bad experiences of wolves in sheep's clothing, you may be able to tolerate this movie. Be warned however, that its implications are unnerving although definitely not unheard of in life period. However, nothing justifies crime in my mind especially regarding religious practices etc. Any sound-minded person knows killing/murder, mutilation, sexual exploitation, adultery, suicide, and all these things cannot truly be done in the name of Jesus Christ because Jesus is holy. However, to me, the movie makes it as though it can be. Thus, mocking the One and Only True and Living God and The Faith. To me, the movie also highlights how gullible/fragile the human mind can be and the importance of having balance. Otherwise, you can become convinced to do something or believe in something that could get you or someone you love hurt OR it can make you crazy and vile. It also highlights the fact that you can't make God do anything no matter how much you beg and plead. Furthermore, it highlights the fact that you shouldn't pick up strangers or hitch hike. Apparently, this movie is based off a book. What I would say of the author is normally when we as authors write things, there's a hint of revelation regarding something we've personally experienced. It also normally expresses a bit about our own character so...to that end, hopefully, the main character found the real truth about life and God wherever he ended up. And as far as the film producer...let's see you take a book about Islam, Buddhism, Witchcraft and the black arts or something to that nature and make light of those religions. People have been mocking Christ for centuries - it doesn't make Him any less real."
827,"I honestly thought that I would like it but truth be told its a largely underwhelming movie. I don't mind movies that are over 2 hours long as long as there is enough content to keep you engrossed over the long run time. The problem with the movie is that a few thin plots are stretched quite a bit to near boredom.I am quite surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal produced the movie but chose not to act in it. To be honest he could have played the part of Tom Holland better than the end product from Holland. Not that Holland is bad, but to me he is the Kristen Stewart of male actors with a one expression face. Personally I felt that Robert Pattinson was dreadful. His acting was cringeworthy at times but he has a face fit for a sociopath and so a lot of people think that he did great. If you like Bill Skarsgard I would recommend his recent movie, Villians. That was an entertaining, engrossing movie that doesnt stretch till eternity.I thought I would like it considering all the positive reviews but personally I think its quite overrated. The quality of the production and the cast improve what is nothing more than a very ordinary novel."
828,"The film doesn't have history. So boring, I don't know how I didn't slept when i was watching it. The actors very good, but the film very bad. 6,4/10"
829,"I realized pretty early on in the movie that it was just going to be a series of ""overly zealous religious believer does bad thing"" and after that I was honestly really just wondering how much longer the film could drag on for. Like damn, we get it. People who commit fiercely to any belief system, whether it be religion or ideology, can do terrible things. Why didn't the film focus more on some of the terrible environmental factors these characters were living through that may have driven them to be such religious fanatics? It did this for Skarsgard's character, but not much anyone else.And I say this all as an agnostic atheist. Getting the same message played out over pretty much every character in the film got old fast.The acting in this is the film's saving grace, if it has one. Pretty much all of the actors kill their roles; Skarsgard and Holland both did well in their intense, brooding characters, Pattinson was slimy as all hell and Harry Melling blew me away with his acting.Too bad the story couldn't hold up. This film was a letdown ultimately."
830,"I knew going into this movie that the trailer was vague, so I wasn't sure if the storyline would come together. Spoiler-it doesn't.
However...there are SO many talented actors in this film (adapted from a novel), so the acting was definitely there. But the plot....WHERE was the plot!? Seriously. Nothing connected to anything (except maybe in the end), and the stories were just awful. Awful. Awful. So much longer than necessary.
I would have turned this thing off after the dog is murdered, but my husband wanted to finish it to see if it got better. Spoiler-it didn't."
831,"Contrary to the plethora of praise heaped upon this movie, I found it dark, brooding, aimless, tasteless and senseless. The players were flat and the plot was thin and meandering. How could so many people have gotten something so bad so wrong? I wish I had that time back, I would have painted the kitchen door. I do have one nagging question: what sort of remuneration was given to those of you who promoted and praised this drivel?"
832,"Surprised at so many good reviews.... I mean, there's some good acting here, but the plot, the characters... all over the place....One big mess of a movie."
833,"Que que é isso aqui? um manicômio?
só tem personagem perturbado meu deus alguém paga uma INTERNAÇÃO PQ NEM TERAPIA DA JEITO
eh istowhat's that? a loony bin?
there are only disturbed characters my gosh someone PAY A PSYCHIATRIST NEITHER THERAPY RESOLVE THIS
that's it"
834,"This was a dumpster, avoid if you can. Good cast, good acting.. terrible story"
835,It wasent Robert or toms best preformed ever but I liked the story very tragic and definitely getting the book Although I think it was great
836,"Artistically Brilliant...
The movie is top notch.. and every single actor has done justice to this dark...psychotic..ride..
But just one question though, with all the talk of inclusion goin on .. where are the black and brown and colored people at?
I mean you might have as well called it ""No country for Colored People"" and it would have still worked.
It's a must walk this season ;)"
837,"Sorry stopped watching when he killed the dog, i know it wasnt real but could have done it differently"
838,"Who allowed Robert Pattinson to refuse a dialect coach? That man sounded like a cat swallowed a balloon.
Aside from the accents: it was a little long, and sometimes unnecessarily cruel/dark, but the performances were good and I liked the note it ended on."
839,"Brilliant acting, superb storytelling and great cinematography."
840,"A masterpiece. Great acting and a good, creepy story."
841,"Boasting a talented cast, this film starts slow but builds into an incredibly gut wrenching and complex tale. Weaved together by multiple complex characters, this film comes out of nowhere to drag you slowly through the most disturbing things that could possibly happen in the American South post WWII. Pattinson and Holland's performances stick out and help aid the viewer in becoming engrossed in the story."
842,"Overwhelming and suffocating, this dark ""fairy tail"" tell the story not about ""the good guys"" or the idealized ""good old days"", so there won't be beautiful characters to cheer for, but tons of ones to be scared of or sad for.Visually great, with good to superb acting, mostly very good dialogue and a sense of great pacing after the a-bit-slow first act, the movie is very good at what it wants to say and the war that it declares with our emotions. It is bleaks but it is supposed to be. The good guys and feel good stories are filler in this one and is as effective or more than most horror movies that try it."
843,Unexpected actors in unexpected roles ireally did enjoy the movie and the scenario was pretty good.
844,"Terrible events don't make drama. The story is slow, there are a lot of side walks and there isn't a main idea or message. They probably just went for this plot because they liked the arena and the feel/attitude of a certain type of film. Yes, the trailer is very promising, I admit, but no you won't regret skipping it."
845,"'The Devil All The Time' is Netflix's most recent thriller with a fantastic ensemble cast, the standouts being Tom Holland as 'Arvin', Robert Pattison as 'Rev. Preston Teagardin' and Bill Skarsgård as 'Willard'. Pattison's accent is very interesting and differentiates him from the rest of the cast. The film tackles some very tough themes (religion, sexual assault and suicide) and gives each one enough time for them to be depicted sympathetically. Some scenes are very gory and messed up, especially with Willard when Arvin is a younger child. The writing and directing are fantastic and Antonio Campos (the Director) creates a realistic look at southern America in the late 60's. Nearer the end of the film the main protagonist (Arvin) starts to find himself going down the dark path that his father previously went down which led to his demise and nearly does the same with him. The final interaction between Arvin and Deputy Lee Bodecker (Sebastian Stan) is incredibly intense and really gets the blood pumping, which is another instance of the writing, directing and acting all being flawless. However, this isn't a perfect film with the end of the first act / the start of the second act being quite slow which leads to the film dragging. Also, I feel like at least a fifth of the film could've been shaved off in the edit.
Overall, the huge cast makes this an enjoyable thriller and I recommend if you have a spare two hours."
846,"This movie paints a picture of life for the majority of people, living somehow connected to men they've never met, influenced by people who had nothing to do with anyone. It's a movie about a snapshot of a web of people, nothing more and certainly nothing less. Beautifully written, beautifully acted, beautifully told. 10/10, not a flaw."
847,"I do not understand how all those decent actors ended up in this sluggish, tasteless, and pretentious video. Indifferent cinematography, incongruous frames, absence of script supervisor's proper work (or maybe the lack of a specialist at all), and an infinite uncountable variety of close-ups... even porno movies have less. And the screenplay... the characters are just floating from scene to scene like the director's puppets... I could not care less about them. In general, the flaw list is endless. In the end, the movie does not make any sense. Do not waste your time. Better watch some classics or read a book."
848,"The beginning of this movie is annoying in the way it jumps forward and backward making it difficult to make sense of what is actually happening loose threads tie characters together in honesty the story in itself is not worth watching As it is really a collection of unrelated bizarre incidents of degradation and the twisted darkness of people's psyche ,however the acting is what makes the film with some great performances and that is what I based my rating on shame the story was not of the same callibre"
849,Acting is not bad for some actors although some actings are horrible. Few plotholes in the film and average directing. Tom Holland is good though.
850,When you have to rely on narration throughout the entire more to explain the motivations of the characters and to move the plot along you know the screenplay is horrible.
851,"I am a state court trial judge. Every day I get to see, first hand, the worst things people can do to each other. And, every one of those people have a rationalization, or what they believe to be a rationalization. In the case of this film, the acting presents one spot on display delusional rationalization after another. Every character is deeply, deeply disturbed, although in most cases we don't really have enough development to know why. The central and most developed character is driven by his Appalachian, evangelical upbringing and a belief that he must right every wrong done to those important to him by any means necessary. And the means are always violent. From beginning to end this movie is violent. As I watched, I began to think much of the violence was gratuitous, for shock value. However, I began to see that it was conveyance of intergenerational trauma experienced by so many. As in life, the traumatic experiences suffered by the characters in this film are most often at the hands of those we expect to protect us. Clergy, parents, police.There is nothing about this film that will make you feel good for having watched it except for knowing that, if you are disturbed, you are capable of empathy. This movie is based on a fictional novel but it is a very real study in the worst things people do to each other."
852,So many unforeseen scenarios with a great cast will have viewers anticipating the next activities of several sociopaths in a rural mundane setting.
853,"First off, I really enjoyed this movie for what it was. Who is very well acted by the book scrapbook kind of story. All the pieces are different but they fit together somehow. The biggest thing is that it's trying to be more person that actually is. We have seen this type of story 1000 times and putting a 48 minute intro about the main characters dad is just trying to make it different. The biggest thing is that it's trying to be more precise than actually is. We have seen this type of story 1000 times and putting a 48 minute intro about the main characters dad is just trying to make it different. In my opinion it's a very poor way to do it. It could have been a Straightforward murder mystery and be perfectly fine. But by the time the flashbacks are over you're done with the movie. I was ready for it to be over. Having The only thing that really change the main character was having his dog killed by his dad was a very weak way to set up his character. I totally get his motivations but you could've had more interactions with the father to justify the way that the boy is today. I liked this film but it was total Oscar bait."
854,"Despite some gritty, well-acted performances, ""The Devil All the Time"" is such a harrowing and depressing experience, it drains almost all enjoyment from the film."
855,"Also, 1.Bad casting, 2.too many unimportant scenes
I just didn't get the actors.."
856,"This is just yet another one in an endless list of Hollywood movies demonizing rural (white) people and their communities. Not much else needs to be said. A lot of people here in the reviews are wondering why the characters are all bad and why nothing they do makes much sense and why it's so nihilistic. Well, I just explained it."
857,"There is a lack of story but the events that happen are quite interesting. The acting is solid but it feels like that there is no character development.
Some random events happen and multiple timezones are shown to the audience. Something that Tarantino did with pulp Fiction where they show the past and the future and where it leads to in the end. The whole movie is also Narrated like a lot of Tarantino movies. There is a constant tension in the movie what feels like a great build up but unfortunately your patience won't be rewarded. The plot is weak and it feels like a rip off from Tarantino."
858,Pretty slow and tough to watch movie. Not for everyone
859,"It would be better if they named it ""The Devils among us""."
860,I liked this movie a lot more than some films I see in theaters - including several films nominated for Oscars. I liked the cinematography and the violence and the darkness and the moody atmosphere. The cast I felt was mostly decent. The narration of this movie bothered me a lot and I think the film would have been a lot stronger without it. I almost wish the film had taken more time to develop the characters instead of used the narrator to push the plot forward. However - it's a decent crime drama and it's super trippy that the Marvel and DC cinematic actors are in it.
861,"I was seriously was bored in the middle and stopped watching, would have rated it much lower if it wasn't the great story ending and how everything connected (all credit to book).I think the giving the author to narrate was respectfull but I would rather watch movies to discover the themes, parallels by myself then someone say that to me. He even spoiled a great subversion. Movie was really badly edited, could have shown those parallels much better with both old & new story playing at same time.The movie draged with little stuffs, high inspiration from Godfather 2 but that had heavy material to play out over the runtime, but this didn't.Acting was best thing about this, love the thick southern accents. I was so uninterested in the middle that I didn't care about Sebastian character and thought his sister was his side chick.There were 3 different ending, they decreased in importantness. Pattinson was important for Tom Holland, wierd couple with Holland had great thrillers but it felt rushed (best scene was rushed where previous once was draged).Could have been executed much better by having overlapping to timelines and fleshing out Sebs character with something better, his scenes felt like it was blocking the flow, transitions were bad.Violence doesn't bother me and I loved the gritty darkness of the subject matter."
862,"Een zeer geslaagde Netflix film,I was always a bit sceptical when seeing Netflix film trailers but this one got it right!Excellent movie, slow burn with dramatic events not that typical fast shot directed crap,I like the different stories and different times makes it all come down in the end. I think the movie is quite original in it's own way too like it doesn't remind me of any other movie.acting from Tom Holland and pattinson is very goodmusic effects on the background makes the story more dramatic and gripping.9 outta 10"
863,Good film...
864,"Very beautifully made, with unexpected twists, subplots and character lineup...The main takeway is the narration, which will initially make you feel like it's going to be a fairy tale ride...But you won't have to wait long to find the sinster side of the movie, and realize that the narration was always meant as kind of a pun, and is totally in contrast with the story line. Character development is wonderful, and all the characters are shown in the grey, no blacks or whites here. A unique film, which has both an old school charm, nostalgia, as well as violence and gruesome scenes. A masterpiece."
865,"An intense film and yes it's a long movie but it has good reason to be. There's so much that happens in just one scene that'll have a callback later so before you're thinking of skipping around-just give it a chance.Going in without having read the book I was expecting either racist or some creepy backwoods ""Deliverance"" scenes and I can say there isn't any thankfully, just a rather odd spider scene.The entire cast truly shine in this film and yes the accents, depending on who you ask are hit or miss but it didn't put me off to the film.All in all, just ignore all the teens giving this a poor review just because they wanted to watch Tom and Robert and not look up what the movie was actually about. They had amazing performances and have broken out of their static roles. I didn't think the movie was pretentious or lacked subtext. At its core this movie is about protecting those you love while also struggling with faith."
866,"Netflix (as opposed to Amazon or Apple) is turning oiut high quality originals - both series and singles. The ratings for this movie are remarkably consistent, and I agree with all of the high ratings. The low ratings are predictable, because this is not a movie that will appeal to importtant groups of viewers. It was shot in Alabama (with the support of public funds), and I woukd make two comparisons:it portrays a particular place, community, era and religiuous communitty in honest detail (more on this below). And it tells its story in non-linear fashion.As to the first comparison, I think this portrayal of a specific time, place, community bears favorable comparison with Winter's Bone. However it has an additional--and I think remarkable -- quality. One ofthe criticisms of Philip Roth's early work was that it lacked affection for its characters and their community life. Winter's Bone also seemed to me to have a negative feeling about most ofthe people it showed us, and showed very little affection for almost any major charcters (except for Jennifer Lawrence's character).This movie presents people we might otherwise have no feeling for in a way that promotes understanding, compassion, or at least some degree of fellow-feeling, with the obvious exception of certain, specific characters. Even the worst of the characters can be understood on some level, and the overall feeling I got was of a time and place gone by, and missed by some. Elia Kazan's ""Wild River"" captured some of these feelings for me. So did Walter Hill's ""Hard Times"" and Robert Mulligan's ""To Killl a Mockingbird"" (and the posthumously publishd literary sequel).As to the story-telling technique, the easiest comparison for me is with ""Crash"" -- multiple stories and time-frames kaleidiscopically interwoven in ways that are only gradually revealed. One of the earlier reviewers here pointed out that the movie was messy but satisfying, and I agree.The acting was great. I must be one of the only people on IMDB who did not recognize most of the names (actors, directors, etc>) But there is no aspect of this movie I did not appreciate or recognize as a very high quality effort.I have enjoyed the parts played by Jason Clarke in other movies; Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, and Bill Skargarrd were exceptional. Mia Wasikowsha, Eliza Scanlen, The cinematography and choice of locations and settings established the locatiuon with authority.The music is worth special praise, and the traditional music selection and playing by Pokey LaFarge were appropriate, moving, and beautiful.This movie is for adults; it left me unsettled and upset, in the way King Lear or certain classical tragedies do. I expect to watch it again.I agree that this movie is not for everybody. Certainly not for youngsters. Also not for people holding certain religious beliefs.There is some criticism of the length of the movie. It reminded me of a line in ""Amadeus:"" the emperor is asked what hre thinks of MOzrt's new muisical creatiion; he cannot think of a good answer, so he asks his court musician, Salieri, whatr he thought of it. ""Too many notes."" to which Mozart replied there werre exactly as many notes as were required. If you catch my meaning.The violence, which is a bit much, furthers the story, and without it the story woulkd lack the depth of engagement the movie expects of its audience..YMMV, of course.This is most certainly a dark and deep movie, well-made and well-played. I started writing this review with an 8 starrt rating, but as I wrote, I realized that I did not have any specific criticism to make, and that I was being timid because the story and presentation are so radical. I cannot find fault with the movie, though, again, irt is not for rveryone."
