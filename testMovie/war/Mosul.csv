0,"It is nice to see all these Iraqi sacrifices to liberate their country from terrorism, murderers and criminals. Acting in the film is very good and the photography is beautiful. I loved the film very much."
1,"Glad I watched it, despite this being 5.9. Which I believe would be purely because of political affinity of reviewers.
From a neutrals point of view, this movie is technically taut. Tension feels real. There are no heroes here. Action sequences are brutal but highly believable. Bottom line is, it all feels real. Extremely Real. The backdrop of a city in half ruins just saddens the overall theme, Civilians being shot was something that could have been left out though. But in the end the movie is about the human side of the elite SWAT Force members.
This is way better than many high budget Hollywood failures"
2,This work is very good and I really enjoy it. I hope you will produce in the future more works about Iraq üáÆüá∂.
3,"A very beautiful movie, but it cannot reach the suffering that the people of Mosul have reached. I ask Netflix to continue making more Iraqi films and series."
4,We as Iraqis appreciate this wonderful work from Netflix.
5,The BEST war movie since Black hawk down!Amazing! Authentic and a true story!I must say to the people that don't understand Arabic that there are loads of words & meaning lost in translation in the subtitles cause it's way better in Arabic!
6,"A very wonderful movie that tells about the tragedy of Mosul and how ISIS occupied it and the exodus of its people. Very cool, and thanks to the brothers Rousseau and the hero Suhail Al-Dabbaj"
7,A decent movie. Better than a decent movie. Everything is great. No particular side is bad. strict 7.5 is a must for this movie. And Arabic actors are doing very well. Nothing to say. A must watch decent movie.
8,It nice to see a movie about the real war that happened in Iraq the movie contains some real facts that really exist in Mosul city acting is good I'm writing this because I'm a soldier in the Iraq army and I saw a lot of terrible things in this war.
9,The great sacrifices of the iraqi army deserved to be honored and documented in a work like this!
10,"Very nice work for iraqi act
Hope best in the future üòÅ
Thank you üòçüòòüòç"
11,"Great and sad story üò≠üò≠
Beautiful cinematic production and beautiful excitement.
But the movie does not focus on a particular hero, to give the message that no one is safe."
12,"But there are some errors, such as non-Iraqi money, and some mistakes in others"
13,"Another worthy addition to Netflix's burgeoning catalogue of foreign language films, 'Mosul' is a unique war movie that deserves to find a wide audience. There's been many films made about war in the Middle East, but thus far they've mostly focused on the point of view of the American forces. Sure, the likes of 'Lone Survivor' and 'The Hurt Locker' were terrific, but to the best of my knowledge, 'Mosul' is the first to be told from the point of view of the people who actually live there. 'Mosul' is an international co-production, but it feels like a distinctly Iraqi take on the war against ISIS.The film tells the story of Kawa (Adam Bessa), a rookie Police Officer in the titular city. With half the city controlled by ISIS and a desperate battle raging for months, he one day finds himself recruited to join the local SWAT Team. The story unfolds over the course of a single day, Kawa going through a brutal baptism of fire as he and his new colleagues take the fight to the increasingly desperate ISIS forces who have caused so much misery.Led by the charismatic Major Jasem (Suhail Dabbach - excellent), the cops take the fight to the militants while also trying to avoid detection by their superiors. This SWAT Team might be cops, but they didn't like their orders to withdraw from the fight and have to bribe their own allies to escape unwanted attention. They face car bombs, desperate battles in cramped backstreet alleyways and as the day goes on, the fresh faced Kawa becomes increasingly dead-eyed and battle hardened. But what is their mission exactly? Jasem won't tell him much and all these random gunfights don't seem to be going anywhere other than racking up the body-count. Can Kawa trust these renegade officers and will he live to see his second day on the job?It's a violent and unrelenting film with some grim depictions of urban warfare. The opening close quarters gun battle is a hectic set piece and if the sound is turned up enough, you can almost picture what being in a real life shoot out would be like. The sweaty palmed fear, the life or death decisions that are made in split seconds...and it only increases as the film goes on. The squad face rooftop snipers and an apparently limitless number of ISIS militants. It's an adrenaline pumping action film that plunges you right into the heart of the chaos.That said, there is an argument to be made that 'Mosul' may have worked best as a six-part TV series rather than a movie. So much happens that it starts to become unbelievable that this could all happen in a single day, especially when it draws to a close and there's still no sign of the sun setting. Plus, aside from Kawa, Jasem and the squad's second-in-command Waleed, none of the other characters get much time to develop. They drop like flies throughout and they've had so little screen-time that each casualty just looks like another bullet riddled body.That said, for the most part, 'Mosul' is a gripping and worthy war film from a perspective we rarely see. Kawa's first day on the job is a hell of a ride and it'll be really striking for anyone in a Western Police Force seeing how he gets it. There's no interviews, no training, he just gets given a hat and a uniform and he's in. Sure, he's gunned down a few of the opposing side already, but the application and screening process is remarkably brief. If 'Hot Fuzz' is to be believed, there's gonna be a lot of paperwork once they clock off for the night."
14,"The movie is good and the story also good but there is a weakness in making me go emotional with the death of the characters, acully i didn't feel even a little bit of sadness when a character die"
15,Very nice work. I hope to see more movies or series about Iraq
16,"The story of the Mosul movie revolves around events adapted from a true story, the protagonists of which are a ""special unit"" of the Iraqi police forces in Nineveh Governorate."
17,A beautiful film that embodies the suffering of the Iraqi people and the Special Forces in regaining the city of Mosul. I hope to produce Iraqi films after this work. Thank you.
18,"Films about war may not be suitable for everyone.
But when it comes to Mosul, it doesn't seem like an ordinary war movie but rather heavy suffering over a country with words and one of the most war-torn cities in the world.
Watching this movie makes you feel like you are one of the fighting forces fighting against ISIS to liberate the city and regain the freedom that has cost so many lives.
The film offers very mature perspectives on the fighting and relays a fraction of the many wartime storiesThe film focused on Iraq's efforts to regain the city of Mosul and agreed to deliver its message, and through it the viewer gets a pure glimpse of the facts of the war and a full dose of reality.The entire cast is great, but the movie is mainly based on the amazing performance by Iraqi-American actor Suhail Dabakh and Tunisian actor Bilal Adam Baisa, who played a pivotal role in the film.Excellent action sequence with photography and sound.
The visual effects and music are great, and the shooting angles are elaborate
Matthew Michael Carnahan gave an excellent directorial presentation,"
19,Good one i loved this movie üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª Im salwan from iraq
20,"Amazing it's deserve this rate bc it's real the iraq people they who fighted and getting killed , god bless everyone of us who died and who lives ."
21,Very nice work ihope we can see another movies about iraq history
22,"I am very impressed by writer and director Matthew Michael Carnahan's first ever directorial debut. I mean wow, it's better than some seasoned directors films I've seen lately. The cinematography is sheer perfection with amazing colors and outstanding close-ups and scenic shots. The casting and performances by actors I'm sure many have never heard of, were exceptional and convincing, and Carnahan directed them perfectly. The writing was also on point with the 101 min runtime being just right and the pacing excellent. The score was also very fitting. All this praise, and yet it's overshadowed by my disappointment that the producers felt their film needed SO many bogus 10/10 reviews. Out of the current 167 reviews, 123 are all 10's from new accounts, or older accounts with this film (and maybe a few to throw us off) being the only one reviewed. That is just sad. Why wouldn't they have faith in their own film to resort to such tactics? My rating would've been an honest and well deserved 9, especially considering this is Carnahans first time wearing the directorial hat, but loses 2 points for all the bogus reviews thinking that his viewers can be fooled so easily. So it's only a 7/10 from me."
23,It's a great movie about üáÆüá∂ thank netflix for doing movie includes iraq
24,"Very very beautiful
And iraqi people will enjoy with the movie i wish u will make another movies for iraq"
25,A dark and gritty war movie with intense and well choreographed fight sequences.Thanks Russo brothers for producing this gem.
26,"A wonderful work that sheds light on real events lived by Iraqis, their pain, and the difficult life conditions due to terrorism"
27,I am proud of such a movie that sheds a light on such circumstances that happened to my country!
28,"It's amazing movie that shows to the world how Iraqi's were fighting the terrorist to liberate their cities from ISIS
I wish if there's more works like this movie ."
29,I loved him because he showed the Iranians as they are
30,"I love the acting, and also it's the first iraqi movie that made by netflix. I hope you make more movies about iraqi army against ISIS."
31,Everything thing was true about how people was running from isis and SWAT how was fighting to save innocent people from qnd kill isis
32,"IRaQI Mix review for the Mosul movie to be shown tomorrow on Netflix:Film story: The story of the Mosul movie revolves around events based on a true story, the protagonists of which are a ""special unit"" of the Iraqi police forces in Nineveh Governorate."
33,"Good job, but the filming is bad and the camera is not very accurate"
34,"Mosul left me with mixed feelings...there's a lot of good things it: for one, it's incredibly real and it builds genuine tension; the actors - none of which is a Hollywood star - offer decent performances; and last but not least, I loved the overall cinematography of the movie.
On the other side, I felt kind of let down by the plot: initially quite messy (understandably to a degree, being all about hectic street fighting) but then it does not find a cohesive narrative line and the finale is a bit of a downer."
35,The film is realistic and wonderful. I like it and I'm waiting for more of these works on Iraq
36,"There isn't much of a background or character development. Because of this the movie feels generic and you could just change the scenery to WW1, WW2, Korean War, etc... and it would still fit."
37,"Thank you, Netflix, a great movie that captures real events"
38,"I live in Mosul, when ISIS entered the city, all the local police forces were dismantled, there is no police division of Mosul that participated in the liberation of the city, everything in this film is false"
39,"I think the director was not able to notice the lousiness of the dialogue because he doesn't speak the language.
Many mistakes are overlooked because there was no proper warzone expert to guide the director.
Losing a soldier in a warzone prompts a certain reaction from his group, it is almost consistent in each and every actual war casualty, it is very well represented in saving private Ryan and I didn't see it in any other warzone movie.
The relation between the different fighting groups in Iraq is not hostile at all, I am a witness to that.. Iranians and Americans were as good allies as they could be in that war.
It would have been a very good movie has it contained a proper ending, more side stories, a focus on the real humanitarian tragedy of the people involved especially the minorities and violated women. Negating such a subject as ISIS should take into consideration the REAL pain people suffered, and the responsibility or conveying the suffering in a historically accurate way is a major part in rating the title. Hence I give 3 stars to the producers for their BOLD step to try such a subject, 2 for the rest of the cast."
40,"I'm from Iraq and the movie reminded me of what happened there during that time, very good movie"
41,There is a lot of lies about it and the absence of the role of the rest of the Iraqi security forces. We lived that period and we did not see any realism in it
42,"Its contain so many faked fact about what really happened in mosul.
Mosul S.W.A.T doesn't the the only one force that fight is*s
The South and the middle of iraqi forces in all of its kind take a huge part in liberating mosul.

44,"A bad movie, due to the bleeding of the story and its difference from reality."
45,"This movie is very ridiculous. The people in charge of this work introduced the problems of the United States and Iran into it. The police in the city of Mosul did not liberate an inch from it, but rather did not fight this terrorist organization in the first place, while the forces that liberated Mosul should have been focused in this film, such as the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, the Counter-Terrorism Service and the Iraqi Army Hero"
46,"This one of the best action movies I saw on Netflix this year. Very realistic, and tense scenes as if you are really there. Dialogue could've been better, but overall a very well written script. But unfortunately due to biased (Iranian or pro Iranian) political opinions of some reviewers it is very underrated. I'm also happy that we finally see well made movies that actually shed light on that not all Iraqis are villains either with ISIS or Iran, but most are with their homeland and against all foreign interference. Truly a great step forward."
47,A small part of the tragedy that occurred because of terrorism. Thank Netflix . We'd like to see other actions added.
48,"This movie was not as I expected...I did not have any big expectations but WOW the acting and storyline was much stronger than I thought. Iraqi history has some of the best suggestions to movies. From 3000 bc to 2020 ad, I really hope that Netflix will continue this path that it has started, and hope to see more Iraqi movies. Truly wonderful."
49,Need more work and the story is weak but the visual effect was very good and the sound was not bad
50,The best Iraqi movie that summarizes the events of terrorism in Iraq
51,Great Authenticity with real emotion. Hope everyone watches this movie and has a moment of silence for all the hero's whom lost their lives protecting their city against ISIS terrorism.
52,"Visually excelent, aurally impressive display of a battle fueled by emotions and love. Amazing tribute to the Niniveh SWAT team, and the victims of Mosul Battle. Film worth your time!"
53,"This film is so well made in every aspect. It is a tribute to the bravery of the Iraqi people. If you enjoy war movies you will like this, it's gritty yet realistic and is refreshingly non-Hollywood. Always good to watch a war movie that isn't all about Americans."
54,"The human suffering, the sacrifice and the bond between soldiers. It has it all, i think this is one of the finest war movies ever made. Great direction, writing, action scenes are amazing and great acting. It will break ur heart while give u a dash of hope. Once again, an amazing movie."
55,Vary bad story and acting with an incoherent and incomprehensible story
56,"As usual its very far from the reality of Mosul war events , the produce and filming are weak"
57,Nice and interesting movie. I loved Jasim's character
58,Very nice work for iraqi act.i hope more in the future
59,"The greatest challenge in war movies is to represent the real war through the lenses of few individuals. Even though the plot was mainly about this terrific set of heros in SWAT, the directors managed very well to frame it with the general events of war. I am very pleased with this work and looking forward to see something similar about the stories of Iraqi ICTS"
60,"A fictional story as opposed to what is written as a realistic story
I speak as an Iraqi and this film is not true"
61,"A very bad movie, due to the bleeding of the story and its difference from reality."
62,"In mosul we didn't see this team ,
The ictf & ieaqi army this forces how fighting against the isis"
63,I surprised when I watched the movie. This not the war that I participated with my previous work!
64,"A failed and funny film in which an insult to the armed forces from the Ministry of Interior, Defense and the Mobilization, and deny their efforts in fighting this terrorist organization, and as a result, the military institution has given many martyrs and wounded during the liberation of the city of Mosul, and this film blew up everything except God curse the oppressors and opportunists who try in every way to falsify history"
65,"I'm an Iraqi (Kurdish), and I will tell you, this movie is very accurate with constant war violence (and by extension, anti-war) in excellent movie about Iraq."
66,"Mosul is an excellent war movie, in my opinion it's worth to watch for many reasons: 1- Mosul is based on a true story and it Simulates the reality of real events 2- the acting of the main characters was very good 3- The events of the film attract the attention of the viewer from beginning to end without boredom 4- The Action in the movie is excellent and tough 5- Excellent cinematography
however there are some points that I did not like such as: All the actors are terrible at Doing Iraqi Accent excluding ""Suhail Dabbach"", moreover the movie should have been longer run-time"
67,"Well done film. The acting was to the point on living a thing, not acting. A very bold film. Make more like this, tell the story of the age old struggle for freedom!"
68,"Great,, but it needs some added features because it is simple comparing to what's happened"
69,Great movie! Explains the important points of what happen in Mosul and the amount of the distraction.I hope they keep producing more iraqi movies.
70,Great movie like fury speak about a team and special objective
71,Super authentic movie thats honors the sacrifices of the Iraqi army. So happy to see more Iraqi representation on Netflix. The whole cast and filming crew did an amazing job!! My whole family thoroughly enjoyed every second from start to finish
72,"It's good to see Iraqi work as good as this
And I wish this one wouldn't be the last one"

75,"This movie is first movie work at iraq and it is start beautiful to going to top, good lucky."
76,This is a wonderful movie. It captures the sadness and misery of war. The acting is superb and the connection of brotherhood between the characters seem genuine throughout the movie.
77,"I have not seen this type of movie quality in a long time.
Emotional, gripping, eye opening.
Makes you think about war and its horrors."
78,This movie is great with a lot of action and a real life drama
79,"Mosul is a whirlwind of a movie anchored by legitimately visceral sequences throughout and brisk pacing that the film sustains from beginning to end. In an environment where streaming has become the predominant mode of consuming content, it's gratifying to get a movie this immersive, one that never truly lets up and one that will certainly keep you invested in the different directions it goes in.Based on a New Yorker article from 2017 and produced by the Russo Brothers and the production company AGBO, Mosul takes place in the titular city and follows the exploits of the Nineveh SWAT team which gained their prestige through their clashes against ISIS forces. We meet the team through the eyes of Kawa, a rookie cop who is ushered into team by the steely commander Jasem, after they save Kawa and his seasoned partner mid-ambush. With ISIS on the retreat from the city and the arrival of a new command, the team has gone rogue and decides to carry out one final mission of their own, the details of which are kept from Kawa, but we come to find it's rooted in a far more personal place than the ones they've gone through prior.Through the absorbing bend much of the film takes, we are put in the heat of battle at every turn, but it's rarely energetic and that becomes an effective element of the film's tone. There is a weariness to each encounter with the enemy as they occur with increasing frequency and over the course of their journey; these soldiers are just trying to survive and here's where Mosul cements its stakes breathlessly and efficiently. It begins to feel inevitable that the Nineveh will lose one of their own nearly every time they make contact with ISIS's opposing forces. What sets Mosul apart from similarly tactical minded flicks is the moments of loss it frequently hammers home. In between the intensity of the action and each waypoint on their venture, there are moments of stillness where we get to witness the fighter's true colors which makes their losses sting with greater severity, sometimes it's commentating over a soap opera on television and at others, it's cruising in a Humvee through the ruins of Mosul, as they're reminded of why they fight and who they're fighting for. The secret sauce that really makes those points of the film work when the team isn't being rained down on by gunfire is that they're still actively pushing the story forward and doing the necessary work to engage us with the characters at the center of the story. Mosul's structure reminds me of that of a video game, with each conflict or objective so to speak, being separated by points of exposition and development, but it works for a mission-focused narrative in this case.Mosul's scenes of battle can get pretty brutal so I recommend this for ages 16 to 18 for some moments of extreme intensity and some graphic violence at times. Mosul is a raw testament to the heroism of the Nineveh SWAT team with an unexpectedly emotional conclusion and I greatly recommend it. I give Mosul 3.5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST"
80,"I usually don't write reviews here. But thought i should write something here, this movie is a realistic one, great actors, good cinematography. A must watch. 10/10 is my rating"
81,"Mosul as a movie gives us a great insight on how ISIS were driven out of Iraq, though the whole movie is just a fictionalised account of a lot of happenings, One gets a general understanding of the bad stuff that went on back there. It is very refreshing to see an all Arab cast and an all Arab perspective of things in place of the regular stories of American soldiers and their deployment in Iraq since the Green Zone and the Hurt Locker.Long time writer Matthew Michael Carnahan, impresses with his skills as a director for the first time. Cinematography is very good and keeps up with pace of the movie. Screenplay is very good and never lags in its entire runtime. Makeup, Production design and costumes were decent. Stunt sequences/ Action scenes were very impressive considering the movie's budget. At a little over 100 minutes editing is excellent. Acting by a all Arab team was generally good.Overall, A great movie to watch for action movie fans that doesn't drag even one bit. The movie is a showcase for the determined Iraqi forces who drove out ISIS out of their soil. The highlight of the movie is presented at the very end, when it is presented for what and whom the fight is for. A must watch movie for all Action movie fans out there."
82,"This movie is more than a war movie, the director has done a great job capturing the emotions. There is a scene with two siblings, took a piece of my heart when I saw that. (not a spoiler), Sadly thats the reality. Brilliant acting from everyone. The story is amazing. What is important at the end of the day is clearly shown. I hope more movies come from Iraq."
83,"And on good journalism and photojournalism, as it's inspired by Luke Mogelson's ""The desperate battle to destroy ISIS"" article published in The New Yorker.Mosul is a honest docudrama, part documentary, part action movie. Don't buy into the baseless claims and politically motivated minimum ratings given by the usual victims of the propaganda wars, of the Dunning-Kruger effect etc. The story is not ""fake"", the Nineveh province SWAT team is not ""fiction"".Don't buy into the self-victimization attempts either. It is not the ""evil western"" exploiting the Irakian tragedy. It is not disrespecting the Irakians(hundreds of movies were made about WW II even before WW II ended). It is not cinematography's fault for the wars and pain and suffering in the world and waiting decades or centuries to expose them would not make them less. Also it is not cinematography's role to do the work of the historians, much less to explain everything about a historical event in a single movie.A 10 from me, to compensate a bit from the hate ratings."
84,Very good movie staring at the war in Mosul. I know that Is just the beginig of Iraqi cinema and I love this Beginig. The accent could be better and I did not get why they use Brittish Pound instead of Iraqi Dinar!! Countine with this Work Please.
85,"The city got cleaned , isis made it like hell, this is true! But the movie shows wrong people helping! And this is not how the city found freedom!"
86,Rivetting. Action Packed. Watch it for a glimpse of the real Iraq.
87,"This was an amazing film to watch. The action and acting was wonderful, however the underlying mission was so heart touching. Considering what happened in Iraq with ISIS and to make such an amazing well acted, great camera work and well directed is commendable. If you like very realistic action/military films this is a one to watch. I do not comment often to films, but this one more than deserves recognition."
88,"Mosul is not the best war movie I have ever seen. However, it is entertaining and very interesting to see another perspective of war. I recommend you watch this movie."
89,"Fortunately this is the opposite of a cheesy war or action movie. Genuine heroes, represented in an absolutely realistic way. It is still exciting but terrifying given that it's try and happened only a year or so ago. We were all watching it on the news but the horrific reality of it passed most of us by while we went to get a cup of tea or catch up on Brexit news. Brilliantly written, directed and acted. And so refresh to have unknowns in all the roles. Brilliant film"
90,"Definitely recommended. Interesting to see what life on the ground could look like. The movie is really about a group of people, because one hardly learns anything about the individuals and aside from one leader and one new recruit they all seem to be pretty much the same."
91,"I think there were two issues with the dialect. One could have been recorded better, I am Iraqi and I had to have subtitles on because at times I couldn't make out what the actors were saying. Also, could have used some more attention to the Iraqi dialect, it would switch to Syrian / Lebanese dialect amongst the main characters who are supposed to be Iraqi.I can't really speak to the plot because even though I enjoyed watching it and it touched on several important issues. I would not know how accurately it represented what happened in Mousl."
92,"Great movie, came across it by accident and I am so glad that I did, it's raw and brutal, I can only imagine that this is the closest we will ever come to the real thing, a must watch for any movie fan"
93,"Extremely good and realistic, with a powerful story behind it"
94,Mosul was a good war film that had very little new things to offer but it made this old things of genre in a good way and it showed how war is hitting many places on earth and not just in America or Europe.Characters werent really explored and we didnt found a lot about them but action sequances were able to satisfay me and make me to not think about some plot details and some weaker parts that second act had.Mosul was a good war film and it may be one of best war films of this year but some cliches and wooden charactes were problem for me
95,The scene where they stopped to help the two young brother kids hit me right in the feels.
96,"To end the controversy .. the film # that connects between truth and fraud!After the hype caused by the movie ""Mosul 2020"" produced by the ""Netflix"" network and the widespread controversy surrounding it; We decided to clarify the facts and document the history as it is. We will not deal with the film from the technical point of view and cinematography, this is not within our competence, but we will deal with it from the military point of view.First of all, the biggest mistake in the film was the phrase ""based on real events,"" and the phrase ""Only Swat Nineveh was fighting every day without tirelessness."" The film's story is nothing more than being inspired by a documentary article for The New Yorker by writer Luke Mogelson. Documenting the author's trip with the Nineveh Swat forces under the command of Nineveh Police.It is our patriotic and humanitarian duty not to underestimate the right of any fighter who participated in the heroic battles against the terrorists, and to make half of their pure blood flowing. The fact that Swat Nineveh participated in the battles is something that must be mentioned.
After the D-11 gangs occupied Nineveh governorate, the police forces were dispersed until they were restructured in 2016 at the Speicher base, and the Nineveh Swat was restructured with a secret force, and they participated in the battles in a limited way between holding land and participating with other major forces axes. Their first participation was in July 2016 to secure the villages south of Mosul, and their first effective participation was to lash out with the units of the 72nd Infantry Brigade, the 15th Division and the 37th Brigade, the 9th Division in the Iraqi army, as they supported the army units to liberate several villages south of Qayyarah.The period the film talks about is the beginning of the battles on the left side, not the end. The Joint Operations Command of the Swat Nineveh Company decided to participate with the units of the 9th Armored Division in the Iraqi army in the attack process. The southern axis from the Al-Intisar neighborhood in October 2016, but after the intensification of the battles and their inability to stay due to the lack of equipment, armament and numbers, they withdrew from the Al-Intisar neighborhood to the villages south of Mosul, where they were based, and then moved later with the eastern counterterrorism axis, and they participated in Some clashes and land grabs with the Counter-Terrorism Service in the areas of Gogjali - Aden district - Al-Quds neighborhood - Al-Zuhur neighborhood, and this was the most prominent participation of the Nineveh Swat heroes in liberating the left coast.Misleading information:
In the original New Yorker story, many facts were falsified and fraudulent.The core story of the movie is a big fallacy, so the goal of Swat Nineveh is to participate with the rest of the pieces in progress, and there was no special task to free the families of the affiliates.Show them roaming freely in the city and without the knowledge of the joint operations commanders, and this is a flagrant violation of the truth, no force at that time can move without coordination with the movements of the Joint Operations Command, except for any unknown convoy that will be targeted by warplanes and friendly fire.Unjustified targeting of the heroic Federal Police forces and distorting their image and that they are bribing to allow Nineveh Swat to pass to interrupt them, and this is something that has not happened in the history of the liberation battles.Show an Iranian officer controlling the crowd forces, which is not free from Western politicization. In fact, there is no force for the PMF in Mosul. Iranian officers or advisors at all in Mosul.It appears that they are like militias exchanging ammunition for cigarettes and this is contrary to reality, livelihood and equipment were flowing to the front fronts continuously and abundantly, but Nineveh Swat suffered from a lack of equipment due to the inability to share the equipment of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service with them because of the difference in armament between the apparatus that is characterized by Western armament and SWAT Nineveh, armed with AK47, PK and Dushka rifles with eastern gear, and part of the force had to return to the back lines to transport equipment to the front lines.In the end .. Regardless of all that, 48 hours after the film was shown, the terrorist organization D11 broadcasted a 44-minute release in response to the Mosul movie, to show that the film produced by the global network Netflix dealt a heavy blow to the organization that prompted it to respond to it with bankrupt propaganda and clips Old versions broadcast years ago during the battles to liberate Mosul."
97,I love Iraqi movies it's good and hope they will make more movies like that
98,"Bad film , based on fake story that does not exist except in the imagination of the writer"
99,"It was not so bad and did not blame reality. First of all, whoever fought in Mosul is the anti-terrorist agency, not the SWAT forces, and the anti-terrorist agency has American-made weapons and the latest military equipment, and they do not carry a Kalashnikov. The movie also showed them like gangs"
100,The story is fake and they didn't mention the real fighters
101,Full of lies to make America take all the credit for ending ISIS while it's a lie
102,"Mosul movie, scenario inspired by imagination !!!!
First, if the battle was in its beginnings, then what was this destruction of the city?
And if it was at its end, that is the liberation of Mosul, then what day did the battle unfold inside the city except for the Counter-Terrorism and Rapid Response Agency and the Federal Police, and there is nothing called the Swat Forces.
Simply because these forces are affiliated with the Nineveh Police Command and the police command did not exist due to the presence of ADH and the associates among the dead, displaced and fugitive outside Mosul
The Swat Forces of Shawkat have told a force from the people of Mosul ???
A question to the script, where is the anti-terror agency, where is the quick response?
But the Federal Police knowledgeable about it is a shameful role
With control, money is given to the Federal Reserve, a hiss, if a civilian man passes only a bribe, the lie may be easier, not forces that pass by the forces of money
Secondly, the Popular Mobilization Forces did not fight inside the city of Mosul because America asked the Iraqi government not to participate in coalition aircraft if the crowd participated inside the city.
As for the Iranian leader, the first thing is to ask the CTS: Are they a Shavo commander or an Iranian fighter inside the city ???
A statement that the forces floundering during the clash
The evidence that colleagues may be killed among themselves shows that not everyone was killed by ISIS !!!
The message for the whole movie was the same
The father takes off the veil from his daughter who is disgruntled with Islam. A sign of rejection of religion and Islam. A question to count. Why did you sacrifice your friends and let them pray without seclusion. You keep the veil of your daughter and your wife.
I eat it. I am the military reporter, Mortada al-Mousawi, who accompanied all the forces from the start of the fatwa to the liberation of the last city in Iraq, and I know the disconnect from attraction and I have documentaries about the war and its real men on YouTube
By the way, the script missed something at the end of the film, that he dedicated the work to the souls of the martyrs in order to convince the viewer that it was real, but he missed that some of the martyrs were martyred in 2018, I mean
After the end of the war and the statement of victory for liberation, it was the end of 2017 and your safety"
103,"Just saw it. The least I can write, is that we have an uninteresting film here. A bunch of soldiers shooting each other. Poor dialogues, no script, fake suspense, mediocre actors. Just shooting and shooting. Bam, bam and bam!"
104,"Bad story, Terrible acting, Characters sucks, it's bad in every aspect...not worth watching"
105,"If you're someone that does'nt know much about what happened in the war in Mosul you would most likely believe everyting happening in the movie. But the truth is that there are so many fake things happening. The police and swat were working together so how on earth would the swat give money to the police to let them walk through. How they view the iranians in the war was madly wrong as well. The iranians worked together with the iraqi people who fought against isis and supplied them with weapons, people etc. Its really funny that they traded weapons with some cigarettes I mean come on. Don't you think that people who got weapons would'nt have cigarettes and stuff like that.Good job att viewing the false info and neglecting the true heroes of the war.
Thank you Netflix"
106,"Utterly brutal from the start, there are no famous faces that you can predict won't get killed. The street landscape and people in it are tragic. Isis as the Major states are ""empty people"". Great attention to detail as one of the few movies where the soldiers gather ammo from the dead. The action is intense but the futility of it all is overwhelming."
107,It doesn't represent what happened during the war.. the scenario is very week... Netflix sucks
108,"Worst movie ever
Worst movie ever
Worst movie ever
Worst movie ever"
109,This movie is very unsuccessful. in it. A falsification of the facts
110,"A very bad movie, due to the bleeding of the story and its difference from reality."
111,As an American I loved this movie. Fantastic story. Iraqi's fighting for their families in the face of evil. Acting is brilliant. I will watch it again and again..
112,"Thanks Netflix for this movie it was awsome , we hope watching More business in iraq"
113,This film is Very God and level up for iraqi cinama
114,"Thank you Netflix I wish you to continue producing films for Iraq, although the film has some shortcomings, but I think it is excellent. Thank you."
115,"As we are living in IRAQ we had all those feeling or we can say the war atmosphere we had been and we know how it was, the movie made me to think and get the same feeling i had 3 or 4 years ago the sequences were all well-produced, i watched the whole movie without getting bored for a second you know what I can't complain about nothing. damn i loved it THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS
DEFINITELY WILL BE ONE OF MY BEST MOVIES OF 2020."
116,"As a fan of war movies I have seen most of them. But never have I seen anyone like this one. This is a movie that could've been a documentary. We don't see any over the top bravery or heroes, just a well paced story unfolding. Black Hawk Down comes to mind, but that alas has a bit of the American heroism in it but this movie has none of those traits. The guys fighting are as professional as you can be without extensive training and they fight well. And despite their professionalism they still can't beat that stray bullet from hitting their comrades. It is just what happens when you have to fight like them. No support, no backup, no overwhelming strike power, just being quite a bit better than their foes.
Aside from the fighting, and this movie has a lot of it, you see the troubles a fighting force has in these conditions. Who is friend or foe? Who is a traitor? How will I change as a person while having my revenge?
I truly endorse this movie for telling a story how it for the most part probably was. And for as a spectator giving me an accurate view of the struggle in Mosul, the way it was partly fraught, and the people who were a part of it."
117,"An intense action that never lets up showing the men from Nineveh SWAT Team in Mosul, IraqThe good and the bad:
It is written and directed by Matthew Michael Carnahan, who directed recent films Dark Waters (2019) and World War Z (2013). Mosul (2020) is another successBased on true events - all films based on true events are off to a good start, although how true this one is I don't know?The action starts straight awayThe intensity of the film never lets upIf it is largely based on true events, then I doubt very few know it, but it's a story which should be toldThe acting and the way it is filmed is perfectAs I mention, I don't know how 'true' the story is, but the film is brilliant and drew me in from the start.Highly recommended."
118,This film is a small part of what happened in Iraq including murder and injustice ...üò≠
119,"This is another kill everyone movie. There are two redeemable characters, but mostly there is no particular point other than shoot, shoot and shoot until everyone is dead. The photography is great. The direction is good, the writing decent, with a good study in character. You do need to wait until the end to almost smile. It is based on a true set of events."
120,"Just go and watch this movie. This movie will tell you that, how local Iraqi forces got their city back."
121,Its very awesome to see netflix casting actors from Iraq with high budget to depict this unfortunate incident.
122,"All the scenes & dialogues in the film, just a small part but a very expressive part of what happened in that ancient & historical city.
It's painful blow in the history of Iraq / Mesopotamia which extends for more than 7000 years.
Mosul the cradle of first civilizations, first church & first mosque on the face of humanity were built there, was under brutal occupation that destroyed most of the landmarks of that city and looted its monuments.
Thanks Netflix to show the truth of what happened in that part of the world."
123,"Yes, it is a truly wonderful movie that embodies the sacrifices of the Iraqi forces defending the homeland, and the actors were wonderful and adept at acting."
124,"A great and good movie, and it is the embodiment of most of our heroic army, and everyone participated in the liberation of Mosul, not just a swat group. Thank you."
125,Nice actors and I like the reality picture in the movie
126,Very good iraqi new film and amazing story and it is really with the history of terrorists
127,"The storyline, actors, directing, and sounds all very good"
128,"It's a very nice work with very good actors, they made me live every scene"
129,A film which is different from the norm. Interesting look into a world hard to imagine.
130,"Director and screenwriter, thank you. So honest and touching! Such a tragic Middle East. God bless you!"
131,"Mosul is a movie that parachutes the viewer straight into the ruins of the war-ravaged city that gives it its title. It does not waste much time talking about the events that led to the war breaking out in the city and this way of telling the story proves to be perfectly suited for it in that it succeeds in creating a realistic insight into the experience of being caught up in a war and forced to concentrate on surviving the present situation without thinking about what caused it and what could resolve it. There is not much that is said about the backgrounds of the characters, either, and virtually all of them are surrounded by an air of mystery, which once again proves to work very well in this type of film in that it makes for a credible way of conveying the mistrust and the incessant state of doubt that are typically experienced by anyone who gets trapped in the depicted set of circumstances. There are a few moments when there does come the feeling that there should be more to say about a character or some of the previous battles, but ultimately the development of the characters and their authenticity turn out to be at a satisfactory level, and the performances are virtually flawless throughout the movie."
132,I liked it . hope to see more work about Iraqi army
133,"I hope more movies about iraq coming special about historical place and city like babylon which was the capital city of Babylonia, a kingdom in ancient Mesopotamia, between the 18th and 6th centuries BC,which was greatest city in the world at that time.
and thank u netflix!!"
134,I say wow because the truth story and I see it's good work from netflix
135,"One of the best movies to watch in this year, shows what Iraqis went through in the Mosul disaster and the cooperation of the iraqi army. I loved the fact that they have real accents, Thank you Netflix for making a good movie this year."
136,"The mosul is veyuekekskskskjsksjs wuuwjwk

140,"Good movie to see with friends of family
If you want to see the movie
You should"
141,"It was one of the saddest movies I have seen. The actors are great, especially Major Jim, who has excelled at his acting. I am sure that it is one of the best films that depicted the courage of Iraqis against terrorism"
142,"My love and God is a very beautiful movieüòçI hope that a film will be created about the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, which Iraq won."
143,Its Wonderful film and great. But sadly be cous we are remember the war
144,So much talent and effort in iraq are wasted to some cheap soap opera shows this is really a good start
145,Great film & Suhail dabbach acting is amazing so 10/10
146,"It s agreat film its talk about war in almousil, but its so sadly we remember the war"
147,"One of the best films I've ever seen.
Why?
The revelation, right at the end, of what their mission actually is.
It brought tears to my eyes."
148,I could say if you like wars you would definitely give that a chance
149,"Yeah finally At least movie without bullshit of milita popular mobilization forces controlled by iran terror
So like it to much
8/10"
150,Will all the wars in the middle east started by the US Gov under false pretense this probably won't be easy to watch. I'd like to see an Arab/Muslim story with middle eastern actors that can project hope & happiness at some point. The Muslim people have wisdom & grit. It's a crime what's been happening to these passionate people. Judge this movie on the acting not the plot.
151,"The film contains a bit of a twist on the militia
the movie so so so so terrible"
152,Nice work good story all good. Thanks netfilx and i love the charchers

154,"Ha-ha-ha-ha What a joke
The movie is full of deceptive events,
The story is not well put together and it's not even close to real life.Thank you Netflix, I hope you are happy now for telling these people bunch of lies."
155,Wow just wow. Watched the 2 times in 1 week. Just amazing. Movie feels like is only 30 min because how fast paced it is. You are on the edge of your true the hole movie. You must watched it!!!
156,So great movie ...i saw not so much movies but i loved this movie so much so interesting
157,"Words can no longer help me after watching this art to describe the tragedy and wars of Iraq. Really, it is a very wonderful movie. We thank Netflix for this beautiful work. The first seven people from the Special Forces entered the other side of Mosul to free their families ... and more than that, the story is true"
158,"I really liked this film , a little like black hawk down , if your ok with subtitles you'll enjoy it"
159,I assure you this us one of the best movies you would ever see.
160,"As a first step From Netflix to iraqi cinema he is good movie .. but ,
the money in the movie isn't iraqi money !the cigarettes isn't known in iraq !The script isn't good !!!and many mistakes..But it's first movie so keep going and make some movies like other countries Netflix"
161,"What a great movie great cast and great director , i hope we can see more movies like this Masterpiece ,thank you netflix ."
162,This movie is just One picture From what really happened to us in Iraq
163,We deserve this movie because we sacrificed our lives and our family for this bloody country üòûüòûüòû
164,"I liked the film, since I am a resident of Iraq, I can say that the film tried to reflect the reality of the war in Mosul and it succeeded in that, Great cinematography , the shooting is great, the script is good,"
165,"The work was really good, realistic and picturesque, with its letters and sad story"
166,This film is talking about my home very realistic way and the characters in the movie in line with events his very like me.
167,Good movie but bad story we wish to see one of the thousand of storys in this war in big movie like this. Congratulation Netflix
168,"This review is from an Iraqi who lived throughout the entire thing.I'm here to state some facts about the zero-hour of operation Mosul liberation...Watching this film and comparing it to what every Iraqi soldier/civilian had witnessed during that operation, you can't help but say that this film has nothing on the 'Free Burma Rangers' documentary or any other real Mosul firefight you'd see on YouTube.Sadly to say, considering that the film was supposed to be about Iraq, only 25% (if not less) of the characters in the film were actually Iraqis, others like the kid policeman and most of the guys in the team were Egyptians or Syrians and I thought I recognized one guy's dialect I thought it was from the UAE.Another facts... The Iraqi SWAT team is actually called Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) or the Golden Division, these guys are under the direct command of the Prime Minister and are in no way obligated to follow the orders of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, incase these guys refuse to follow a direct federal order, they'll be declared fugitives and will be shot on sight just like the Islamic State terrorists. And with that being said, no one in the country apart from the PM has the right to tell them what to do, and especially not a stupid police officer holding a checkpoint only to be bribed. These guys don't stop at checkpoints to ask for permission... They MUST be Iraqi and police detective with a Major rank cannot be a part of them, they only take in people at around the age of 18-23 (not sure about the numbers exactly), so I think you guessed it... they don't recruit people based on motive, it's not up to them.Also the ISOF operate US military-standard NATO gear and equipment... meaning no AK's, no looting of dead people vests... These guys are the most funded and the most paid infantry personnel in Iraq.And about the firefight and the scenery of the film... there's a reason why ISIS militants are called rats... they hide behind buildings, fire through holes, and they don't setup outposts in the middle of the street (when the Major and his second in command spotted them with the score/snorkel)... I mean, they literally dug tunnels throughout the entire city with outlets that extend 5-10 kilometers in the outskirts of Mosul. ISIS don't SMOKE CIGARETTES. Period... and that is what the kid looted off of the IS sniper he incapacitated on that rooftop.I don't know if anyone had the same experience that I had , but this film would've had a rating of 4.5/10.0 tops if it was about world war II and not the most recent event. Sorry, that's just my opinion."
169,The film is very very very good........................ thanks to Netflix for this gob and iraqi people wishes seems more film on our country
170,"The movie is based on real events !!
it's i big joke, The movie is based on lies just lies
thanks to netflix for this lies"
171,Seems like one of those commercial war movies which is directed to teens..
172,"The film is pretty good, and also the performance of the actors is excellent, the story and the directing are also excellent, and I recommend watching the film strongly."

176,"If you have a soul, you will never be the same after watching this film. To see what these people are going through in Iraq is a life changer. The story, cinematography, sound design are all beyond excellent and will immerse you. After a friend and I watched this at TIFF in 2019, we turned to each other and said we will never take anything we have for granted again. One of the best war films ever made!!"
177,"Five stars. Very realistic, intense. Well done. Loved every minute."
178,I was happy to find that all actors speak Arabic. To me this movie sends a message of love and there is no clear individual hero in the 'Swat' team. It is from the perspective of the people of Iraq and not from foreigners which was very refreshing.Unfortunately this view is not seen too much in cinema and I believe most people from America or Europa do not get in touch with this perspective as much compared to most war movies.The plot sends a message of love if you watch it through and the Arabic language made me watch the movie with much more attentiveness than if they were to speak english.
179,"Was it worth the watch? The answer is yes.Pretty much everything surrounding this film is mixed. The directing was above decent when it came to action scenes, on the other hand some meaningless sequences could stretch way too much.
The cinematography was beautiful but repetitive, keep in mind i am comparing it to Black Hawk Down here. The latter, though staged in a similar setting, found multiple ways to spice the visuals up (night shots, interior lighting and so on), which you shouldn't expect to see in Mosul. As for the guns enthusiasts out there, there's a bunch of cool-looking AKs to glimpse at.
Editing- and vfx-wise the movie looked quite professional, especially when it comes to faces, which is the topic many modern movies still have trouble dealing with. The only drawback here was a vague feeling of scars and blood looking unrealistic, can't really figure out what it was in particular.
The scenario was okayish, and the writing somewhat managed to keep my attention till the end. The characters however left me with a negative impression overall, with the exception of Jasem (i won't justify to not include spoilers). The acting was let's say average-to-good level, nothing crazy, nothing horrible.
A final thing to point out is that the use of Arabic made it hard for me personally to distinguish who was speaking at the given moment, which probably contributed to my negative thoughts concerning character development."
180,"Sounds good in the movie. üëåüëå...
graet movie ....."
181,It is nice to let the West care about important Middle Eastern issues such as the war on terror and explain to them the facts that have happened. There is nothing better than films of this era to illustrate and spread a certain idea.
182,"When it comes to war this one is ... well hard to tell. It is even better than Hurt locker, quite better than American Sniper although they are all great movies."
183,Plenty of action but couldn't take to the charactersShame as the subject matter was a plausible one
184,"Man, Suhail Dabbach is such a great actor. I started to watch this and I couldn't stop. I have never served in combat but I did serve in an intelligence capacity during the 1991 Gulf War and I can say much of what I saw and heard in this film reminded me of things I heard when monitoring radio traffic back then. I felt like it was 1991 again even tho this movie is from a different generation."
185,"This movie made me write this review, because of how realistic this movie was. It was a kind of movie where you forget about almost everything and just focus on the movie. I would recommend thos highly!!"
186,I found it a lot better than 'Extraction'. Tight editing and well directed.
187,"A movie with a soul and purpose. Action was on point and I could tell the actors were trained on the tactics. A lot of little details shows the director really cared about this film in taking the time to capture the ugliness of war. In war, humanity is the casualty and that's sadly lacking in many Hollywood productions. This is way better than that lie "" The American a sniper"" based on half truths and hyperbole. You feel for the people of Iraq and Mosul on what the invasion did. This movie is a must watch"
188,"The movie is very cool
It is possible to make more films about Iraq and the civilizations that were established on the land of Iraq"
189,"Why is the rating 7.3? Should 9-10, I see so many tens.
This movie is the best depiction of a war in reality. Gory, bloody, guttsy. death in an instant. So good. Best Netflix has to offer. Don't miss this, if you're into action pack movies. Stay away if you have a weak stomach. LoL."
190,If this movie does not win an Oscar or another award then questions need to be asked!
191,"The story was awesome despite the fact that it is real. The plot is unique not like any other movie of war.
Although every thing was good there is always one thing that is not right which is totally normal and that is the accent, some actors didn't even speak in the Iraqi accent I was hearing Jordanian. But all in all the movie was the first of its kind the first Netflix film in Iraq."
192,It was so so good in acting and I hope to see more of my country's acting in the future thanks Netflix
193,"""Mosul"" is a generic war film that shines through in technicalities but falters in the rest.
Main reason being its inefficacy to provide ample depth to the script. As a result, the inconsistencies become apparent.Barring any arguments about the alleged legitimacy of it being based upon 'True Events'. Solely from a film's perspective; this is indeed a technically sound execution. Credits must go to the team behind the camera & set design for aptly delivering realism in such pompous fashion.
It sucks you right into the ongoing events as you've now become a part of it. Unfortunately that's the only thing making an impression here.Even with a set of reliable performances on board, the Characterization seemed dreadfully loose. And because of that, I barely connect to anybody. An incongruous Screenplay failed to reciprocate any of the high octane moments with befitting remainders. Whenever, Action comes up; the film starts displaying its worth.
But as soon as it ends, the pacing comes to a halt as it loses quite a bit of its preceding steam. That's where mediocrity sneaks in."
194,The movie is simulated what happend in mosul not all what happened in real life we hope from Netflix to prduct movies and series
195,"Thanks for ICTS and all force fighting isis, I wish all fighters who die to RIP"

199,"Great job Netflix keep going with Iraqi movies
We want more"

202,"At one time, it seemed Isis was unstoppable in Iraq. The docudrama Mosul, produced by the Russo brothers, takes us in nail-biting detail with an elite Iraqi SWAT team dedicated to eradicating the last vestiges of the terrorist group with no little motive of revenge in their hearts.While this drama, pulling together pieces of real events, is largely close-quarter fighting in the alleys and homes of the city, first-time director and writer Matthew Michael Carnahan expertly takes his hand-held and Steadicam with the soldiers to give the immediate sense of terror mixed with courage and mission.The linchpin of the group is Major Jasem (Suhail Dubbach), rough and soft, tough and smart about Isis activities. More than once must he decide on the value of saving a life or letting it go, be it his soldier or Isis's. In that way this story is like The Outpost earlier this year in which hundreds of Taliban corner a small U.S. team placed in a canyon by irresponsibly clueless officers. Survival by wit is the common denominator, and thoughts of love buoy spirits but not for the audience that knows too well the ongoing tragedy.Many learn history through realistic films like Mosul. The sights are not pretty, and the losses are not easy to accept. Those who know first-hand our losing efforts in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq can be assured that we have a good idea of the costs of democracy and misplaced ideals through competent and uncompromising docudramas like Mosul.
On Netflix."
203,"This movie is not entertainment. It is sad and harsh and difficult to digest. Yet, it is based on true events, not Fake news or propaganda. It shows in is own way how human beings are the same everywhere. In a war there is no victory. Humanity looses no matter how you look at it.I suggest that you see and ""feel"" this movie.It will definitely create many thoughts.10/10"
204,"You are the best
We wish more movies about iraq
Thanks"
205,"I clicked this not knowing what to expect. This film starts and runs through in a constant time Frame and grabs you and takes you along. It's possibly the best film I've watched in awhile and the best war film since black hawk down. I saw someone else make the comparison/comment and agreed with the opinion. This film is imho better than black hawk down as the story and emotion of what your watching is far more of a superior film. There was a film called battle of long tan or some such about Australians in Vietnam which was good and captured what it must have been like for inexperienced private's when the enemy numbers and position is far superior to yours and the reality of conflict hits.
Mosul though was totally different and again a superior film imho. The horror and desperation and commitment to wipe daesh out of Mosul by the men of Iraq and their personal/family sacrifices is heart wrenching and the ending is moving in the extreme. There was no unrealistic bullet proof heroes the carnage and loss was real and although this is hands down a war film heavy in the gunfight/conflict scenes the reality of everyone's final breaths being just one second of bad luck away and the tragic loss of the father/leader/uniting presence force is hinted at in earlier scenes and a simple personal compulsion ends the 'hero' of the film. The last scenes made me choke up a bit and the ending could be no better. This film will stay with you a while and really make you think of the sacrifices iraqi forces made in Mosul to rid Isis from their city"
206,What great about this film is the big mission which will not be relieved until the end of the movie but you feel it all the time. It is so strong that even one of the heroes in the film did not it but still fought for it. Great film that cover one of the many stories which need to be talk about in this country.
207,It's a great move to explain iraq painBbbhgggggffxc
208,This is an extremely underrated movie. I can imagine that the suffering is only represented as a fraction of the real thing but this is a nice basis to understand what people in war torn areas are going through. Excellent acting and character development. Please give us more quality Iraqi cinema.
209,"I think that the film should be built on the basis of not sectarianism and not accuse others and offend them just because some details and events indicate abhorrent sectarianism. Therefore, I think that I conclude from the film
The owner of the role of Jassim Suhail Dabah and filming the Netflix company is the best thing in the film, it means that Charisma Suhail Dabah was the most beautiful and wonderful and filming Netflix, but otherwise it is not worth watching. Greetings"

213,"Having been involved with the old name Military Operations in Urban Terrain as Operation Continue Hope turned into The Battle of Mogadishu.The current extensive Use of RPGs, Handgrenades, our Grenade Launchers was to easy to make mistakes like bounce backs, thing comes right back in your direction, then boom. Semi automatic only, aim squeeze trigger, if low on ammunition kill them as close as you as possible, get any or all of what they have and their weapon, and know how to select semi automatic on the right side of weapon (AK-47), magazine release to reload.At Afghanistan more Military Operations in Urban Terrain, Street to Street, Room to Room, Building to Building, figured out Rooftop to Rooftop. AC-130s accurately firing at building across the street. Surviving the Battle of Mogadishu we made sure that we did not run out of ammunition, same idea just in case kill as many as close to you as possible, we don't aim center of mass we aim for the neck, bullet high shot in head, bullet low upper chest below neck, on target in the neck.What they did to make things worse, road blocks, and when you stopped of course they launched RPGs, threw handgrenades from roof tops, when you got out of vehicle they made sure that they had blocked the doors of the buildings with almost everything that was in the building so that you get suck in the open in the street in a kill zone. Fortunately for Us they had not started making the 100 pounds to 1000 pounds Pakistanis Fertilizer Bombs (Improvised Explosive Devices).Iraq as deployed from Afghanistan 2001 the City of Sargat Iraq. More Military Operations in Urban Terrain except much easier than Afghanistan 2001. Full support of U.S. Air Force Special Operations Wings, AC-130s, F-15 Strike Eagles, etc..This movie accurately depicts some, not all of what is involved with Military Operations in Urban Terrain, and also has some tactical mistakes that they made and the deadly consequences.When I got involved with the Iran Iraq Wars, glad that was Conventional Warfare out in the open and not at any Iraqis City. The same with CIA Operation Cyclone most of that was Mountain Warfare, lots of ambushes to make the U.S.S.R. Bases run low on food and ammunition, sometimes infiltration into the U.S.S.R. Bases.Not going to rate this with Stars. If I did would be 11 stars. Too many memories of too many losses of as to how deadly Military Operations in Urban Terrain is. Being in Command leading from the front, Survivor's Guilt."
214,Nice move I love üòç the move so Marchand great move what can I'm say about the move
215,"Like Uncut Gems, be prepared to feel pure anxiety throughout the whole movie, from beginning to end, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat. Besides the action, this movie demonstrates the damage foreign influence has done to the Iraq, constant meddling and wars have done so much damage, Mosul is portrayed as essentially bandit country, different factions operating on their own accord throughout the city. The Nineveh SWAT team are heroes, and I hope their work and efforts inspire others to bring Iraq into a new age of peace and success. A excellent scene which I found particularly moving, as some of the SWAT team are praying, ISIS start hitting them with drones, and the members continue to pray as their comrades defend their position from the drones. Demonstrates the brotherhood and comradery among the team."

The true story not like this
The SWAT and the Hashid shabby
Have great rule their
All the Iraqi army fight with faith not only specific component
The treason done from the families lived in Mosul
Not from the army
You can search on the YouTube that the people who live in Mosul who actually betray the army
Don't fake the facts"

248,"It is a beautiful story for the team of heroes, but there are some errors that must be corrected because they are false and we do not want the world to see the false facts üòÖ, the Federal Police sacrificed a lot and the PMF was not bad either. The Iraqi army has sacrificed all kinds. We want more of these stories because they represent the extent of suffering and pain that occurred in the city of Mosul ... Thank you, Netflix"
249,The best movie ever has personate the fight against those rats
250,The movie is very cool. We thank Netflix for producing this masterpiece
251,A masterpiece love and support from mexico my das is from iraq btw
252,Well presented with good storyline. This movie will help the world know how Iraqi people lived with the evil war.
253,"The movie is so good, talk about the real story in Iraq (Mosul) what happened in 2016 it deserve to spend 1:45 minute, Particularly is In Arabic Language Iraqi dialect.I recommend everyone to watch if you like action movie."
254,"The film is based on a true story as is well known, but it could have been better presented to increase sympathy for the sacrifices of our heroine forces, however you will be affected by the reality of the film and it is impossible for you to not have an impression after watching it ..Output:The directing is of a documentary nature, it gives the positions their full rights, the way scenes are managed and the transition between them is more than wonderful.Photography :Photography is almost universal in terms of proper use of the aspects of taking snapshots and focusing on key scenes.the acting :As for the actor ""Suhail Dabaj"", his acting is completely improvised, and this added an aspect of seriousness to the character despite some unwanted confusion that occurs to him during the important scenes. I do not know why he is no longer photographed or modified because it made the actor unable to see him.The supporting actors turned out a little chill, but nevertheless the greatness of filming and directing sufficed.Scenario:What killed this creative work was the script and character building, and the way the event passed, it did not give the viewer enough time to understand the character, its causes, sufferings, and feelings. If the film was two hours in full, the characters would have developed better.The hero (Major Jassim, Suhail Dabaj) received a large share of this injustice, literally destroying the way events were narrated and the way they were conducted. It is assumed that (Major Jassim) was the central character, but .. I will not speak until I do not burn events!Dialogues:The dialogues were never professional, very suitable for an American movie, but you will not like a movie in the Iraqi dialect ..
The hero of the film speaks a very beautiful Iraqi accent, but the others have not really mastered the Iraqi accent.Is the film biased towards a certain axis? :The message of the film is that only the Iraqi forces will liberate the land of Iraq, not America or Iran.
The film well illustrates this fact and the most obvious negatives of the American and Iranian presence."

263,"War is the physical manifestation of ideological constructs like patriotism, loyalty, duty and pride. Young men and women kill one another to preserve social constructs such as country and culture. But the real enemy is intangible, because the purpose of battle has little to do with its participants and pawns. War is not conceived to be a personal essay: it has no place for the intimate humanity of pain, grief, empathy and compassion. The system demands clinical robots, before spitting them back out as wounded humans.READ THE FULL ARTICLE ON FILM COMPANION"
264,"I can say this movie is a dare work showed many facts, despite sometimes with exaggerating but yet it did great job with these facts:1- the presence of foreign fighters (the French rebel who got killed by swat.
2- The morality of patriot people and fighters of swat or by its real name (counter terrorist forces).
3-the dedication and sacrifices for good cause.
4-Existence of Iranian rebels, although exaggerated.
5-the reality of corruption and bribery to local forces which led to invasion on the Mosul.
6-the experience of iraq forces from Army of Iraq in Saddam era.
7-the consumption of weapons and ammo was so real like in the reality confirmed by stories from the ground scenes.
8- The simplicity of scenarios was good.And yet the movie missed :1-Story was short and briefed even battles conflict was too short , the film it self should last at least 2 h.2-The Ending was so fast and emotions of the fighter when met his wife was a bit slight and unexpectedly cold.3-The dead of The major could be more dramatic, though its a positive point that the film based on concept and principles.if its meant then it excellent.4-once again if its on purpose its good , the Isis fighters dressed differently and their faces wasn't with beards or their flag and they looked so weak and stupid , which is unreal , the brutality and the strength of them also wasn't shown at all.
5-the 2 kids pulling a trolly conversation was good but their dialect looks like they're from Jordan or Syria, not iraq.6-Kawa should have practice more on the iraqi dialect and kurdish language as well.Best Regards."
265,"The movie is successful and the story is beautiful, but there are some things that affect the film, including dialogue, that was not enough. We didn't understand the soldiers' stories on their own. Their individual stories were superficial and not deep enough for the integration and love of the personalities and their impact on them. The film was short for about one and a half hours. We would like to appreciate the excellent work of representatives, managers and those who have done this work. I hope to see more work about my country Iraq."
266,Amazing movie 10/10 and more than that it's really a great movie from acting from camera from editing everything
