1,Nothing unique about the movie. Predictable story. weak storyline. One time watch.
2,"After the outstanding web series Scam 1992, director Hansal Mehta delivered another entertaining movie. But this time he switches to a light-hearted zone. Chhalaang marks the fifth movie of actor Rajkummar Rao and filmmaker Hansal Mehta after Shahid (2013), CityLights (2014), Aligarh (2015), and Omerta (2018).The movie has a simple, little predictable, yet enjoyable plot with a good message. The story also deals with the importance of sports education and gender parity. The first half has well-written characters and smartly written humour. The second half has well-executed Basketball and Kabaddi matches, although there was still room for tighter editing.Rajkummar Rao never disappoints, he again delivers a diverting performance. Nushrratt Bharuccha gave a charming performance with her lovable Haryanvi diction. Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub looks convincing as the competitive PT teacher.
The film also has a great ensemble cast, Satish Kaushik, Saurabh Shukla, Ila Arun, Jatin Sarna, Baljinder Kaur, Naman Jain, and all the young actors delivers a terrific performance.Direction 3/5
Acting 3/5
Dialogues 3.5/5
Story 2.5/5
Screenplay 3/5"
3,"Rajkummar Rao and rest of the star cast act brilliantly.
But the story is routine, and it's treatment, execution very ordinary. The climax is very weak.
Background music is standard; hence the desired impact of the critical scenes are lessened to a great extent. The film could have been 15-20 mins less. The direction isn't extraordinary.
So overall the film turns to be average. Music is decent.
It's a one time watch"
4,Good Family Film.Rajkumar acting is Mastermind. Such a great story.
5,"The first half of the movie is nice but not that good. The second half of where the movie loses its charm and becomes predictable and slow.
Don't expect too much from the movie.
You may like it if you have low standards.Looks like bollywood is still living in fictional world, I'm from Haryana and if a couple are found hanging out they are beaten black and blue, but here they are going for dates specially in city like jajjar. And meeting guys Father.
Eventually the girl will always end with the hero and in this case job too.
The movie doesn't makes sense in the second half, it's like Sultan where he does training for one month and he beats the world chapions.
Over here they had turned nerds into professional players within few days.Very disappointed and dissatisfied.
Lost my previous time.
I wish I could get it back."
6,"Chhalaang is an attempt on the miserable yet reality of the sporting system prevalent in the country. It targets the frivolous nature of PT as a subject in schools with subtle yet powerful gender inequality still existing in society.
Subject looks impressive and the hype it got before it's release sets the expecting sky high, something which it fails to live by.
Hansal Mehta coming on the back of a blockbuster web series 'Scam 1992' somehow hasn't been able to make this as exciting.
More often than not you might have deja vu with ""Dangal"" and ""Chichhore"". The predictably of the script adds to yet another reason for this not living up to expectations.
In no way it's a bad movie, but definitely a good distance apart from a ""WOW"" movie.
Absolutely a good watch for entertainment but don't keep very high expectations.
Rajkumar Rao have life to Monty and was brilliant as always.
Nushrratt finally got a more character oriented script and she has shown quality and real glimpses of her talent. The Hariyanvi accent was beautifully. Mohammad Ayyub and Saurab Shukla were terrific in their characters and deserve all the appreciation.
The background score was pleasing.
Overall a decent watch with a lot of gaps to be filled but a good entertaining 140mins"
7,The perfact cast and superb storyline makes movie enjoyable in every bit.
8,"Movie was not upto the mark.... First of all I don't like this idea of holding a competition for a woman..... Then one can't out of the blue take up some random students and train them against already good players and the newly trained ones actually win..... Though I appreciate the fact that the player who actually turned the tables and was the most reliable one was actually a girl and the team was having players of both genders.....
The idea that the boys were chased by dogs in a guava orchard was bad, the is not how training is done....."
9,"There is nothing new in the story, Direction was good, dialogues were good Rajkumar Rao has done a phenomenal job infact the best thing about this movie is Rajkumar Rao other supporting actors like Saurabh Shukla, Satish kaushik, Jatin sharma, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub were done a good job Nushrat Bharucha also done a decent job. All in all a good family entertainment movie dont expect anything more than that.üòä"
10,"Its not like this story has not been told before , but what makes chalaang unique is primarily the direction of hansal mehta, who after a long time is indulging in such a project , and secondarily rajkumar rao's flawless acting talent .
If u want to spend your lazy afternoon with giggles then chalaang would be a good pick this diwali !"
11,Unrealistic movie..made up situations...90's type of movie...
12,"The movie deals really well with the attitude of people towards sports in India through the life of the protagonist. It uses an amazing method to convey an important message, while at the same time keeping matters light and funny. In other aspects, like while dealing with romantic and family life it's a normal Bollywood film, with little, but predictable twists. Overall, a great watch and probably worth your time."
13,"Everyone has acted well. The story is exactly what can make our from the trailers. There are a fair number of useless elements that are not used. A lot more emotions could be evoked and direction/screenplay could have been better.
It is entertaining nevertheless."
14,Same boring story. Seriously looking for a movie worth watching.
15,"This is full of excitement, emotions overall worth watching. Plot was usual but because of the acting, it didn't made me to skip for a sec in the entire movie.
Rajkumar Rao's one of the finest movie...üëç"
16,Truly an awesome movie by Hansal Mehta and Luv Ranjan. Simply great and Raj Kumar Rao steals the whole show and makes maximum use of this mother tongue and dialect. Looks so real and for sure this movie would be hit in North India or especially those who have ever visited a school in Haryana. It seems like a real life movie but the love angle digress the movie but not out of context. Overall a nice movie to watch !!!
17,Totally waste of time...filmaker thinking that due to corona peoplyat home are having very free time so that then can watch anything without applying theirs mind.its really a very pathetic movie.and who have given this movie good rating they may be belonging to crew and cast of the movies.
18,"Predictable story, few good comedy punches n overall great acting.
Don't expect much, its 1 time watch with family."
19,The message was good but I feel the execution was lacking. Certain portion is good but most part is difficult to connect. They should have focused on romance a bit more.
20,"Purely illogical, you will feel like to spit on each and every scene. Blalant and boring üí©üí©"
21,Rajkumar Rao at his best.. really good movie. Its a very happy movie. Relaxes and keeps you entertained throughout. There is no dull moment or phase. Must watch.
22,"Importance of sports in life and career wise.Empowering women.Never give up attitude.Challenging oneself to win by sweating for an extra mile......are among the social issues handled here.The story is fun and appealing in the ways, above than the said words."
23,"I don't want to give you any spoiler so, I would only say that It's highly recommend movie just watch it . Please üôè
üî•üî•üî•"
24,"Worst movie of Rajkumar rao, overacting and very bad direction"
25,Dont know why the movie is getting good reviews. Maybe due to Nepotism traction Or the fact that recent films in the Ott platform has sucked bigtime(sadak2 & laxmii bomb) in comparison this one is atleast a one time watch. but really this is a very average movie.
26,Story is good but the dialogue delivery by all the actors are just amazing.all the characters potrated their role very nicely.good story and screen play in comparison with big budget and copy paste movies .yet another master piece from hansal Mehta after the epic scam 1992.once to watch movie
27,"Hansal mehta is on run streak, first scam 1992 and now chhalaang, a perfect BLOCKBUSTER, a story of underdogs trying to defeat the already a champion team. Well this is a story seen so many times but every time it looks good and same is the story with chhalaang. A very predictable story but with lots of entertainment and hilarious haryanvi accent, this movie is must watch.Story revolves montu a PT teacher in a small town of haryana whose life changes when a computer teacher enters his life and also gets objective for life when yet another new PT teacher comes to the school and becomes head of montu. These leads to a small competition kept between the two. A simple stoty is fully made with heart. Hansal mehta has succeeded in showing some social issues very lightly and in comic way and as it is a bollywood movie, thus with full drama.
Rajkumar rao is such a natural actor, a small town guy roles are like made for him, nusrat did a decent work apparently got a good share of screen time and proved that she has got some good acting talent.
sateesh koushik, saurabh shukla and zeeshan aayub are the champs in comedy, their comic timing is up to the mark and dosen't look forced. Other supporitng cast did pretty good job to make movie even more watchable.on occasion of diwali, this movie is best treat to watch even with your family, a perfect family entertainer which must be seen."
28,"Raj Kumar acting very good . After seeing this movie I much impressed with the acting of Raj Kumar .
He is the one of the best actor"
29,"Movie was super and better than movies released this year. Commendable performance by all the actor and actress in the movie. There wouldn't be a moment where you feel boring. Better than soty1/2, panga. A good sports oriented movie and also a family film. It wouldn't have come at a better time then this. Hats off to the director and producer."
30,In order to fit into the character there is a lot of overacting by most of actors. Becomes unbearable after a point of time. Its trying too hard to be authentic.
31,This is the movie you can enjoy with your family on these festivals daysIt's a normal story but well directed by Hansal mehta of course not like scamRajkumar is the hero of this Diwali by giving fabulous performances in ludo and this movieNushrat killed with her expressions and others contributed wellThe movie is hilarious but needed some good edit and songsLike other good sports movies this has also kept the vibration onIt is entertaining
32,Rajkumar Rao once again stole the show with his acting skills and he was well supported by other casts. A watchable comedy movie with a much-needed social message is what you get from this movie.
33,"Shameless storyline. There are some social responsibility as a entertainer, remember it dear. Long way to go"
34,Same boring story. Seriously looking for a movie worth watching.
35,Worst Movie.Absolutely worthy enough to be ignored..Waste of time!!!
36,I did not liked the movie at all. It's totally a mess
37,"Charsi ganjedi bhikari s desperately back
Charsi ganjedi bhikari s desperately back
Charsi ganjedi bhikari s desperately back"
38,"One can watch it but completely predictable plot
Nothing new same old drama etc etc
Better watch any holywood movie. They are Much better."
39,"Hansal Mehta delivered again. The movie was quite simple. The plot was already known after watching the trailer. But Yes, it is worth watching. Rajkummar Rao & Nusrat Bharucha have shown great skills of acting. But the USP for the movie was Mohammad Zeeshan Aayub. He has perfectly nailed his character of 'I.M. Singh'.
The Supporting cast of Saurabh Shukla, Satish Kaushik, Ila Arun have also performed excellently.
The 2nd half should not be missed at any cost!!"
40,"The movie is disturbing on various levels, a teacher to prove his point, organises a competition our of nowhere, and to teach students to run, he casualy throws them infront of a pack of HUNTING DOGS, which latter on uses the same sounds of the dogs to win a competition. (Then why did they spend our 30mins on showing the grit of kids to excel in sports, if they had to win through dogs barking aloud on speakers)
Second thing objectionable is that when teachers would serve false court notices to parents in blackmailing the parents to work on the whim and fancies of the school Admin and to make the children do something which the parents don't approve off, (this they call it in the movie Sam dham dand bhed, chanakya would be really ashamed of this type of interpretation)
Thirdly, to bring out the best underdog story, of never to give up even if all your chips are down, the laywer father comes out with so called motivational story about his client who he was fully convinced off, that the client the lawyers are representing was actually the murderer and fighting for his client was wring and a lost cause, and even though the whole village knew about the outcome that the client would be tried for murder, the lawyer bit into his grit and through his skill, even though he knew this was a lost cause, did manage to acquit the murderer, (what an underdog storyüëèüëèüëè)"
41,"This is very light movie, good for entertainment.. You can watch with family.. so hanky panky in movie.. simple and pleasant to watch.. Story line is very simple which doesn't offend any one or any once emotion,, good message for the teachers and Students also.."
42,"Yes, movie was predictable. Out of 3 they will lose first.. excel in second and after some skipped beats and fist clenching win last game. But it was amazing. For parents who want their kid to get 96 97 out of 100 and think it's the only way to become someone in life it a perfect way to say take the road not taken."
43,"What are you trying to prove with the movie? That it's okay to not work hard entire life, and for live just start acting all stupid? That real educated sportsguys are no match for a village idiot?The movie is total cringe worthy and portrays exactly what's wrong with India now. Useless euphemism over nothing, a loser should have been portrayed as a loser."
44,"Below average movie ,predictable ending. No new concept"
45,We all must unite against production of this kind of stupid movies!
46,"Hate the cast especially ajay devgan, he is the worst and awful acting"
47,"Kya hai ? Rajkumar ka hype band karo ... Mitti , Gareebi , Cotton saree aur Rajkumar RAO matlab Art movie ? No sorry üòê Itne pagal nahi Hum ... it's such a cheesy dramatic unrealistic movie under the pretext of Art movie ... Isse Achha Harry met Sejal type drama dikhao koi glamour or achhe visuals to hote hai. Nushrat n Rajj romance üò∞spare me the horror .. typical bakwaas Bollywood movie hai"
48,Don't Watch! Don't watch movies of this bollywood. Time to banned on Bollywood.
49,This movie is wrong at so many levels and promotes all the wrong things.
50,"Only good thing about movie is rajkumaar, else everything is s¬©¬©¬©t. I made mistake to watch this movie by seeing its rating."
51,It's. Really great experience and entertainment ful movie
52,A motivational movie shud have good dialogue.. this one had none !! Acting was average . The other actor who was competition to rajkumar rao was better
53,Rajkumar Rao should have chosen a better script. Not suiting him.
54,Really bad storyline. Good actors but still they could not do much with such unrealistic story
55,New masala in same outdated story. Very poor story and boring.
56,There was no wow moment in the movie. The characters were not build well and the motive of the competition was so very bogus
57,"Nothing Great , This is a below Average ""Sally Rides the Horse after Falling and Failing the Horse"" movie.
The only thing good is the Trailer because it's to be marketed that way.
Rajkumar Rao has become a Boring Actor with similar roles and novelty.
After SSrajputs death he's the milking cow but won't last long. Pompousness and Stiffness Goes into drain .
You can't expect Greatness from Producers like Ajay Devgan who has only done mediocre work all his life.
Won't be watching these movies as they are made by and Stars Bad and Evil People."
58,We started watching only because Rajkumar Rao was in it. I guess he just started doing such movies for the money. Not that I blame him but I'm sure he'll be cringing every time he sees himself in the movie. 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back .
59,Below average movie with a logicless script. Saurav shukla and rajkumar make us laugh a little but not worth watching for 2hrs. Its a family film which you watch for timepass. Not recommended
60,Good actors are just wasted in this over the top drama. The message of the movie is having specialised physical educate is wrong and that job should be given to a village bum. Home cooking is bad and it's a sign of slavery. We should all waste slot of our hard earn money on food take aways and should not eat the clean food of our home. Mix sport is ok. On the name of gender equality a woman should live like a man and not just A man but an idiot one.
61,"The movie is quite predictable but still it binds u to screen for sure .u feel the character well connected and friendly. And the lesson it gives u for the life is most precious,excellent work by all crew and the great heads of to camera man and producer and director for the great shoots shown in movie"
62,"Below average story and acting.
Can surely give it a miss."
63,"Only watched for R Rao.
Otherwise the topic is good but could not make it well. U can easily pass this. Forgettable."
64,"From Senior actor like sarubh sukla to satish kaushik to New Generation actor rajkumar rao, nushrat, zeehsheen ,Bunty all are too good.. Story was not so good others department are also good"
65,"Don't watch, a sheer waste of money this Bollywoodies are!"
66,"Do not give any money to bollywood, that would be used against you. Remember rajkumar in the karan's party?"
67,"I mean there is nothing too bad technically with the story, acting is kind of ok for most part, but there is nothing new with the story and is totally predictable !Watch it if you have nothing else to do, but you will just feel ""meh"" at the end - a shrug at end, no jubilation, no stars, no tears , just meh"
68,"What a great movie it is. Very good for growing India. Instead of showing vulgarity or abusive language, this is a great movie where one can learn a lot, from Montu and Singh sir, about training, or life lessons from Shukla ji and Montu's father, or the spirit of a teacher from Neelima ji.
Would love to have more such movies which improves the mindset of person of every age group."
69,"Decent movie, but lacks depth both in plot and characters. Moreover, film is quite predictable."
70,"I laughed so much, it's a mind-blowing movie which keeps you engaged ,based on a village theme ,it's a good family movie."
71,Good Movie.nice and funny movie to watch good storyline.
72,"Rajkumar simply at his best, Nushrat couldn't carry herself in Haryanvi tone."
73,"Ghisi piti kahani, overacting, illogical, clumsy screenplay, boaring dialogues......how could such story can be turnes into a movie?
Only Rajkumar Rao has shown his work & somewhat Satish Kaushik & Saurabh Shukla are watchable.Nusrat is not a main lead material."
74,Nice twist at the end... Expected the typical end to the story but was surprised at the way the story ended. Not too many songs in the film which would have been an unwanted distraction
75,The story is so much predictable. I would say this movie is a cheap version of Student of the year movies but slightly better than those.
76,"Great movie, recommend, the story was bit old type, but I enjoyed."
77,"Rajkummar Rao and rest of the star cast act brilliantly and all there performance was too good but story is not interesting
No climax was good"
78,"The story line is just like any other sports movie , team will be about to lose but some magic will happen and they will win. It has a good message and acting was done well by the cast ."
79,It's really a beautiful movie. Perfect comedy timings and songs really gd. Normal bt a fascinating story. Enjoyed a lot
80,"Positives first. Acting is great by all key actors though some are definitely underutilized like Saurab Shukla and Rajeev Gupta. The movie is also light-hearted and a family movie. In fact, you can combine your regular chores with watching the movie and not worry about having missed anything.
Now, the 5 stars are because I rate it 6 for first half and 4 for second. The first part attempts to add some humour, but it doesn't really make you laugh. It's completely passable. It's not too bad though. The film completely falters in the 2nd half due to an unnecessary angle of this competition between the two PTI teachers. This was completely illogical and you shake your head in disbelief. Well but we have all seen such Bollywood sagas, haven't we? So we can go past that. Then since it's going to be a game, you'd want to root for a team, in this case obviously Rao's team. But you don't feel sympathetic towards it and then their methods to train and persuade parents don't cut any ice. The movie is a complete letdown and better to avoid. Camerawork and acting is good. You can give it a pass or treat it as a time pass."
81,"Seriously,such a garbage story.Is this how Bollywood is going nowadays??"
82,"I like it... All carecter done their job good, specially Sing sir (Mohammad Zeesan Aiub). But the slap seen should be removed, the girl pinky slap the boy who is so younger than her & neither girls and nore boyes have the right to slap each other... Scrept writer or Director should remember this."
83,"Time waste movie üòëüòë writing is pathetic
Yes off course the acting of rajkumar rao was awesome but what's new in that"
84,A really hilarious family film. Outstanding humor. Story was ok kind of predictable. But good to watch with the family. Performances of the cast were outstanding especially the supporting cast.
85,"Watched it only for raj , he was brilliant in every frame"
86,Movie can be predictable but the screenplay was good... One thing they could have avoided is the park sceen with the hero & the heroine parents which no way brings any continuity... End of the movie I feel if every school is competitive with spirit to whatever game or study they do it will be good for the future generations...
87,"Though, some scenes are too filmy to derail the decent plot, it is enjoyable ride overall.A good one time family watch!"
88,"Good family bollywood movie after a long time
Good family bollywood movie after a long time"
89,Everyone here praising Raj Kumar Rao (no doubt he acted brilliantly in this movie) but Sourabh Shukla did equally well. Good movie.
90,"Same old story of rag tag kids becoming sports champs, like We are Marshall or The Mighty Ducks. But had it not been the presence of Rajkumar Rao here, this movie would have been a definite disaster. The work that Hansal Mehta got done by the kids was exemplary. Saurabh Shukla was a delight to watch, despite his character not required for the movie at all, just like Nusrat Bharucha, who was probably just there for the Indian palate. Satish Kaushik was a delight too, like always. His mere presence in a scene gives you that assurance that you won't be bored, whether he does comedy or drama.Overall, must watch on a Sunday afternoon kind of stuff. You'll not regret."
91,"Comedy Timing : Perfect
Shrad Shukla and satish kaushik excellent job
Rajkummar Rao Perfect haryanvi accent
Story got dull in competition
Otherwise good movie"
92,"Quite a predictable film, over the top humour trying too hard to be funny. Left watching it after 30 odd mins. Have better things to do."
93,The movie try's to make certain social issue stand out . But those don't stand out . Chak de is the best movie so far. Can't believe hansal mehta director of scam also directed this mediocre movie . Had great expectations from it. Nevertheless movie can be watched once and along with the family
94,"No element of surprise in the whole movie.
Typical Bollywood style movie. Filed with unnecessary songs that don't make sense.
But a good effort by Rao and Bharucha.
One time watch maybe, or you may skip the movie as well."
95,"#Chhalaang - Jitna uppercase feeling one got watching director #HansalMehta's #Scam1992, utna hi lowercase one feels watching this. Must admit, it's not as bad as Laxmii.Seems more like a producer #LuvRanjan movie than #HansalMehta - shallow characterisation, roadside humour and a totally predictable 2nd half.
It takes just one dialogue/ expression for a character to change his/her outlook - that's probably why the movie is titled #Chhalaang - the fantastic leaps characters take during the course of the movie.#HiteshSonik may be producing different background scores for #LuvRanjan movies but they all sound the same.Couldn't walk out of the theatre as I was watching at home."
96,Seems it was made by the team not for an audience but to keep themselves occupied with some work during Covid time.
97,"This movie is like gone in 60 seconds.
Story opens up before even you see the movie and the story is full of lackness in delivery of whatever the scripts says.
In short, bad script, bad casting and direction."
98,"Weak point -Predictable story
Strong point-Rajkumar Rao and supporting cast's acting"
99,First half was brilliant.. Entertaining.. But 2nd half lacks the show.. One time watch..
100,"An amazing movie to watch with family. Haryanvi dialect was amazing. Rajkumar rao at his best. He literally adopted the role of a PTI. The actress could've done better. Secondary roles such as Haliwai, Mummy, Papa, Friend we're amazing. They made the movie much better. Amazing ancillary actors. The Villain did well but I assume he can do much better."
101,The movie started well but lost track midway. The female lead is terrible. Very little character development. Ends up being the same old unrealistic Bollywood drama. A few humorous scenes but that can't make up for the threadbare storyline. Can't believe this is a Hansal Mehta film.
102,Super dupper movie exxilent work i like rajkumaar rao and standard work
103,"Just a cute, feel good movie that's perfect to watch w/ your parents or other family members. Kind of felt like it dragged in a few places but the excellent acting by the cast made up for it. Although, I do feel like the character development was a bit poor but all wrapped up - it's a nice movie. There's definitely better media you can spend your time on, though."
104,Same old story we have watched in thousands of movies. Nothing unique about performances of any actor.
105,One of the first Rajkumar Rao movie which I despised. It was same vanilla story line.Nushrat and Rajkumar I somehow felt very irritating. There is something feminine in his acting style. I liked him in Omerta and trapped.Maybe he has to rethink about his roles and delivery.
106,Hilarious sports movie if the year. Lovely dialogues and super acting by all cast members. Really enjoyed it.
107,"Chhalaang review :In a significant departure from his serious cinema, director Hansal Mehta's Chhalaang is a light hearted rom com with a dash of 'khel- kood' drama thrown in. Written by Luv Ranjan, the plot, especially the second half, is quite predictable but still makes for a satisfactory festive weekend watch with family. Provided you keep your expectations low.Of the cast, Rajkummar Rao is earnest as ever in the lead role. Nushrat Bharucha resembles Deepa Sahi a lot but isn't able to match her in acting skills. The supporting cast comprising Saurabh Shukla, Satish Kaushik and Ila Arun are sincere.Not great nor too bad a film, Chhalaang is better than Ludo and Laxmii - the other two OTT releases this Diwali. Atleast, it doesn't spoil your mood!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
108,"Story starts of with the simple premise of a irresponsible PTI(Rajkumar) with his daily routine and his life, but twists comes when he finds out that another wel trained PTI is now going to instruct school kids. How Rajkumar over com this situation is the movie..
Acting: All lead and supporting ctors had done their job perfectly.
Music: Good hummable songs and background score is good especially in sports sequences.
sports sequences are directed properly.. little bit dramatic sometimes.
Director Hansal Mehta is in form right now
In the end Movie teaches us than. Win or Lose in any competition,take it sportingly"
109,"A movie I set forth watching with really high expectations. Rajkumar, Luv Ranjan and Hansal Mehta. Rajkumar is always sincere as an actor but even he can't carry a no story movie. Luv Ranjan who shares writing credits is known for vibrance and lively stories fails to inspire. You keep on waiting for something worthwhile to happen something inspirational so much so that it becomes a drag and you are glad it's over. Out of six, two stars are for one liners and some quirky laughs in the first half."
110,"The movie is predictable at every single point. With such a good star cast it does not meet expectations. Acting is excellent. Music is okay. The story was very weak and old, otherwise it could have been made into a great movie. It also felt unreal sometimes. It is a good movie for time pass. Don't expect great things from it."
111,Way better than other sensless movie stories that are being released during corona.Simple story and good acting.
112,"Rajkumar Rao's acting is good but does not releases his full potential. Sheer waste of the acting talents of such great actors Saurab shukla,Ila Arun, Satisk Kaushik.
The plot is not strong and climax is simply too predictable. And the forced HAryanvi accent is irritating sometimes"
113,Overall cat acting is superb but storyline and direction is poor
114,"Its a capturing and motivating drama,which doesn't let you get bored throughout the movieüòÄ.must watch guys!!"
115,"Very rare in stories to show true sportsman spirit. And accept that opposition is better and can teach self.
Good for kids to learn and adapt in the competitive world."
116,Awesome bro rajkumar thanks for a great movie great this awesome I love this
117,Great and good this movie really good because it's competitive movie
118,Wonderful competitive movie for teachers and students
119,That is a good movie for students and teachers and all of man
120,Best movie I had expected by that service and scene from this movie
121,This movie have a great entertaining and a good experience
122,"Movie was
very nice good movie all are watch good massage for all the men's and women's"
123,It really entertaining movie I love all character of this movie
124,This is a good movie most entertaining movie for all
125,Good movie. Average movie this movie is really good.awesome I watched
126,"Hansal Mehta & Rajkumar Rao are like Pav Bhaji, together their combination gives authentic taste of cinema.
From Shahid to Omerta and recent Hansal's Scam 1992 everything is a masterpiece by itself but not this one.Chhalaang is as long as it's title with few unnecessary characters.
About a PT teacher who realises he is a PT teacher nothing else. A mediocre film with performing actors like Rajkumar Rao, Saurabh Shukla, Satish Kaushik, Nusrrat Bharucha, Ila Arunand Zeeshan yet it's a pastime and nothing extraordinary or great here.Writing felt ordinary at best, music was decent and score was good. Jatin Sarna 9f Sacrad games comes and goes as fast as a ""Parle G"" get drowned in Chai. Haryanvi accents are at par and film does intend to provide a social message but it looks more like a forcibl glass of milk than a smooth gulping milkshake.Available on Amazon Prime, watch it for the sake of watching it and nothing else otherwise lagao ""Chhalaang"" to the bed or couch nearby and sleep."

But story of the movie is Beyond reality, This movie's Conclusion based on Sports results, One side well Trained Sports Students and other Side has those students whose never played any sports but they still got winners tag.

147,"Basic concept... simple story

148,Story is so predictable that thwre is nothing to enjoy. With such talented cast much more expected.
149,Storyline of the movie is predictable and weak and in terms of comedy it's just above average. Good for one time watch.
150,"This is really fun movie, nice to see a sports movie dedicated to school level."
151,Natural potration of Haryana . I actually laughed at silly jokes. Good time pass.
152,"Just when I was losing hope in bollywood movies, I have watched this.it is so good, it is a simple story but well executed. Although it is very predictable, this movie is not about the climax, but rather about the ""journey"".Kudos to the producers who invested in such a simple, no-nonsense movie as opposed to the regular overhyped bollywood movies."
153,"Solid acting by Rao, Kaushik sir and Saurabh Shukla. Barucha is adorable too in haryanavi accent.
""Ghatiya hona to theek hai but ghatiya hone pe ghamand hona, Badi baat hai""
Second half is predictable but enjoybale.
Overall a good movie."
154,"He is a real acting RKR
Than outsider very good acting from nepokids"
155,"Some days you need a light hearted peppy movie, this is that neatly woven simple movie, ho for it..."
156,Hansal Mehtaji this is disaster... This movie will not be given get 7 rating if it was not for Rajkumar rao...this movie is fully waste of time..
157,Recommended. Will not be disappointed. Acting and comic timing is great.
158,The first half of the movie is funny and the second half of the movie is so inspirational.
159,Light hearted movie filled with comedy and laughter. Powerful message delivered by movie of making winners out of losers.
160,Best movie for sport and so many ture line in this movie for sport person to play and sports .
161,Leading cast done a grt job and a well assembled supporting cast uplifed it more üëç
162,"One will like the simplicity of story and the varied emotions hinged to the storyline.
Worthy for a 1 time watch."
163,"Still confused if this was directed by the great Hansal Mehta whose work was also top notch and technically brilliant. I feel this was just his ""time pass blow off steam"" work after the stupendous Scam 1992! Raj kumar rao was as usual good but very under utilized. Actress was totally looking out of the place for a proper haryana based movie. The only odd one out fo the entire cast. Music was average. The last song was totally unnecessary. I believe Luv Ranjan was let down as this might have been a pretty good story on paper but spoilt by the director. Editing was below average. The school children characterizations were not established properly so missed the connect in climax. Overall just a average time pass movie from very brilliant artists."
164,"Nusrat Bharucha, who appears only in Luv Ranjan movies has no screen presence at all. I feel like fast forwarding all the time she is on screen. Zeeshawn is absolutely average. Rajkumar rao is the only highlight of the movie along with Saurabh."
165,"This was a awesome movie loved it
Classic , nice characters really nice movie
Rao fans will love it."
166,"Usage of regional language, raw acting, humor, yet mixing a cause makes it an extremely entertaining movie. Rajkumar rao keeps up to the spirit of acting and show casing a cause, truly a good actor"
167,"#OneWordReview #Chhalaang Entertainer
One of the finest entertaining movie based on sports. Yes the climax was predictable but the way Hansal Maheta Direct this it is fabulous. Raj Kumar Rao such treat to watch. He again proved that how superb he is as an actor. Nusharat had done a good job. She got a good dialogues & the way she acted it was looks so good! Mohammad Zeeshan as an opposite Character he done superb work. Rest of cast were decent too. The perfect mixture of light hearted comedy & Sports. You will love each & every scene of the movie. #ChhlaangReview 4/5* . A perfect watch for Diwali!"
168,The movie start with same usual story in fact you can see trailer rather than watching story trailer itself will tell you all the story.
169,I liked this movie very much . It contains very nice comedy
170,"You just can feel that they are acting.
A good acting is one which doesn't feel like they are acting.
Worst script
Worst performance ever by Rajkumar Rao"
171,This is really a great movie with highs and lows along with elements who as humor and fun to it.
172,"""Chhalaang"", Hansal Mehta's fifth time collaboration with Rajkummar Rao; is a breezy entertainer. Being an above average execution at best, especially keeping in mind the excellent track record of Mr. Mehta in recent times; It just about delivers as a pastime.Hansal Mehta has a distinctive style in his craft. As we have seen several times with his outings like Omerta, Citylights, Shahid, Aligarh or the recent hit Scam 1992. All those being critically acclaimed and inordinately loved by the audience. As a result with any of his new projects; the expectations are usually sky-high. Perhaps those exceeding confidence should be the one to take all the blames.A message is indeed there, the intent is discernible but an underwhelming execution failing to match those ideas on a similar level. Performances are great. The writings on every character had me surprised. Even the smaller roles made an impact. It's technically well made with a competent work behind the lens & a fitting soundscore! However In all fairness, all the flaws & loopholes in the script subdued its other qualities.Conveying the gravitas of 'Sports' and its irrefutable positive effects on children is laudable. But it was never set up as a sports drama, nor it had any naive intentions to do so. The sole focus was always on the underdog story of Rajkummar Rao as Montu and his journey from an ignorant fool to a sensible being. Hence, after its first half the storyline lost its charm and began its slow & unfortunate descent into mediocrity."
173,"Chhalaang is a good family movie that can be enjoyed on any evening. I loved the movie for a number of good reasons. Here are the highlights-
1. The plot is very interesting. There is not a 'melodramatic' moment and can be enjoyed with any age group of audience.
2. Flow is relaxed. Natural interaction between actors and does not feel like a commercial act at all.
3. Stunning cast. Rajkumar, Sourabh, Satish Nusrat, Zeeshan, Illa, all of them are outstanding, the entire team complemented each other's presence. Their expressions escalate the mood of this movie
4. The atmosphere of the movie is cozy, relatable to our everyday life, minus the music of course.
5. The dialogues are precise, funny, and appropriate. Most importantly the delivery is smooth.
Downside:
Overall rhe negative vibe is negligible or absent I would say. However I didn't enjoy the songs that much. Besides that, background music between scenes is vibrant."
174,"Almost the movie is good
Very nice story and rajkumar rao acting very well"
175,"Chhalang-- A Very Long Jump
Another OTT original feature film release in Covid times, this time on Amazon Prime. Lately we have been hearing such names like Chak-de, Dangal, Panga, which point to a desi flavour in tales of inspiration in sports. They are comparable to similar offerings in Hollywood of fight and motivation. Generally such stories are drawn form real life. As the name suggests this movie too deals with the same genre I.e. sports but the inspiration is from a hurt to the ego of one man as, the movie set out to be Montu'sl story of goof and love but there is a jump literally midway. It changes to a story of the underdog. Though everyone has their respective favourites in sports but one's heart surely goes out for the underdog. The movie is set in a quintessential town of Haryana. Indians love their heros in the field of sports and are proud of our Tendulkars and Milkhas and P.T. Udhas and Sindhus and want our children to be as successful as them, but as Montu-Rajkumar Rao's character says we as parents don't want to support our children to be like these idols. It is naukri and chhokri for which the boys are prepared in their youth and if a girl studies even upto 12th in the mofussil towns of India it is breaking news as they are prepared for chula and chowka for their in-laws' house. People who support their children or their married daughters-in-law really have a big heart. Though things are a changing but ever so slowly. Realisation that sports can also give a career and has professionals is setting in due to the various leagues in football, kabaddi, badminton etc. apart from cricket which is a religion for our teeming billion. Some encouragement, some support and some financial aid is the need of the hour. It is a story of courage and never say die spirit. It is about never giving up in face of extreme adversity. With a little hope, encouragement, out of the box thinking, perseverance and you will come out tops. That is the USP of this film but in the second half. The first half is dedicated to an insensitive, ambition-less PT instructor whose main job is to avoid work and loaf around, his passions are aroused only when he faces challenge in both job and love from a superior individual. The story changes to a tale of inspiration from then on. The unique touch of Director Hansal Mehta who makes us forget that it started out to be a romantic flick and splendidly turns it around. He is also the person who has helmed such sensitive socials like Shahid, Aligarh, Omerta and his latest offering being Scam 1992 which is a web series streaming on Sony LIV OTT platform besides this one. There is a definite shift in his subject, whereas in the past his films have dealt with social issues, the latest offerings from his stables have been more of mainstream commercial cinema but the touch is definitely still there. The performances are as expectedly great from seasoned actors like Rajkumar Rao, it is very noticeable that Haryanvi suits this guy and he he has not let us down either , he has given us a superlative performance in the movie and has looked every bit the Hero for the movie and in his character. The surprise packet is Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Mr. Singh the Johnny come lately who it trying to take over Montu's job and love. Nusrat Bharucha as a whiskey sipping, out going and a girl with a head firmly in place has performed suitably for the role and she looks dainty too. The veterans Satish Kaushik, Ila Arun and Saurabh Shukla make their presence felt. The dialogues and the behavior of the small town characters have been captured with subtle finnasse, in scenes like the fight in vegetable market and the sports ground or the one at Monty's friend Dimpy's eatery where they tease him for his cooking and profession that's the kind of banter we hear in such places where small things matter too. It is the second movie in as many days after 'Ludo' where the heroine asks the hero 'daru pilayega'? The equation seems to be changing. It is food for thought to all ye horsing males.http://filmytown.com/movies/chhalaang-movie-review/"
176,"Chhalaang is about that leap of faith we all have to take when faced with adverse conditions. It is about never giving up and always coming up with your next attempt to overcome the challenges.Director Hansal Mehta come up with a simple plot set in Haryana. It is a feel good movie. What makes it work is the limited number of lead characters around which the story revolves. Also, there is clarity in each character and they all look credible.Story itself is fairly simple and the movie flows like breeze. A good watch. Do not miss."
177,"Average and predictable movie, sports theme with the obvious drama and the same old preaching....nazariya badlo nazare badlenge!! Rajkumar Rao has done a fab job and was able to get and hold on to the Haryanvi accent in the entire movie, Nusrat seemed to be struggling with getting a hold of the accent, but the effort was evident and commendable! All supporting cast was amazing, these are pro actors and hardly ever go wrong, no matter what role! Loved Rajkumar's mum's character, not very many scenes but she was the typical Haryanvi mother, impeccable performance. Jatin Sarna was quite an underutilized talent, he is a good actor but had no significant role and was totally missing in the second half. Music and humor was average, though the scenes of dogs barking in the finale was a facepalm moment for me!! I hope we get to see inspiring movies but without the continuous preaching. Inspiration needs to be delivered in a more subtle way for it to reach our hearts. This movie was cliche and far from being awesome."
178,Light movie and good watch. Liked the story. Overall good learning and professional behavior even after you lose.
179,"First of all, came here after watching this movie to only feel embarrassed to see people rate it 1/10.
Is the average movie watcher mind so brainwashed by now that they pay money and waste their own time to see trash Bollywood movies spouted by nepotism and the Khan industry.The message in this movie is very subtle, most of RKR's movies are so, which unfortunately flies right past the average viewer (as is evident by the rating & reviews).Is the movie cheesy, unrealistic and predictable. Ofcourse. But you can't all have serious, grave movies with social messages because many won't watch it.This movie touches on many social issues in a light hearted manner that it *almost* escapes you.Raj Kumar is a part of the ""moral police"" in the beginning & later in a subtle manner it is showcased how wrong he was. These movies are VERY important. There are so many such hidden dialogues.Yes, it's a cliche. Taking a rag tag team and making something out of them. As if alllll Bollywood movies so far have been so original.
Excellent entertainer, happy to see none of them Khans, Chopras and Kapoor's & those brain dead movies they produce and act in.I'd rather watch this anyday even if it's an ""average"" story. 10/10."
180,"Some story maybe comes with same type story line but it give us a Chhalaang all time but when we use it in our real life we forget it maybe. So Take a deep breath and ready to take a big Chhalaang with Rajkumar rao
And Nushrat Bharucha . It is very helpful for students after a long break of school and college life to boost up their ""SSS"" . Now what is ""SSS""!! For answers You have see this movie ."
181,"Inspirational movie ,soprts is a important for a student"
182,"First thing first is the movie's storyline: these kind of movies have to be release on theater as well because our nation has to be watch mostly sensitive part of our nation who things wrong about girls in the sport and I loved the storyline #familywalimovie and short timeline, however the story is but the message was clear that's way I loved the movie. Peace"
183,I have no idea why people have not rated it highly. It is fun watch with absolutely brilliant performances. You will enjoy it. For a change the school setting is so real and refreshing. It is not like SOTY. These school kids are very relatable.. In fact my school was not very different for the school shown in the movie. Rajkumar Rao is just brilliand and Nushrat has also done a great job! All in all I will highly recommend this movie.
184,All the actors n actresses hv performed their roles well.....story was average....dialouges were too good ......Good movie to watch...
185,The film is set in rural town in Haryana. Sports is central to the theme. Anyone who grew up in semi urban schools will identify with rustic charm around school sports events.
186,Hillarious movie ... Mind blowing Rajkumar Rao Brilliant & Zeenat Ayyub Was Also gd ... Story Was Nice ....
187,"Please avoid. Trust me, the story line is non-existent and the acting is way overdone. Not much comedy either, unless stupid is your thing."
188,This story is not worth wasting your precious 2 hours. It is a typical bollywood story without any logic. Hated it and could not bear to watch it without continuous forwarding.
189,"I like all movie of rajkumar rao and Nusrat . Both actors doing fabulous acting in every movie. This movie is also best. After many months, I like this movie ..."
190,"Borderline between being tolerable and annoying. Yes, not even putting it to a decent comparison level. Over acting by the actors, poor story, slow tempo, average direction and uninteresting depiction overall. After watching the movie, a feeling of 'why did I waste my time' . Clearly made for the sake of it and released during this time on the hope that people will watch anything these days"
191,"You'd expect a script with much greater depth, but the Hansal Mehta & Rajkumar Rao combo brings a surprisingly light hearted watch with Chhalaang. What disappoints the most is the predictable and almost cliched storyline. The movie tries to win with an important message but fails to deliver it with any conviction whatsoever. Dialogues don't impress either. Watch it for the acting performances."
192,"This movie travels from ignorance to knowledge, from nothing to everything. This is a motivational movie which gives hopes to lost people. This also teaches how to tackle difficult situations in life."
193,"Good movie. Can watch with family. No obscenity and gaali. The movie didn't need a heroine, she was more like ketchup on pizza. Nobody would have missed her. Few questions to Hansal ji, why is she standing on a tall stool in the whole movie? Why are her dark circles video edited? Why did she exist in the movie?"
194,"Nothing new or exciting about this movie. We all have seen such plots numerous times. Only saving grace is flawless performace by entire star cast. Felt this movie was made just for own feel good time pass factor.
One time watch."
195,"The cast of this movie, their acting, their punch timing all are great.
Yes movie is little predictable.
But aren't we all watching movie for some entertainment??
And I guarantee you, you will never get bored, and there are many moments of true laughter.
Also Rajkumar Rao is brilliant as always."
196,"The plot was usual and on the expected lines but because of crisp direction, editing, the movie kept the audience captivating and glued to the movie. Rajkummar Rao is an excellent actor, but I found Nushrat Bharucha, a fresh face, overshadowing many a time. A family story with a nicely worded message in its conclusion but slight non-family in its promo song at the end. A must watch."
197,"Rajkumar has been one of the favourite actor of mine,but this movie doesnt help him to show his talent.Not capable of even 3 star."
198,"Movie had potential, but script and direction is weak. Good acting all round. Should have been more intense"
199,"I was proved wrong that Bollywood doesn't produce good movies anymore. One of those movies you can enjoy with your entire family.
MUST WATCH!!!"
200,Father Son having drink together along with his girlfriend that too in rural village of Haryana. Pathetic sense of direction not because of this scene...but because both are Teacher...and every evening they practing scotch along with parent.Dialogue of movie fits exactly... behuda harqat karna to ek baat hai . Usi behuda harqat pe proud ye alag level hai..Hansal Mehta should think before making those scenes....Pathetic direction
201,This movie story is amazing and nice . Never give up in our life overall movie is ok
202,"Good Concept ,, So Much Entertainment, Comedy,Romance ,Inspiration, n Awareness In just one Movie.
Great Acting.
Great Movie.... Paisa Vasool.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
203,Bad story bad acting even I don't like name of film. So I want to give 1 star.
204,Fill of fun and excellent dialogue in a simple story woven with beautiful screenplay. Each memeber of the cast has contributed to this fun journey.
205,Don't waste your time rather do some creative work
206,"Lack novelty , script and screenplay . Makers has tried to pull up last 20 min but failed."
207,"Though the first half of this movie was good, 2nd half of the movie didn't feel the same."
208,"Chalaang gets engrossing as it progresses. Well researched. Well scripted and good direction. Lives up to its philosophy of ""The match is not over till the last ball is bowled"". A movie worth watching. RK Rao shows his calibre. Audiences will connect with this well made movie. A double thumbs up to Chalaang."
209,It is just a typical bollywood masala movie.... Not worthy of time. Rajkumar Rao should have let go off this... This film has lowered the benchmark he had set...
210,Thr are similar movies already made on this topic.. performance wise Rajkumar Rao is brilliant
211,"Beautiful movie....but climax was predictable
Nushrat looks pretty....light comedy......perfect family type movie
And as always Rajkumar Rao was so good"
212,You should be more realistic rather than repeating same old story. They are predictable and every one knows about the happy ending.
213,"Each & every second of the film was amazing
Loving acting by each one."
214,"Just wanted my weekend , This is worst movie ever I watched"
215,This is very good movie and it's my favourite movie thanks for this making this movie...
216,This is very good movie thanks for this movie I watched this movie is my favourite........
217,It's a movie with great message and brilliant performances. It's a best movies to watch with your family and smile. Rajkumar is as always brilliant with his performance as Montu. Other casts are also brilliant. Direction is good. Must watch
218,"It is good comedy film, nice sense of humour, Loved rk rao acting. Nusrat barucha is owesome.
Shukla ji also playeda good role. Overall loved the movie."
219,Even though second part is a little predictable but even then movie is full of emotions and what we would like to watch. Go ahead and Watch it.
220,Rajkumar Rao once again proved his ability as actor. No one can do serious comedy like him.
221,Though this movie has certain points for improvement like some situations could have been more realistic and in the second half competition part could have been little shorter and less predictable but overall movie is a great treat for eyes with very nice ending and also superb performance by everyone including the kids.
222,Comedy is good in first half and second half is mostly based on competition. No need to describe the teams you already aware.From starting you know who will win but worth a try how they win and what message they want to convey.Please go and stream if you like any sport.
223,"Rajkumar rao and saurabh Shukla sir have done a great job. Nushrat barucha has a good hold to her role and justifying it that her character really have the involvement in all trainning session.
Overall you can give it a watch. It's not something new in it that you must watch it. Just give it a try and don't expect too much."
224,Family movie with good comedy sences and social message specially second half really enjoy and entertainment
225,"Best Motivation For Our School Teachers who feels teaching is a time pass (specifically PT Teachers).
Perfect Lesson For Children
Not to be good at only studies but also at Speaking skills."
226,It was really a motivational and a good watch for all generation. Rajkumar rao is best .
227,"We all know what will happen at the last in this kind of films, but we watch only to know how it'll happen. Chhalaang is a fun film to watch. If there was only comedy then maybe this would've been not a very good movie, but as there is also sports it became a very good movie.The movie is more engaging mainly in the 2nd half. The sports techniques were executed very well. The movie is full of very good actors and everyone acted very well. This also teaches that sports is very important part in childhood. At last, like Ludo, Chhalaang will also leave you with a smile on your face."
228,"Review:Scenes were predictable as its a sports movie
Song Care Ni Karda was not needed in the film
I feel Rajkumar Rao deserves better role than this
According to Luv Ranjan's movies(Ex:Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety,De De pyaar de) this is not that great as the other movies
This movie is good entertainer but could have been better"
229,"Such hilarious comedy, lot of subtle jokes makes it exciting, story not new but acting and movie is sincere. great job and we need such movies only. RKR should be next super star"
230,Good movie and a family watch. 100 times better then ludo.
231,This is very good movie I really happy with the movie thanks for providing me movie
232,It is a good movie of 2020 to watch with family and enjoy it. The best part about it is Rajkumar Road. He is very talented actor and I am sure he could be future SRK.
233,It is a perfect movie to watch with family and enjoy it.
234,It sets an improper example for the young generation. It will deter the thought process to strive for anything good or great in life. Comedy isn't good either. Neither was it inspirational.
235,"Nice block blaster movie
Best acting ever rajkumar is good acter"
236,"Excellent!! Very good motivational movie..
#chhalaang"
237,A movie with out any standard.. a big waste of money and time... tooo boring... ugly characterization and plot.
238,"The collaboration between Hansal Mehta and Rajkummar Rao is a force to be reckoned with. They've given us great films like Shahid, Aligarh, Citylights and Omerta. Their fifth collaboration, Chhalaang is not up to the mark.Chhalaang follows Montu, a PT teacher who is very lazy with his job. One day a senior PT teacher arrives and both clash with each other, leading to a sports competition between them to decide who gets to keep their job.I really like Mehta and Rao's previous works together but this time they decided to do something more mainstream and accessible. The end product is Chhalaang, which is one of the most ordinary and unoriginal films pf the year. The film isn't terribly bad per se but it's nothing special or memorable like their previous films. This doesn't feel like a Hansal Mehta film as all his other movies feel grounded in reality but some of the events that take place in this film don't feel realistic at all. The sports competition is something I've seen countless times and is riddled with all the clich√©s you can expect. Nothing about it is very exciting or new. It's too predictable. What the film does do well is the authenticity of Haryana. The accents and location help in making the state feel real.The acting is pretty good. Rajkummar Rao is great as usual. There is a great scene with him and Satish Kaushik drinking during the night and the way he delivers dialogue is really well done. Nushrat Bharucha does well but it felt strange seeing her character wear high heels throughout the movie. Saurabh Shukla and Jatin Sarna provide a couple of laughs and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub is pretty good as well.Overall, Chhalaang is very predictable and forgettable. Nothing new or creative is done with this kind of story and nothing stands out in particular. Unfortunately it's just another basic sports drama..."
239,"Unnecessary drama
Nothing else
Nothing new or promising to watch
Bollywood is now money making industry and Nothing else
Same ghisa pita kahani with slight twist
Bollywood lost all talent over the decades"
240,As usual the same old predictable plot but the performances are praiseworthy.
241,"The movie starts of well and keeps u engrossed,then suddenly it goes downwards
and no looking up post that.
Scenes where teachers try to convince the parents are so lame.
Sports competition scenes looks so jaded.A movie that shows so much promise but loses steam midway.
Keep the remote nearby as it can be used to skip through the second half torture."
242,A total family entertainer üòçüòçüëç. It's a total diwali gift. Finally an OTT film release worth watching after Lootcase üëç
243,"Little bit overdramatic but overall good movie. Good acting by Rao, Saurav Shukla and Bharucha."
244,First half of the movie is ok-ish but the second half is utterly boring. Don't waste your time on this movie.
245,"First half is superb but second half is too stretched. Couldn't feel any connection with any character shown. The story seems shaky - couldn't get the point of the movie.
All 5 stars for everyone's acting."
246,"The strory is simple and interesting with good humour. Best part of the film is you all can watch amd enjoy it with your whole family. Although there is nothing new in this but still screenplay is so much interesting to keep you seat till film gets over.
Story revolves mostly around a PT teacher Monty played by Rajkumar Rao and how his life change. Some of the sports drama in film you can compare from CHHICHHORE but still this film is unique in own way.
Talking about performance Rajkumar Rao is the soul of the film and again he has given powerful performance. Zeeshan Ayub again prove his acting skills and he deserve more recognisation. Saurabh Shukla made you laugh whenever he came. Nushrat looks damn pretty. Rest of the supporting cast especially all child Artists have done a great job.
direction of Hansal Mehta is good and yet again he has presented a good movie to all sections of the society with a strong message.
Songs are decent. personally i like Care ni karda and teri choriyaan songs.
Negative is you can predict easily what wil happen next in some parts of movie. And also sports drama could be presented in some more better way. But these flaws could be let aside
overall This film deserve a watch with all your family on Diwali. Recommended level: High sir"
247,There were many scenes where I would say that it appeared cinematic but the movie was so awesome that it is ok for the extra cinematic parts. Rajkumar Rao like always was great. His acting skills are extra ordinary. Nowadays it is either Pankaj Tripathi or Rajkumar Rao's movies which are everywhere. The movie Ludo where both the actos where awesome....now Rajkumar Rao in Chhalang was mind blowing. Nusrat Barucha played her character smoothly with ease. The supporting cast was to the next level. I would say...go for it...
248,Typical rural story. With the protagonist playing a happy go lucky person. The movie revolves around his he wins her over with showing that he is worth an effort. A waste of time and üí∞. Definately avoidable..

You wouldn't be able to stop yourself from saying, "" this is a really good movie'."
305,"So many mistakes; 1)unconvincing character development (a hardcore traditionalist making a total U-turn in one meeting with a girl)2)a very flawed love story (how can anyone fall in love so quickly with someone who has publicly insulted your parents)3)is getting a job so easy in India that one can organize a interschool sports meet and the winner gets appointed4)there are easier and safer ways to get your athletes motivated than to intentionally let them get chased by dogs5)The Heroin and hero's father threatening the student's parents to let them play in the 'tournament' . Which teacher does that? Is that even right ethically?Overall a one time watch, masala feel good movie, just don't use your brain too much"
306,"Family movie, good acting, good message given and rajkumaar rao and zeeshan are superb"

308,The things I mentioned above this movie definitely delivers all even more what a performance by everyone Rajkumar Rao was incredible it was funny and the journey of the character to fight and NVR give up makes it super amazing know he wins or looses for that I recommend u watch it majority of people will love it
309,"A very simple movie that delivers a very powerful message in a very entertaining way. It talks about an important issue and convey the message in such a delightful way without preaching. It keeps you hooked till the end, not a boring moment. Hats off to Luv Ranjan's writing and Hansal Mehta's direction. After Akaash Vani we can see Luv Ranjan has written something beautiful instead of his usual Rom-com movies like Pyaar ka punchnama and Sonu ke titu ki sweety. Reminds us that he is capable of writing good female roles too. Totally different genre for Hansal Mehta but he has aced this social comedy.Acting is top notch by everyone including the kids. Raj Kumar Rao is one of the best actors in this generation he has proved it again in this one, you cant help but root for this goofy PT teacher Montu in whatever he is doing. Luv Ranjan's muse Nushrat Bharucha does an amazing job as Neelu. She is such a natural actor and deserves good roles like this. Raj and Nushrat shares amazing chemistry and its delightful to watch two self made actors doing so good in movies. Supporting cast is top notch, not a single bad casting in the lot. Best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the kids. They have done a superb job each and every one of them. Like the balance between girls and boys. One character that stood our for me personally was the girl Pinky and her little storyline.All in all it's a perfect family entertainer that gives a message to teachers, students and most importantly parents."
310,"I would say after a long time such a masterpiece.
Great story line,nice message to society,nice songs overall full package"
311,Fantastic movie all characters played there part very well
312,"A comedy movie with strong message.. great casting ,writing and comedy timing of actors. Loved it"
313,"Probably the best bollywood movie of 2020,I mean just great storyline and very enjoyable movie it's a must watch for sure."
314,"After a long time,laughed so much while watching a bollywood movie.Brilliant acting by every cast member."
315,"True diwali gift form Hansal Mehta and team in the form of Chhalaang, Don't even think of watching Laxmii this diwali it will surely destroy your festive mood"
316,We should never quit anything.we have to fight till death.
317,One of the best movie of 2020 no nudity no abuse language use. 10 out of 10
318,"Seriously its a hilarious comedy movie and surely a must watch, from the very start to the end couldn't stop my laugh"
319,"Hansal Mehta and Rajkummar Rao constitute one of Hindi cinema's most potent artistic collaborations. Their films - Shahid, for which Rajkummar won a National Award, City Lights, Aligarh, Omerta - are blistering, probing portraits of the state of our world. In Chhalaang, Hansal and Rajkummar attempt something more mainstream. They tell the uplifting story of a PT teacher in small-town Haryana, who finds his purpose in life through coaching the weakest kids in the school into a winning team. I suspect this conventional narrative went against their DNA. Chhalaang isn't tear-your-hair-out awful. It's just ordinary.READ THE FULL ARTICLE ON FILM COMPANION"
320,A good watch just if they would have cut one scene in later it would be 9 Point film I thought that that scene was unnecessarly dragged it could have been easily chopped but at the a good watch with strong acting and a good command of dielect
321,"A fabulous combination of fun, inspiration and entertainment. Movies of such capabilities always remind us that a powerful story and stalwart performances by the cast is always the quintessence of Bollywood. Special shout out to Satish Kaushik and Saurabh Shukla for such indelible performances in every movie. It's a must watch."
322,"Gem actor.......................,...plz do watch it"
323,I just enjoyed watching this movie with my familyüòç the songs of this movie are also too good.
324,I would love to watch this movie again and again.Full entertaining movie the actors acted too nicely.
325,One of the best sports movie..if you dare then change my mind
326,A 2020 must watch movie.Direction of the film was on track a family entertaining movieüòç
327,Fully entertaining movie. Must watch the story is too awesome
328,It is very useful service for all user. It is the best services. It is nic
329,Chalaang movie is a must watch movie I would love to watch it again and again the story is based on a very nice theme till the end it didn't made me feel a little bored I really enjoyed itüòç
330,"Total time waste, was waiting eagerly for movie of Rajkumar Rao, turns out to be the disaster of the decade, no idea what director was trying to achieve and no storyline, was not expecting this."
331,"Very poor Haryanvi accent & the way of using Haryanvi dialogues is also poor. If you have seen ""Tanu weds Manu"" then you will not like this movie as it is nowhere stands near TwM."
332,Except Rajkumar Rao's acting all other actors are avg. I am shocked to see when Nileema is asking Montu ki Daaru pilaoge. After that in every 7 minutes there is liquor scene. Monty's father serves and drinkliquor. Montu's friends drink and serve liquor.
333,"What is in this movie? Waste of time. No good song, no humour, no punch line...No suspenses...Nothing."
334,"A Time waste.
It is niether a Comedy Movie not a Sports Comedy.
Luv Ranjan, Bansal Mehta and Ajay Devgan made a Khichdi."
335,Another movie promoting creepy Bollywood stalking... Even i felt cringe being a guy.
336,"Chhalaang (2020) :
Movie Review -Chhalaang was lucky not to release with high expectations because the trailer clearly said that it is nothing new but just same old traditional bollywood stuff. Hero falls in love with heroine, third guy enters in this emerging Love story, hero feels jealous, challenges him and defeats him in close match. Chhalaang is as predictable as this typical 90s formula which is by far outdated in today's time but then it has sports issues to deal with. Whether it manages to deal with the issue or not is a different argument altogether, but yes we have it and we have it in outdated and predictable manners. If all this 90s or may be 80s formulatic drama if I'm not wrong makes to your watchlist in 2020 then you should definitely watch Chhalaang this diwali.Chhalaang is a story of a lazy and ambitionless PT coach Mohinder aka Montu who falls in love with a computer teacher Ms. Neelima. However their first introduction spoils his dreams, he tries to convince her through apologies and few local heroic tricks. Then the 3rd guy Mr. Singh enters in this emerging love story and Montu decides to take him on. Both the coaches makes this small challenge look like a national war and we all know who wins at the end. Chhalaang never ever looks like trying something new, it doesn't even bother putting new techniques in the love story nor it bothers doing something in screenplay. It looks rough right from the first frame till the last one and somehow manages to make an average flick with the help of performance and postive outcome.Rajkummar Rao is a brilliant actor and we have seen him taking tough challenges so this Montu character is too lightweighted according to his standard. He deserves better and tougher roles which can suit his potential but this Montu is very ordinary. Nushrat Bharucha looks gorgeous and handles local accent beautifully. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub also gets underwhelming role to play and he does it like an easy daily life course such as walking or sleeping. Supporting cast is fine but remains unnoticed because of weak writing.Chhalaang did not stand a chance to come out as a good film because it falters in the on paper writing but directorial efforts make it look even more weaker than it was. Lame execution in almost every aspect kills the potential of decent story is somehow saved by Music and Performances. As far as such films are being made audience will keep saying, ""Enough of old school books, Bollywood needs to think out of the box or at least try something new"". Overall, Chhalang got nothing new to offer but still it's an average watchable flick when there is nothing else to watch. Hopefully people won't show much interest to see just another frivolous short jump made by Bollywood filmmakers hence they might come with something new next time. It is hard to believe a creative mind like Hansal Mehta came up with something like this because he's one of those from whom we expect something innovative and hard hitting.RATING - 5/10*"
337,"I will not support Bollywood movies or it's so called druggystars anymore.
They are Inhuman.
They do not have any Feeling for Costars like Jiah or Sushant.
They don't have any feeling or respect for us also."
338,"Poor story line. A PT teacher, who is least interested in performing his duties is shown as the hero of the movie who turns his fortune within a month. A good coach is shown a loser and portrayed negatively. What inspiration should one draw from such a pathetic movie. Very illogical movie to be frank."
339,Story is good but due to pathetic acting or you may say overacting by co actor (zeeshan Ayub) movie became pathetic.Better to watch something else
340,"Amazing, fabulous and an extraordinary performance by Rajkumar rao....Nusrat... beautiful..dear... Saurabh Shukla sir..love you sir...Zeeshan sir...nicee performance..
dialogues and screenplay....Too good..."
341,"Flim is based on a nice subject but does not seem to rise to the expectation . Same stereotypical story and film doesn't contain anything new. Rajkumar tries to hold audience attention throughout the film but even such a good acting performance cannot deny the fact of a avg storyline.Nusrat does a fairly average job one cannot keep an eye away from her .Supporting actors are the ones who really try to keep the film's humour going and stand high in terms of acting .
But again film does not perform well as first half is a total romance buildup and second half seems quite fast as lots of things are happening and the most important part the ending seems to be known coming and makes the film an average one time watch"
342,"Poor direction, Mohd Zeeshan Ayub is doing overacting"
343,Very average script. Raj kumar under used. Hansal put your creativity in really thinking of a better script.
344,Better to skip this one. Story is quite predicted.....
345,The narrative could have been played much better...like some great sports films.....Rajkumar rao as usual was good....also Shukla.....but rest was too dramatic......even the storyline at many points felt copied from many sports films of India......
346,"The movie has superb actors and they have delivered too. Its always a pleasure to watch good actors in one frame. The kids are the surprise element who have acted equally well. There are moments which make you laugh and smile. 10/10 for acting and direction.However, the movie is let down by a predictable and weak storyline.This is still a big let down in Bollywood films where no effort is put on the script. 0/10 for story."
347,"This movie launching date as same laxmmi movie I watched both the movie and I want tell only one thing Akshay kumar time came to pack ur bag and make a room for such talented actor, actors and director. Laxmmi is not a 1% of chhalang."
348,"Rajkumar steals the show from the word go. He takes the proceedings forward very well. The supporting cast is perfect with a special mention for Shukla ji. His expressions are enough at times. The movie proceeds well till it reaches the finale. Getting the sports sequences right is not easy and not all succeed in keeping the audience interested. Unfortunately this is where the director fails. The matches are not thrilling enough and even the climax is a big let down especially since the movie keeps you engaged through out.Special mention for background score and cinematography.A time pass movie. Except for the last 30 minutes, the movie is quite entertaining."
349,If you are a romantic at heart and if you are in love you will love this movie. Watch it two times. If you like it the first time you will love it the second time.
