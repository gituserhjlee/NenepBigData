0,To all the people who include the word 'Penny' in their review... I hope you also complained about Breaking Bad having Malcolm's Dad in it. I hope you haven't watched Fringe or The Affair because it Pacey needs to stay on Dawson's Creek. I hope you have a problem with Californication because of Mulder...The show itself... I haven't watched a lot but I have enjoyed what I've seen so far!
1,"First off, this show is way better than the commercials made it look. I was very pleasantly surprised by the pilot. The lead actress is showing she is capable of so much more than the Big Bang theory (thank god). She's not outright likeable as a character but it's by design and she pulls it off really well. The directorial choices are bold, and threw me off at first but by the end of the episode I was digging the unique flairs the show goes for. From the score, to the shot framing, self aware flashback scenes (if you can call them that) and more, the show makes an effort to stand out from the crowd and it hits on 90% of those choices. I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the series goes. Will update my review if it goes downhill from here."
2,Okay so I know some of you guys don't wanna pay for hbo max but this is a good show fast paced funny and sweet I only saw the first episode so far but this is very good and I recommend it to almost anyone
3,"It's a bit of a caper, modern day Telenovela, mystery who-done- it. The target audience isn't the same as The Big Bang Theory, I have a feeling that's why there's such a wide discrepancy in ratings. This one is modern and more subtle.
It's not the best thing I ever watched but it held my attention during this strange Covid winter. Had a crisp pace, interesting visuals, and relatively even tone.
The only thing that was a little hard is that the main character is dealing with some pretty serious trauma both in the present and in the past, but then there's kind of like a light caper going on around it, so there's some dissonance there that's a little bit hard when you're watching."
4,"I love this show......
Very suspenseful I love that the main character is wondering what, why and when???? So many questions.
Everything is crazy u can't figure out what is going on. I love that. I just keep wondering what's gonna happen next. It's the best.
I like how she is going back and forth w/the dead guy and trying to figure out what have happened to him and how she did not kill the the man and what have really happened.
I cannot wait to find out who really did it!"
5,"Three episodes in... Great pacing, Kaley Cuoco is perfect and the drama mixes well with comedy. Although, the comedy can be a little heavy when you want it to be serious. It's everything you'd expect from the trailer. Definitely can't wait for more of these intensive-filled episodes!"
6,"WOW. I have binged and the the first 3 episodes, and I am so excited for the rest. Excellent show, cast, everything and a mix of humor, drama, mystery. Kaley Cuoco is very believable as her character Cassie, as is the rest of the cast in the parts."
7,"Well, this is a show with a twist that keeps on delivering.
First off, Kaley Cuoco finally proves she's more than a sit-com bambi, and that's quite a feat in the Flight Attendant where her character is...well, a blonde silly bambi, to some degree. Her delivery of a whole scope of emotions and reactions to events unfolding is way better than I would have previously given her credit for. She alone is worth seeing the show, and that's just a start.
The story arc seems interesting and well planed. It doesnt give away too much, keeps you mostly on the edge of the seat. Supposedly there's not that much going on in the episodes following the pilot, but they are well shot and well written. The pace seems quite fast thanks to the on going state of general turmoil around Cassie. I did not get bored watching the first 4 episodes.
Are there any flaws? Minor, sure. I have had some minor issues with the way FBI acted, sometimes it seems they would have made better choices. But it's not a big deal, doesn't compromise the show entire."
8,"Maybe it's entertaining for some, but I can't get over the lazy, cliche writing. Constantly drunk flight attendant drinking vodka on a flight and sleeping with passengers? Really? They could have tried a bit harder, as a former FA The character is uterly annoying and none of the motivations are believable or really even probable which doesn't even let me enjoy the comedy part of it. The characters, especially the ""crew"" are a bunch of stereotypes, the music is overly dramatic and the split screen gets old."
9,"Slogging my way through the third episode. It's trying to be a noir-type mystery but so far has been a faceplant. The characters are pretty two-dimensional and the subplots are even more trite. As much as I adore Kaley Cuoco, even she can't save this Boeing 737 Max of a show."
10,"I'm really not sure who the audience is that would find this sort of low brow comedy appealing. Right from the start you can tell that this hoping that any Big Bang Theory super fans will check this out as Kaley Cuoco is the lead and plays the same type of clutsy character. But after one show I think even her biggest fans will not be happy with this show.Lots of reviews from 1 review accounts attempting to prop this trash up from the bottom.This is just frustrating to watch. The endless drinking and partying portray flight attendants in a poor light which I'm sure no one will appreciate. The dumb blonde schtick gets old fast and is rather annoying. Flashbacks and a dimwit trying to be a detective is just not that watchable, and I had to stop halfway through esp 2."
11,There was a time long ago when flight attendants were seen as glamorous world travelers living a jet set lifestyle. Those days are long gone but this show manages to hang on to every bad stereotype and more. Will our drunken sexpot of a protagonist find the real killer? Is she actually the real killer? It's getting really hard to care one way or another.
12,"The casting is a miss all around staring with the lead. Add to that a bad attempt to add humor and ""clever"" sarcasm to a murder mystery and it just means nothing is working. Different casting, better writing and focus on a murder mystery might have salvaged this, but it's not engaging enough to even care who did it."
13,"I had to give up about half way through the 2nd episode. While liking Kaley Cuoco's other works, in this show the writer(s) make her out to be an alcoholic nymphomaniac with an IQ lower than her shoe size. She gets drunk has what would be a one night stand. Wakes up next to a corpse, and (the writers make us believe) that as she is a ditzy blonde, she cleans the crime scene before leaving. Then she thinks she's Nancy Drew & decides to find out what happened, instead of calling the police & let them do their job. I checked the writer's previous efforts and they all lack experience in writing comedy and this show clearly demonstrates why they should keep away from the genre in the future."
14,"3episodes in: and always the same pattern. first episode was really interessting but then same old same old. and whats up with the constant alcohol drinking ? i get what they trieing to say with it .. but its too much.first episode 6 pts
sec epi 4pts
3epi 2pts"
15,"It's refreshing, different, fun and makes you appreciate your own little boring life :). It's not an Oscar winner yeah, but not all have to be. I really liked it and can't wait for the next episodes."
16,"Definitely wold have binged this series in one sitting if I didn't have to wait! I absolutely love it!! Best pyschological crime/thriller series I have seen since ""You."" I dont understand the negative reviews on here about it being ""boring"" or the ""nothing new."" I was thinking the exact opposite while watching it! I was really into it, and was so sad when I finished the 3rd episode and remembered that HBO doesn't release full seasons."
17,"It was funny at first, now it's just ridiculous. They just took the ""penny"" character and turned her into an even drunker flight attendant playing Nancy Drew. I'm bored, won't finish this series. Glad i didn't sign up for HBO Max ...."
18,"Show is an okay watch but what kept bothering me how much Cassie drinks.. I was worried more about her getting sick than the mystery. Also, its really hard to like any of the characters in the show."
19,"I struggled to complete this series.I love Kaley Cuoco. I saw The Big Bang Theory because of her and it is one of my favorite comedy sitcoms ever. But this The Flight Attendant isn't yet funny to me. I have not had any reason to chuckle. It has been all glitz and glamour and club scenes and sex. I like the premise but so far the execution hasn't been as promised.The single, 30 year old, hard partying, hyper- sexually active and heavy drinking character has been overdone by American producers. I roll my eyes each time the lead character gets drunk or has another fling.I am still waiting for the drama to unfold and so far nothing fantastic has happened yet. BUT the series is promising, I remain positive and I will keep watching to see if my review would need editing for the better."
20,"I've looked at all the negative reviews with astonishment. When exactly did we lose the taste for hokum, screwball, and farce? It's improbable and unrealistic? Well, duh! It's not a documentary!It's appropriate that the ""poster"" features the lead character falling as the tale is in many ways a modern Alice down the rabbit hole with Kaley Cuoco in the character of Cassie making a pitch perfect Alice buffeted by the unexpected and unpredictable while dealing with her own problems of scatty wilfulness, capriciousness, and a raging thirst! Michiel Huisman as the murder victim, Zosia Hamet as the weird best friend and lawyer, and Rosie Perez as the overly dependent colleague all provide perfect foils for the madcap misadventures. Definitely one of the highlights of this otherwise miserable year!"
21,"I love this show a lot. It's fast, it has great locations, lots of different fashion.
You would forget anything this actor has done before, she does sad, happy and comedy all very well.
What do you do when you wake up and the person you went to bed is dead and then you can't get out of your head.
He helps Cassy solve his murder, along the way she finds out things she'd rather not know. It all starts with Cassy meeting a man on a plane. You learn a lot about Cassy, why she became a flight attended and how she became a drinker, that's the not so pretty part of Cassy life.
Go watch it and make up your own mind."
22,"How are we supposed to take a character seriously when she has the emotional depth of a drunk toddler.
Cass acts so unbelievably stupid in the days after the murder. It's also unbelievable that every person in Cass's life wouldn't think she killed that guy. It takes until 15 minutes into the second episode for Cass to make a good decision, she then immediately starts to make bad ones.
This show insults your intelligence at every single turn.
I'm out."
23,"She is still clumsy, promiscuous and a drunk! So, this role had her name written all over it 🤣 I watched the 3 episodes to date and I must say, Kaley Cuoco is an amazing actress - wow! Sure many of you may get mad my calling her Penny, but it's hard to let go of her career-making character, especially in being a similar character. But this time, it's not aloof acting, but intense dramatics, and she has pulled it off. The entire casting is actually great, and it's great to see Rosie Perez back on the tube. Novice creator Steve Yockey who wrote and produced the Supernatural and Scream TV series, managed to put together this genre-melding hot-mess whodunit comical drama with - so far, great success. It's sexy, tense, darkly funny, trippy, twisty, weird, fun, entertaining and a crazy ride, that without Cuoco's career-best performance, may have not worked. It certainly is something refreshingly new in the subscription TV-show battles. I hope the writers and directors can maintain the excitement in the upcoming episodes. Thus far, it's a surprisingly and well deserved 8/10 from me"
24,"It's a great watch, not too heavy which is just the ticket sometimes. The cast work great together and it helps the story flow.
For the body found next to you in a bed in a hotel room genre (It must be a genre dammit, if not then I just coined it) it plays the style pretty well with how the revelations keep a coming.
Only three in and I was feeling like I could binge a few more but hey, patience is the word and I'll have to wait for a week.
I wasn't really a Big Bang watcher so I only knew of the main protagonist fleetingly but she looks great and plays the role exceptionally well."
25,"I got through the first episode only because kaley was the actress but the story is pretty meh to be honest i don't really understand some of these good reviews, watching cheese melt can be more entertaining. Back to the big bang i go!"
26,"It's labeled a comedy, but the jokes just don't land. It can be a thriller at times, but nothing to keep me at the edge of my seat. The drunk blonde who sleeps around it's just lazily written and adds no excitement to the characters personality.The worst of all is the supporting cast. Their performances are awful. I'm surprised it's rated so high. It's not worth your time. Swing and miss by HBO's woke executives."
27,"It's messy, a little silly. But isn't is so much fun watching this mess?
It's something different and good."
28,"Good show where Kaley Cucuo has a role that fits her perfectly. Several genres altogether match finely. I'm having a good time. There's life after""The Big Bang Theory""!!!"
29,"The premise was fun and started well as a wanton romp through the world of globetrotting airline crew. The blaring music at every second step was merely distracting at first, but soon became grating. Clearly a work of American shtick. Couldn't stand it by episode 2 as the story went into absurdia. Fine for people who only watch loud run of the mill shows, as the high current rating shows. Others can pass."
30,"The director couldn't decide whether to make it a comedy or a serious thriller, so he. decided to mix them. The result is viewers' mental confusion."
31,I can't with some of the GARBAGE comments on here trashing a perfectly good show. The lead actress never really impressed me on that awful Big Bang show but she's pretty good in this. I binged watched all 3 episodes and wasn't bored at all...a rarity!
32,"This is way too drawn out for a plot that should only take a couple of hours or so. There are also issues with tone. Is it a comedy? A drama? A murder mystery? It swings wildly back and forth and all the parts don't mesh well.The biggest problem is with Ms. Cuoco's character. She's an alcoholic, completely unreliable and yet somehow everybody in her life calls her their best friend. Too much of the comedy relies on her drinking and getting into situations. A little of that goes too far these days, and this is just unwatchable. You would guess at some point her alcoholism would reach a crisis (her brother hints at that) but then that would completely derail the comedy. Ms. Cuoco does the best she can with this character, but nobody could redeem her.The rest of the cast does well enough with the thin material, but as I said this should all be wrapped up in in 2 hours and not 8."
33,"It has a lot of mystery going on , but there is humor and comedy too . So this is for all that love mysteries and thrillers but sometimes they don't like the series that is too dark so comedy is missing there."
34,"Kaley Cuoco does an amazing job of bringing Cassie to life from the novel , she did so awesome in this role!"
35,"As someone who has read the book, it's a nice adaptation.... and even without comparing it to the novella its still a great mystery show...."
36,"So I kinda like it and cant't stop watching. It is intriguing but I wonder how long. Will it be like the series Pretty little liars which carried the same plot for 7 seasons or it'll run out the ideas till the end of the first season. Although pretty little liars got pretty boring after few seasons. I can't help to wonder, if it's that interesting in the beginning, will it survive? PS, they should change the genre from comedy to thriller because there isn't anything to laugh about."
37,"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about what I was getting into. I didn't see any trailers or read the plot or nothing! I was shocked and surprised by everything that happened within the first 3 episodes. The plot is pleasantly intriguing and always has me on the edge of my seat. Kuoco may be known as Penny, but I literally have to remind myself that it's the same actress. She is fantastic as the role of Cassie and she has a great supporting cast as well. Although Michelle Gomez's character has been in very few scenes, her character is still a huge part of the show and she is as intimidatingly intense as ever! She was born to play those roles. Honestly there is almost nothing bad I can really say about the show. It is really good at covering such topics and problems such as alcoholism, mental illness and trauma. I just want to read the book at this point. This show won't be for everyone, but if you like a good mystery that twists your brain around, then you'll probably at least enjoy the show. Highly recommend."
38,"The production values are clearly American schtick, which I suppose is fun for some. The music here blares every second to tell us how to feel. The acting borders on overbaked but fortunately stops just short. It's the story that makes this work. Brilliant escapism."
39,"This show isn't a 10, but I wanted to rate it that because of the low reviews. Yeah, it's not perfect, but it's fun, dark, twisty, entertaining, mysterious, and scandalous. It's not boring at all. Most of the time, I have a hard time putting my phone down during shows, but I was hooked to this one. Give it a try! Don't listen to the bad ratings!"
40,"The trailers looked good at first but then most trailers do, It didn't capture my full attention. After watching the first episode, I gotta say, It was absolutely great. The direction and the writing were phenomenal. And I didn''t expect much from Kaley Cuoco but I have to say, she was great in it. So were the rest of the cast. It's the kind of show we need right now especially given the situation. But so far, I'm loving this show.
But the show isn't for everyone, It's still a great show to binge though.
It's great for thanksgiving. It's like HBO's Night of but with a lighter tone. Oh and you'll probably see a lot of hate on the show from people who hate her."
41,"The first three episode is promissing. And yes, seeing Kelly Cuoco running around for murder is extremely fun. And yes, she carried this show nicely. I have 0 expectation to this miniseries and yes, I enjoy it a lot."
42,"I watch alot of film and tv which means nothing to you reading this other than apparently I'm a guy who watches alot of film and tv .... but I gotta say this series
( if this series stays focused and on course ) nails it and nails it well , hands down.....
.. , exceptional filming , acting , storyline , everything good . Pretty refreshing . It was more like watching a film than a series . Great stuff ."
43,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery, No, Drama, Mystery? Maybe, Comedy? Definitely not.
Maybe it was a typo & was meant to read as ""s h I t e"".
Rarely seen so many awkward actors trying to act, the only ""comical"" moment came after the 1st episode finished with a preview of a future episode, a scene with a flying shoe.
Hopefully now the awkward unfunny snoozefest pilot episode is over there might actually be some comedy within the coming episodes, as a pilot episode is meant to grab the viewer so they continue to watch further episodes this failed on all levels, the only reason I'm interested in watching the next episode is for the ""flying shoe"" & hoping there's a few more scenes with at least that level of comedy.
Kaley Cuoco has shown with Big Bang she's a good actor & it's nice to see she's playing something other than the dumb blonde bimbo, an intelligent dumb blonde slapper, oh well, it's progress, possibly.
Hopefully this will do well if they get the comedy right, it's got some interesting quirky aspects to it, the awkwardly shoehorned flashbacks of what seems to be child molestation may be ""character developement"" but seems unnecessary given there's already a murder mystery to unravel.
As this is billed as a comedy god forbid they should take it the route of the farsical ""spy"".
As ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" so to does too many writers scew up a story."
44,"... but it's PC enough, includes a homo couple (no bearing to the plot) and some racial discussion (also no bearing to the plot)...I wonder how the feminists are not complaining yet..."
45,"This show is very cool and different. Love the actors! No clue why some low reviews
Sad. The show is fun"
46,"I never watched Big Bang theory, so I haven't watched a lot of Kaley Cuoco's work. I know a few things about her though. She's gorgeous, funny and super talented. This character shows complete depth. Outside she's a care free party girl. Inside she's a wreck. And clearly she has multiple demons from her past. Mixing all that with what happens in the pilot makes for a unique character.I've enjoyed how fast paced the story is. It's not overly complicated, and the supporting cast all nail their roles. I didn't think I'd enjoy it this much but I was excited for the new episodes to arrive tonight. I'm excited to see where it all leads.As for some of the no talent losers on here that get on a site just to troll: I feel bad for you. Covid has us all down, but seriously get a life. Find a hobby. Getting on here and calling her ugly ? GTFO with that nonsense. I actually saw a post where someone criticized the fact that she drinks too much. Wow, good call Sherlock. Do you think maybe she has an alcohol problem because of her past? Or maybe because her father was a drunk? No... thinking is too hard for d-bags like you. I wish I could reply directly to these people but with all the stupid I see on this site, I'd be replying all day.Okay rant over. Please give the show a chance. It's a blast.8/10"
47,"I wanted to see what Kaley Cuoco would do after a long running show and this is really different from TBBT. The style is sort of slick 1950's murder mysteries, but the acting is up to date. I'm on the 5th episode and the storyline has expanded the subplots as well as Kaley's Cassie storyline as well as backstory. It's fine/pleasant enough to watch, wouldn't consider it binge-worthy but I am still watching it and looking forward to seeing how the series ends"
48,"It has an amazing plot, my son and I are hooked. So funny, dark, interesting and spontaneous. Anyone who would write a bad review has to be a very boring, dry human being. Keep up the good work girl! This is a fantastic show!"
49,"Only saw the first 3 episodes (all currently released on HBO Max), and this is definitely how good TV is done. I don't particularly like TV series (I'm more of a movie guy), and this is still very watchable (it's movie-quality TV, IMO).The only part I thought was overly fake was when the lawyer's boyfriend hacks into the company to get information for her (HBO needs to learn to get hacking in movies and TV right -- they always seem to think it's so easy. You can't just hack into whatever you want, whenever you want. They should've have him contact a guy who deals in hacked/leaked information dumps, or something more realistic).Other than that, it seems like it's going to be a great series, though. They did a good job on this one. I hope they keep making stuff that's as high quality as this is.If people rate this show low, I will be angry (just like with Avenue 5, my favorite show, which I feel it's low rating is is due to internet bots and not actual reviews, but I obviously can't prove this)."
50,"Because it failed in both departments, this show is ridiculous. Stopped watching at episode 3."
51,The main character is a train-wreck. She goes from one bad decision to another. This show would be renewed if she weren't so designed as dumb blonde. I can't empathize with her so it's hard to really enjoy this show.
52,"It's a good series to binge , and the actress is soooo hot , loved the story line"
53,"I'm glad something good came out of 2020
A must watch"
54,Wish I could give this more than 10 stars. Kaley is awesome. Also love Rosie Some things I wasn't expecting but that's what makes it so good. Way to go to the writers and actors
55,"There's of lot of noise and talking but nothing is happening. I turned it off mid episode 2 so I gave it two stars. Maybe it gets better, but don't care."
56,Nice try but this too ambitious and lacks any real rhythm! Too much drinking and less overly aggressive editing would have made a better show! Someone didn't trust the script and became nervous so became the show! Hard to watch!
57,"I should have known better considering the lead actress was in another awful tv show. Her character is too over the top in an American way, no cleverness just in your face dreary slapstick."
58,"This is a really bad choice for an actress clearly trying to prove that she can do more than play the sexy, ditzy girl-next-door on her famous sitcom. Because this definitely is NOT a step up. The character she is playing here is such an irresponsible, brainless, drunken trollop, that she makes 'Penny' seem like a temperate genius by comparison. You have to wonder how on earth Kaley could think that this particular role would help her shake that image.The character's irrational behavior makes it impossible to empathize or identify with her, as she makes one incredibly stupid move after another - making virtually any viewer write her off, early on, as a hopeless, moronic loser.The plot/trope (someone wakes up after a drunken one-night-stand in bed next to a dead person) is as old as dirt, and this version does nothing to improve on that old chestnut. (The same basic idea was done much better in ""The Morning After"", an '80s movie starring Jane Fonda -- and THAT film was only mediocre.)Kaley has a reported net worth of $55 million, so she clearly doesn't need to work for a living. If this is the only kind of role she can find, she'd be better off retiring young and rich while she's still at the top, coming off one of the most successful shows in TV history."
59,"A terrible show! How anyone can enjoy this dribble is inexplicable. Is not funny, not interesting, not enjoyable, but pure high heel junk."
60,That's about all you need to know. The flashbacks for no reason in episode one is enough to turn me off from the whole show
61,"After watching episode 1, my first thought was, ""Ok, interesting... I wonder how she's going to get away with her dumb decision to clean up the murder scene.""Then after watching episode 2, I got a little pissed off with her making her own situation worse and worse by persistently making dumb decisions, not listening to her lawyer friend, attempting to flee, and visiting Alex's workplace. I am not pissed with the fact that she tried to find out the truth by herself. I am pissed because she is so DUMB to not do it a discreet way!By the time I watched episode 3, I got so fed-up with her clumsiness, always breaking things wherever she goes, that I simply switched the TV off. I will probably watch the last episode because I'm still curious about who the real murderer is, and how he/she killed Alex. But I'm DEFINITELY NOT going to watch the process of a dumb & clumsy flight attendant trying to find out the truth. Period."
62,"Signs you might be watching a chick flick:1. Women live a glamorous life working a poorly paying/middle class job.
2. Every man they they meet is attractive, rich and dresses like a playboy. And just perfect. I know guys like this and literally no one likes them, and if they do, that's because they don't really know them.
3. Woman is slightly rebellious, edgy and gets away with diva behavior no matter what they do.
4. Everyone around her is happy-go lucky and has no problems or gripes. Except for one person who has the weight of the world on her shoulders.I don't want to get into detail because of how this site censors reviews these days, but I think the scene where Cassie has an overnight in Thailand and walks out to meet the rich Russian guy in his Aston Martin did it for me. Just super-ridiculous. No wonder dating in the US is so bad right now. Shows like this make women believe this is what every relationship should be like. Can't pick up your date in an Aston and take her out on a speedboat, dressed in expensive designer clothes? You're a loser!The show bothers me because as a man, I just can't relate. Some attractive women do really live life like this. Well, maybe. I mean, that's great and all, but stuff like this is just unhealthy for our youth."
63,"After watching you realize that Kaley-is-Kaley and Penny was Kaley.
Even 3 episodes in I still ""see"" Penny (10yrs on BBT, duh).
That said, this Character is troubled (to say the least), there are things the character does, that in retrospect, are a little eyeroll-worthy, but if you let yourself just watch the show; these moments fit-in with the extremes we see in the caricature of a troubled-broken-lonely-human.Wife and I (40-50yrs) binged the first 3eps and would have watched 6 more if they were available.
Sadly, the IMDB reviews pointed out flaws/faults that we didn't see originally, because we were simply in-the-mood for a decent show to watch.
FYI - Not sure how this turns into a multi-season show...
It's HBO, so def a 14+ rating for language, violence/gore, adult situations.
(nothing that bothered either of us)
She's a Sex-In-The-City fan, I'm a Office/Seinfeld fan yet we both enjoyed this for a bunch of reasons.
NO COVID hysteria so that is a PLUS; out of the gate.
NO forced-Social-commentary (at least not yet); another PLUS.
And NO reasonable Flight-attendant would be offended by the portrayal. :)"
64,"Where can I even start, it's boring, visionless snd simply unimaginative. She's drinks a lot, sometimes she project a scared innocent woman that just keep puck-nosing into something that thosenr concern her and for god sake she met him once for sex and d whole series is based on this , are they even in love"
65,"I had high hopes , but darn it anyway. The drinking is way over done and her main line is ""I'm sorry."" Lots of flash backs to fill in. Starting to get stupid."
66,"This show was recommended to me by a friend who loved The Big Bang Theory. I have never seen a single episode of that show so didn't have a reference point for Kaley Cuoco. But after finishing up another series and needing something to watch, I decided to check it out.I got about 30 minutes into the 1st episode before I couldn't take it any more.It's awful. The lead is not a good actress and it's impossible to have any empathy or sympathy for her character. She's not likable at all. The writing is cheesy and trite. The dumb blonde cliche is overplayed and lazy.Don't waste your time unless these kinds of things (laziness, bad writing, bad acting) appeal to you. I have no idea how this show is getting good reviews."
67,"It could have been interesting. It could have been sexy, intriguing, appealing, funny, or even interesting. They chose with bad acting and uninteresting instead.Imagine if the entire difference between kelly Cuoco being a mediocre actress on the big bang theory and her in this show is that she swears.That's it. That's the big spoiler. Because after the single plot line is exposed in the first 10 minutes, you're left with a bad acting job and absolutely no actual plot or anything to keep you interested.Save your effort. I get why they released this. I bet it was shot and shelved but with a lack of content because nobody is shooting anything new, the network got desperate and just put this out.It's just boring and bad."
68,"Just watched the first three episodes, and so far it seems like Cassie is not exactly the image the Flight Attendant union would prefer. She drinks all the time, has sex with anything in pants, and is completely irresponsible. While the scene with her brother may be working towards addressing her ""issues"" so far it looks like the show is just accepting her actions as OK.Oh, and since my wife is blonde--and has to put up with blonde jokes--I kinda think that should be mentioned too.Well, maybe episode #4 will turn the corner. Fingers crossed!"
69,"Dashing around frantically, making ""jokes"" at rapid fire speed, slamming back drinks at a rate that would kill a person.....just silly and too chaotic. I give up."
70,"I absolutely love this show. I cannot believe are giving it such poor reviews. I hate that i have to watch it on my computer, instead of actually on HBO on my TV but it is so worth it. Flew through the first 3 episodes, cannot wait for the next episode."
71,"Ok. How to start this...
the protagonist is pictured as the dumbest stupidest alienated character ever (character, not even a person as it's impossible for an average human being to be so stupid). It's so unreal that should be rated as a sci-fi.
There are some good things but they are so tiny that it's impossible to give them a big appraisal - the what she manages to have a conversation with herself mirroring the dead guy is funny and different but hollow as it lacks depth. If we forget how people work and erase from a couple of minutes all the bad and unreal decisions , we can have a laugh .
I do hope it gets better as the scores are being their best with so little . The lead character is funny and well projected as the dumbest person ever , and it helps . But it's not enough . See it if you don't want to think much and just want to see someone in constant panic with a funny face ."
72,"Taught, well done mystery/thriller. There has yet to be any comedy (in the first 3 episodes aired thus far), but hoping there will be some coming up soon."
73,"The lead character seems like a sex-crazed over-drinking party girl. Most people probably won't empathize with her character, or really care what happens to her. Then they mixed in a bunch of creepy full-screen flash-backs to a dead man covered in blood in a bed. All together, you'll probably stop watching the show too."
74,"The show is quite enjoyable and the acting is decent, but there are a few cons.
Kaley Cuoco is exactly the same character that she was on Big Bang Theory, but why? Let's see, she is playing a low skilled party girl which has drinking troubles and messy relationships, this is exactly what Penny was... If the show producers bothered that much, they could make her a serious high ranking office manager with black hair and glasses, which hangs out in a bar nearby after work,but they didn't, they wanted her character to be this light messy blond with unsorted life ...
So all in all, the best way to watch it as a sequel of Big Bang Theory where Penny gets into trouble... Another thing to mention - annoying flashbacks, it's way too many of them and they get in the way of the main story too often... Other than that ""Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state"" :D"
75,A few episodes in I'll finish it at some point probably but trying to mix comedy into a murder mystery is hard to pull off and they don't come close here. I always enjoyed Cuoco but this was a miss for her here.
76,I really couldnt think of a good thing to say about this show. you have a lead who has skated by on good looks and now those looks are fading you get to see just how talentless she is. wooden acting all round. definitely room for improvement but if it dosnt the its a one season pony and its gone.
77,"Although it was a little better if you turned off the sound and just had it on the TV as background video. Why would a supposedly employed lawyer have a psycho drunk as a ""best friend""? Are there people in the real world who are this messed up?"
78,"Kaley plays Cassandra who is a complete mess! Drinking since childhood and take all the wrong choices:-). But it also shows a person who is lost and can't get out of her situation. Needs advanced help I imagine and frustrated of her drinking an logic! Fantastic acting :-)
The first 3 episodes did go all to fast, can't wait for the coming ones!!"
79,"Started out good and I get it supposed
To be a comedy. But most of the incidents are just stupid and would never happen. When something is funny the reason is you can picture it happening. Hope it gets better"
80,"Let's start with the over baked music. It's entirely to loud and to much of it.
I know we are in a pandemic and starved for new content, but seriously have we not seen this formula before??
I didn't make it passed the half way point of the first episode. I know how how this ends...."
81,"Although there are some good things in the first five episodes the entire premise and several occurrences are weak, as is the writing, in my opinion.First, why would someone kill the only person who appears to know or at least is the only person to have access to the $200 million dollars we just found out appears to be what the villains are after? Brilliant! Kill the only guy with the combination to the safe, so to speak. You would think capture and torture might be a better option.Second, it is simply unbelievable that if they wanted Cuocco's character captured or dead that they wouldn't have taken care of her while she was passed out in the hotel room after they killed Huisman's character. Instead the bad guys resemble the Keystone cops. It is not even remotely realistic that career criminals and probably professional killers would be unable to off someone who appears to be an uneducated alcoholic and certainly not a career criminal or trained mercenary.In the fifth episode Max and Cuocco's characters, ahead of the police or the bad guys, were the only people who thought of visiting Huisman's apartment to search it or seize the computer that was on and sitting in plain sight. They also of course unconvincingly figured out the address of where the tech equipment was. Max figured out in a short period of time how much money was missing but not where it was. But wait. Judging by the appearance of the bad guys they also must know the location of the tech equipment. The set up certainly looks sophisticated and expensive and no doubt the information it contains could send a lot of people to jail, especially since Max was able to ascertain that $200 million went missing in a matter of minutes. I expect that a forensic electronics police expert with access to law enforcement around the world and the power to obtain banking information if there has been a crime would be able to figure out a lot more, including where the money went, in a day if not a few hours.Stay with me. So instead of the bad guys protecting this very expensive equipment and the secrets it contained it was left unguarded, presumably with the hope that no one would figure out its location from a return address on a letter or otherwise stumble upon it. Perhaps because they are out some $200 million they were unable to afford a live armed henchman or two to physically protect the location. Not only that but whatever alarm system used was comical and inept. You would think that someone with a ton of money at stake and secrets to protect , even if they inexplicably chose not to move or physically protect the equipment, would at least have an alarm that worked immediately as opposed to just after Max finished tooling around and finding out about the money and the various identities of those already killed or to be killed. I've never heard of a delayed notification alarm. To remain consistent with the Three Stooges theme of this episode the alarm of course was not silent. Where was the movie computer voice a la Blofeld telling them to get out? Two minutes and counting to self destruct! They also could have had flags pop out of the equipment telling them to ""leave now"". I half expected Adam West to show up in the batmobile before the bad guys did.Finally, another blown opportunity to kill Cuocco's character and perhaps Max if it turns out he still lives. While I am sure being hit by the car was painful it didn't appear to be going at highway speed and there should be a high probability he survives. There would appear to be no logical reason why the bad guy henchmen didn't just drive up to both of them and put a bullet in their heads, particularly after the previously bungled attempt on the train. Maybe next time they will capture who they want to kill and either strap them to a table subjected to a slow laser or tie them to a pole and lower them slowly into a shark infested pool, of course leaving them alone with plenty of time to escape.There is some entertainment value to the series and I generally love HBO, but there is going to have to be some all world explanations in the last three episodes to make sense of a plot that is impossible to take seriously."
82,"Really glad the cast can find so many hot actors and some really good full human back scene, really turned me on. The Italian bar tender, so hot!"
83,"The background noise through the whole show is very annoying making it hard to listen to, maybe it needs a laugh track instead so I know what is funny and when to laugh."
84,Love this show. Its full of drama mystery and suspense but still keeps things light hearted
85,"The rating is very strange on this one. It definitely and most objectively doesn't deserve more than a 5/10. It really doesn't. And that's too much. Kaley Cuoco is so bad, (her and the script included) you often aren't able to tell if she's deliberately making a mockery out of her own vapid character. The show doesn't even have elements of comedy....and it most certainly doesn't deserve to be called a mystery either. There's a difference between comedy and awful pieces of the story's puzzle that just remain floating somewhere in genre limbo. Rosie Perez and Michelle Gomez REALLY tried to salvage this trainwreck most of the time, but the writing is so faulty, it's probably beyond said salvage. Most of the instances are so shallow and highly unrealistic making it hard to watch if I'm perfectly honest. It should be a fun, light-hearted show, but it's hard to watch, believe it or not. Kaley Cuoco makes such a spectacle of herself in a roundabout way, exaggerating her character's obsessive behaviour, that the experience becomes awkward, hard to watch and just extremely cringeworthy. There is a lot of awful cringe, and that's just in the few episodes I've seen. The amount of cringe is outstanding. The characters are so poorly written, stereotypical and void. I know many people argued, can Kaley Cuoco step away from ""Penny's"" role and in my opinion yes and no. Yes in very, very few instances, and then no for the remaining 85% of the time. It feels like a shallow way of telling a sad story with the main character descending into addiction and madness. Basically a story about a divorced Penny, finally revealing her true colours and as if she had suffered a mental breakdown, subsequently escaping into alcoholism and just an awful display of promiscuity. It is one of the worst shows of 2020."
86,"The worst show ever. Or at least one of them. I mean constant drinking with that frequency and she's still able to walk and talk (somewhat)? Srsly? And nothing but drunking and dumb thinking? Predictible events and characters everywhere? Unimaginably never could happen situations just because.... ummm... sexy blonde ""drunk"" FA? Shut up. Halfway in the first episode I felt we're in trouble. Laughed in pain at the second one, watched the third just to be sure this is where I end the suffering. No more for me, thank you!"
87,Hope Kaley Cuoco picks a better show next time. Playing a drunk nymphomaniac murderer that attempts to become a Nancy Drew stretches the imagination to it's limits.
88,"First episode was ok after that become boring like very boring, the intro is the only part I liked."
89,"Not sure which is more distracting, the wooden acting or the cliched writing./ dialogue. A hard pass."
90,"I really wanted to hate this but after three episodes I'm all in! Mattress-hopping vodka-sucking flight attendant meets hot guy in the sky and wakes up the next morning to find him dead in bed. So begins this whodunnit-after-she-did-him murder romp that involves and excess of expensive clothes, annoying flashbacks, split screens and implausible plot lines. If you're looking for logic then look elsewhere, but if you want a glossy distraction that falls apart under mild scrutiny then step right up.So what makes this wish-mash of problems work as a whole? The surprisingly good performance by Kaley Cuoco. She supplies just the right amount of personalty and comedy to make her character compulsively watchable. I'm not a Big Bang Theory watcher so I don't have anything to compare her acting skills to, but she hits all the right notes here as far as I'm concerned. You really do wonder where things are going and the plot so far has been wildly unpredictable.Another enjoyable element is Rosie Perez, who showed so much promise in the 90s that didn't quite pan out. She plays it soft and low key, and more than holds here own in comparison the more frantic acting style of Kaley. It's great to see her on the screen. The remaining players are just like talking extras and plot facilitators at the moment but that will no doubt change as the series progresses.For those looking for mystery and intrigue, you'll find no subtly here. There's some pretty obvious plot holes as well as the standard cliche political and social commentary, but the introduction sequence is outstanding and I'm looking forward to seeing where this flight attendant goes to next."
91,"With all the hype surrounding this I tried not to get my expectations up because I know when critics say something is great the audience usually hates it because critics just have no taste anymore. But this is really, really hard to watch and hard to like, it's just not funny when it's meant to be.Kaley Cuoco plays the same degenerate perpetually drunk empty egg carton she plays in everything else. Everything is as predictable as you'd expect. But by episode five I realised I truly care zero for ANY character they all just suck. The only thing this bad I've seen is Star Trek Discovery lately."
92,"But I hate the story. A fool stumbling around and somehow fix something, mostly due to her friends. No thx. If I wanna be irritated I just have to watch American news."
93,"I don't remember what show or movie sparked Hollywood's fixation on the comedy-thriller-action-romcom formula but...it doesn't work and this flight attendant proves it admirably.Basically Kaley Cuoco is simply cookoo in endless, never ending scenes of being annoying while apparently sexy with that guy from GoT who seems out place and actually bored with the writing, like I was after 10 minutes.This is bad but well produced by the technical artists behind the bad writing.No Hollywood-HBO Max, bubblegum and peanuts combined suck and Kaley only adds soap to the mouth. Pass on this one"
94,"I love BBT and Kaley, also I am following her on Instagram and that's how I have heard about the show. I was soo excited about the show as I adore traveling and thought this is going to be something exciting, fun, unusual, but cold ice bucket hit me. The show is so boring, stupid, shameful, those flashbacks and drinking is annoying as hell. The main character is oblivious, selfish and it is impossible to watch those scenes when she is pouring vodka down her throat from small bottles. This show actually made my opinion about Kaley lower. Can't believe she produced something so lame."
95,"Isn't it almost 2021? Aren't women being portrayed differently? Well, so far the lead is a flight attendant willing to lose her job and respect with every drink or guy that lands in front of her. There she is gettIng HAMMERED (AGAIN), in a foreign city with a guy she just met (AGAIN), while the music sings ""I'm A Woman, Yeah"". Despite being hot, her character is a complete turnoff. Drunk skanky skid. Step your life up!"
96,"It was interesting, until I kept getting stressed out on how dumb the lead character kept doing. And she won't even try and sober up. Her brother so far is the only one with sense. Also I hated how she kept doing dumb dangerous stuff while not telling other aka her lawyer/bff. She keeps doing the same mistakes, boose, men, then blackout. Women aren't exactly that stupid and it's becoming annoying. I'm quite sad, I was excited for this one. Already on ep 5 but hopefully it will get better and Cassie will get some sense in her head."
97,"Okay, i have watched all the 5- episodes of The flight attendant and i have had so much of hope with kalley (Penny)
If you have an option, choose another watch rather than giving this series your time.
Let's talk about this show, As trailer tells us penny's night out one day boy friend got murdered in thailand and she reaches NY after the murder, FBI as expected interrogate the flight crew and believe me you will also get clue that Penny actually seems suspect but due to bad writing or long writing of the writer of this series, FBI actually works like a local police station ans even lesser, they show up in every episode for LITERALLY five minutes, bangkok police showed so tough here in starting like they are demons but surprisingly, not make a proper call to FBI.
To be honest, first Episode is indeed very much nice but after that story seems weird, Murder mystery changes to some random 5-6 stories unfolds.
All the characters have some rand weird uncommon story and their story starts unfolding for no reason.
I watched for a murder mystery not some weird stories.
In my view, Very much over rated series."
98,"I know it's not fair to judge a film or a series by only the first dozens of minutes, but there is so much trash out there I've come to find it useful to cut my losses early. So I stopped watching this one after a never ending series of shots that really went nowhere. Maybe it gets better but I didn't get any enthusiasm to keep watching."
99,"It had a great opening episode but really went downhill fast, turning into a generic drama with silly plot holes and sub-plots that were plain boring. And the main character is just so damn annoying. No one wants to see some idiot running around like a chicken with their head cut off. Really poor writing."
