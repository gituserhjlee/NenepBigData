0,"Anyone who has seen as many disaster movies as I have knows that this is absolutely the best one ever made. For a film nearly thirty years old, Poseidon Adventure is still so effective that it would cause anyone planning to take a cruise to think twice. You probably know the plot--luxury liner capsized by a tidal wave. This synopsis is brought to life with suspense, drama, and sometimes, terrifying reality. One of the most effective cinematic touches is that in nearly every scene, the camera is slowly swaying back and forth to give us a sense that we really are at sea. Something ""Titanic"" completely missed. We follow the journey of ten survivors through the inverted ship to their hopeful rescue--narrowly escaping fires, explosions, and flooding corridors every step of the way. The sets are epic and nothing less than spectacular. Especially the inverted dining room when the Atlantic Ocean comes crashing in, and the engine room which is now a horrifying twisted metal inferno. The cast is good, however Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters, and Stella Stevens are best. Hackman is our handsome hero, Winters is our unselfish caring mother, and Stevens is absolutely radiant (pre-capsize) and adds a welcome touch of humor to the mess. No, the movie is not perfect, and it is of course starting to look a bit dated. However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored. Poseidon Adventure is a true classic. A must see for everyone--not just disaster movie fans."
1,"for a disaster flick,this is one of the better ones.for 1972,it is well made and has some good effects.it's pretty convincing also thought the movie was compelling and touching,and sad,all at the same time.since we get to know the characters a bit,you can't help but feel for them in their(what seems hopeless)situation.i did think there were a few stereotypical characters,which was annoying,but the acting was decent enough.plus,the fact that the survivors had to go through what amounted to a labyrinthine maze as they tried to get out,really added to the feeling of hopelessness of the situation.i was also surprised at who ultimately survived and who didn't.for a nearly 2 hour movie,this one moves along pretty good.i was engrossed throughout.for me,The Poseidon adventure is a strong 8/10"
2,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of those movies I have seen at least once a year as long as I have been alive. I lived in Maine when I was a kid and we loved our natural disaster flicks. Of all the great disaster movies from the 70s, this has got to be the best one. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Neilson, and the list goes on.The basic plot goes like this. The Poseidon is a cruise ship out for its last voyage and it is New Year's Eve. The guests are all celebrating while deep beneath the ocean's surface an earthquake is happening. The earthquake sets off a huge tsunami and the ship is knocked upside down. In order to be saved, a small group of people heads for the engine room at the bottom (make that top, since the ship is upside down) of the ship. At first, the ocean claims hundreds of the passengers until they are whittled down to about 10 people left. From here there are plenty of tense moments and a power struggle for control of the survivors. Typical disaster movie fare but done rather well.This movie is a great main event for a disaster film weekend."
3,"The Poseidon Adventure has gotten its reputation as the best of all the disaster films of the seventies, not just for the Special Effects good as they are. It's that select group of people trying to survive, they're a bunch you do get to care about even though some of them can be annoying as all get out.The film is an adaption of Paul Gallico's novel which was written in the Thirties, but it was updated to the present for the film. While on the luxury liner Poseidon as a New Year's Eve Party goes on, Captain Leslie Nielsen takes note of an undersea earthquake and the tidal wave that will hit the ship in about fifteen minutes. But he's certainly not prepared for the wall of water that smacks the Poseidon broadside and capsizes it.Before the big event and the special effects that got The Poseidon Adventure its Oscar in that department we are introduced to the group of people who elect to try and climb up to the keel of the capsized Poseidon while the rest remain in the grand ballroom. Leading the group is minister Gene Hackman and the rest are married couples, Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens, musician/singer Carol Lynley, hypochondriac Red Buttons, steward Roddy McDowell, and teenager Pamela Sue Martin and her little brother Eric Shea.You do get wrapped up and sucked into the conflicts especially with Ernest Borgnine who's simultaneously got a war going with Gene Hackman and with his wife Stella Stevens. She's an ex-hooker who he busted several times and eventually married. He's got a rambunctious nature and Borgnine provides a lot of the interest here.Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters are the typical elderly Jewish couple who are on a trip to Israel to visit the grandchild they've never seen. They're a calming and steadying influence on the others. So is Red Buttons who finds courage he never thought he possessed and he helps Lynley out who's devastated at the loss of her brother who was in the band performing at the New Year's Eve Party.Gene Hackman as a minister takes his gospel from that noted skeptic Benjamin Franklin who said that God helps those who help themselves. For those who believe in a divine plan, he seems divinely sent to get these people to safety. Not all of them make it though.The Poseidon Adventure got another Oscar for Best Song for The Morning After. Maureen McGovern's recording of that tune was playing everywhere in 1972. It's one of the few Academy Award winning songs that is still prized and remembered over the last 40 years.Maybe Irwin Allen did a wise thing by not directing the film and letting Ronald Neame do it. Spectacle is great and I love it, but a good story with characters you care about is what makes the Poseidon Adventure the fine film it is."
4,"The aging liner Poseidon, on her final journey, is struck by a tidal wave that knocks her upside down. A small group of passengers realise that if they want to survive they must journey up into the bowels of the ship hoping for rescue from above.The idea is well conceived and the excellent cast turn in good performances despite getting little help from the somewhat corny script. With above average special effects for the time and excellent sets that convincingly realise the upside down half-flooded ship and its bewildering maze of passageways, the movie manages to be compelling and exciting viewing."
5,"The clothes and the likes are really the only thing that date this film. 35 years old, and it still holds up well. No CGI featured, and none required. I have not read the book of this film, so I cannot say if it is an accurate adaptation, in the spirit of the original. I will say that it is a well-produced piece of fiction. The plot is quite good. The writing is good, and has very realistic, great moments. Dialog is well-done, and delivered equally well. The characters are credible and well-written. There is a reasonable amount of development and background for them. The special effects are undeniably excellently done. They are convincing throughout. Nature itself becomes the threat, with realistic physics. The camera-work and editing are nicely done, save for an awkward cut or two. Cinematography is effective. The pacing is solid for the whole film. As far as the technical aspect goes, the film is great. The acting is of high quality. The kid isn't the most annoying ever seen. The tension is admirable. I haven't watched particularly many disaster films... in fact, this film may be 50% of the total amount... so I can't say if this is an outstanding one. I'm not sure you can really watch this without noticing the theme of passivity versus activity... or, blind faith versus a more critical, independent faith. The film takes a definite stance on that. All in all, entertaining and worth your time. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or the genre. 7/10"
6,"If you have three and a half hours to kill, do NOT watch Titanic.  Take the three and a half hours and watch the Poseidon Adventure twice. Okay, it's campy and it's the consummate 70s disaster flick, complete with ensemble cast.But when you put them up against each other, Poseidon Adventure is just leagues better than Titanic.  Titanic is over three hours, and centers around two characters.  In that time, the two characters are hardly developed at all, they're terribly one dimensional and probably could be summed up in about a sentence each.Compare this to Poseidon Adventure.  Stars off with a dozen main characters, and in half as much time, they all have their own personalities, quirks, and are real identifiable people.  And far from the Titanic tendency of stamping ""I'm gonna die"" on people's foreheads, in the Poseidon Adventure you don't know initially who's going to die- or at least not how or when anyway.The Poseidon Adventure is just a more interesting movie.  It may not be as glossy or as pretty, but it's got it where it counts... it's just a better film."
7,"I still don't understand how people get on here and write reviews about movies, with statements like wasted actors talent, campy, don't you understand this movie was made in 1972 there was no CGI and copying movie like it's done today, this was an original and won awards and was up for many more nominations, these actors weren't wasted they were continuing to develop their craft. I saw this as a 6yr old and still remember it today on New Years Eve as I just watched it this morning bringing back so many memories that made me the movie buff I am. I never forgot it from the wonderful soundtrack (Oscar winning ) and the cinematography (Oscar winning) which was earned the old fashioned way imagination, not by some computer generated initiative. I love movies today but I still remember good movies and how they were made in yesteryear also. It's kinda like comparing atheletes when people(younger people especially) when they say Lebron is better than Oscar R or Michael J, the players are all great in their time, if either Michael or Oscar were here today they would still be GREAT, as Lebron is today, but to say he is better is foolish, This a Great Movie today as it was in 1973. PERIOD!!"
8,"I would have normally given this disaster classic only eight stars. But after re-watching it (after seeing Petersen's 2006 film POSEIDON), it looks even better than I remembered! Although TPA may seem somewhat dated and cheesy today, the campy script is really a hoot! Many classic lines found here! Thank God for Stella Stevens' character...The actors are great, the camera-work and timing are great, and even the special effects are fairly impressive (particularly for the film's age). Actually, the capsizing scenes are far superior to the latest version's in many ways.If you have plenty of time on your hands, you can always watch both films and compare for yourself. If not, I would stick to the original. It may lack the massive budget and glossy CGI special effects, but it sure is more fun!"
9,"This movie is my ultimate disaster flick and even though I really liked Titanic. This one, as others have said IS better and I'll tell you why. In Titanic we have just one story going, where as in this one we have several. The subtle budding romance between Nonnie and Mr. Martin was very interesting to watch. I thought they were a rather odd pairing at first, but it worked seeing how they both needed each other. Linda Rogo was my favorite character. She knew what to say and how to say it. She even told her pompus husband off a few times. The fact that she's an ex-prostitute and her husband being the cop that arrested her made their story rather interesting. Mr. Rogo and the Preacher's quarrels were amusing and heated. I liked the Rosens, they were the strong ones and you could truly see the love they had for one another. The kid was annoying, but useful and I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Susan and the Preacher. Their scenes were my favorite. This movie has a cast of truly rich characters that were more entertaining to watch than the actual effects. Ah! The good old days where character development and an actual plot outweigh the special effects and the disaster itself. 9 out of 10."
10,"SpoilersThis is still one of the best films ever made, and other than the clothes hasn't dated.It's got everything in it, suspense, action, drama, sadness & even fits in some laughs where appropriate. I was never around to see Borgnine & Hackman in their prime but I've never seen them better, Shirley Winters is great too.The good thing about this film is the thought that went into it. The right characters die & at the right times. There's none of the typical Hollywood ""Lets have all the big stars escape ok"" here. McDowell dies early, Hackman perishes too.People call it a cliched film. It is in parts but the cliche's have mainly come about since it was made.This is still the best disaster film ever. Even better than Towering Inferno, which takes some doing. 'Disaster' is probably the genre of film, which which has most deteriorated in quality over the years as this shows.This is everything Titanic should have been.A monumental film. 10/10"
11,"I have seen many disaster films in my day but The Poseidon Adventure is truly a film that will leave you on the edge of your seat because each moment after the being hit by a tidal wave is unpredictable. The survivors have to find a way out of the ship and a preacher (Gene Hackman) has to lead them out that becomes dangerous and often scary situations they face. Each cast member played their parts with emotion that becomes dramatic at times. All in all I thought this was better then the Titanic. I know they did a remake of this film in 2005 but as I always say, stick with the classic."
12,"Although after Airport The Poseidon Adventure truly is the film that started the craze... The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Airport 75 etc. all owe their getting made to this film...while Airport may have started the genre PS perfects it. Top of the line special effects, decent acting, and an edge of your seat story makes this the king of all disaster films. It's so good that no matter what I'm doing if I flip channels and hot this I stop and watch it."
13,"'The Poseidon Adventure' is a supremely entertaining flick from the days when blockbusters were amongst the best movies out there. Rather than the worst. Sure, it's corny and it's histrionics can seem overly familiar, but it still packs a punch. This is due to the fact that it's played completely straight. Well, relatively straight in the case of the Borgnine/ Stevens double-act. And it achieves real dramatic resonance from it's allegorical plot line. It pretty much created the template for the 'disaster' film.Favourite bits:Red Buttons' funky little walk up on deck.The way Pamela Sue Martin and her date boogie down when they hit the dance floor.Pamela Sue Martin's legs. Ditto Carol Lynley.Lynley's hippy brother.Roddy McDowall's accent and dialogue (consisting mostly of ""yes, sir"" and ""I think so, sir"").Ernest Borgnine learning that kids can be useful as well as merely irritating.Hackman's ""Please, God - not THIS woman"" schtick and death scene.All of Stella Stevens' wardrobe."
14,"It is hard to believe this movie was made over 30 years ago.  Don't let the fact that it was made in 1972 influence your decision to see it.  It is as exciting today as it was then.  I never miss a chance to see it, as I pick up new details each time.  The scene when the cruise ship turns over is especially awesome.  The actors are well cast.  There is just a sprinkling of comedy to take the edge off the drama.  Gene Hackman plays his part well. I have never been disappointed by this actor.  The main characters compliment each other well.  They are all familiar faces, but they become the people they are playing.  Hollywood has not remade this movie because they can't improve on it."
15,"Despite some questions about the plausability of the physics behind the disaster, I greatly enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the fine ensemble cast headed by the great Gene Hackman. I actually bought into the illusion that this diverse group of people was living this unreal harrowing experience. I remember my theater instructor said this film makes a statement about which people deserve to survive and thereby reproduce. Without being politically incorrect here, he said to analyze the different criteria we use to classify people and see which of these criteria can be applied to the survivors. Even without any social analysis, this is a fine disaster film, 8/10."
16,"The 1970's is the decade that gave birth to the disaster movie genre. In my review of 1970's Airport, I pointed out how that movie gave birth to disaster movies of that decade which in turn spawned disaster blockbusters of today's age. These kind of movies are meant to be dumb, silly fun and the makers of these kind of movies embrace what these movies are meant to do: to entertain. You won't be getting any thespian acting or a serious melodrama. Instead you'll get an onslaught of special effects and a thin story usually about trying to survive and that is quite okay by me. Another early example of a rather entertaining disaster film is 1972's The Poseidon Adventure. I enjoyed the film for what it was. It has a big cast of former Oscar winners and big-name movie stars, and they all seemed to have a grand ol' time. Sure, the dialogue is cheesy sometimes but the action is what we are here to see. And in that regard, the movie clearly succeeds.The plot remains simple and for good measure. The basic setup for the story is that a disaster strikes and the survivors must reach for safety. In this case, there is this passenger ship called the S.S Poseidon (loosely modeled after The Queen Mary) going on its last cruise before it reaches retirement. Out of nowhere, a large tidal wave hits the ship and turns the boat upside down. Now with everything in reverse, the survivors of the ship led by minister Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) must climb to the now-uprooted bottom of the boat if they have any chance of escaping. See, this is a simple story but its a fun story regardless.Ah, let's talk about our characters. This movie is based off the best-selling novel written by Paul Gallico, and rumor has it that the characters are unlikable in the novel. Some of the characters are unlikeable in the film, but screenwriters Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes and seasoned British director Ronald Neame did a solid job in tweaking some characters as to make them more sympathetic. Now, all the characters do what you expect them to do in this type of movie, so expect no surprises. The character development was rather surprisingly strong for some characters. As for the acting, no one gives a career-defining performance but everyone does a solid job. Gene Hackman as Reverend Scott and Ernest Borgnine as Rogo are arguably the two leads. They had a fun time, but they may have overacted especially in Borgnine's case. Those facial expressions and the way he delivered the lines were cheesy, but fun. Check out the rest of this cast: Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelley Winters (who delivers a fantastic performance), Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, Leslie Nielsen, etc. That is one heck of a cast.We don't see these movies for the performances, but rather for the special effects. It was amazing what this film was able to do with practical effects. The big tsunami wave that overturned a boat looked mightily impressive for a 1972 movie, but in reality it was just a large wave filmed in slow-motion off the coast of California. The production design was immense and the I love the way we see the capsized boat. Keep in mind the film was release before computers played a role in effects, which makes this movie even more impressive. If there is one thing I absolutely love, it's the way how the movie looked and sounded and how the visual effects were implemented in the movie.Another thing I liked very much is the score and the music. This film was composed by the young maestro, John Williams. Williams would eventually become a film legend with all the famous films he would score, but this is the movie that got him his big break. Some people go as far to call this his best score ever. I wouldn't go that far, but it's high on my list. The overall tone of the score is dark, but the theme is rather light and there is something about it that makes it special.When originally released, The Poseidon Adventure received good reviews with lots of praise going for the visual effects-and rightfully so. Of course this film is a blockbuster and not meant for any award recognition, but somehow it received nine Oscar nominations mostly on the technical side though. Although Shelley Winters received an nomination for best supporting actress. The film was very fun, and very entertaining. The story is nothing special, but if you're looking for a movie with great visual effects, campy acting, and a story about surviving then this film is for you.My Grade: A-"
17,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and have watched it numerous times since then. There is no comparison to the two remakes that came out---both pieces of crap. The original has it all---an all-star cast that shines, great effects, and most of all a story that grabs you from the very beginning. I find it interesting that so many people blast it for the ""hammy"" acting. Sorry, people, but these characters are REAL---I know people like the Rosens, the Rogos, the preacher, all of them! I found the portrayals dead-on, and very realistic for the situations that confronted them. They developed these personas in such a short period of time to make you care about them, that's where half of the tension comes from in this film. The special effects still hold up remarkably well for todays CGI-induced public---the capsizing scene still gives me the shivers. Of course, most of this movie is lost in its cropped format---it has to be seen in all of its widescreen splendor. Airport and this film are to me the granddaddy of all disaster films---they incorporate the best that soap-operas have to offer, along with top-notch casts and special effects. Pop a big bowl of popcorn, and enjoy!"
18,"I was a little boy when I first watched it. But Gene Hackman's character is still sticking in my mind. I purchased the DVD several days ago and I watched it today. Wow! It is so intense and rich. Given the fact that it did not have any digital techniques, the special effects deserve even more credit. The waters are real, according to the DVD's bonus features (I own the special edition).I got emotional and tearful towards the end. The characters' development flourishes the entire movie. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" wins my heart not because of its visual effects, but because of its acting and character developments. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine excel in their roles, particularly with their disputes and quarrels. I also like Shelley Winters playing Mrs. Rosen. She does a fabulous job in the swimming scene.Disaster movies are usually not my taste because most of them simply feed the audience with special effects. However, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an exception. This is truly a grandmaster classic in this genre. I do not regret buying the special edition, making it one of my film collections."
19,"Reverand Scott cracks me up because He's so concerned abut all the women not climbing in their long dresses. ""You can't climb in that, it'll have to come off""-except, conveniently, Mrs. Rosen. Hmmmm....I die for Pamela Sue Martin's outfit and how she just sort of shrugs and steps out of that dress revealing those red hot pants. That is so good! Love Stella Steven's sick scene! I LOVE R. Scott's sermon. ""God likes tryers!"" Love love love Carol doing her Maureen McGovern drag.Also, R. Scott overlooks Linda's giant silver spiked heels! Not exactly recommended ""climbing out of the innards of a capsized ship footwear""-especially those catwalks!Woopsie! Having said all that, ""TPA"" is my all time favorite! It works on every level for me and I don't care what anyone else thinks! Unless, of course, you love it like me than by all means share away! I get goose pimples every time Leslie Neilson looks through those binoculars and says ""Oh my God"" -die for that. Oh yes.All The Best, Guy"
20,"The 1970's were the heyday of disaster films and this was one of the better ones. An overacting all-star cast graced the screen in all of them. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the very first big-budget moneymaker that spawned a whole slew of knock-offs involving tidal waves, fires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and volcanoes. It is also arguably the best. Producer Irwin Allen was the mastermind behind most of them, known for spending millions of dollars on special effects and his big-name stars.A simple plot: a tidal wave knocks a ship upside down and a handful of survivors have to climb to the bottom of the ship at the surface before the ship sinks. They are led by a fanatical preacher (Gene Hackman) who conflicts with an ex-cop (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-hooker wife (Stella Stevens). Jack Albertson (WILLY WONKA) and Shelley Winters are an elderly Jewish couple who are on their way to see their new grandchild. Pamela Sue Martin (TV's Nancy Drew) and Eric Shea (like Bobby Brady, but more annoying) are brother and sister on their way to meet their parents. Roddy McDowall (a fantastic actor) is wasted as a ship hand who dies rather quick. Red Buttons (PETE'S DRAGON) is an elderly gentleman who helps the ship's lounge singer (Carol Lynley) retain her sanity. Arthur O'Connell is a strict reverend who refuses to go along with Hackman. Leslie Nielsen makes a cameo as the ship's captain who dies during the tidal wave.The cast really isn't very important, it's the special effects and on-going tension that makes the film so much fun. I absolutely love the claustrophobic and wet feeling that is so important to the execution of the film. While a lot of the acting hasn't aged well (Shelley Winters, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are especially guilty of overacting!), the special effects aren't too cheesy and the entire set of the ship is wonderfully well-made, still standing as an achievement on its own. Lots of unintentional humor abounds (the obese Shelley Winters swimming underwater, displaying her underpants clinging to her bulbous buttocks), which makes the viewing experience all the more enjoyable. The theme song, ""The Morning After"", won an Oscar and is rather lightweight, but highly listenable.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE definitely does have some twists and turns that surprise the viewer (not everyone gets out alive) and holds the audience's attention throughout the entire thing, even though things do get a little soap opera-ish at times. This makes a great double bill with THE TOWERING INFERNO, which I find a better picture, but POSEIDON is a very fun viewing and is, if anything, a great movie to watch if you have 2 hours to kill."
21,"The Poseidon Adventure tells the story of a ship that is capsized by a tidal wave on it's final voyage, and a reverend on board attracts a group of followers who want to climb up to the bottom of the ship to find a way out. Along the way they run into obstacles that test their strength, their courage, and overall their willingness to survive as a team. The Poseidon Adventure is a movie that I saw for the first time on TV when I was 8, and I've watched it every time it was on, I rented it both from the library and the video store, and I finally bought it. I never get bored of it. Every time I watch it, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time. My enjoyment of it never decreases. There are several reasons for it being a good movie.The acting is amazing. Is there a bad actor in this movie at all? No. Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens...All capable and very good actors, together in one movie. Everybody plays their role with the best of their skill. There's really not one bad performance in the movie. Pre-comedy Leslie Nielsen even does well in his small role as the captain of the Poseidon. Since it's a 70's movie, some lines of dialogue sound really corny, but they end up being the film's most memorable lines.The special effects are pretty good. The upside down sets are really cool, and the underwater shots are well done even though we know it's a model ship. The capsizing scene is amazing and looks as if it's actually happening. Irwin Allen wanted everything as perfect as he could get it, so the actors performed their own stunts, and the actors said it was the most difficult shoot of their lives. What I like the best about this movie is what was missing in the 2006 remake. Character development. Before the action starts, we are introduced to each character and taught who they are, what they're like, why they're like that, etc. The new Poseidon is missing that, and it's a mistake.The Poseidon Adventure is the first real Hollywood disaster film if you don't count Airport, and it's still the best to this day. If you want a good time with a good story, good acting, and compelling characters, The Poseidon Adventure is for you.8/10"
22,"Every so often over the years, I have found myself in a room -- at a doctor's office, the auditorium where I had my high school graduation, even in a church during a funeral -- and I find my mind wandering and wondering about what it would be like should the entire place turn upside down. Where would I land, which heavy object would I have to dodge to keep from being squashed, etc. Such is the power of movies; they have the ability to alter perspective, not in some deeply profound way; but with the subtle way you perceive the world.My upside down view of the world is an outgrowth from having seen THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE dozens of times over the years and gotten a kick out of the moment on New Year's Eve when the entire boat capsizes and everyone goes head over heels. The movie took something readily recognizable and made it fascinating just by flipping it over.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the first and the best of the so-called disaster movies of the 1970s. Okay, the original AIRPORT and long before that 1939s SAN FRANCISCO were first, but the airborne disaster in one and the earthquake in the other were mere threads in rambling soap operas; POSEIDON was the first where the catastrophe was the focal point and the starting point. As such, producer Irwin Allen was mining new territory and essentially created the genre -- though its value as a cinematic art is certainly debatable.Anyway, I think that the original POSEIDON works, where so many of those that followed didn't, because it has a sense of humor. Certainly, while many imitators (EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, POSEIDON's two woeful remakes, etc.) were laughable, they weren't humorous in a humane sort of way. The film recognizes that its basic premise is absurd, but doesn't dwell on it, placing the emphasis on the people not the situation.The disaster movie became quickly known as a vehicle where stick-figure characters, burdened with cumbersome and melodramatic backstories and played by big-name stars shamelessly emoting all over the place, bided their time as the impending doom of the special effects polished them off one by one. As such, the disaster became the star, not unlike Freddie Krueger or Michael Meyers or other horror movie boogie men; and the point of the film was less about survival than about not surviving, about how and when the special effects and the stunt team would give which character the next big adios.You'd be hard pressed to remember, let alone care, who played what character in EARTHQUAKE or THE SWARM or AIRPORT 19-whatever. That's the beauty of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE; even if you think the characters are caricatures, their backstories lame and the whole film silly, they nonetheless stick with you. Part of this is due, I think, to the fact that the characters are more real; there are no multimillionaire industrialists, no fading movie stars, no international terrorists or jewel thieves, no phoney-baloney VIPs of any sort. The final voyage of the SS Poseidon carries a rather mundane passenger list of tourists, honeymooners, doting grandparents and lonely singles. They're ordinary people who end up in extraordinary circumstances. Likewise, the cast is made up of ordinary movie stars; none of the cast (with the notable exception of star Gene Hackman, hot off his success in THE FRENCH CONNECTION) were at the height of their careers, but they are an immensely likable ensemble of recognizable character actors; Red Button, Roddy MacDowall, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, etc. They are performers who the audience is so comfortable with that you instantly are concerned for their safety. Bigger stars might have overwhelmed the story, like in THE TOWERING INFERNO or EARTHQUAKE; but here, if you don't like Shelley, you just might identify with her character. Bottom line: you really do care who survives and you are hurt when so-and-so meets his unexpected and untimely end.Even Hackman manages to be larger than life and yet rather ordinary as the movie hero. Though he plays a minister -- in itself an odd choice for an action hero -- his Rev. Scott is something of a rebel, an outspoken, liberal cleric, like those who popped up during the antiwar movement of the 60s. Instead of the icy, grim hero of most of these films, as the story's Christ's figure, Hackman's Scott is guided as much by his emotions as by his self-righteousness. He's certainly no Charlton Heston -- and that is just fine. Through Scott, the film delivers a fiery sermon that puts a strange spin on the usual Darwinism that rules this type of film. While the film pays due respect to the old ""it's God's will"" style of religion as embodied in Arthur O'Connell's Chaplain John, the main message of POSEIDON is that of self confidence and self-determination. Darwin's survival of the fittest ideology is not seen as a contradiction to the theology of ""the meek shall inherit;"" -- perhaps suggesting that the meek must survive in order to inherit.Though not handled with very much grace, the film's religious themes nonetheless give THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE a bit of backbone; arguing that religion without action is futile and that one of God's greatest gifts is the will to survive.As an action machine, POSEIDON hasn't aged all that well; it's special effects and production values now seem sort of quaint. Yet, at the same time, these things give it a bit of character, a remembrance of when drama was defined by a good cast, an intriguing story and a sense of adventure, not just by how cleverly a CGI technician can manipulate images. Like the ship itself, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE may be a fine lady that's seen better days, but unlike the ship in question, it seems to sail on and on, seemingly unsinkable."
23,"Although not perfect, this is a very entertaining disaster movie. It has all the elements of ""who will survive"" movies of the '70's, but delivers with creative originality that most of the similar movies that followed it lacked.One of the weaknesses of the movie is that some of the characters are written much more volatile than an ordinary person would be, even under these circumstances. A great cast, however, make these characters as believable as possible, and the audience gets a chance to see who they are, and how they respond to situations and the crisis in general. Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman), a fiery maverick cleric, leads the campaign to escape as their antagonist, the water, keeps on systematically pursuing the group from deck to deck. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), a tough cop, provides plenty of conflict with an equally strong personality.The cast also includes Stella Stevens, Shelly Winters, Roddy McDowell, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, Red Buttons, and Leslie Nielson. All are terrific in their roles, and bring plenty of emotion, suspense, plot twists, drama, subplots, character development and more to make this an exciting film. There are a few contrivances (such as explosions always occurring at the worst possible moment), but overall, the story works well. Some images are effectively haunting, too, such as the famous scene of a victim falling on a window. The memorable music score is effectively used at key moments to flavor the mood and tension.There is a lot of symbolism in this film, a creative slant that you don't see very often. Some examples: The priest leading the group to a ""promised land."" The reformed prostitute character (Mary Magdalene?). The Christmas tree as a route to safety. The waters ""Flood""ing in.This was the original, and with near-classic status, did not need to be remade. Forget that travesty on TV a few months ago that brazenly used the ""Poseidon"" title, and avoid any other unnecessary counterfeits that they come up with. Get some popcorn and enjoy this movie."
24,"I'll take Reverend Scott, Rogo, Martin, Linda, Nonnie, Acres, Belle, Manny, Robin and Susan over Jack and Rose any day.In both movies, the ship is the star. But in the 70s you could get an all-star cast where in Titanic all you can get is a really good actor in Leonardo DiCaprio and an (at the time) unknown in Kate Winslet.Yes give me the tidal wave over the berg.""Oh my god. Hard left."""
25,"An American disaster adventure; A stellar cast is submarine but Gene Hackman soon sorts the men from the buoys when drama unfolds. Ernest Borgnine chews up the scenery but Oscar nominated Shelley Winters provides great support in one of the great genre movies. Visual effects are always better in remakes but in this original the special effects and set design work to ensure tension runs just as high in the rafters. Scored by John Williams, it won an Oscar for Elizabeth McGovern's performance of the song, ""The Morning After""."
26,"First time I saw it, was a little miffed with my parents; they made me go to bed after 3 quarters into the disaster. It was past my bedtime.This is THE must see films for those enamored with the disaster genre. A modern day classic and transcends time. It has a cross-section of REGULAR people in the area of looks. The modern movie makers of any film the likes of this should take stock of this film. In terms of image, casts this day are geared towards the twenty, thirty demographic on average and the perfect bods. How realistic is that? This movie, edited or not (watching the unedited version as I write on AMC) I feel appeals to all ages. The writings good, the cast excellent, the progression of interaction between those initial survivors is very genuine. Most important in terms of watching it, the characters, regardless of degrees of pleasant are likable. I feel sorry for the ones met briefly, want the small band of intrepid refugees to survive.Btw, I hearing ""The Mornig After""; having to hold back tearing up. Gonna halt this review. Besides not wanting to spoil the fun for those consider watching it for the first time, the big wave's come. Business is about to pick up."
27,"Much as I enjoy Kurt Russell, the new movie just doesn't have anything to offer. Who cares about updated special effects? I found the ""old"" tidal wave/rogue wave more frightening than the ""new"" one anyway, even though you can tell they tried like heck to outdo the ""old one""! 1972's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is so much more fun. It has more personality, cooler music (John Williams rules forever) and a more palpable sense of doom, disaster, heroism and friendship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Jack Albertson, Carol Lyndley, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens and all the rest of them did great. Sometimes things are over the top, but this is Irwin Allen stuff. It's a classic and always will be."
28,"This is what every disaster movie should be!  The hero isn't some ripped moron leading people through outrageous obstacles while shooting bad guys and what not.  It's a plain and simple movie about survival.  Reminds me a little of 12 Angry Men in some scenes, but it lends to the movie well.  I mean, how would u react if you were trapped in a sinking ship with a revrend, a cop and a hooker and a singer??  Superb acting contributed by some, and not so out standing provided by some as well.  Hackman & Borgnine never miss.  Music is a cut above, but I would expect no less from John Williams.  Some gripping moments will surely grasp (if at nothing else) your sense of pitty for these people.  Later remade as Daylight with Stalone and met with a less successful story.  Over all, well done."
29,One of the most suspending thrillers I've ever seen. Suspense from the first up to the last minute. A fantastic Gene Hackman and a (much more fascinating) Ernest Borgnine.
30,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" starts out as a rather routine ocean voyage but turns into a very risky escape from disaster, thanks to a massive tidal wave striking the ship on New Year's Eve.The Poseidon is an old vessel on its way to the scrap yard, but its last voyage is never completed.  Instead, only a few of the passengers survive the overturning of the ship, and manage to climb to the hull, which is now afloat.  Gene Hackman plays the leader of the small group, with excellent back-up from Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, and Red Buttons.  Female leads are handled with skill by Stella Stevens and Shelly Winters.  Each deck the small group climbs brings them closer to the engine room, and safety in the hull, but the water keeps edging ever closer.  Who finally survives?Rent this one to find out, or better still, buy it.  A must-see."
31,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" stands out as the best of the disaster film genre,which was spawned by 1970's ""Airport"" and recently revived with both worthy successors (""Titanic"") and some not-so-worthy (""Volcano"",""Daylight"" and ""Dante's Peak"".) The film's plot goes something like this...on New Year's Eve,a tidal wave capsizes the S.S.Poseidon during its journey from the States to Greece,and a small band of survivors (ten to be exact),led by a fiery preacher (the superb Gene Hackman),struggles to escape from the rising waters by climbing to the engine room,which is now located at the top of the ship. Shelley Winters is a standout among the top-notch all-star supporting cast (which includes Ernest Borgnine,Red Buttons,Carol Lynley,Roddy McDowall,Stella Stevens,Jack Albertson,Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). The Oscar-winning special effects and set design will knock your socks off, and the film's theme song ""The Morning After"",sung by Maureen McGovern is also excellent (it won a Best Original Song Oscar). What separates ""Poseidon"" from the other films in the disaster genre is that you will find yourselves really caring about the characters,and the film's writers and producers were not afraid to kill off its lead characters. My score: 10 out of 10! Simply the best!"
32,"Over 20 years since it's release, no other movie has beat this one! Since I've seen this movie as a kid, I've learned every word of this flick within the hundreds of times I've seen it. Watching this film once every two weeks, it never tires. Ranking up their with such classics like The Towering Inferno, the Poseidon Adventure follows a handful of survivors after a tidal wave hits a cruise liner on New Year's Eve. Fighting their way to the bottom of the ship, which is now floating upside down in the ocean as it takes on water, some survive this suspense/action classic while a few die along the way, resting at the bottom of the ocean with the countless others that refused to follow leader Reverend Scott, played by Gene Hackman. Forget Titanic! This movie beats out every movie since, including the very pathetic sequel, Return to the Poseidon."
33,"This is the movie which inspired the disaster trend of the '70's. The Oscar winning special effects are incredible even today. The much copied story still holds interest, especially if you don't know the fate of some of the characters. This movie will someday be remade and updated, but the original will always be considered a classic. A definite must-see!"
34,"Although one could point out what many see as flaws in the film (and I really can't disagree with them) the basic elements still hold up as to why I love this movie: the horror of a tidal wave capsizing a cruise ship and leaving it's surviving passengers in their ""hell, upside down"" is still there. Rev. Scott (Gene Hackman) announcing that ""The sea is going to keep pouring in..."" to that awesome score still carries the threat of what they're up against."
35,"While ""Poseidon"" may never be known as the greatest movie of all time, it does have its merits.  One need only look at the junk it unfortunately spawned (ie.ARMAGEDDON).  The characters in Poseidon may seem cartoonish to some, but at least you care about them.  People always say that before the ship turns over the dialogue is wretched.  I think its fine -haven't you ever been to a wedding where you are seated with complete strangers - how in depth do your conversations go?  Nowadays, I find that ever character appears to be auditioning for the Comedy Store -it's a constant barrage of one-liners.  The strength of Poseidon is that the one-liners are left to the Rogo's (who are like Ralph and Alice Kramden on sea) and the other character play their roles straight.  Poseidon is a film which, I believe has stood the test of time.  If it were released today -like Star Wars it would accord itself well and perhaps teach new directors that you can have a great action flick with good acting and suspense."
36,"I watched the Poseidon Adventure with mother and aunt and we all agreed that it was a great film. The disater scenes were nice, the acting was excellent and the emotion was very good. All actors gave a great work in this film. I really liked it and would recommend it to a friend."
37,"This was the first film I recall seeing as a kid that just blew me away.  I couldn't believe how good it was.   Now as an adult I hear the goofy dialogue and notice some things that make me laugh a bit.  Even though, the show is GREAT.  My wife and I bought it and many friends who are in their md 20's have watched it for the first time with us and loved it.The film was a massive hit when it came out and it deserved to be a hit. The acting is good while some dialogue is stupid.  The interaction between the characters is what you'd expect from a bunch of strangers from different walks of life being forced to come together in a disaster.  EVERYONE wants to take the lead so fights would happen.  Imagine something happening in your own city or town.  How many people think of themselves as the LEADER?I have to say that BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is atrocious.  I tried to like it but I HATED IT!!  Another all star cast but what a terrible idea for a film.   Michael Caine and Sally Field must be embarrassed (but richer) for that film.I don't think Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Leslie Nielsen or Eric Shea feel humiliated for appearing in such a great film as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE."
38,"Any way you look at it, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a very thrilling and entertaining two hours. The acting is perfectly adequate (considering the genre); the sets are terrific; the camera work is above par; and John Williams' musical score is great.  Most importantly, it has withstood the test of time. This film has always been one of my favorites...and always will be."
39,"The Poseidon Adventure is a fabulous drama with a cavalcade of stars. Each one of the characters was portrayed by a master performer and the casting director was brilliant. The cinema- tography was incredibly realistic and the story, although rather unbelievable at times was gripping.The ending wasn't predictable and the movie as a whole really keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. This is a film well worth renting/watching if you enjoy a dramic movie with a romantic theme."
40,"It has been argued which of the 1970's ""disaster genre"" movies is the absolute best...Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno. As some IMDb members have pointed out, ""Airport"" started the genre, and films like Earthquake and Airport 75 were highly entertaining additions. But when it all boils down to it, PA and TI were the two most popular at the box office, each easily topping $100 million in domestic ticket sales.I saw Towering Inferno upon its theatrical release in December 1974, at the age of 9, and was crazy about it, because a) I wanted to be a fireman, and b) loved all the great action (especially watching the fire trucks racing through the rolling hills of San Francisco, and the Navy rescue helicopters, as well as the amazing John Williams soundtrack).However, as the years have passed by, and having watched the theatrical version of Poseidon Adventure on cable several times, I now feel that it is the better of the two movies.First of all, it is one hour shorter, which means we get more action per minute, and less ""fluff"".Perhaps most important of all, we get to see and know the main characters in much greater depth than we ever do in Towering Inferno. That alone makes for much greater drama, because we get to care for them more deeply.Also the underlying themes in PA, such as faith, new-found courage, self-sacrifice, overcoming self-doubt and arrogance, and learning to trust a child to help lead us to safety are so well written and acted out, it just adds all the more to the viewing experience.Above all else, what makes for a truly great disaster epic is having people we truly care about / root for.Poseidon Adventure does this in a way that Towering Inferno never accomplishes. In TI, Irwin Allen was going for true thrills, with less emphasis on the individuals. And with the drama / suspense of the blowing up of the water tanks, plus John Williams masterful score, it is a truly great ""thrill ride"", albeit with at least 30 minutes of excess running time.And, even though I love Steve McQueen's ""Chief Michael O'Hallorhan"" in TI, I dare say that Gene Hackman's ""Reverend Scott"" is just as good, if not more powerful and charismatic. If you want a truly epic ""1970s disaster film"", Poseidon Adventure delivers at every level."

Filmed at the height of the disaster genre from the 7os , this entry in the spectacular series profits of a strong acting by awesome players . Our heroes get stuck in the ship before it sinks and the protagonists spend most of their time devising grisly ways for avoid to die . The explosions , pyrotechnics , floods are spectacular and breathtaking , being well made by FX experts . Most of the external shots of the Poseidon were shot using a model built from the original blueprints of the Queen Mary . Some of the pre-capsize sequences were shot aboard the Queen Mary, including the opening storm sequence, the pre-disaster scenes in the staterooms and hallways, the scenes above decks, furthermore , an early scene in the engine room and 125 stunt people were used during the filming , no one was killed or injured. Magnificent main and support cast as Leslie Nielsen , Stella Stevens , Arthur O'Connell , Jack Albertson , Carol Lynley , Red Buttons , Roddy McDowall and special mention to Shelley Winters who gained 35 pounds for the part and trained with an Olympic swim coach so that her character.

42,"The Poseidon Adventure is the first of a long string of disaster movies. Its about the cruise ship POSEIDON that is capsized on the early hours of New Years Day. The ship contains such stars as Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowall, and Shelly Winters. They have to escape the grand dining room, flooding corridors, upside down kitchens, vertical shafts, and a lot more obstacle's to brave. The acting of the actors are good, especially Shelly Winters as the former swimming champion. Director Ronald Neame creates characters you care about and cranks up the tension with the claustrophobia and the thought of impending doom. The model of the Poseidon is impressive. The supporting cast contains Jack Albertson, Stella Stevens, Pamela Sue Martin, Arthur Connell, Eric Shea. Leslie Neilsen plays the Captain in a straight face role, and Fred Sadoff plays Mr Linarcos, the ships accountant, but they go out early in the movie. The Poseidon Adventure is an enjoyable film, with a stellar cast. 10 out of 10!"
43,"This has to be one of the best films ever made.I saw the film for the 1st time when I was a little girl (I'm now coming up to 30!)and I have never forgotten it-especially being distraught at the end,when Rev Scott dies!I now have the special edition DVD and I recommend it to everyone.There are so many different features on it. I love everything about this film. Unlike the remake,it provides us with true to life personalities that you can believe in and situations that are not over the top or bursting with special effects.It was sad they ran out of budget towards the end as,a shot of the liner in the water (as planned), would of made for a perfect ending.I'm so glad the film was made when it was because the casting was first class and this film is a true classic."
44,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an above average disaster film from Irwin Allen, who eventually became known as the Master of Disaster after this came out in 1972. This was the movie that started the disaster film craze of the 70s, and deservedly so. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is about a luxury liner traveling the open seas on New Year's Eve that has the unfortunate task of running into a 90 foot tidal wave that proceeds to capsize the ship and turn it upside down thanks to an undersea earthquake. Afterwards a small group of survivors try to make it to the top (or bottom) of the ship hoping to be rescued. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" starts off as a silly comedy for the first 20 minutes, where they introduce the main characters. These characters are portrayed by an all-star cast: Gene Hackman as a reverend who's always barking orders at everyone; Ernest Borgnine as a cop who always complaining about everything; Stella Stevens as Borgnine's wife, a former prostitute; Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson as a Jewish couple; Red Buttons as a lonely bachelor; Carol Lynley as the ship's pop singer; and Leslie Nielsen as the ship's captain. After the opening 20 minutes the real excitement begins. The passengers have to endure many dangers while trying to escape, and during the course of the film the real question is the same as it is in every disaster picture: who will die and who will survive? I won't dare say who dies and who survives. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an excellent movie for most of its two hours, and I enjoyed the action, special effects, and the performances (which are terrific). Sure Borgnine has the worst written role in the film, but so what. He'll either make you laugh or get on your nerves. I felt a little of both. Same goes for Stevens who is a good foil for Borgnine. Hackman plays the reverend to the hilt, a man who won't let anyone give up. Winters is very funny as the Jewish woman who worries she won't make it because she's overweight, and Albertson plays off of her very well as her husband. Buttons is very good as the bachelor who's sweet and caring. Lynley gets to show off some singing talents, and does a decent job of singing as she does at trying to escape from hell upside down. Nielsen is a lot of fun to watch as he plays it deadly straight here long before playing it deadly straight in ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" comedies. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is pure adventure indeed. Terrific entertainment.
***1/2 (out of four)"
45,First saw this movie when I was 12 and it's still one of my all time favorites. This movie has great special effects for 1972. The cast is very good. If you like adventure this is a must see.
46,"It is possible to go one better than a lifeboat for oceanic claustrophobia What you do is have a luxury liner completely capsized by a tidal wave, and you let ten people live on in a pocket of air, their only hope being to make their way through fire, dead bodies and endless amounts of water of the sinking ship to a propeller shaft, where the hull is thinnest and where there is a chance of rescuers cutting their way through This was the terrific idea set up in Paul Gallico's most well-known book, which descended with awful disappointment on to the screen, but caught the public fancy, and started a cycle And while the tense adventure lacks the austere presence of George Kennedy, no one could ask for a better set-up for suspensenaturally, when the genesis was with that old master of mass emotions, Gallico But oh, what a waste was there in Ronald Neame's motion picture Partly it was due to the lack of the technical perfectionism of a Hitchcock, and much more to the stereotyping of the characters and the excruciating banality of their dialog There was a muscular clergyman to lead, an old Jewish couple still in love after some time of marriage, a hot head detective and his well reformed happy hooker wife, a young lady Pamela Sue Martin, (and his nice younger brother) and a hippie girl singer who were there presumably to give a pleasant show of legs in hotpants, a lonely haberdasher, and a nice cool steward along for the ride Gene Hackman was cast as the preacher the most unlikely reverend I could imagine Presumably he was chosen because of his well-deserved success as the cynical, determined New York narcotics cop in ""The French Connection."" He played the character every bit as rough and tough Whenever he heaved his muscles and opened his mouth I anticipated the coming of ""I got the God connection."" But one must not blame the cast There were fine actors among them and it was not their fault that the situations were evidently prefabricated, that the characters were as realistic as the cutouts at the back of a cereal box, living and dying as contrived ""incidents."""
47,"A big, raucous, one-box-of-popcorn thriller that made for huge box-office in 1972. Terrifically-charged and designed disaster epic from producer Irwin Allen has an ocean-liner overturning in a tidal wave, sending the passengers scrambling for safety. The writing has some campy elements, but also many intentional laughs (most belonging to Stella Stevens as a shrewish harpy). The cast is uniformly excellent, and it's especially nice to see Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson together (in any other movie they would seem like a mismatch, but in these roles they are just right). Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine battle each other for leadership, Carol Lynley is an appropriately terrified pop singer (when I saw this in the theater, the audience seemed highly in favor of Lynley getting left behind!), Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea are the kids. There are two deaths that I felt came out of nowhere and were simply to pare the ensemble down, but otherwise it is a fabulous trip with eye-popping effects. ***1/2 from ****"
48,"Classic disaster movie that never tires.  I can watch it again and again!! Anybody who thinks this is awful should watch it again!!  Shelley Winters is great as the ex-olympic swimmer.  Watching her climbing the Christmas tree is one of the best moments.  Sadness along the way from the moment the wave hits.  Gene Hackman is great as a preacher, fighting with Ernest Borgnine. Constant clashing!  I have no criticms about this film!  Only wish I could have seen it on the big screen (shame I wasn't born!)  Carole Lynley plays a great singer, despaired at the loss of her brother in the disaster, but fights to survive with attentiveness of Roddy MacDowall.  Watch it watch it watch it!!"
49,"The Poseidon, an ocean liner larger than the Queens Elizabeth and Mary combined, is charting its course on New Year's Eve. Just after midnight, Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) spots the mother of all tidal waves. It is the last thing that Harrison and practically everyone else onboard sees before drowning -- the Poseidon is turned upside down, with only a handful of survivors. The ten lucky ones -- including Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), Linda Rogo (Stella Stevens), Acres (Roddy McDowall), Belle Rosen (Shelley Winters), and Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) -- led by no-nonsense minister Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), desperately attempt to climb from the top of the ship (now submerged) to the bottom (now ""the top""). The film's theme song, ""The Morning After,"" sung by Maureen McGovern, earned an Oscar. In addition, The Poseidon Adventure received the Special Achievement Award for Special Effects; L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers were the recipients.One heck of a film . Melodramatic a tad; but the cast namely Gene Hackmen who performance is riveting. Shelly Winters , Ernest Borgnine , Red Buttons , Pamela Sue Martin ,Carol Lynley , Jack Albertson & Eric Shea are such a fabulous ensemble . There combined talents makes The Poseidon Adventure just gel into one of the greatest ""Classic"" of disaster movie's ever produced . Fantastic film."
50,"A handful of people led by take-charge renegade priest Reverend Scott (an excellent performance by Gene Hackman) struggle to get out of a capsized ocean liner that they are trapped inside of before the ship eventually sinks.Director Ronald Neame keeps the gripping story moving along at a brisk pace, builds plenty of tension, maintains a tough tone throughout, and doesn't let the pyrotechnics overwhelm the intrinsic powerful drama in the desperate main situation. The meaty script by Wendell Mayes and Stirling fleshes out the principal characters nicely, doesn't pull any punches concerning the grim fates of certain people who one initially expects to make it, and even comes complete with a significant central message about the basic human desire to live and survive no matter what.Moreover, it's acted with tremendous aplomb by a tip-top cast: Ernest Borgnine as belligerent detective Rogo, Red Buttons as happy-go-lucky bachelor Martin, Carol Lynley as fragile pop singer Nonnie, Stella Stevens as Rogo's brash ex-hooker wife Linda, Shelley Winters as the good-hearted Belle Rosen, Jack Albertson as her gentle husband Manny, Pamela Sue Martin as spunky teenager Susan, Eric Shea as precious kid Robin, Roddy McDowall as helpful steward Acres, and Leslie Nielsen as the no-nonsense captain. The use of convincing practical effects adds a strong element of gritty realism, with the real flames and water conveying a potent and palpable sense of genuine danger. Kudos are also in order for Howard E. Stine's crisp widescreen cinematography and the lush and majestic orchestral score by John Williams. Worthy of its classic status."
51,"This film is full of drama and tension.We meet many people, who take a New Year's voyage to Greece that may be their last.The Captain (Gene Hackman) tries to sail his ship,but meets with danger and peril. We meet many passengers like The Rosens ( Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters) or Mike and Linda Rogo (Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens). It happens that the ship comes upon a tidal wave that may mark the end of everyone.In the struggle,the ship capsizes and things get risky; We find that the passengers must climb deeper through the boat to reach safety.True courage is knowing how to face what comes in front of you.Wisdom helps you to understand how to face reality head on."
52,"I am amazed that there haven't been many comments about John William's brilliant score! Just listen to the Main Titles it shows an ominous enemy (the rough sea) is battling against them but somehow it also personifies the courage and resolve of the people on board. A most beautiful introduction which should draw people into the movie like it did me when I first saw it at age 10. These Poseidon remakes couldn't even hold a candle to this wonderful score. All in all a fine cast that did a great job despite the rather pedestrian script they were dealt and who can forget ""just panties what else do I need"" :) For my part Borgnine, Winters, Hackman and an honorable mention to Leslie Nielsen as The Captain and Fred Sadoff as the ""bastard Linarcos"" If you want to wax nostalgic then definitely watch this fixture of the 1970's."
53,"Water assumes the role of villain, as a small group of passengers try to move ever upward inside a capsized and sinking ship, in what is one of the better 1970s disaster films. The film starts with a screen notice that informs viewers ""There were only a handful of survivors. This is their story."" Which of course keeps viewers wondering who will survive and who will die. And so the first third of the film is interesting in that we get some good character development, courtesy of a well-developed, character-driven script and an all-star ensemble cast. When a major character dies we feel a sense of loss.A lot of the nail-biting tension derives from the tight, claustrophobic interiors through which characters must traverse. And I must say the props, literally upside-down, were terrifically designed. It's hard to imagine these interiors were all built sets. With appropriately placed echoes, plus the sound of steam and rushing water, the film's sound effects are almost as impressive as the visuals.A couple of sequences are quite dramatic. One is the festive New Years eve ballroom segment. As the external wave hits the ship, everything begins to slide at an angle that becomes ever more steep. Here, film editing creates a sense of horrifying realism, with just the right quantity and quality of screen cuts. Ditto the Christmas tree panic sequence.Cinematography is highly effective. In many scenes one source of light augmented by a bit of back-lighting makes for just the right visual effect. An unobtrusive score in the right places adds emotional depth.In sync with the dialogue, acting trends heartfelt. Most performers give quite a good performance. I especially liked Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters.Several minor complaints include dialogue that is a tad too sentimental in spots, some rather too obvious plot clichés, and thematic depth that trends a bit shallow, pardon the pun. None of these script issues are serious.""The Poseidon Adventure"" aims for a high level of entertainment value. With a good script, terrific cinematography and editing, and some fine acting, I think it succeeds."
54,"Credit for the ""disaster movie"" craze of the Seventies is often given to AIRPORT, a very good film that has a disaster in it, but the disaster is tangential to the plot rather than its center. It was not until two years later that the real granddaddy of the disaster genre was released: Ronald Neame's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, based on Paul Gallico's bestselling novel and one of those rare occasions where the film actually outshines the book.The film actually follows Gallico's novel fairly straightforwardly; the primary difference is in the characters. Gallico's dramatis personae are a bunch of people so unlikable that I found myself wishing the damn ship would just sink and take them all to the bottom.The movie's screenplay, by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, softens the characterizations considerably, humanizing them to a great degree and allowing Neame and his brilliant star-studded cast to strut their stuff, from Stella Stevens's funny-sad floosie to Ernest Borgnine's hard-nosed cop whose weakness is his wife (Stevens), from Gene Hackman as a rah-rah football star-cum-minister, to Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters, heartbreaking as a Jewish couple on their way to Israel to see their grandson for the first time.High art this isn't, I'll admit that. The acting is hammy in spots (Borgnine in particular is allowed to overplay almost every scene), but somehow it works here. Neame has a good grasp of the material he is working with; the book was a potboiler, a soap opera on the high seas, and he filmed it accordingly.Winters received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Albertson was easily her equal and should have been nominated in the Supporting Actor category but the Academy is notoriously fickle about these things.The most impressive thing about this movie, and the thing that sets it apart from more recent epics such as James Cameron's TITANIC, is that they did not have CGI technology in the early Seventies; everything you see was filmed on a set that had to be built with actors who probably spent all day in the water for weeks on end. What visual effects may have gained with the advent of computer technology, something was lost along the way; a certain verisimilitude that somehow looks more real than the sleek CGI stuff.I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a kid of nine; despite the slight cheesiness of the proceedings, I give it a ten because, as the saying goes, ""they don't make movies like this anymore."" And it is true. Two remakes were made of this one, and from what I heard (I refuse to see them), they sank faster than the ship did.Pass the popcorn."
55,"I've seen all the old disaster flicks on cable recently. And i have to say, most aren't as good as i remembered. Earthquake was pretty bad. Towering Inferno kinda drags on, though after 9/11 its somewhat eerie. But Poseidon Adventure went the other way for me. It seems better than i remember. Pretty remarkable special affects. Great acting, Hey, Leslie Nielsen in a non comedy roll also. I always liked the beginning sequence with the ship in bad weather and that kid makes it to the pilot house. I was that kids age when this came out and i remember saying, no way in heck would I have done that. Whenever i hear that Morning after song, i think of this movie. One things for sure, if i am ever on a cruise and that song comes on, I'm hitting the bar immediately."
56,"My Take: Cheesy as it might be, this ranks as the best of the character-driven disaster movies of the decade. Boy, don't I just love these disaster movies. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is one of the first of its kind, following the success of Ross Hunter's production of ""Airport"", based on the novel by Arthur Hailey. And, well, what can I say? It's highly entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of characters, and stuff around the characters, including a lot of character background and varieties. Gene Hackman's character of Rev. Scott may be a turn to what viewers expect from a hero, and that's why he's great. The other characters, although somewhat stereotypical, are very convincing. Now just add a disaster background of a capsized cruise liner and you get a disaster movie that's a lot of fun. Nowadays, ""Poseidon"" may be considered ""campy"", or such. But really, it isn't. This movie has so much likable qualities. It has this nostalgic feel in it, that I find very enjoyable and wonderful.""The Poseidon Adventure"" was released at the time that disaster movies were king of the cinema, or maybe this made it become the king. After ""Airport"" was released previously, it earned a lot of bucks from the box-office, but was savaged by critics when it was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Picture. ""Poseidon"" wasn't nominated for Best Picture, but I think it would be more of a better qualification. Now, I haven't seen ""Airport"" yet, but after seeing a couple of trailers and so, I think this was more entertaining. It was more interesting, I think, and more action-packed for its time. It also, of course, has more body-count, and drama to go around it. I think this certain thing is, let's say, the top of every disaster films, and makes them entertaining. Surely enough, it's very interesting to see a well-respected all-star cast, caught in a major calamity, and escaping them with rewards (they get passed dangerous obstacles) and loses (some of them don't really make it, of course).I think that ""Poseidon"" was superbly entertaining, and, done with right justice on DVD, think this would still be very effective now. It may lose some of the charm, but this film would still have a special place in my heart, and may movie collection. I think similar to anyone else.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."
57,"I've been hooked on this movie since it came out in '72, but could'nt see it until '74. And I'm very grateful for the hard work they all did. You can see why it's a classic all around. However, I do have a little bone to pick with some. Linarcos was'nt the bad guy here, if Captain Harrison had ordered ""Hard left,"" sooner...chances are they would have survived the capsize. Linarcos was only doing what he was told to do. The tidalwave and capsizing was'nt not entirely his fault. As side from this, you will be captivated by this movie, from the time you see the liner and hear the film score. Through the arguments that Mike and Linda have, Capt. Harrison and Linarcos, even the kids. Yes, there is tension, but watching this movie....you will understand why the original, will always be the best, it set the standard in disaster movies and even today..no disaster movie can stand up to it. Enjoy it for what it is, fun and enjoyment. LONG LIVE LINARCOS!!!!!!"
58,"I picked up this original classic as I anxiously await for the remake opening soon in theaters. I had never seen the original and I was absolutely blown away. Never before have I been a big fan of Gene Hackmans. He's a versatile actor who's been around a long time but I never much enjoyed him and finally after many years he won me over in a huge way and proved his stardom. The entire cast comes together as a group and creates a death defying story of a group of survivors making their way from the bottom of a ship (which was the top before it capsized) to the top (formerly the bottom.) Everything comes together to make The Poseidon Adventure the brilliant classic that it is. The performances, the story, the adventure, the action, the writing, the directing, the brilliant setting...you can't beat this film and there is nothing else like it.Gene Hackman plays Reverand Frank Scott. A rather loud mouthed, do things his own way preacher who has had some fallings out with God. Nonetheless he's brave and caring and a leader at heart. When the ship capsizes it is him who leaps to action to save not just one or two people but everyone aboard the ship. Unfortunately most will not listen to him. This is hands down Hackman's most brilliant and wonderful performance. He should have absolutely taken home some awards for his role. Ernest Borgnine plays brash and tough cop Mike Rogo. He's the perfect balance to Hackman's character and they clash for leadership but also work together to save lives. They have great chemistry opposite each other and he's a loud mouth fun character. Shelley Winters is terrific as Mrs. Belle Rosen and equally good is her husband Jack Albertson as Mr. Rosen. Together they are ""everyones"" grandparents and you root for them as they make their way through and overcome some real adversity to escape. Stella Stevens is terrific opposite Borgnine as his equally loud mouthed wife Linda. Their banter and arguing but love for one another is fun to watch. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea do a great job as the younger members of the cast, brother and sister Susan and Robin Shelby. Roddy McDowall makes a brief if not a little unremarkable appearance as ship hand Acres, and watch for Leslie Nielson in an equally brief but more important and stand out role as the Captain of The Poseidon. Red Buttons plays quiet nice guy James, and Carol Lynley plays his love interest of sorts Nonnie, whose brother's death aboard the Poseidon makes her wonder if life is worth continuing but James pushes her through and saves her every time. With such an enormous starring cast...the majority of them share equal screen time it's amazing that most of them manage to give stand out performances. Some stronger than others but all of them make up an important ensemble and each play a role that you enjoy watching. Nobody is ever safe and with only a few survivors you fear for them aboard the ship.The setting for this film is absolutely unique and incredible. Your average sinking ship disaster film is changed immensely when they are escaping from a completely capsized cruise ship. Everything is upside down, creating a world unknown to them due to that. Scenes in washrooms, kitchens, hallways, doorways all become new terrain because it's all upside down and creates a uniqueness and cinematographic brilliance. The Tag line really says it all...Hell...Upside Down. That's exactly what it is. You become so attached to each and every one of the cast members...most of all Hackman's hero. There are some very minor downsides...at times the acting gets a little over the top, their fear and moments of emotion are almost campy and overdone which can happen in a disaster film. They want to give it their all. I also felt that the women in the film, although strong characters were intensely sexualized. For 99% of the film Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and even Pamela Sue Martin shed their dresses and pranced around the ship baring their very long legs. I think that was to really mainstream the film and I suppose it did that but seemed out of place and almost blatant at times. That aside The Poseidon Adventure is an absolute classic, brilliantly made, and a constant edge of your seat adventure. You'll wish there was more when it's all said and done. You'll laugh and cry and root for them...it's the best classic I have seen in a very, very long time and one of my favorite movies hands down. 10/10"
59,"First the bad news - Irwin Allen's film is full of overacting, stereotyped characters, cheesy 1970s' décor and allegorical content, and at times is hard to sit through with a straight face. The good news is that it is still hugely entertaining, remembered fondly by many viewers over two decades after it was first released, when it gained two Academy Awards (music and special effects). On its own terms, it is a film which remains highly successful, the sort of Hollywood product at which it is easy to sneer but compulsively watchable once started.Allen's surefooted career began with another Oscar (that for the 1953 documentary The Sea Around Us), before he graduated onto the more profitable world of fantasy. The Lost World (1960), was followed by Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea (1961) and Five Weeks In A Balloon (1962). He really found his stride with a series of now-cult TV shows like Lost In Space, Time Tunnel, Land Of The Giants, and so on. The Poseidon Adventure, which marked his return to the big screen, is credited by some as marking the start of the disaster-film boom, a slew of titles such as turkeys like Allen's own The Swarm (1978) and co-director Neame's Meteor (1979), as well as what is now seen as the finest achievement of the genre, The Towering Inferno (1974). Arguably Allen also helped kill off the cycle he helped start, as those who have sat through the appalling Beyond The Poseidon Adventure (1979), in which a bored Michael Caine reworks the original, can testify.
Chief among the cast here is Gene Hackman, who plays the non-nonsense Reverend Scott. His own brand of muscular Christianity has caused him to be exiled by the church. Terming himself ""angry, rebellious, critical and a renegade"" Scott has no time for the meek of his flock, as is evident from his very first line in the film ""Get down on your knees and pray God for help? Garbage!"" He wants ""winners, not quitters!"" and, outside of disaster, it is the driven nature of his religious conviction that propels much of the film's narrative. As events will prove, Scott's self-help philosophy is just what is needed, although Hackman is occasionally guilty of chewing the scenery to show it, bringing little of the acting class he exhibited in the recent French Connection (1971). Along with the polo-necked reverend are a range of characters introduced quickly in scenes reminiscent of TV's later The Love Boat: a gruff and bitter cop named Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), travelling with his wife the former prostitute Linda (Stella Stevens), an elderly Jewish couple the Rosens (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters), a teenage girl and her young brother (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea, a juvenile role parodied memorably in Airplane!), pop singer Nonnie (Carol Lynley), and Acres, a conveniently knowledgeable crewman (Roddy MacDowell). There's also Martin, perhaps the most interesting supporting character, one who perhaps ""has been a bachelor too long"" - but who nevertheless strikes up a pathetic relationship with the shell-shocked Nonnie. In a film without a token black face to represent other minorities, and whilst Martin fondly considers marriage, he is instantly recognisable as a coded gay - a role which, in different times, would surely have been made more explicit.Allen's films are noticeable in that they often include strong religious or quasi-religious allegories. Thus the plagues of Egypt hover over The Swarm, shades of the Tower of Babel rise up in The Towering Inferno, and the film Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea asserts the truth of prophecy and revelation. Poseidon is the most explicit of this group, offering a sort of Pilgrim's Progress, complete with its own version of earthly travails or hell, even including a final ascension of the chosen ones to heaven. For Allen, the disaster genre came complete with worldly ordeals to be borne with the possibility of final salvation, a narrative frame repeated from project to project. Convinced by providence, one can never imagine him making a film with an open-ended conclusion such as Hitchcock gave The Birds.The Poseidon is more than just a boat; it is a ship of some 1400 souls, a human world turned upside down. Transformed from a luxury liner to an environment full of torment, flames and death, though which the principals have to make stark moral choices, it is this landscape that makes the film so compulsive. Beginning with a climb up a gigantic Christmas tree as the first step to saving themselves, the main movement of the film ends with light beaming in through the opening of the ship's 'sky', down onto Rogo's now-believing, ecstatic face. Between times the assorted characters battling to survive have chosen between the words of the Purser (who urges survivors to stay put) or the Reverend Scott's plan to work their way towards the bottom of the inverted ship. A case of God over mammon perhaps, for those who remain behind are quickly punished in a flood of almost biblical proportions. Scott has clearly found the right path, although it is hard for us to forgive his slowly closing the door on those drowning souls he abandons. At the end of the film this controversial cleric appears to abjure God entirely (""leave us alone!"") in a death scene strongly suggestive of crucifixion and hellfire.As others have rightly observed, where other directors like William Castle ""used gimmicks implanted in theatres to increase the cheesy fun of his pictures... Allen made the movies themselves the gimmick."" This is noticeably true of The Poseidon Adventure, and the recreation of the stricken vessel is still impressive today. (The scene in the vertical shaft, where Acres meets his end, might easily have inspired a similar one in Alien: Resurrection, 1997.) Amidst the flooding deck ways Allen even manages a couple of truly surreal moments, as when the boy investigates the topsy-turvy barbershop, or the mysteries of the ship's urinals. Generally the Oscar for special effects still seems well earned, although there's surely a glaring mistake in the representation of the 90-foot wave bearing down on the ship, which appears to be breaking before impact! Cultists will enjoy the sight of serious Leslie Nielsen as the captain of the doomed liner, while some will regret that more is not seen of ex-Playboy playmate Stella Stevens, whose flimsy clothes remain stubbornly intact and opaque throughout each ordeal. Borgnine is, well, Borgnine and provides a suitable down-to-earth foil to Hackman's driving optimism. Shelley Winters, who put on pounds of weight for the film and gained an Oscar nomination for her pains, is less impressive, although playing half of the self-absorbed Jewish couple was an uninspiring part.Caveats aside, this is still an entertaining enough cinematic vessel to wonder around in and while away an hour or so, and there are surely much worse films out there with higher reputations. The DVD is cheap and can be recommended, although a special edition is sorely needed.."
60,"I tend not to be a spoiler, but this to me is the movie that started all disaster movies. I love this movie to no end! The Poseidon Adventure is based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Of course the book version and the movie version are completely different but some based on fact. Paul Gallico during World War 2, witnessed the Queen Mary almost capsizing and that inspired him to write the book. The characters in the movie are very good. The special effects are awesome. Though this movie is fictional, this tops all sea disaster films. The movie has a lot of realism in it, and a variety of characters. If you are a disaster film lover, this is the one movie for you! You will find out later on that you'll keep on going back and forth between scenes, and then before you know it, you are addicted to it just as I am, and you'll probably watch it so much you may know every line by heart!"
61,"I do not know why this movie had the effect it did on me, but from the first time I saw anything about this movie it has held me in it's grip. I remember being about nine years old and seeing a short film about making this movie, and then months later seeing television commercials about it coming soon and then counting the days until it was premiered, and finally seeing it on the giant screen at the Bel-Air cinema. I must have driven everyone in my family crazy to see it as many times as I could. I remember cutting anything about the movie out of the newspaper, calling radio stations to request ""The Morning After"" and then buying the 45 and wearing it out. I attended a Catholic school, and in every art class I would draw pictures of ships and scenes from this movie: I'm telling you that this movie had a HUGE effect on me. I am not at all surprised that ""Titanic"" has broken box office records. This type of movie, a disaster amidst luxury seems to strike some primal instinct in people. I'm very happy to know that today I find that there are others who agree with me on the impression this movie has made."
62,"The film that set the early 1970's stage for practically a whole genre of ""disaster movies"" (aside from AIRPORT in 1970). Yes, the initial prologue and set up is rather inane, yet we grow to appreciate and care for these characters. Flashing back to when this was a new release, this had as much buzz going as TITANIC. You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing ""THE MORNING AFTER"" being played. I just about drove my mum off the deep end ""filming"" a THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, with her Kodak super-8 camera. It starred all of us kids in the neighborhood, and I turned the house topsy-turvy to get that perfect ""upside down"" look. It's a wonder she didn't end up in a straightjacket on that one. Anyone in possession of those reels could own my home via extortion.    The nucleus of the film, of course, is mega-wave capsizes the SS POSEIDON. Passengers make their attempts to survive and escape the ship, if possible. The acting gets a little heavy at places, yet we are swept up into the saga. Anything that we're not alienated or disenfranchised from, is bound to win us over to a certain degree. You can't help but get involved in their struggle. The script dawdles here an there, however, it's a well above average movie.         Special kudos for Red Buttons, who does turn in an understated performance, and shines superbly. Recommended."
63,"Since I've been 5 years old, this disaster movie from Irwin Allen has been the must see movie my whole life. I'm only 16, I've seen the teenslasher/drama flicks with the whole 'Scream' trilogy and 'Cruel Intentions' hits, but nothing has pulled my strings as this film has.
This 70's film, which nabbed two out of the nine academy awards it was up for (music and special effects), was the pioneer of all the disaster flicks. Poseidon is to credit for the spark of suspense movies such as Earthquake, The Towering Inferno, and Avalanche. When a cruise liner is capsized during a New Year's Eve voyage, the handful of survivors played by an all-star cast fight their way to the bottom of the now overturned boat. Battling rising water, boat-rocking explosions, out of control flames, and the race against time before the luxury liner sinks, only the toughest passengers come out alive.Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters, and Erniest Borgnine truly deliever with extrodinary acting talents put to use in an original and attention nabbing plot, making this film a golden classic for future generations."
64,"Forget Titanic...this is the real thing. Quality performances abound in this high octane adventure. The first half an hour may seem soporific, but this just lulls us into a false sense of security, then the action hits us with MegaVolt intensity. This film could only have been made in the seventies. It has that genuinely dirty seventies look to it, as opposed to the pristine polish of such nonsense as Titanic or Dante's Peak or any of the disaster pics they make today. And it has a top score by Williams, which I believe is buyable on Cd. Buy this one now on widescreen."
65,"This film will always have a special place in my heart if only because I was practically born in a movie theater when my mother went and saw this.  The film that began Ernest Borgnine's second career.  Gene Hackman great as always, Shelly Winters big as ever, Red Buttons over-the-wimpy-top, the Christmas tree, the exploding smokestack, the upside-down men's room, the reverend's fall.  The film that ultimately began the cornball era of Hollywood Disaster films. Love it!!!  Watch with tongue firmly in cheek or don't bother with it at all."
66,"A passenger ship, on her way to the scrap yard is pushed to her limits by the new owners to save on the dismantling fees. A tidal wave hits her, flipping her over so that all the internal rooms are upside down. A priest takes a band of survivors on a journey through the bowels of the ship in an attempt to survive.....This film has it all, a wonderful build up, some terrific set pieces, and most of all, a band of survivors you actually root for, because the acting is just so good.First and foremost, it's a disaster movie, and probably the most iconic made when Hollywood wanted to destroy everything in the seventies.Hackman is wonderful as the preacher, and his altercations with Borgnine only add to the drama. The last fifteen minutes of this film really hit the emotion button hard, when events take a turn for the worse.It's a grand film, made on a grand scale, and although there was a plethora of films that followed, each ones quality diminishing as the years went on, this still demands repeat viewings.A bonafide Hollywood classic."
67,"The Poseidon Adventure was among my favourite films when I was a kid. Along with ""Airport"" it was one of the early seventies disaster films that defined the formula for many more. Many of the themes have been reheated and used in a hundred other films and consequently it now looks incredibly corny. The fact that other themes were already past their sell by date doesn't help. It *was* an important film for the development of it's genre, so film buffs may find it interesting; the over thirties may enjoy it for it's nostalgia value; otherwise it will probably seem pretty weird and clunky. Why, for example, is Pamela Sue Martin wearing shorts under her evening dress? The dialogue often sounds like the cinematic equivalent of gears grinding. ""I'm a renegade"" says Gene Hackman's character in what must be the most unsubtle piece of exposition ever.I now find it more amusing than exciting but I still like it. It was of it's time; comparing it with Titanic is as meaningless as comparing Gone With The Wind with The Matrix."
68,"I read some comments and I feel I should contribute by my opinion. It was first movie I have seen on cinema like a little boy. Until I have seen this film in adult age, I remembered only the scene with the big wave (I sat in the third row in the cinema with had a very big screen) and scene with Gene Hackman when he is hanging above the fire. I think this is one of the best movies 70s. It has good idea and good actors starring here. You cross one's fingers to all who survive.For me it's a very jolly memory to my mother which saw this movie with me then and this movie was her favorite too."
69,This is easily one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Not only I like the genre but it is so well done that I cannot ignore film crew ability to create a real touching story. The more I see it the more I like it. When a movie makes that effect to me then it's gonna be one of my favorites.I watched it today in my home language for the 100th time and not only I liked more than ever but I cried. At first I had some in my eyes during some sad scenes and at the end I really cried for sure feeling the same as the characters. Really one great movie that deserves its credits.I recommend it to everybody for good action and drama that despite the timed special effects still evolves in greatly without ever annoying and giving thru emotions throughout.
70,"I've seen an incredible amount of disaster flicks, I enjoy them I admit. They always have a common trend of the same outcomes or same cheesy characters, but let's face it, the effects are always what makes the movie. The Poseidon Adventure was a first disaster movie that was all around an enjoyment for me, acting, effects, and a terrific plot. I couldn't believe for 1972, how well they did on turning the boat over and the shocking aftermath.The whole movie you just can't help but root on for the survivors to go on and live through this terrifying ordeal. Of course you have a cheesy moment here and there, otherwise, I'd say all systems are a go for this movie. Believe me, this is one of the best disaster flicks that I have seen in a long time! 8/10"
71,"""Poseidon Adventure,"" like all great disaster movies, creates dramatic tension by exploiting basic fears, in this case falling, drowning and burning. That might be why the movie is so vivid despite rather pedestrian special effects. You don't need an MFA in film to figure out how they did most of it -- if you can tilt a camera, turn on a fire hose and nail a toilet to the ceiling, you can pretty much remake ""The Poseidon Adventure."" And the acting is so cartoonish and histrionic you have trouble believing that this cast has, all told, piled up 7 Oscars (2 each for Gene and Shelley). But in fairness, the script is overstuffed with mawkish, corny, tin-eared dialogue (""come here, you lousy cop!"") that can't be delivered without sounding hammy.I love this movie. I think it's brilliant.No, I don't just love it in an ironic way, it's actually a masterpiece, an allegory so blatant it needs all its overblown camp elements to keep it from ascending to the level of fable or parable. More Biblical than ""The Ten Commandments"" or any of those other annoyingly literal epics, ""Poseidon Adventure"" is about man's search for God. A holy man, of uncertain ordination, is experiencing a crisis of faith that leads him to preach self-help theology. (Potential spoiler: he's saved by the death of a Jew.) A cop discovers his humanity through his redemptive love of a prostitute. A sad old bachelor rediscovers his will to live by helping an abandoned, frightened young woman. The central question of this film is how do we find salvation, and it offers this answer: within ourselves. Notice the contrasting fates of those who actively seek salvation and those who await it passively -- Gene Hackman, who has led his small flock upward/downward in the hope of survival, watches with mingled pity and horror as a deluge sweeps away those who have obeyed the ship steward's counsel to sit and wait. (A rather Protestant message, it must be said.) To underscore the metaphysical theme, there's plenty of shouting up into an echoing void, plus scores of characters falling into infernos. There's even the possibility that ""Poseidon Adventure"" is a Gnostic narrative -- via a schism, the characters are cast into an imperfect, upside-down world and seek through faith and effort to escape into the perfect (well, at least right-side-up) realm. No wonder this movie has inspired such a cult.And if you choose to ignore the subtext, you can have a pretty good time anyway. Please don't bother to suspend your disbelief. There's no way you can convince yourself that Carol Lynley can sing or that Red Buttons is heterosexual or that Shelley Winters is a very skinny lady, in the water or anywhere else. Enjoy ""The Poseidon Adventure"" for its many absurdities -- Stella's panties, Shelley's panties, Pamela Sue's hotpants and Lolita-like lust for a much older man, and the hysterically untalented Eric Shea as the requisite annoying kid. There are even some genuinely good things in it, namely Jack Albertson, who manages to create a rather moving and believable character, even if he's overshadowed by his louder, more melodramatic castmates. Go rent this right now."
72,THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is a worthwhile movie mostly because of GENEHACKMANS performance as the Reverand. The script about a ship turnedupside down and the struggle of the passengers to reach safety is exciting.Ernest Borgnine is quite good as the police Lieutenant. You get the feeling that the passengers in the story will be alright because there are people used toleadership like the police Lieutenant. The special effects look fine after over 30 years. The fact that there is a THX version of the movie available is appealing. Some of the damsel in distress stuff seems a little sexist today. The film inspires you to think about humans surviving underwater for long periods of time. If the human species is to survive alien contact we may have to learn to liveunderwater for years at a time. I gave the POSEIDON ADVENTURE a 10 out of10 because of the cliffhanger script and great acting.
73,"I love – and I truly mean LOVE – those typically bombastic and ginormous-scaled disaster movies from the 70s and early 80s, but admittedly they are all exactly the same The setting and type of catastrophe are always different, of course, but the narrative structure, cast of characters and action sequences are practically always alike! When all hell breaks loose, there's always one atypical hero who stands up and mobilizes a small group of reluctant followers to do the exact opposite of what seems logical and of what everybody else is doing. The group exists of stereotypes that complain the entire time about the decisions that are being made, and several of them obviously don't make it until the end of the movie, but eventually the hero's choices naturally turn out to be only slim chances for survival they ever had! Of course, being released in 1972, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was one of the very first big-budgeted disaster movies and one of the first enormous successes of producer Irwin Allen, so it's only logical that it spawned many imitations and that the formula blatantly got copied by Mr. Allen himself. Nearly 45 years later, the film is still very exciting, the sets & stunts still look very convincing (without any computer generated effects) and it's also still extremely realistic when it comes to illustrating what happens when blind panic breaks out. For all passengers and crew members aboard the SS Poseidon, the New Year couldn't possibly start off any worse Caught in an immense storm, the luxurious cruise ship gets hits by a massive tidal wave and capsizes, only moments after midnight on the 1st of January. With the captain and most of the crew members dead, the slightly controversial but authoritarian reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) profiles himself as the leader and rescuer of as many people as possible. He guides a small group towards the bottom of the ship – since it's upside down – but since they were celebrating the New Year in the restaurant on the deck, they have to climb huge Christmas trees and squirm through narrow ventilation shafts in order to reach the engine room. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is incredibly fast-paced, all the big names in the cast depict their roles very energetic and John Williams delivered a tremendously great score. The script contains a few horrible clichés in terms of character development (for example, dominant males and docile women) but luckily the multi-talented actors and actresses deal with it very well. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters and many others deliver stellar performances, and even Leslie Nielsen is memorable in his (too short) role as the amiable captain. Along with ""The Towering Inferno"" and the original ""Airport"", this is the most iconic disaster movie of the seventies!"
74,"This movie really is Allen's first special effects effort on the big screen. He had done some major stuff on television. No really huge stars were in this but a lot of veteran cast members, a young Gene Hackman.The screen while a bit hokey is supplemented by the special effects with the water racing the survivors through the decks. The effects were so well done that Allen would get a bigger budget and even more hokey Towering Inferno after this one. This movie sort of kicked off several disaster films after it.Maureen McGovern would hit the pop music charts with The Morning After from this movie. With the death of the musicals, films would do one major song. She did another less memorable song in Towering Inferno.The story here is whole cloth, fictional from start to finish. If your a fan of phony Melo-Drama, this movie is for you. If your not a fan of Leslie Nielson, this movie is for you as he does not last past the first big wave.Old actors Jack Albertson, Red Buttonas , and Ernest Borgnine, plus Shelly Winters are pretty durable in this one. This movie the shock value of killing most of the cast before the rescue. It was considered good enough to be sequel-ed and then remade. So original is Hollywood."
75,"This is the ultimate disaster movie with a huge boat, a huge cast, a huge tidal wave, but most importantly, a huge heart. There have been lots of jokes in regards to the weight gain by Shelley Winters in the part she plays here, and until I first saw this, I had the impression that she played a stereotypical nagging Jewish wife. Wrong! Her character is the heart and soul of the film, a far cry from her clinging wife and mother in ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and her extremely abusive, racist mother in ""A Patch of Blue"".Several years before the success of ""The Love Boat"" on T.V., this all-star cast disaster epic was the big box office smash of its year, and seeing it 40+ years later, it is easy to understand why. The film is entertaining from start to finish: nail biting, sentimental, funny, and even tragic. There's no iceberg, torpedo or giant sea monster, just an act of God standing in the way of this ""Grand Hotel of the Sea"" getting to its destination.The actual tidal wave occurs fairly early in the film, leaving only enough time for character development and brief plot to establish what is going on in these people's lives at the time. Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters play an aging Jewish couple on their way to Israel to meet their grandson, while Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens play a trashy rich couple who do nothing but verbally spar, making them a modern version of ""Dinner at Eight's"" Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow. Stevens gets in a few good potshots at both hubby Ernest and portly Shelley, rudely pushing her way in front of Winters to climb up the Christmas tree impromptly used as a ladder while shouting, ""I'm going first, before old fat-ass gets stuck."" Carol Lynley is a shy, mousy lounge singer, first heard singing the film's Oscar Winning song ""The Morning After"", made famous as a hit record by Maureen McGovern. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea are a young sister and brother traveling alone, while Gene Hackman is a rather embittered Reverend. Others aboard include Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons and Arthur O'Connell, but with too many subplots going on, a few of the stars had to suffer in the final print. There's a bit of camp with the casting of a pre-""Airplane!"" Leslie Nielsen as the ship's captain who is deadly serious here without being called Shirley.The world of an upside down ship is a scary one, especially when surrounded by thousand miles of ocean and no realistic way to get to the top to summon help which may not be forthcoming. The human drama and suspense of being trapped in an enclosed space make for riveting storytelling. There are some shocking fatalities, and several of them are ""time to reach out for a Kleenex"" moments. The rapport between Hackman and Winters grows as the desperation increases, making for a touching relationship between strangers. Winters was a good sport about this film, and later in her life, poo-pooed the 1997 ""Titanic"" by publicly declaring, ""I prefer 'The Poseidon Adventure'"".Having become a perennial favorite for midnight showings on New Year's Eve and private viewings of the film's cult fans, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has survived a wretched sequel and an unnecessary remake. The film spawned tons of imitators and a series of disaster films that for the most part pale in comparison. If you are to see only one disaster movie in your life, it should be this one. Skip towering infernos, exploding blimps, big buses and tampered with rollercoasters. The adventure starts here, and Poseidon's name is stamped all over it."
76,"The Poseidon Adventure is a much better disaster film than the 2006 remake based off this film. I only saw this film because I wanted to compare it to 2006 version but I founded out that it would not be a good idea. Even the special effects in this movie are groundbreaking when compared to the remake.This film is about a group of survivors on the S.S Poseidon and their goal is to make it out of the ship alive.This movie features many great actors such as Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgigine, Red Buttons, and Leslie Nielsen. They all deliver gritty, sometimes heart-wrenching performances.One thing that really amazed me is the visual effects. They are quite groundbreaking when this film came out in 1972 and I think it still holds up pretty well today.Overall, this is the father of all disaster films! This is one of the best disaster films to see. I rate this film 9/10."
77,"I always enjoyed this disaster movie from the 70's. For the time the effects are very nice and it has a nice assortment of characters in it as well. Though I do feel Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnaine steal the show (though others have their moments). This one moves at a bit of a slower pace than the remake that went virtually unnoticed at the box office and I think that helps this one a bit. Let's face it, in that one there was virtually no thinking before people started doing crazy stuff to get out while here there was some debating going on. The story is about a ship that gets hit by a very big wave and gets tipped over so that the bottom of the ship is now the top and the top is the bottom. I am not sure how well a ship flipped would handle taking on water and such, but I think it is safe to assume that the air in the ship would slow its progress down a bit, though not sure to the degree this movie shows. This one has your basic group of plucky survivors trying to make their way to the bottom of the ship which is now the top, thus it is the only way to freedom. Some just want to wait for rescue though in the ballroom. So you get your survivors making their way along facing obstacle after obstacle and losing the occasional member. This one is much better than a later disaster film called ""When Time Ran Out"" featuring a volcano as this one has a lot more of the disaster happening and a lot more action. That one was way to much lead up and not enough going on after said disaster. There would be a sequel to this one, which makes little sense when you think about it, but for my money this is the best flipped over ship movie trumping the sequel and its remake though I enjoyed that one a bit too."
78,"On New Years Eve, the ocean liner SS Poseidon is hit by a tidal wave causing it to capsize. Floating in an inverted state in the sea, a hardy band of passengers led by Reverend Frank Scott, attempt to climb up to the engine room and hopefully to freedom. But inner fighting and a number of obstacles in their way are seriously hampering the survival bid.Producer Irwin Allen seemed to have single handedly created the disaster genre in the 1970s, here with The Poseidon Adventure, with Ronald Neame directing, he managed to take us into an upside down world of thrilling drama and none stop perils. The cast list may well be something to note, Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Roddy McDowell, Stella Stevens and Red Buttons, but really it's the sets and the fight for survival thru this watery labyrinthine that lifts the film above many of its genre peers. The picture has a very real feel to it, with the characters gradually getting you on side as they strive for survival, we have great work from Hackman and Borgnine as they vie for control of this disparate group, but we are with them all the way even tho we just know that this number will surely dwindle.The Poseidon Adventure 1972 was remade for the modern audience in 2006 with all the tools of the trade available to the makers, watching both films together it's not hard to see which is the most impressive, the 72 original has a vitality that modern blockbuster pictures can't quite grasp, and of course the technical aspects easily outstrip the CGI laden efforts of the later picture. Often seen as one of the leading lights of a much maligned genre, The Poseidon Adventure still packs a punch to this day, both in its craft and its emotional heart. 8/10"
79,"Lately i saw the remake of ""The Poseidon adventure"" which name is ""Poseidon"" ... that remake stinks.""The Poseidon adventure"" is a wonderful and touching movie about a ship that collapses and it is face down. Now, few people will go for the correct road, but ... they have good luck? ""The Poseidon adventure"" is catching. With a great cast like Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Carol Lynley, Red Buttons and Leslie Nielsen. And although i gave reasons with the cast, the plot is very creative. One of the best disaster movies.PD: Oh can you see the morning after? *Sorry for any mistake in the review ... and sorry if is very short too"
80,"When the Poseidon Adventure premiered, in 1972, every kid in my 7th grade class wanted to see it. I know I wasn't the last one to see it, but it sure felt like it. Clearly the movie has flaws, but it's a great story and is highly entertaining. I watch it whenever I see it coming on TV. Its enduring appeal for me is the ""what would I do if I were in his/ her shoes?"" aspect that runs throughout the movie. You feel involved...as many times as I've seen it, I've never been able to just dispassionately watch it.My only regret is that the movie makers didn't follow the book more closely. The ending in the movie (no, this isn't a spoiler!) is almost a letdown if you've read the book. The psychological impact of the book ending was devastating for me, and because of my strange tastes in movies, I wish Irwin Allen had had the fortitude and wherewithal to more closely follow the book's ending. By the way, the book's author, Paul Gallico, is a great story teller and is incredibly versatile, having written entertaining books in several genres, from children's stories (""Thomasina"") to espionage thrillers (""The Boy Who Invented the Bubble Gun"") to, of course, the action/adventure of ""The Poseidon Adventure."""
81,"Talk about memories from my childhood. I couldn't wait to see this movie on the big screen at the Dallas DeLuxe Theatre after seeing the movie poster advertising it. All those stars! My nine year old brain couldn't stand it! Then, like now, I will still tune in and watch, if only to see the capsizing of the boat and our rag tag troop climb up the giant Christmas tree. Many a day I ""played"" The Poseidon Adventure in our basement, turning furniture upside down and being trapped! Stella Stevens was pretty raunchy in the movie with her talk and outfits, I even remember one of her negligee's being a little too see through if you know what I mean. All in all it was great excitement and Shelly Winters took home the Oscar for her poignant portrayal of a former Olympic Swimmer!"
82,"Spoilers!!!!!!So, I admit it. The Poseidon Adventure is my favorite movie of all time. While I realize that this is not the most stunning, well acted, and executed movie in history, I just love it. The story of survival is so important to me, people putting aside their differences to help one another is really cool. The Poseidon, as you might know already, is a cruise ship in the middle of the holiday season, taking passengers through the Mediterranean, when it is capsized by a rouge wave just after midnight on New Year's Eve. Ten survivors now ban together for a brave climb to the bottom of the ship (which is now over head). A few don't make it to the journeys end, dying so suddenly and you are left with no time at all to mourn. The hardest loss for me was Belle Rosen. For one thing, she has age and her weight to fight with all the way through, and she dies saving everyone else, a true example of human sacrifice, putting the needs of other people before your own. The scene brings me to tears every time Iwatch it. I recommend that everyone and their mother see this movie, and I won't get mad if it doesn't wind up being your favorite, you gave it a shot, and that is all that matters."
83,"This was actually one of the very first films I ever saw in a theater, way back in 1972. I don't recall the screening itself but I do remember the line to get in actually going all the way around the block.I always remembered this being a good film, so When I saw the DVD in a store for only 6 bucks, I had to buy it. 6 bucks for a nice quality widescreen Poseidon Adventure? Great deal!The Poseidon Adventure is a lot of fun to watch because Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are both a blast. Hackman is one of those actors you can watch in just about anything, and Borgnine is obviously digging into his role here as a pain in the butt for all involved. And talk about an early 70's cast - Shelley Winters (who I just never liked for some reason), Jack Albertson, Eric Shea (annoying kid), Pamela Sue Martin (looks great), et all, and geez, even Red Buttons.You can't deny the early 70's were a lot of fun movie-wise, with all the disaster films being made. Besides movies about bee attacks, giant rabbits, spiders, and other science disaster flicks, you had the nitty gritty like The Poseidon Adventure, the Airport ones, Earthquake, Towering Inferno - these were loud, intense and cool films. Entertaining! Poseidon Adventure just may be the best of the bunch.The film moves along nicely, and the sets are nicely constructed. And the special effects are pretty good, especially for the year. This is real filmmaking here, no computer-generated crap to be found. You know if the talked-about remake ever happens, it's going to look completely fake because of all the cartoon computer FX garbage they are going to fill it with. It'll probably cost $130 million dollars and look like an animated cartoon. I'm starting to get the feeling that film fans are beginning to get sick of all the fake computer crap - I certainly hope so. Buy The Poseidon Adventure and see what real filmmaking is all about."
84,"My favorite of the 70's disaster movies.  It's probably least credible in what could really happen, but the over the top acting, the terrific sets and special effects, and the exciting trip up to the bottom make it a fun movie to watch.  Plus, 70's fashions!!   And ""The Morning After""  AM radio at it's poppiest!!Honestly, a fun, entertaining adventure story."
85,"SPOILERS AHEADProducer Irwin Allen hit a home run in his first at-bat in the disaster genre with ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" a terrific suspense classic that actually looks as good today as it did upon its release in 1972.The plot is simple:  a tidal wave hits a huge luxury liner in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.  When the ship capsizes, a small group of survivors must climb their way UP to the bottom of the ship in the hopes that rescuers can cut through the hull and rescue them.  Since the entire crew of the ship has apparently been killed, an outcast minister named Rev. Scott (Gene Hackman), who is borderline psychotic and holds some incredibly unconventional views about God and his influence on mankind, assumes leadership of the group.  Scott's chief rival is a gruff and bitter cop named Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), who is travelling with his nasty, foul-mouthed ex-hooker wife Linda (Stella Stevens).  Other survivors include an elderly Jewish couple (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters), a teenage girl and her young brother (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea), a middle-age bachelor (Red Buttons), a pop singer (Carol Lynley), and a crewman (Roddy MacDowell). Of course, the suspense all revolves around who will live and who will die.While the characters for the most part are stereotypes, what makes ""The Poseidon Adventure"" stand apart from other films of its type is the strong plot and the utter unconventionality of its lead character.  Gene Hackman, coming off his Oscar win for ""The French Connection,"" is absolutely sensational as Rev. Scott, a minister who doesn't believe in prayer and actually sees it as a sign of weakness.  He believes that God has put man on Earth to fend for himself and has given him a brain to figure things out for himself.  I honestly have never seen quite a character on film before or since, and the religious subtext actually gives the film additional meaning beyond the standard thrills and chills.  He may be psychotic, but the man makes sense, at least in this predicament.  Most of the rest of the cast is also quite good, with Borgnine making an excellent sparring partner for Hackman, and Stevens having her finest on-screen hour as the hilariously unpleasant Linda.  I also liked the burgeoning relationship between Buttons and Lynley, who are quite touching in their loneliness.  And then there's audience favorite Shelley Winters as Belle, a nosy (and obese) Jewish grandmother.  Winters managed to get an Oscar nomination for this role, but let's face it:  she's just a teeny-bit terrible in this one-note role.  And the kids are ridiculously out-of-place here: why would parents put their kids on a luxury liner instead of flying them to Greece?  Its obvious they are around solely for audience sympathy. It doesn't help that young Eric Shea is so obnoxious as the young brother you may very well find yourself wishing he had drowned with the rest of the passengers.  Then there's Leslie Neilsen as the ship's captain.  At the time a serious actor, it's impossible now to keep a straight face watching this master clown in this serious role.  You keep expecting him to break into slapstick mode, even though you know he's playing it straight.  Regardless, he's believably authoritative in the role.  But you'll still laugh.If I have one negative thing to say about ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" it's that the establishing scenes, in which the characters are introduced, are pretty bad, laughable even.  But once the ship capsizes, the film turns into topnotch entertainment, with fabulous Oscar-winning special effects that still are convincing today.  Irwin Allen followed this one up with the even better disaster epic ""The Towering Inferno.""  Together, they make a terrific, if day-long, double feature.  Forget ""Titanic.""  ""The Poseidon Adventure"" remains the top of the maritime class.  ***1/2 (out of *****)"
86,"This movie is great! Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine lead an extraordinarycast. Among them are the bitchie but funny Stella Stevens, the gorgeous Carol Lynely, Red Buttons who was nominated for an Oscar for this, the heroic Shelley Winters, the heart-stealing Jack Albertson, the shy Roddy McDowall, and thetwo children Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea. The film is also features thesmall roles of Arthur O'Connell and Leslie Nielsen. See this movie! It is one of my faves!"
87,"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972) *** Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Stella Stevens, Jack Albertson, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Carol Lynley. Pamela Sue Martin, Eric Shea, Arthur O' Connell, Leslie Nielsen. One of the greatest all-star disaster flicks ever from ""Master of Disaster"" producer Irwin Allen: supersized ocean liner S.S. Poseidon is en route to a natural disaster on New Year's Eve when a titanic tsunami causes a giant tidal wave to capsize the vessel with only hours to escape before she sinks! Fine picked ensemble particularly disillusioned man of the cloth Hackman acting as maverick savior for a ragtag group of survivors scrambling for escape, including Best Supporting Actress nominee Shelley Winters (who gained some 50 pounds for the role and never lost it!)   Excellent production design and Oscar winning visuals as well as an Academy Award for Best Song (!) ""The Morning After""."
88,"Good Art form.Good Special Effects..I still remember watching in Indore, MP, India with my brother(Murli P. Rupani and Cousin Prakash P. Roopani). It was raining heavily.We were all wet.There was some water in our life that day.Some years later came Towering Inferno.....I don't know what is next...  something in Space... or perhaps onMoon....Thanks and Regards."
89,I love this film i saw this film back in 1997 and i still see it now. My dad love this film to. The cast and crew were great and the plot and story rock. On a scale of 1 out of 10 I give this film a 10 IT ROCKS. My hole family loves this film. Its excellent for a old film it is a classic film one that SHOULD BE AROUND FOREVER.
90,"The last time I saw The Poseidon Adventure, I was a little girl. I took the time to watch it again recently and found that it enthralled me as much now as it did then. Granted, some of the acting is average (such as the little boy, Robin, who feels obligated to shout all of his lines), but the whole of the movie far outweighs that negative. The special effects can still hold their own today, and the story will always be timeless so long as there are ships at sea. The plot is plain and simple - a cruise comes to a halt when it capsizes, and passengers try to find their way out. There is no hidden bomb, no secret character flaws (if they have a problem, everyone knows it), no seedy ""bad guys"" trying to kill the survivors. The only enemy here is the water that continues to flood the boat. Each character is well-developed and therefore, well-liked, no matter how irritating. There is one character in particular that I would like to slap because she tends to panic and freeze up in the most inconvenient times, but I can still identify with that panic. In a nutshell, SEE THIS MOVIE!"
91,"I just seen this movie for the first time tonight and I was blown away.
I will be honest, when I first heard that Leslie Nielsen was in the movie, I had to find out if it was a comedy.  I don't recall seeing him in anything but a completely ridiculous, but funny, movie.I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.
***Spoiler***The thing that pi**** me off about the movie was when the four people died at the end.  Everyone else in the movie I really didn't care about, but when I actually got to know the characters, seen them as my friends, it did upset me.  Mrs. Rolen's death upset me the most as I kept waiting for her to breathe again.  When the preacher died, it just about killed me.  I kept waiting for him to walk through the fire.  I kept waiting for Acres to walk out of the water and I sat and waited for the other woman to survive falling in fire.I liked this movie much better than Titanic.  I actually preferred the older version of Titanic better than the more recent one.Just a note, I'm not too good with names here, if you didn't figure that out already. :-)"
92,"I am inclined to agree with Spartan, one of the other people who have commented on this movie. Poseidon Adventure is better than Titanic by leaps and bounds. Incredibly, the critics tore this movie apart, saying the plots were tacky and dumb, yet how about the phoney love affair that takes place in the story of the Titanic with actors who can't act their way out of a wet paper bag. Kathy Bates was the only actor in the film with real talent. Amazingly, Titanic won multiple academy awards. Just goes to show what critics know. If you wish to see real acting watch Poseidon Adventure and put on your seatbelt for the ride of your life! This is when hollywood had great actors who afterall could act! This was from what I understand, one of the most complicated movies ever filmed with a great cast that has continued to grab audiences for years. This is perhaps the most engrossing film ever made! I have seen this one at least 10 times and it still keeps me on the edge of my seat!!"
93,"One night in late 1972 or early 1973,two of my older sisters invited me to see a movie with them.I remember almost not going,but I ended up going anyway.Up until this moment in my life,I had paid very little attention to movies.I was a fidgety little kid who rarely sat still,especially through an entire movie.For the first 20 minutes of this film,nothing changed about that.But then it happened,the tidal wave.I remember how awesome it looked on that huge drive-in movie screen.It was awesome to this seven year old anyway.The wave hits the ship and that crowd of people are suddenly in peril.With that,they had my attention and 35 years later,Hollywood still has my attention.The Poseidon Adventure made a movie fan out of a fidgety seven year old kid.If I had seen it for the first time as an adult,would I have been as impressed?I'll never know,but as it stands,I was an impressionable little boy,and was I ever impressed.It's my favorite movie from all that I have ever seen from cinema's grand history.Check it out!"
94,"After this film was released at the beginning of the 1970's, it started a trend for big budget disaster movies. This is one of the best, (The Towering Inferno and Airport'75 come close). Typically in a disaster flick we have a perfect cross-section of society, i.e. a shy loner, a jewish retired couple, a know-all kid that you hope will die, a cantankerous ex-cop etc. (strangely, though, no token Afro-Carribean character). And a disaster movie wouldn't be complete without the irritating hysterical blonde who can't swim, and screams whenever there is an explosion. Gene Hackman is brilliant as the Maverick Priest, and the way he sobs and dribbles over the dead Shelly Winters is method acting at its best. You hope that he survives with the rest of them - but does he??With the brilliant characterisations set up, all that can go wrong is with the sets and special effects. No fear, as these essential elements shine through (you can literally smell the mixture of sweat, diesel oil and sea water), and you can tell that they used moving sets rather than getting the cameraman to jiggle the camera about and directing the actors to run into walls - the initial disaster scene in the dining hall when the ship turns over and bodies are sent flying still manages to shock."
95,"I was a little boy when I first saw this film.  My mom had objections because of the mature subject matter, however, I convinced her to allow me to see the movie.GREAT MOVIE.  I mean great!!!  The women in this film (Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley and Pamela Sue Martin) are beautiful.  The special effects are awesome and fun to watch.  The song ""The Morning After"" is a classic that just adds to the allure of the show.The acting, especially Gene Hackman, is just so very natural.  Gene encourages the passengers to reach from within themselves to find the strength to move forward - to survive and to thrive.  A message that I still remember in the struggles of my life.Every once in a while a movie comes along that makes an impression on your life and it does not hit you until sometime later as time passes.  ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is just that film.  I hope that all of the stars of this film are doing well and still entertain audiences. Best wishes to each and every one of you special people."
96,"The problem with seeing this movie on the small screen is that the effectiveness of the great and horrifying ballroom scene is much diminished. That sequence is like watching a surreal car crash in slow motion. It still haunts me, almost thirty years later!Too bad the characters aren't well developed, which is the biggest 'minus' to this movie. Just the same, they're kinda fun, and only detract slightly from the terrifying circumstances that are, after all, the whole point of a disaster movie."
97,"If nothing else, this film should be watched for Shelly Winters brilliant, and well known, death scene.  Only a true, real artist like her could do it the way she did. Intense and real, not an ""actress-y"" death scene at all.  You can see she studied this one and really worked at it.  I adore Shelly, and she is brilliant"
98,"I watched this film again this evening on AMC.  I saw it in the theater when I was 15.  ""The Poseidon Adventure"" holds up well, I think, considering it's 27 years old!  The disaster formula used in this film wasn't new in 1972, but it was handled well, and it has been done to death ever since.  What works in ""Poseidon"" that often doesn't work in modern variations is the work of all those ""old pros"" (i.e, the cast).  They make the most of under-written characters, and even when they're bitching (as Stella Stevens does so well in this film), they're likeable.  I remember being very upset when a certain character actress ""bought the farm"" (so to speak)--her character was one of my favorites.  The effects don't show their age at all, and it's nice to see a film with CGI!  If all you've seen is ""Titanic,"" ""Independence Day,"" etc., you owe it to yourself to check out ""The Poseidon Adventure."""
99,"This is an excellent underrated picture.Everyone has a go at the script - whats wrong with it??Old jewish people are really like that, and 70's preachers were exactly like Gene Hackman.Hackman is an actors actor - the guy is just fantastic, my three favourites Hackman films are this - "" The Poeidon Adventure"" , and also ""The French Connection"" and my personal favourite ""No Way Out""Anyway, the first time i watched TPA , i was physically shocked, when Acres (McDowall) fell into the water taking borgnine with him, thank God Borgnine emerged - he really was Excellent in this movie, another bit which really got my heart pounding fast was when Reverend Scott sacrificed his life for the others, that was a really brilliant and saddening moment which i will never forget.This and ""The Towering Inferno"" are the two flagships of disaster movie excellence - i love them both,"
100,"Out of all the crummy forgettable 1970s disaster movies (remember ""Earthquake""--I didn't think so)  there are two reasonable good ones--""The Towering Inferno"" and this.  Yes the dialogue is laughable and the stars do not give out their best performances (but considering the dialogue how could they?), but as soon as the ship turns over the movie revs into high gear and never stops.  There's very few lulls in action and the movie moves quickly. No masterpiece but a lot of mindless fun.  Well worth renting or buying (like I did)."
101,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of the greatest ""disaster"" movies I have seen. It blends magnificent acting (esp. Hackman and McDowell) as well as keen special effects for its time.  If you are a Hackman enthusiast or want to see a good movie on a rainy day, then this is the one for you. I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10."
102,"It may not seem like anything particularly new these days, especially after the revival of disaster films in the late 90s. But in 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was a somewhat groundbreaking film. But we're used to a group of survivors fighting against floods, earthquakes, storms, sinking vessels, zombies, volcanoes etc so you have to keep this in mind when watching it.Taken from Paul Gallico's novel (who himself was one a ship that almost capsized) the film features an all-star cast (though young viewers will probably not recognize a single one of them save Gene Hackman or Leslie Nielsen) with 7 Academy Awards between them. Surely, the bigger the stars have a bigger chance of survival! Not so! A capsized ship has many different ways of killing you as our unfortunate stars learn...the hard way. None of it is particularly graphic but there is a lot of tension and claustrophobia that makes it work. And the sets are quite impressive, if a little dated. When the Poseidon flips over it's already an ancient ship heading for the scrapyard. It would have been better if they destroyed something brand new and pretty, but I guess that means it wouldn't be so dirty and menacing when upside-down and full of salt-water.Followed by a sequel in 1979 and a new version in 2006, TPA has become famous as the film that started the disaster genre and Irwin Allen as its creator. Truth be told, Allen only ever directed 2 (and a bit) of these movies and produced a couple more. I guess it's because TPA made such an impression that his name was linked to disaster movies he wasn't even involved with.Strange though to think that Gene Hackman hated making the movie and has apparently, to this day, refused to watch it. Much like Ed Harris in the Abyss. I guess some bald actors should just stay out of the water."
103,"This film has too MANY undercurrents of emotion, character, and lessons of life to be called a ""disaster movie"". For me, the disaster part came secondary to the characters and their development throughout. Each character's karma tokens are tracked, and each gets what they deserve, even Reverend Scott who gave his life, but only after being saved by Mrs. Rosen who could be considered the true hero. The long look Reverend Scott gives her after she saves him then dies in his arms speaks volumes. He knows he could very well have to give his life as well, and when the time comes he does so with a fury so inspiring that Mrs. Rosen would have been proud. There isn't any grown person here who hasn't yelled at God at one point in their lives, and Reverend Scott screaming at God to take him instead broke me down. I realized right there, that this is no ordinary ""disaster"" movie, and deserves to be called something else. Perhaps a psychological disaster movie? I dunno, but it's definitely in it's own genre altogether, and i haven't seen anything like it since. I'll always cherish this movie as a growing experience, and one that I always used to watch with my Grandma (who reminds me of Mrs Rosen). RIP Grandma!!! I love you!! :-D"
104,"I was 10 years old when this film was released. It was the first film I just couldn't wait to see. The poster really caught my imagination. Great acting, direction, and production design. And John Williams' music is one of the great underrated film scores."
105,"The S.S. Poseidon is enroute from NYC to Athens to be scrapped. The owners force the captain (Leslie Nielsen) to sail at full speed while not taking on required ballasts. She is top heavy and at midnight New Year's Eve, a rogue wave flips the ship upside down. A group of passengers struggle to work their way through the sinking ship. Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman) leads the group with the help of injured waiter Acres (Roddy McDowall). Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his wife former hooker Linda (Stella Stevens), the elderly couple Belle Rosen (Shelley Winters) and Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson), Susan Shelby (Pamela Sue Martin) and her little brother Robin (Eric Shea), shy bachelor James Martin (Red Buttons) and the lounge singer Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley) face the dangerous maze for the faint hope of survival.The 70s became in love with the disaster genre. This is one of the best. Along with other greats like 'The Towering Inferno', they represent simple mindless thrills. The biggest requirement is for great actors in easy to define roles. The flipping of the ship is chalk full of action-stunt goodness. The guy falling onto the skylight is terrific. This movie has to be considered a fan favorite of the genre."
106,"It's New Year's Eve and a cruise liner is making a journey from New York to Athens. The ship is on its final voyage when it becomes engulfed by a huge tidal wave a few hundred miles off the Greek coast. Many of the crew and passengers are killed in the aftermath. However, a small team of passengers (against all odds)work together to try to find an escape route from the ship.Wow talk about intense!! Once this film gets going it is an absolutely first rate thriller/adventure/survival film. Prior to the 'disaster' occurring, we're introduced to several characters who end up as 'key' survivors. Many of the characters are strong and this helps to increase the intensity of the experience. Hackman and Borgnine are both particularly good; Borgnine makes no secret of the fact that he doesn't approve of Hackman being in charge of the group. I suspect that this is partly down to the fact that he's got a bit of an inferiority complex with Hackman and partly down to his police roots (he was probably used to ordering people around). The kid was annoying in the early stages, but he actually proved to be quite an integral part of the team which was great to watch.As well as being majorly intense and incredibly entertaining, the Poseidon Adventure is also incredibly moving. In fact, the only times that the film loses a little bit of momentum is when it shows snippets from other individuals that are trapped on the boat. This isn't a criticism as even on the occasions when it's not focused on the team escaping the boat there are still many emotional and moving moments. That's what I loved about this film, it seemed that no matter what it was doing it was doing it right. It was intense, the performances were good (particularly from Hackman & Borgnine) and the chemistry between the cast as a whole was superb. In summary, The Poseidon Adventure is intense and brilliant and a first rate survival film that is well worth checking out."
107,"Irwin Allen produced this all-star disaster yarn about a luxury cruise ship that is overturned by a freak tidal wave on New Year's Eve, and the survivor's desperate attempts at survival, as they try to reach safety and eventual rescue through the top(well,the bottom now!) of the ship.Cast includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Roddy McDowall, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, Shelley Winters, and Leslie Nielsen as the Captain.Well directed by Ronald Neame, this film works despite the contrived premise because of the cast and interesting script, which balances seriousness with humor effectively, with many memorable scenes."
108,"Without question one of the all-time, most exciting adventure films ever made. What stands out particularly about this classic is that it was made long before things such as blue screen and computer graphic imaging reared their ugly heads. All of the startling and captivating effects in this film were accomplished by actually turning sets upset down, outlandish stunts and highly creative production design that gives the audience a first hand feeling of an upside down ocean liner bobbing on the high seas.The POSEIDON ADVENTURE is the grand daddy of the disaster film. In addition to it's eye popping effects it sails on the merits of its first rate cast. Jack Albertson and Shelly Winters are perfect foils as a retired married couple, Red Buttons exudes pathos and great likability as the shy loner, Ernest Borgnine unleashes bravado and fury as the stubborn New York cop who continues to oppose preacher Gene Hackman every step of the way throughout their escape attempt to the ships' hull.Hackman is also very strong playing a role completely opposite of the no holds barred Poppeye Doyle in the FRENCH CONNECTION however with equal fervor and determination as he seeks to deliver his desperate band to safety. A young Pamelue Sue Martin pines for Hackman while her younger brother Eric Shea provides some timely laughs along with ship board knowledge.Director Ronald Neame does a superb job navigating his actors around the real ship the Queen Mary docked in Long Beach, California however, through camera effects the ship appears to be cruising the far reaches of the ocean. Neame creates terrific suspense and packages a wonderful twisty, adventure. The POSEIDON ADVENTURE has developed cult status because it is such a thrilling and exciting story brought to life by gut wrenching special effects, top notch performances and a wonderful story from writer Paul Galico's original novel. Don't miss it."
109,"As a very enjoyable film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has held up very well over the years, and is still a great film in this era of CGI everything. Great, well-developed characters, a great story, and great sets. Oh, and some interesting lessons on surviving a maritime disaster.Many, many years ago when ""The Poseidon Adventure"" came out, I was a freshman in college. As part of a Navy ROTC class we were studying survival at sea. Wrapping up the topic, our Navy instructor took us to see ""The Poseidon Adventure"" at the local theater. We watched the movie armed with notepads, pens, and flashlights (and yes, the theater management was okay with the flashlights). Our assignment was to on the left side of the page note everything that the characters ""did right"" while trying to escape the ship, and on the right side of the page note everything the characters did wrong. The following class period we turned in our notes and we proceeded to dissect ""The Poseidon Adventure"", and it did very well! Overall, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" ended up being an excellent instructional tool. Obviously, that wasn't its purpose, but it was such a well-crafted story and film that it went beyond entertainment, and reached a much higher level.And now, more than 40 year later I look back on ""The Poseidon Adventure"" as a wonderful example of the art of film making, and a wonderful way to spend roughly two hours. Okay, time to pop the Blu-ray into the player for another viewing."
110,"Although it wasn't a very long-lived (let alone highly praised) genre, the disaster film was a prominent phenomenon on the Hollywood scene during a fair chunk of the 1970s (and would be revived again in the closing years of the 20th century and on into the 21st). The standard line about disaster films is that involved a large group of people, usually big-name stars, caught up in either a natural or man-made cataclysm who must do everything they can to survive. And during the 1970s, no one in Hollywood personified this peculiar genre more than producer Irwin Allen. While he had been known during the 1960s for such TV sci-fi series as ""Time Tunnel"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"", it was in the following decade that he became known as the Master Of Disaster. And it was with his 1972 production THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE that he earned that nickname.The situation involves the aging steamship liner S.S. ""Poseidon"" on its final voyage from New York to Athens as New Year's Eve approaches. They have managed to navigate through a severe storm on the Mediterranean Sea, but the ship's new owner's representative (Fred Sadoff) then forces the captain (Leslie Nielsen) to order a full-ahead on the ship's speed, even though not enough ballast has been taken on to allow it to proceed safely. This proves to be its undoing, as a severe earthquake in the sea off of Crete has just generated a massive tsunami. At one minute past midnight on New Year's Eve, that tsunami nails the ""Poseidon""; and the all-star cast inside the ship's main lounge finds the world going upside down as the wave turns the ship completely over. Many of the survivors still hold out hope for Nielsen and the crew to save them, but those hopes turn out to be totally unrealistic as the sea pours right in on them. However, one group of survivors, led by a very rebellious priest (Gene Hackman), has made a determined effort to get up towards the hull of the overturned liner. Even that is not without its complications, as Hackman frequently must put up with the belligerence of a New York cop (Ernest Borgnine) who isn't convinced of the validity of Hackman's plan. Even as they make their way slowly but surely through the ship's interior, every deck of the ship behind them keeps getting flooded; and they pass another group of survivors heading for the ship's bow (an unwise move, as the bow turns out to be under the water by that point). It becomes a struggle, as they are reduced to only six by the time everything is settled.By 21st century standards, notably when compared to films like 1997's TITANIC or 2008's POSEIDON (the latter of which is basically a reworking of this film), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is admittedly dated. The soap opera theatrics that were such a part of the genre in its 1970s incarnation are very much in evidence here, accompanied by some overacting a bit too much shouting on the parts of Hackman and Borgnine, who are otherwise quite good. And there are liable to be a lot of people who will point out that the special effects, which gave this film one of its two Oscar wins (the other was for Best Song, ""The Morning After""), are now painfully old-fashioned in the wake of CGI. And yet this film, for whatever flaws it may have, and however predictable the death scenes may be, still packs a sizable punch in terms of tension and suspense; and John Williams' score presages some of the things he'd later do for JAWS and JAWS 2. The cast includes, among others, Pamela Sue Martin, Carol Lynley, Eric O'Shea, and Arthur O'Connell, all of whom are fairly well directed by Englishman Ronald Neame, whose previous credits had included 1966's A MAN COULD GET KILLED, and GAMBIT. Credit should still also go to effects masters L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers for their work, which still holds up fairly well to scrutiny, especially once one accepts the effects for what they were at the time.Few critics have ever given the disaster film genre the time of day; and fewer still have any patience anymore for a film like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. That being said, however, it manages to deliver a lot in two hours for a $5 million cost; and given that so many 21st century spectacles cost forty times that much with less real substance, that is still quite an accomplishment."
111,"Today it seems that every third movie leans on CGI to a point at which the term ""special effects"" has little meaning--but there was a time, and not so very long ago, when the words had a very literal meaning. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, loosely based on the novel by Paul Gallico, was very special indeed. So much so that it was not simply a movie. It was an event.The film's fame is such that the story is extremely well known. An aging passenger liner, the Poseidon, is making a final voyage at an unsafe speed and with insufficient ballast. Shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve it encounters a ninety foot tidal wave and capsizes, leaving a handful of survivors to fight their way to the only point in the hull from which rescue might come.The opening sections of the film, during which we meet various passengers, was filmed aboard the Queen Mary. Once we enter the Grand Salon for New Year's Eve festivities, however, every set has been constructed to full size. There are no CGI effects, no rear projections, and (with the exception of long shots of the ship itself) there are no miniatures. The cast works exclusively in the middle of tangible effects, and then as now, the result is remarkably disturbing. It looks real because it is real.And it is really that sense of reality that puts THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE at the forefront of its genre. Disaster films have been popular since the silent era, but THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was virtually without precedent in 1972. It is difficult to convey the visual shock the film had in its first theatrical release. People screamed and jolted in their seats, and when the ship capsized the entire audience leaned to the right, clutching at their arm rests and each other. You left the theatre physically drained, your conversation laced with nervous laughter.It is true that the film's dialogue is more than a little corny, but this was indeed made at a time when children still said 'No, Sir' and 'Yes, Ma'am;' the film reflects its era, and many viewers were as shocked by the profanity as they were by the special effects. But whatever the film's shortcomings in terms of dialogue, there can no dispute about the plot: this is one movie that really moves, and with such speed and logic that you can barely catch your breath.The cast reads very much like a Who's Who of acclaimed actors of the day. Leading man Gene Hackman was fresh from his Oscar-winning performance in THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, and Red Buttons were all former Oscar winners. Carol Lynley received heavy-weight critical acclaim in earlier films and Stella Stevens was the popular star of many light comedies--and gave the performance of career when she stood her image on its head. Jack Albertson and Roddy McDowell were noted character actors, and even comparatively minor roles such as the ship's captain and chaplain went to such notables as Leslie Neilson and Arthur O'Connell. Together they make the unlikely nature of the story seem entirely plausible.The recently released ""Special Edition"" DVD cannot, sadly, compensate for the loss of the big screen--but that aside it is really quite fine. The print is virtually pristine, and while the sound is a bit lacking it is solid enough to make me wonder at those who complain. The bonus material is also very good, including considerable ""Making Of"" information, brief interviews with surviving members of the cast, thoughts about iconographic subtext, and story board samples. The commentary track by director Ronald Neame is both informative and entertaining, and while the commentary track by Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and Pamela Sue Martin is somewhat spotty it is enjoyable none the less. Recommended as a classic of its kind.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
112,"They don't make 'em like this anymore.The Titanic was alright but... even amazing modern special effects couldn't help it compare to this film.It tugged at my heart strings in the first half hour... It sets the scene and character development and stuff... in the first half hour. It sets the mood and builds meaning in the first half hour. Then the disaster itself happens within like 1 minute. It doesn't draw it out and try to over dramatise anything. Its dramatic enough. Its also quite horrific and chilling i thought.. people falling to their deaths and getting squashed to death and loved ones dying... Its pretty hardcore.I love films like this :) Just really well made and well acted and well written and doesn't cheesify stuff.They managed to fit a few laughs in there too.. And there's thankfully very few ""OMG NO!!!!!I'm NOT DOING THAT!!!"" women who you just know are going to die and just annoy you. In fact the only character who i can remember as being annoying like that was Ernest borgnine's(sp) character, but thankfully he isn't overly annoying.Just a great film. I love finding an old classic like this on TV which I've never seen before."
113,"I recall everything about this movie. I was 12 at the time and this has to be my 1st true epic film that comes to mind. The publicity was great (TV Trailers and movie previews) I remember scanning the movie ads in the newspaper awaiting its release at the local movie house. It was a great family event too. I recall the theater being sold out for weeks at a time and see the crowd surrounding the building! This was a time when Panavision was still a big deal. The movie seemed so real mainly because of the music, sound and wide screen effect. The tidal wave seemed so real it appeared to ingulf the theater! I recall Shelly Winters on the Merv Griffin show I think she was describing how she had to put on so much weight because she wanted the part so bad. Wise choice! I recall mom saying you know she was once a very beautiful slim and trim starlet in the 1940's? I was shocked to say the least. I loved this movie so much I still have my ViewMaster slides on it! This was when there wasn't all this new computer animated special-effects junk we see now a days. There actually some of the best men and women stunt people used for those horrific scenes! I once had the behind-the-scenes book about the making of the movie but it has disappeared. However, when I saw the VHS I grabbed it and have worshipped it since! I couldn't stand to hear critics snub this movie. It made hundreds if not thousands of people happy and I am glad to say I was once of them!"
114,"To even compare this movie to Titanic is an insult to movie-goers everywhere.  Titanic isn't even in the same league as The Poseidon Adventure.  Titanic's acting is like an elementary school play compared to Gene Hackman and his castmates.  And unlike Titanic, with Poseidon Adventure, you actually root FOR the survivors.  I don't know anyone that wouldn't have preferred that Rose went down with the Titanic along with Jack.  The only thing Titanic beats Poseidon on is the special effects, and you certainly can't fault it for that.  For its time, The Poseidon Adventure stretched the limits of the technology far more that Titanic during its mid 90s shooting.  My only bad memories of The Poseidon Adventure, and this is not its fault, is its sequel.  Not only was Beyond... a horrible movie, but it ruins the first movie.  Suddenly rather than a huge disaster where only 6 people make it out alive, and only because they listened to Reverend Scott, we find that many more made it without his help.  It just doesn't have the same feeling after seeing the sequel.  (And why did the rescue team just leave after finding 6 survivors?  They couldn't stay awhile longer looking for more?)"
115,"It's one of those films that has EVERYTHING. Gripping adventure scenes, non-stop crises, drama, cheese, hotpants on TWO of the main stars, Shelly Winters' underwater underwear exposure, Ernest Borgnine (anything with Ernest Borgnine is good), fabulous characters, tension, really sad scenes, heroes, heroines, death, growth, love, understanding, go-go boots, cliches, ""There's Got To Be A Morning After"", a kid who looks like Bobby Brady, Red Buttons... the list goes on and on...If you like movies that have EVERYTHING, check out ""Groupie Girl"" (a.k.a. ""I Am A Groupie"") and ""The Vikings."""
116,This is hands down the best of disaster movies and I have loved this for my whole life amd this is no aception this is with 15 academy award winners Nd being a you a never gets old movie with great characters with these movies dont usually give you. You have great story telling great fire that is all real bo effects in this movie. It's directed good and acting is good at ti.es it's overacted at times but it's still a good movie but their are flaws but it's still great I'm not iterated this film every film has its flaws and as I get older I know their are flaws but it is still great I still love this and abalutly I give this a 10/10
117,"Here we actually have a well made and entertaining disaster film. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" contains moments of tension and suspense as the survivors of the cruise ship wreck attempt to reach safety and against overwhelming odds.... Most of the time, the leading man or lady isn't required to act very much. They are required to look either brave or frightened. In this case, Gene Hackman made his character - a maverick priest - a multi-dimensional one. He doesn't feel he is any more brave or heroic than the average person. He never forgets the terrible task that he is faced with, as leader of the survivors on board the cruise liner. A great performance. Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters give the best performances in the supporting cast. The screenplay is a lot better than films of this kind usually are. The director Ronald Neame sensibly allows the audience to know the backgrounds of all the main characters before disaster strikes. The introduction of all the characters helps to give them much needed shading. Everything about this film looks frighteningly real. The fact that the ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was directed by an Englishman can't make it that bad a film! This is the definitive disaster film by a long way."
118,"This flick is entirely engrossing, and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Very entertaining.The performances were great.  Over the top?  Sure!  It's an adventure film for crying out loud!  But the whole cast was believable in the context of the movie.  Everyone had something to offer.  Carol Lynley played having a nervous breakdown to the hilt.  Stella Stevens was sexy and saucy as the ex-hooker.  Gene Hackman intense as the crusading preacher.  Borgnine showing a full range from tough to showing his weakness.  And one more thing.  To the people who have had nothing good to say of Shelly Winters, their full of crap.  Her performance was nothing less than touching and heartfelt, and she deserved the Oscar nomination.As for the effects, considering the film was made in 1972, the scene where it turns over is still pretty awesome.People can't go in being all critical and looking to find things wrong with it, comparing it to modern day technology.  Open up and loose the cynical outlook.A classic disaster flick full of great conflict!"
119,"A New Year's Eve celebration is interrupted aboard the S.S.Poseidon, when the passenger ship is hit by a 90 foot tidal wave and is turned topsy turvy. The capsized vessel is now the scene of a lot of heartache and mind bending struggle to survive.A priest(Gene Hackman)does his best to lead a group of survivors from the upside down grand ballroom to the only logical escape from the propeller shaft, now above the water line.Along the way, many obstacles challenge the group. Fire and debris need to be sidetracked and conquered. Plus the rising water floods the compartments behind them. An elderly, overweight former swimming champion(Shelley Winters)helps guide the survivors under water to stay ahead of the flooding waters.Some of the best dialogue comes from an ex-prostitute(Stella Stevens). She does her best to keep her new husband(Ernest Borgnine), a gregarious New York cop in line. He seems to be the groups main detractor. Miss Stevens also happens to serve as eye candy. WOW!Plenty of nail biting action. Plus the personal drama between the diverse characters in doubt of their rescue, makes for a very involving film. Your attention is grabbed and held for the little over two hours runtime.Hackman and Winters are stellar in their performances. Also featured in this all star cast are: Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, Carol Lynley and Eric Shea."
120,"From director Ronald Neame (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), this is possibly one of, if not the most well known and well loved disaster movies of all time, up there with The Towering Inferno. Basically S.S. Poseidon is a cruise ship travelling from New York to Athens, and all the passengers are getting ready to celebrate the New Year. But then disaster strikes when a gigantic tidal wave hits the ship, killing Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) and the bridge crew, and turning the ship upside down, with some passengers also being killed. The surviving passengers, led by Rev. Frank Scott (BAFTA winning Gene Hackman) decide to start climbing upwards to reach the engine room and the propeller shaft. While a few passengers stay behind and suffer their decision, the passengers climbing include Det. Lt. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and wife Linda (Stella Stevens), James Martin (Red Buttons), Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), Acres (Roddy McDowall), husband and wife Belle (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Shelley Winters) and Manny Rosen (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Jack Albertson), and brother and sister Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and Robin Shelby (Eric Shea). As they climb they encounter explosions, passing other surviving passengers, water flooding in and upwards, and some of the group being killed by the continuing destruction, but in the end, six of the group are rescued. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""The Morning After"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and the Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. With a fantastic cast, Hackman of course standing out from the rest, and filled with all the tricks to keep you gripped, it is a highly watchable classic. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""The Morning After"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Gene Hackman was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!"
121,"This rather alarming film stars a young Gene Hackman in as about as bad a performance as he ever gave. Of course, his character  -- a self-described ""renegade"" preacher -- is about the most arrogant, pretentious, bullying nitwit ever passed off as an adventure hero. The preacher's bellowing hostility and vicious emotional manipulation might have been something interesting and different if the script didn't seem so unaware that the character is, well, a jerk. The other male characters are pretty much stock types, though the always-reliable Roddy McDowall as a hapless ship worker is dignified and touching.The women do even worse than the men -- among them are a bitchy ex-hooker, a starry-eyed teenager with a crush on the boorish preacher, and a hot-pantsed halfwit of a lounge singer who frequently becomes paralyzed with terror and has to be comforted in the manly arms of Red Buttons.The single female character with any depth at all is Shelley Winters' sweet Jewish grandma, whose swim through the flooded propellor room ultimately makes it possible for the others to be saved. A generation of unkind jokes aside, her sensible, brave performance is the best thing in this very silly movie."
122,"This film trudges forward solely on the power of a truly annoying set of characters, most of whom are filled with self-pity from start to finish, and none of whom seem particularly worthy of surviving the disaster. Everyone screams, everyone whines, everyone complains, and everyone moves slower than molasses to escape drowning at the top (bottom) of a capsized cruise ship. One main character (Nonnie) remains almost catatonic throughout the entire film, much like the plot. Heavily dated in the early 1970's. Only worth watching Leslie Nielsen as the caption until the boat capsizes. From then on this film is a disaster. Rating: 2/10 for Nielsen and sets/special effects that are impressive for the period."
123,"badly written, poorly acted, cardboard characters and more fun than a bunch of castaways stranded from their boating accident.Which is the most ridiculous part of this movie1.  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants? 2.  Carol Lynley asking Red Buttons if he liked her dead brother's music as his body lies in her arms? 3.  Ernest Borgnine marrying prostitute Stella Stevens? 4.  Stella Stevens walking in ripped clothing and high heels? 5.  Shelley Winters climbing a Christmas Tree? 6.  Shelley Winters acting as a beached whale after she dies? 7.  Shelley Winters getting an Oscar Nomination? 8.  A tidal wave in the Mediterranean?this is a no-miss hit and wonder, much more entertaining than Earthquake or Towering Inferno"
124,"""Peter Pan I'm NOT!"" says Shelley Winters' character after getting a nice shove on her bottom from Gene Hackman while climbing a Christmas tree. I think the mere fact that there are 22 pages of reviews for this movie speaks volumes. All movies become dated after so many years. But that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this one. It's great to see these actors in their prime giving it their all under trying conditions. No CGI or stunt doubles here - they did it all (or most of it). As a kid, I remember watching Shelley on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson describing the movie. You could tell she was so proud of the movie and her work in it. They showed the clip of her swimming underwater and you knew right then you HAD to see this movie. Yes I'd like more diverse actors/characters and the kid is annoying. But I agree with an earlier reviewer that there are more interesting characters and back stories in this movie than Titanic. Yes there are implausibilities, yes there is scenery chewing dialogue, but who cares? There are also some poignant moments and you've got all these fabulous actors being drenched and beat to hell climbing to the bottom of an upside down cruise ship! Who will make it/who won't? It's 1972 American movie making, and you are there, so grab some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle."
125,"The other one was the original AIRPORT. As I said before, this is a genre that ended up caricaturing itself, and the two great movies that spawned it got a bad reputation because of it. This movie, along with its predecessor AIRPORT did not deserve its bad press. This movie took its time in telling the story and gave you a chance to know the characters so that you cared what happened to them. That is something, from what I heard, that Wolfgang Petersen's remake failed at miserably. I'm glad I didn't see it.I spotted a lot of religious symbolism in this movie. A ship turned upside down meaning a world turned upside down and everyone who tries to follow the way to life is mocked and scorned. Interesting that the one who tried to lead a handful of people to life was a rebellious priest. Also, the standing up of the Christmas tree conjured up an interesting image. Seeing Rev. Scott shouldering the tree looked a lot to me like Jesus carrying His cross. Also, only a few survived, implying the Bible's prediction that in the end, only a few will make it into heaven. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I couldn't help but see that kind of symbolism in the story.Still, a great movie. My only gripe, and I am by no means a prude, as you will see by reading some of my other reviews, but they overdid it a bit with the use of profanity. After a while, hearing people scream things like, ""This is no g--d--engine room!"" and ""Where the hell are we?"" every fourth word got a bit tiresome. As I said, I'm no prude, but some of it seemed unnecessary. After all, General Patton wasn't on that ship. But it told the story very well and, just as you thought you could relax a bit and catch your breath from all the excitement because you didn't think anything else would happen, the ship would explode or spring another leak and then all unreconstructed upside down hell would break loose again. It never completely let you relax. You were always vigilant for the next thing to happen, and that is good story telling.Another gripe of mine is I have not been able to find the soundtrack to this movie. It's an early one by the great John Williams, and I can't believe you can't buy this on CD. The main title theme brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it, and then there's the MORNING AFTER song that Marueen McGovern made a monster hit back in 1972. If someone knows where I can find this soundtrack, please post a note on this site and let me know. Otherwise, great movie! Ignore the bad rap. 9 out of 10."
126,"The Poseidon Adventure was one of the first, and one of the best disaster movies.A luxury liner sinks slowly beneath the waves as we follow a small band of survivors attempting to make their escape, led by Rev Scott (Gene Hackman). The Rogos are a squabbling couple of cop and former hooker (Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens); Acres is a member of the ship's staff (Roddy McDowell); the Rosens are a devoted couple (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters); Susan and Robin are the token children (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea); and Nonnie (Carol Lynley) is a singer hired to entertain the rich passengers on New Year's Eve.Special effects are pretty good, from the actual crash and impact at the New year party, to the set pieces throughout. Guessing who makes it to the end is fun, and the acting (especially that of Hackman, Borgnine, Winters, and Red Buttons as the token good guy) is very good indeed.A corker of a film."
127,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a good but not great flick of the genre that I call ""Disaster"" films because the action revolves around the characters surviving a life threatening disaster.  This film builds suspense rather nicely and somehow manages to pull you into the story.  Gene Hackman is a bit annoying as a bizarre preacher.  Some of the things his character says don't seem like anything a real person would say.  There is a bit of this problem with some of the other main characters also who on occasion have some inane dialogue, not to mention some of the passengers who  seem like your typical stupid herd of victims type caricatures.  Despite these annoyances, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is watchable and worth seeing at least once.  I'd rate it 83.0/100."
128,"This is a truly entertaining disaster flick. I've seen it 5 or 6 times since it came out and never got tired of it. Even though I liked «Titanic» too, I would watch «The Poseidon Adventure» again before.Out of 100, I gave it 83."
129,"What I found most interesting about The Poseidon Adventure was that the point of the movie and the point of the the book are diametrically opposed. **WARNING-SPOILERS AHEAD** In the movie everyone who stayed behind died. In the book they are all saved, in fact one of them is still drinking from his bottle of champagne and dressed in his evening clothes while the followers of the Reverend are in tatters and covered in oil and slime. The little boy, who is saved in the movie wanders off and just disappears half way into the book. The novelist, Paul Gallico, also wrote all of the Mrs. 'Arris goes wherever novels. I think that he and Irwin Allen had vastly disparate views on how the universe operates."
130,"From the start there is no doubt about what is going to happen; we are told that The Poseidon will meet disaster and only a few of those on board will survive... the question is who and how. In the opening scenes we are introduced to various key characters; Rev Scott, a priest who believes that God helps those who help themselves; Mike Rogo, a New York cop, and his wife Linda; Belle and Manny Rosen, a couple going to see their grandson; teenager Susan and younger brother Robin, who are travelling alone; Singer Nonnie Parry and some crew members.Then as everybody celebrates New Year's Eve there is an earthquake of Crete which causes a massive Tsunami. When it strikes the ship quickly turns turtle, killing many people. Survivors in the dining room are advised by the ship's purser to stay where they are and wait for rescue; Rev Scott believes that to survive they must head upwards to the engine room; now the highest point in the ship, also the location where the hull is thinnest. He is joined by the people we were introduced to earlier and as they proceed they meet various difficulties which not all of them will survive.The seventies are the decade associated with disaster movies and this is one of the best know examples. The genre may have got stale fairly quickly but this film still feels surprisingly fresh. The opening introductions don't go on too long but still manages to tell us enough about each of the key characters. The disaster itself is impressively shot with great special effects that make the viewer believe the characters really are in an inverted ship. The various problems they encounter keep things very tense and lead to some poignant moments. The way the characters argue about the best course of action feels realistic... although the precocious boy who seems to know everything about the ship is more than a little annoying at times. The cast does an impressive job and includes many famous actors; most notably Gene Hackman as Scott and Ernest Borgnine as Mike Rogo. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of the disaster genre but it is also worth watching if you like a good tense drama."
131,"The so-called ""Master of Disaster"", Irwin Allen, was the genius behind this very early entry into that popular 1970s genre known as the all-star ""disaster film"". And ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an acceptable bit of escapism. Based on the novel by Paul Gallico, and scripted by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, it tells of a luxury cruise liner crossing the Atlantic on New Years' Eve. An underwater earthquake causes MASSIVE tidal waves to occur, including the one that causes the ship to capsize. It's up to a limited number of cast members to make it to the bottom (now the top) of the ship, and hopefully escape.As directed by Ronald Neame, who also guided ""Meteor"", a late entry into the genre, this is solidly entertaining, even with its flaws. Admittedly, the characters' introductory sequences ARE pretty bad, and there are too many of them here who are required to spend their time being annoying, or abrasive, or both. It does take a while for the film to grab a hold of its viewers, but once the wave hits, and the action kicks in (about a third of the way through), it becomes pretty watchable. Just don't spend too much time thinking about it, and it works fairly well.Kudos to production designer William J. Creber and cinematographer Harold E. Stine for creating a ""Hell on Earth"" vision for our survivors to endure. You're not always convinced you're seeing upside down sets, but you may be amused regardless. John Williams' music adds the right rousing touch.The cast is saddled with some bad dialogue and some characters who are ridiculous at times, but they do their best. Gene Hackman is the hero, an irreverent priest, and Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, Shelley Winters, Pamela Sue Martin, and Eric Shea play the imperiled passengers. Roddy McDowall and Leslie Nielsen are among the ships' crew. Nielsen, still a good eight years away from his career reinvention with ""Airplane!"", is solid as a rock as the too briefly seen captain.This is agreeable mindless entertainment that actually kills an hour and 57 minutes in a reasonably paced fashion. It can boast an Oscar winning song, in any event: ""The Morning After"".Followed by a sequel seven years later.Eight out of 10."
132,"""At midnight on New Year's Eve, the S.S. Poseidon, enroute (sic) from New York to Athens, met with disaster and was lost. There were only a handful of survivors. This is their story"" introduces this magnum opus from Irwin Allen. The fantastical science-fiction TV series producer rode a wave through the 1970s, until ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" finally sank as the decade closed. It was a great ride...""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the grand-daddy of the newly christened ""disaster film"" genre, and one of the best. From his space adventure TV programs, Mr. Allen gets Johnny Williams to compose a thrillingly appropriate soundtrack. A veteran of ""Lost in Space"" and future ""Star Wars"" traveler, Mr. Williams always scores. A cast of familiar faces, and three sets of shapely female legs, contribute memorably for Mr. Allen and director Ronald Neame... Amid the shipwreck, plus-sized Shelley Winters (as Belle Rosen) literally defines what a ""Best Supporting Actress"" characterization does for a film. The special effects still look terrific. Pop some popcorn and enjoy the voyage! ********* The Poseidon Adventure (12/12/72) Ronald Neame ~ Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons"
133,"This and ""Airport"" two years earlier helped make the disaster movie a staple of 1970's filmmaking. It's also the movie that got Irwin Allen's career going in a big way, before it sputtered out a few years later. In it, on New Year's Eve, a ship captained by Leslie Nielson is turned upside down by a rogue tidal wave which kills most of the extras. Nearly everyone The star-studded cast of survivors must climb up the ship before it sinks entirely and must undergo some terrifying risks to survive. I'm not saying this is any kind of masterpiece. Most of the story isn't hugely believable, but it's plausible and entertaining, thanks to the solid special effects, talented actors, and the enthusiasm that went into the project. If you're in the mood for a disaster movie, this is one of the better ones."
134,"This is one of those movies I guess you could compare to comfort food. It's always the same and it's nice to know it's there. Its story, about a luxury liner that is capsized by a tidal wave leaving a group of survivors to travel 'up to the bottom' of the ship to escape, is known to most people. For some reason, the 70's was the golden era of disaster movies and I think The Poseidon Adventure ushered that age in. It's not really hard to see why, as it's a very efficient and entertaining film.Some folks consider this flick a camp classic, and I suppose I can understand why that might be so to a certain extent – there are some hokey scenes and silly dialogue such as the 'did you like his music' exchange. While the likes of Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine seem to be competing against each other to see who can chew up the most scenery, such is their over-acting. None of this hurts the film though, it's all for the greater good. It also makes me chuckle to think that the most ridiculous screen couple in cinematic history – Martin and Nonnie – actually couldn't bear each other in real-life, and only inter-acted when they had to shoot a scene. In addition it is an absolute impossibility to watch Leslie Nielsen as the captain of the ship without thinking of his comic turn in the disaster movie spoof Airplane!Despite all this the movie works as a good adventure film. The setting of the up-turned ship is great, and is used to good effect. There are a number of nicely staged set-pieces throughout that ensure that the pace never gets bogged down. The New Year's Eve aspect also works in its favour as it ensures the movie will always be a festive season staple, which certainly adds to its overall appeal. It's still a fairly derivative film in many ways though and its characters do seem to fill certain clearly defined roles. You know Stella Stevens character is doomed the instant she mocks Shelley Winters for being fat. And as for the young boy? His unconcerned incessant upbeat chat was, I suppose, meant to reflect the innocence of youth but really it made you actually think that he was either moderately autistic or annoying beyond belief; my guess was it was probably the latter and I wouldn't have blamed the group if they had decided to throw him in the sea.Overall, a good bit of escapist hokum."
135,"The Poseidon Adventure is and will always be my all time favorite film.I remember seeing it when I was a young boy at the Avalon movie theater at Kings Highway in Brooklyn. My parents and I sat in the balcony in Dec of 1972. The Gene Hackman Rev Scott character still has a tremendous effect on me, as his journey is quite a powerful one. I guess why I like the character so much is that he Questioned, which is what America was also doing at the time dealing with the aftermath of the Vietman conflict the year it was released. Ronald Neame who directed the film does a great job on the DVD extra's with his unique commentary. Its a must listen too. Personally I would love to see the film once again on the big screen and have gone as far as requesting it as a submission to the Clearview classic series which runs at the Zegfield movie theater in NYC a few times a year. I actually taped a tribute to this film and other disaster films on my radio podcast show on my site-entertainmenttodayandbeyond.com Im really proud of it! The Poseidon Adventure is the one film that I never tire of, and find it fascinating ever time I watch it!"
136,"Thirty years and two remakes have not diminished the quality of 1972's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE an exciting and emotionally charged actioner that initiated a new genre of movie-making in the 70's known as the ""disaster"" film. The film follows what happens when an ocean liner is capsized by a 90 foot tidal wave, turned completely upside down, and follows the handful of survivors who try to get the bottom (or top) of the ship before it sinks completely. Maybe the special effects look cheap compared to the effects in the remakes, but what this movie has that the remakes lack is heart and characters you care about: Gene Hackman as the priest doubting his faith Ernest Borgnine as the cop married to ex-prostie Stella Stevens; Red Buttons as the lonely haberdasher; Caroly Lynley as the emotionally distraught lounge singer; Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters as the aging Jewish couple en route to meet their grandchild for the first time; Pamela Sue Martin and Christopher Shea as the brother and sister en route to a reunion with their parents. Irwin Allen somehow has managed to make an exciting film rich with characters you come to care about and make you hope for them to come out of this alive. Many have tried to duplicate and imitate, but this is the granddaddy of them all that is still as fun to get wrapped up in as it was 25 years ago."
137,"In 1970 we had airport. It was the first to usher in the ""Disaster movie"" era. It took the action of the bond movies of the time and tweaked it to more realistic levels and placed regular people into extreme situations.Poseidon Adventure was the next. It was made ina time when we didn't mind hearing and seeing the dynamics of the different characters. We had more of an attention span than we dotoday. It was brain as well as eye candy that we thought about after it was over. We talked about the cool effects back then as well as now, but the human element is lacking in most action flicks today. See it for what it is and don't compare it to anything else."
138,"Ok, ""Titanic"" was based (very, very, very loosely) on a ""true"" story. The whole romance thing ruined it. Who wants to sit and watch two people whine for three hours?In ""The Poseidon Adventure"" there are people who CAN act, and they have real characters. It seems more true to life. OK, you have to realize it is a '70s movie, but at least it is possible to get involved with the characters. In suffering through ""Titanic"" all I wanted to do was slap everyone and tell them to grow up.Watch ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and donate ""Titanic"" to your local video store."
139,"This is the best of the Disaster genre. I own this movie and watch it at least twice a month. The movie tells the tale of a group of people that have survived the turning over of their ocean liner. It shows you their trek through the ship. The thing I like about this movie is that it lets you get to know all the characters and then BANG they die one by one untill there are only a few left when the movie ends. This is a MUST see for all who love action, adventure, love and DISASTER."
140,"2001 - One of the most trite, overacted, poorly directed things I've seen. Shelley is such a ham (theatrically and physiologically). Anyone with half a brain would close each and every watertight door they passed through on the way to the top (bottom). If indeed somehow the ship stayed afloat, it would have sunk in a couple of minutes after all the entrapped air, which provided the only buoyancy, escaped through the giant hole they cut in the hull - but we saw not a whisper come out!Revised 5/06 - Just saw snippets of this on TV. It is worse than I remembered. It is such a technical disaster. Possibly OK for anyone who has never been to sea. It was amazing how they could walk around on the ceilings. In fact, they would have to crawl almost everywhere - as the ceilings are covered with lights, pipes, wires, ceiling tiles, sprinkler pipes, etc, etc, etc.And where did all that light come from? Was the ships generator still running, or were there giant batteries (upside down) powering everything?"
141,Way better than titanic. Heaps better stunts too especially upside down
142,This was and still is an excellent movie. 48 years later and it's still a pure classic One of the best disaster movies of all time
143,"Near Cape Farewell, Greenland December 1942 Paul Gallico, the highest paid magazine writer in the United States, may have been a passenger on the 'Mary' when she was struck by the rogue wave. Cosmopolitan magazine had sent him off to Europe to be their war correspondent. Years later he wrote a best-selling book about a luxury liner that turned turtle in mid-ocean. Hollywood bought the film rights and it became a blockbuster movie called 'The Poseidon Adventure'. The 'Queen Mary' had just 5"" before it would have capsized with 11,339 passengers and crew perishing in the frigid waters. It could have been the worst trajedy of our lifetime - the greatest sea disaster of all time."
144,"This is, by leaps and bounds, the greatest Disaster Movie of all time!The difference is that you truly connect with the characters and feel what they feel as the film goes along. Their losses become your losses. Right up to the end, you feel their plight and are fighting for each and every one of them.This is completely different from today's bloodless Disaster Movies like ""2012"" that have tons of disaster, tons of deaths, but you are never exposed to a single one of them. It's like you're playing a video game, get killed and get to resume play, without a thought of what just happened. This extends to today's action films like ""Man of Steel"" where tons of people must be getting killed, but you're not allowed to get anywhere near feeling a thing about it.""The Poseidon Adventure"" even goes far beyond Producer Irwin Allen's other films like ""The Towering Inferno."" There, and in his other films, it's just lots of chaos without connection to the characters. Credit for ""The Poseidon Adventure""s success goes to Director Ronald Neame, Screenwriter Sterling Silliphant, and source novelist Paul Gallico. The acting by the all-star cast is excellent across the board.Supporting the film is John Williams' film score, Harold E. Stein's cinematography, the Production Design and Art Direction, and of course, L.B. Abbott's excellent visual effects!This film set the standard for Disaster Movies, and no one has come close since, and are unlikely to ever.********** (10 out of 10 Stars)"
145,"This movie is a classic! I certainly hope that people put good reviews on this movie! This is an exciting adventure of people trying to escape from a boat that will soon become their underwater coffin. This is something I hope to get on DVD soon, if it's still around. Even if their is some death and scary moments, this is a good movie for the family. This movie however, contains some parts which are boring, and unneeded. It's also a tragedy where many people on the ship die. This could also use a little more action. To make it more exciting and fun. This is way better than The Titanic. This is a fun movie that everyone will probably enjoy, so have lots of fun."
146,"Irwin Allen was a man whose creativity was matched by few others. Not only was he responsible for some of the best TV science fiction during the 1960s – I'm talking LOST IN SPACE and LAND OF THE GIANTS – he also made my favourite disaster movie of all time, THE TOWERING INFERNO. Allen single-handled devised the short-lived boom in disaster movies during the 1970s, along with INFERNO and this. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is another classic, a simple yet epic movie detailing the efforts of a small band of survivors to escape from an upside-down, sinking cruise liner.The first thing that struck me as I sat down to watch this was the budget – or lack of. Many times, the director and creative team cut corners to disguise lack of funds – the climatic scene with the helicopter take-off is a rather poor piece of effects work, while exteriors of the stricken ship are limited to a few dodgy effects. Nevertheless, the lower budget actually works in this film's favour, as we end up sticking closely to the group of central characters, never learning what's going on outside of their inner circle. This gives the film a claustrophobic feel that works well with the plotting. Essentially this is a straightforward action-adventure, detailing visceral survival against the odds as the dwindling survivors cope with explosions, rising water and rickety, destroyed scenery.There's plenty of tension between the group, particularly coming from Ernest Borgnine as the hard-headed complainer. Gene Hackman is the erstwhile hero, a preacher with a neat line in heroics, racking up another strong performance in his career. Character actors like Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall and Shelley Winters round out the rest of the cast, while Stella Stevens brings glamour as the ex-hooker wandering round in stupidly high heels. Along the way, members of the group learn lessons in humanity and life, others discover their inborn hero, and still yet others make huge sacrifices for the good of their fellows. The pacing never flags and excitement and danger are everywhere. While I don't think this quite reaches the heights of THE TOWERING INFERNO, it's nevertheless a classic for good reason – a film that hasn't dated one bit."
147,"This first version of Paul Gallicoe's novel was one of several movies at around the same time which more or less set up a template followed by disaster movies ever since - there is some major disaster (in this case a tidal wave turns the luxury liner Poseidon upside down without sinking it). An intrepid group of survivors sets out to find rescue/salvation, but not all of them survive. What follows is the action/adventure of their quest for survival, and the suspense of guessing who will make it and who won't (see also Airport, The Towering Inferno, Earthquake et al).This is one of the better ones, and not just because it is one of the first. It benefits greatly from the upside down sets, which fire the imagination, and also because the group of survivors are well watched and well cast. Plus, in Gene Hackman's fiery (and unlikely clergyman), it has an excellent lead.I must also put in a word of praise for Carol Lynley's velvet hotpants, which left a profound impression on me, metaphorically speaking."
148,"I just found out this morning that the director ""Ronald Neame"" passed away. The director of one of the best disaster movies ever made.I have always loved this movie and have seen it over and over and over but have never tired of it. There is a reason for this. This movie, with all its cheesy moments, has a human connection. Drama. Unlike that dreadful remake ""Poseidon"" with all its CGI and lack of character development. You actually care about the characters in the original and in one especially, Mrs. Rosen. Her death scene was so overwhelming that it still breaks my heart to this day. ""Poseidon"" has none of this stuff. Its main focus is ""look how elaborate our CGI effects are"". Granted the capsizing scene is very good, but after that....it has nothing else going on for it. Whereas with the original after the capsizing (which I still think is quite impressive without the use of CGI...""Old School"" methods of disaster are best), we had a Christmas tree to use as an escape tool. The remake however? Broken staircase. I could go on and on about how bad the remake is but I wont.This is about Hollywood losing an iconic director who made one hell of a disaster movie to add to his movie credits. A classic that has not faded. The saddest part of this all is that Hollywood is dying as well. Because the directors and producers today don't really focus on the human aspect of situations. Its all about how loud and overdone they can do it.Us old timers who come from a time of good movie making, sits back at watch Hollywood destroy each classic they can get there hands on. Rumour has it ""The Wizard of Oz"" is next. Nothing sacred in Hollywood. Once again I want to say..""Thanks Ronald, for making a classic movie that has held up through all the years...Rest In Peace!"""
149,"For a disaster film this ticks all the right boxes. Although for its time The Poseidon Adventure was seen as a special effects spectacular what is more apparent years later is how well crafted the characters are. For example Gene Hackman plays Reverend Scott who preaches that god only helps those who help themselves, and has a discussion about if that is true with another priest before the wave hits. This is a theme that runs throughout the film as he is the one who persuades a small group to try and climb to the engine room to save themselves leaving lots behind who stay and wait for help. **spoiler!***After several exiting set pieces and a couple of deaths Reverend Scott finally loses it and has it out with god at the end doubting his own theory, and sacrifices himself to save the remaining few. Mr and Mrs Rosen, a happy old couple who you genuinely want to make it through, and the continuing friction between Reverend Scott and Mike Rogo. The quiet man who finds an inner strength to help a petrified and grieving young singer - good characters who are well drawn before the disaster happens. I really think even after all these years The Poseidon Adventure remains the greatest disaster movie of them all. Effects can get better - the remake had great effects but still overall did not come close to this. The sets still look excellent, the effects are still decent and its a thrilling couple of hours of anyones time."
150,The Poseidon Adventure is a 1972 Gene Hackman flick I recall seeing in the early eighties. When re-watching I remembered the scene where the fat lady dies after saving the preacher. This movie is so realistic and striking for it's time. This would have been a very high budget film to make. It was so funny how there was so many shots of the blond hooker in her panties or an ass shot. Like when she's climbing up that one ladder and you can several times easily see her ass cheeks. The kids were cute and I love the ex police officer. Gene Hackman rocks and is awesome as the preacher man. I love the Jewish guy and the foreign girl and redheaded guy. Very well written script. Awesome camera shots and set design. Very realistic and disturbing for a film this old school. But the old movies are always the classics. This film is totally shot on 35mm motion picture film and is edited pretty slickly. I can imagine this film would have grossed very wealthy profits at the box office in 72' when this film was originally released.
151,"You got to start off with the cast on this movie. It's incredible, everyone in here is in excellent form. They're so good, you don't even think about stereotypes in disaster movies. Of course people have made fun of this type of films, but even the more sarcastic ones have to admit, that this movie is damn good! The movie is about a boat on a cruise and of course something bad will happen. And although the visual effects here aren't as good as in the remake (my comment on that under the remake IMDb page), but that doesn't affect the suspense. If you've watched the remake, you'll appreciate this movie much more. Extra-ordinary drama packed in a thriller disaster movie. What else do you need?"
152,"'The Poseidon Adventure' is a quite brilliant film.It has model work - you can see that in the opening shot with the ship.Then John Williams incredibly lush and foreboding score kicks in and we are away in this incredibly exciting and moving film.The passengers are on the last voyage of the SS Poseidon with the captain being pressurised to speed up the ship without taking on ballast.There is a subsea earthquake on New Year's Eve and she's hit by a tidle wave and turned upside down. A handful of passengers led by Reverend Scott are led up to the bottom of the boat. Ronald Neame directs the first and best disaster movie with wonderful attention to visual detail and a spectacular sense of danger. He actually manages to make the audience feel that they are there ! You really care about all the characters whom are beautifully fleshed out by Stirling Silliphant.One thing I noticed -was that when Hackman as Scott and Borgnine as Rogo argue it doesn't seem like an acted scene but a real fatigued row--you wouldn't get that sense of danger today. The demise of three of the major characters is also utterly shocking and brilliantly 'executed'! The performances by Eric Shea, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson,Pamela Sue Martin,Leslie Nielsen,Stella Stevens,Carol Lynley,Roddy McDowall, Ernest Borgnine, Arthur O'Connell and Gene Hackman are incredibly powerful and make this an incredible film going experience."
153,"You can appreciate this classic epic more when you see the totally stupid remake that came out recently. Great acting, suburb special affects -for you younger folk, there's no cgi here- and great story line. Allot of 70's disaster movies have been on cable recently. Most i liked very much as a kid, but movies like Earthquake and Towering Inferno seems pretty lame now that i'm older. But PS still the great movie i remember. Its now being showed on cable in HD and looks and sounds great. For people who thought this was terrible, go back to watching the newer crappy movies like King Kong and Spiderman with there fake looking special affects."
154,"I showed this film to my critical viewing class to introduce a unit on special effects. I wanted to show them how it used to be done--with sweat, guts and imagination. The extras on the DVD provide a wonderful teaching experience and explain many of the stunts. The kids really liked the film. They laughed at Stella Stevens outrageous lines, thought Shelley Winters was annoying until she died saving the whole group and then they got very quiet, and thought that the characters in general were memorable. My lone freshman in the class said it was better than the remake because he felt he got to know the the people more. One thing was mentioned--why were there no fish swimming around in all that ocean water? I guess this comes from showing older films to kids today who look for extreme realism! But all in all, it was a very successful film with today's teens and its a tribute to the film makers of old."
155,"At midnight on New Years Eve the S.S. Poseidon is struck by a 90' tidal wave and is capsized. In a last gasp, a priest ( Gene Hackman) takes a mixed band of survivors on a journey through the bowels of the ship in an attempt to survive.Paving the way for a series of spectacular action-adventure epics throughout the 70's and even spanning a recent remake, The Poseidon Adventure still remains a favorite among audiences everywhere. Gene Hackman leads the all-star cast that includes Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin and Shelly Winters.One of the main themes of this film is faith and trust. For example, the very first example of this is really Susan's ( Pamela Sue Martin) ' leap of faith.' "" Don't be afraid, trust us."" Secondly, Gene Hackman's character is a priest and he is not only a natural leader, but he is also a questioning hero! The best example of this, I can give is the scene where Hackman's character Rev. Scott has a complete look of anguish and grief over his face when the people on the main floor choose to stay.Ernest Borgnine's cop character Rogo, is almost like a parallel to Rev. Scott, almost as if they are the same person, but they simply chose different paths in life and faith. For example, Rogo wants proof. He won't stick his neck out simply on ' blind faith.' Red Buttons, Mr. Martin is pretty much simply a mediator between Rev. Scott and Rogo. In a sense, he is just quite simply a reluctant hero who rises to the occasion. All of us would like to think we would be able to rise to the occasion as well, in the same situation. His relationship with Nonnie (Carol Lynley) is quite interesting. Ironically, they actually disliked each other intensely and refused to have anything to do with each other except when the cameras were rolling.The best scene from the entire film comes after a certain death, and Susan completely losses it."
156,"The Poseidon Adventure is about a cruise ship called the Poseidon.On board are common people with their own everyday life and everyday problem.They're all looking forward to the new year.But little do they know is that by the struck of midnight a Tidal Wave that's huge will tip the ship over.With the ship upside down and a large number of people dead and injured. It's up to a preacher like guy to save as many as he can by climbing up to the bottom of the ship.This movie is pretty good. The special effects are well down even if technology was still primitive back then. Has some suspenseful moments, violence, and a lot of swearing for a movie from 34 years ago.It's worth checking out at the Rental store."
157,"I am not a big fan of disaster movies. Titanic was up until I saw The Poseidon Adventure really the only one I really liked. The Poseidon Adventure is both scary and the affects are amazing, plus the acting is very good. Gene Hackman who is in my opinion a very overrated actor gives what is maybe his best performance in what if you had to make a choice on who the lead is would be it, but it is the amazing Shelley Winters that is the standout. She is wonderful in her roll as a fat older woman who is going to visit her new grandchild for the first time. The direction is also fine but it is the visual affects that will awe you. In all a very fine disaster film that should be viewed by all who are interested in film."
158,"I suffered my way through all one hundred and ten comments that were listed to date about this movie, and the four comments on the message board. THANK YOU MR. VALENTINE, WHOEVER YOU ARE!!! Valentine wrote the most cogent notes about the movie from them all. Do yourselves a service and go read his notes on the message board. I am STUNNED that most of the comments of this movie were negative in the first place, but even the positive comments indicated that this movie was just over everybody's heads. First of all, this movie was THE movie that started the grand movie making of ""disaster films"". This is actually very important, because this particular movie was NOT made with the purpose of BEING a ""disaster movie"". It is an allegory. Anyone out there know what an allegory is? Yes, class, it is a story about one thing, that is actually portraying some other story that most people know. It is done for various reasons, but I believe the reason here was for the purpose of putting a very old, possibly outdated story, into a present setting, so it could be understood in modern day.  For any of you out there who are familiar with the New Testament, think of the parables. Now...what does a parable do? It tells us a story, but the story has a deeper meaning. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is an allegory. It may or may not be politically correct in this day and age, but when it was made no one really cared. Several commentators have mentioned the book by Paul Gallico. While I have liked some of his work, I actually think that the movie improved upon it by leaps and bounds. But then I guess I am more of the persuasion of the movie maker than the ""diametrically opposed"" view of the original writer. Tough. The movie is the movie. It is the story of someone who is preaching a new kind of religion, as opposed to the preacher who wears the traditional black with a backward collar. The two can sense a kinship for each other, but disagree about the way a clergyman ought to be. Is the class beginning to get it yet? OK, we'll carry on. All the characters are encompassed in a great, big, boat (think 'world'), so there are no additions or subtractions for our allegory's (story's) sake. We have a cataclysm. Some die at the first. We know that others at top were lost. Others hold on. Things settle for a bit. Then comes the disagreement about how to get saved (get it, ""saved""). Most want to wait for a nonspecific someone to save them. They plan to sit and wait until that nonspecific someone comes to get them out of what is now the bowels of the ship, since it capsized. But the Reverend with the new ideas, grabs hold of something that a child says (get that, ""and a little child shall lead them""). The Reverend Scott is not content to wait. He says ""I know the way out of here. Come with me. Follow me"", or words VERY close to that effect. Are we recognizing anything yet, class? He and his followers are creative in using the huge Christmas tree as a ladder to go UPWARDS (get it, up, up, up, as opposed to down further). He begs the others to come with his small group. But only just a very few do. Most do not. . . until. . . another explosion, and there is panic, and then because they have panicked, too many try to climb the tree/ladder, and it falls back DOWN. And the Reverend says to his people, that they can not take the time to mourn those that are lost now. They must persevere to try to find the hull which is now the TOP of the ship. Anyone out there know their New Testament and what was said about leaving mother, father, sister, brother, and ""come and follow"", . . .who? And so the journey begins. Some places are not bad going, other places are dangerous, and very scary. Some intersections appear to be the end of the way, that there can be no way past, but with the help of Reverend Scott and the others using their own ingenuity, they find ways and means. At one hallway, they find a group going the opposite direction, and though it seems to those people the way to the top, it is the way to the former top. But they will not listen. They are firm in their pathway to the BOTTOM (going down anyone?). On go the little group of followers of the Reverend. Some DOUBT some of the choices, but end up going anyway. Others are devoted to the charismatic religious leader. Sound like anyone in history you have heard of class? Sadly, though all his group are trying, some lose their hold and fall. Some are not strong enough to make it all the way to the hull and are lost. And one sacrifices herself for her fellow human beings to help them get through an almost impossible, impassible underwater way. Then comes the final hellish room of heat and long falls. There is a door that can get them through to the other side of it, but it has to be opened by a round GATE-like turning apparatus (seen only on boats). Who can do it, risking their life? Who is strong enough? Who has the courage to face that almost certain death? Who questions God about the only way to open that door? Who says I will do this for these people? I will do it for these brave good people, but you (God) better get them through if I do this? Yes, students, it is the Reverend Scott. And he SACRIFICES his own life, so that the ones left with him, will have a fighting chance at getting out of the ship. And those that do get to the hull are worn out, and sad, and can not believe that the Reverend did that for them. Some would almost have rather died with him, than to be left behind without him. But still they persevered. They got to the hull. They are lifted out and carried on the wings of . . . helicopters (or angels, whichever). They are SAVED. Yes, class, dear students (even the student of film who never understood the significance), dear Readers,  THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is an ""allegory"" (look it up in the dictionary if you doubt my meaning of the word). Even the best of the ""disaster films"" that followed, had, at the most, an interesting story to go with the dynamics of the disaster. This movie. . . was the story of a saviour.Now, go and watch the movie again, and keep it in mind."
159,"This movie is to the 70s disaster genre what 'THEM!' was to the 50s giant-radioactive-insect genre.  Both genres are absurdly stupid, totally cliche groupings of film too reliant on formula to set any new boundaries. What sets these two apart from the rest is that they have dated the least and retain the most power.  'THEM!' used flat acting to complement the mood, but breaks several stereotypes in the process.  'Poseidon' has better actors, but uses stereotypes.  'Towering Inferno' had a weaker cast despite its bigger budget, hence it died quickly like 'ID4'.Disaster movies are broken into several distinct parts.  There is the introductory exposition, then the ""event"", then the crisis response, then the aftershocks, then conclusion.  Unlike its followers, 'Poseidon' is not as typically structure, much like how the post-capsize ship differs from other nautical films.The most interesting part is how James Cameron borrowed from this movie and 'THEM!' for 'ALIENS'.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"
160,"You know what's strange.  I loved this movie when I was 5, and I still love it today.  It's huge sets and well done special effects make this movie one of the greatest of all times.  The cast is like none other to be seen.A movie owrth watching. ****SFX secret****When the ship is turning over, they actually put the entire dining room set on a gimple and flipped it over to get a real reaction from the actors and stunt doubles."
161,"I actually really liked this movie.  It has an all-star cast (Gene Hackman, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters), who deliver great performances, and has really good special effects for their day.  The only thing I kept saying about Red Buttons character through the most of the movie was ""Leave Nonnie! She is a wussy wench and is slowing all of you down!""  Cuz every time they moved onto a new obstacle, she was a coward.  Anyway, this movie, in my opinion, deserves 7.8 out of 10."
162,"*SPOILERS*I saw the Poseidon Adventure on AMC recently, and I found it rather enjoyable instead of the camp flick everyone claims it to be.  A couple of detractions from the movie were 1)That annoying kid who really deserves a whack upside the head for his smart-aleckiness, 2)That singer Nonnie, who besides her great ability to lip-synch, doesn't seem to know what else to do with herself, and that 3)Roddy's character died too soon in that air shaft, I sorely missed his Britishness soon after.  I also noticed how everyone moved to the sides to just let him fall, how rude!"
163,"Yes, the disaster movie has cliches by the cartload- but this one invented most of them. Yes, the characters are stereotypical- but they're meant to be, there's no need and not enough runtime for in-depth psychology. Yes, the special effects look of their day- so will 2002's eventually, believe it or not. Yes, the fashions are cheesy and the decor awful; but that's the 1970s.Many who come to sneer will stay to cheer, if they have an eye and an ear. For ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the greatest disaster movie of modern times: a superb, sure-footed allegory of crisis, panic and the will to overcome them, which knows exactly where it's going and when to stop or run along the way.Director Ronald Neame was a master of staging, pace and timing. The film is structured as a quest: one of the archetypal myths or six basic plots. Like ""Pilgrim's Progress"", fainthearts fall away, blowhards are confounded and cheats do not prosper. Like the ""Odyssey"", the brave confront and slays monsters: a force of Nature such as water, or an inner flaw such as cowardice and lack of trust. And like all good allegories, the biggest hero is he who sacrifices himself for his friends. Rev. Scott winds up literally crucified before plunging into the flames of Hell to be harrowed for the salvation he has surely earned.The film deserves credit for making the leader of the would-be survivors no sweetly saccharine saviour or mightily muscled macho man. Hackman is a sour, arrogant and abrupt bully who himself stands in need of the redemption only courage and initiative can earn. Hammy? Of course, it's his stock in trade. The cross-section of crew and passengers, his disciples, are drawn to him by his determination and resourcefulness, not his charm.Mrs Rosen, seemingly the deadweight of the party, surprisingly rises to the occasion, emphasising how in society we all have something to give. Borgnine's edgy cop, a Scott-like curmudgeon without Scott's faith, finally sees the light (literally, in the last scene) and understands the difference between them. Timid little Red Buttons finds the grit under his frilled shirt.""The Poseidon Adventure"", as another IMDb reviewer has noticed, does not need a MacGuffin for the situation into which these folks are pitchforked. No evil terrorist lurks along the corridor; no chiselling naval architect cuts corners and gambled on the big tub staying upright. As in Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", we never know why the disaster happened; what matters is how they (and in our imaginations, we) cope with it. Water, omnipresent and unstoppable, is the least malevolent-seeming of foes. You just have to rise above it, or take a deep breath and force yourself through it. This is existentialism made pop.Another poster wondered about the abruptness of the ending. To me, that is one of Neame's masterstrokes, confirming how well the film is plotted towards its consummation. You wanna see a big widescreen-filling shot of the upside-down titan? Hundreds of unlucky victims shrieking and drowning, Cameron-style? Sorry, it's not in keeping. Instead Neame shows us a short, speechless sequence of the few survivors clambering on to a chopper which then lifts off, away from the section of the hull where they came out. Fade to black, then credits. No laborious ""what happened after"" scenes, no inquest about what caused the sinking, no happy-ever-after epilogue; it was never about that, but about how a few people survived. The movie's last word is ""No"".Art, even popular art, is about exclusion. Movies are about what you leave out of the frame. Why do a few films last the way ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has lasted? It outlives its ephemeral and kitschy trappings as its protagonists, soaked and possession-less, outlived theirs. It conveys a set of eternal insights and truths in a fresh, absorbing manner. The Love Boat becomes a Love Thy Neighbour Boat."
164,"Satisfying and emotionally felt upside down caper with well etched, believable characters is also a master stroke of fine art direction. Even after multiple viewings, this thing holds up well, thanks mostly to the strong acting. Not exactly faithful to the more powerful novel, it competes nicely as a great movie experience, if that is, you can bear to watch people crawl their way thru a mangled ocean liner, not knowing if they'll live or die. Shelley and Gene stand out in all their scenes, but Ernest Borgnine is surprisingly heartfelt at a stubborn, grumpy cop whose wife used to be a prostitute(the always enjoyable Stella Stevens, who quotes the movie's best dialogue.) Has an incredibly moving and haunting musical score, too. All in all, probably the most poignant of the 70's disaster craze."
165,"The Poseidon Adventure is certainly a classic.  Yes, there is some bad acting by some of the supporting members of the cast, but the acting is easily forgotten as the story absorbs us.  We bond with the characters in one way or another, and we all can relate to the element of fear that they all had to deal with. Many of the characters were afraid of the unknown just as society and a person in general is.  This film takes a closer look at that idea, but more from the courage side of things than from the fear aspect.  The whole movie wreaks of emotion, and Gene Hackman's fiery character could be an inspiration if viewed from a certain angle.  If you like this movie, check out The Towering Inferno, which is at least as good, if not possibly better."
166,"I have to disagree with anyone who feels this movie was a waste of talents or lacked in the imaginary field. Paul Gallico wrote a terrific novel and had this been made into a film 'TODAY' it would probably blow away the TITANIC, especially with the special effects that could have been provided. It's a fast-moving, colorful adventure, suspense film with some unique twists and turns. If you haven't seen it, rent it."
167,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of my all time favorite Disaster films. We all know that we the ship turns upside down a small group are going to try and make it to the top. This is where the fun begins. The group dynamics at play in this film are fantastic....Gene Hackman's Rev. Scott going into verbal battle with Borgnine's Cop. Roddy McDowell's Arces is pure camp. Throw in Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, a classic line ""must get to life boat stations"" and a pompous purser and you have the makings of a great film. I would love this remade...perhaps Tim Curry in the Arces role. Happy viewing!"
168,"Watching The Poseidon Adventure as a 9 year old, I learned that in times of disaster, death and destruction, if you are young, pretty, and as wooden as a deck chair, you will survive.  And one question that has ALWAYS lingered for me:  WHY was Pamela Sue Martin wearing hot pants under her evening dress?"
169,"forget ""the towering inferno"" and ""earthquake"", when we look back at the disaster films of the 70's, ""the poseidon adventure"" is the archetype. many of the situations and characters in this film about a ship turned upside down might been new or original in 1972(although i doubt it) but all seem cliched today.  nevertheless, this movie is worth watching for a good laugh. all the characters are one dimensional and underdeveloped, not that it matters because people don't watch films like these films for the acting. actually, gene hackman's performance is quite good, considering he is in such a schlocky film.  however, the movie also has some god awful acting, particularly by carole lynley who hardly speaks thoughout the film but still manages to be completely annoying. i swear, if i were one the poseidon survivors, i would have straight out smacked her!  pamela sue martin is cute but doesn't have much to do besides gaze longingly at hackman, who, by the way, plays a preacher!?  this movie is really sexist, as all the women act really passive and all wear really short, shorts with their butt cheeks hanging out. basically, this film is a perfect representation of the ""silly seventies""."
170,"The Poseidon Adventure is a better camp classic than Valley of the Dolls! When I saw it at age 12 I found it so exciting that it made my pulse race! I loved the overturning liner and waited anxiously to see it when it finally appeared on TV.  I had many happy hours recreating the overturned luxury liner with my younger sister's Barbie family - the Malibu camper was destroyed!  In our teen years, we played ""Survive the Poseidon Adventure"" in the swimming pool.  Years later I have come to appreciate its special appeal for being deliciously ""over-the-top""What a tour de force of overacting! Shelley Winters and Gene Hackman took top prize respectfully as a stereotypical Jewish Grandmother and maverick early 70's avante garde ""preacher-man"". They rival Susan Hayward's and Patty Duke's characters from ""Valley of the Dolls"".And what great ""wooden acting""!  Pamela Sue Martin and Carol Lynley look dazed throughout the whole flick - their expressions rarely change unless registering ""TOTALLY CANNED COMPLETE TERROR LOOKS"" - otherwise, they don't look any different from before the boat tipped over!  And except for some occasional screams, they are the tops with their monotone deliveries!  I especially loved the ""CANNED HORRIFIED LOOK"" when Carol Lynley looks down a corridor and sees floating...pans!  Barbara Parkins and Sharon Tate(""Valley of the Dolls"" fame) look out!My favorites of course are Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens as a squabbling, though much-in-love married couple (he a cop and she a former hooker). They have the best one liners in the movie with incredibly sarcastic deliveries. Whether it is a discussion about suppositories, screaming insults at other passengers, swearing, or just yelling at each other these two made a ""fun to watch"" couple - the ship won't go down without them getting in the last word!The supporting cast was sufficiently stereotypical to fill any disaster movie.  Jack Albertson is a likeable old cuss married to Shelley.  Eric Shea is a whiney no-it-all kid.  You appreciate why Ernest Borgnine always looses his patience with him and you just want Ernest to slap Eric but good. When I first saw the movie I thought Red Buttons character was pretty disposable - years later I appreciate it as about the only understated performance in the movie (and he is the real leader who is truly responsible for anyone getting out alive!).Of course the terrifically horrible dialogue gives me the most laughs!  I love the part after the water bursts into the main dining room and you hear this same woman repeat ""Help me, I'm going under""... twice!  And the dialogue between Red Buttons and Carol Lynley in the upside down barbershop is a treasure of stupidity!  And of course, Stella Stevens continually shouting at people to ""shut up"" rivals Patty Dukes screaming out for ""Dolls, Ted, and God"" in Valley of the Dolls!Overall, this movie has always been a joy.  It's still a fun adventure, the special effects, though dated, were way ahead of their time and still give me goosebumps. You still enjoy watching the interaction between the characters and you can't help but want them all to survive - but, of course, they don't and thats what good disaster movies are all about. This is a true cult favorite.  However, I wonder if the characters are really stereotypes or if they set the standard for ""Disaster Movie Stereotypes"" to come? The characters are generally true to the Paul Gallico novel of the same name - although the plot has different twists (the book is darker than the movie).In summary, all I can say is that as far as this movie and I are concerned there will always be a ""Morning After"""
171,"Top-heavy cruise ship The Poseidon is on its final voyage when it is hit by a freak wave that turns the vessel upside-down. A handful of survivors try to make their way to the 'top' of the topsy-turvy boat before rising waters cause it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.In the battle for best disaster movie of the '70s, top contenders The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure are fairly evenly matched: both are based on best-selling novels; both have big budgets and excellent special effects; both have an all-star cast; both boast scores by John Williams; both deliver in terms of nail-biting tension and excitement; and both end with an inordinate amount of luck and happenstance for the remaining survivors. So when choosing a favourite out of the two, it all boils down to one thing as far as I am concerned: hotpants!I don't seem to recall there being too many pairs of hotpants in The Towering Inferno (no jokes about characters' trousers on fire please); The Poseidon Adventure, on the other hand, features two pairs, as worn by brunette hottie Pamela Sue Martin and blonde babe Carol Lynley (who pairs her shorts with knee-high leather boots). With both actresses regularly called upon to climb up things (and to get thoroughly soaked), this small detail clinches it for Poseidon.Throw in Stella Stevens in her panties (and Shelley Winters for those who like 'em older and much fuller of figure) and that's men of most tastes catered for. The ladies of the audience aren't so lucky - they get Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowall and Ernest Borgnine - great actors but hardly hunks.9.5/10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb."
172,"Those disaster flicks of the '70s wouldn't have been so dull (maybe not at all) if they'd only had the disaster part. Unfortunately, they always felt tempted to show how it was affecting people's emotions. In ""The Poseidon Adventure"", a rogue wave hits an ocean liner, thereby capsizing it. With the ship completely inverted, a group of passengers races against the clock to find a way out. And a few people die along the way.I hate to have to say this, but this movie tries so hard to manipulate your emotions, that you kind of want everyone to die. What I can't figure is how Gene Hackman, usually one of Hollywood's most dependable actors, could go from his Oscar-winning role in ""The French Connection"" to this. For that matter, how could director Ronald Neame go from ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" to this? Wasting not only those two, but also the talents of Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Roddy McDowall, and Leslie Nielsen, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the ultimate example of a movie that you only watch as a reference. Thank God that ""Airplane!"" spoofed these kinds of movies."
173,"This film suffers from bad acting, bad direction and a very bad dialog. An on top of that, many of the actions that the characters take are down right stupid and not founded in any sort of reality, except in a bad Hollywood-reality... The average rating of 7.0 is nowhere near what it should be if you compare it to other films with the same rating. I have wasted many hours on many meaningless things in my lifetime - including bad movies, but these two hours was a real pain, and I truly regret having wasted them on this lame excuse for movie entertainment. If you have two hours to kill, DO NOT waste them on this movie. Instead, try to count the number of drops of water it takes to fill a glass... You'll get just as much entertainment out of that, and I'm sure the glass will ""hold water"" as opposed to this movie..."
174,"The Poseidon Adventure is set aboard the cruise liner the S.S. Poseidon which is sailing from New York to Athens, it's New Year's Eve & a huge party is in full swing in the ball room. The Captain (Leslie Nielsen) is called to the bridge, an underground earthquake & aftershocks means a huge tidal wave is on a direct collision course with the Poseidon. The huge tidal wave hits the Poseidon at midnight just as it turns New Year, the Poseidon is capsized & ends up stranded upside down in the middle of the Ocean. With water gushing in & the inevitability that the Poseidon will sink a handful of passengers decide to head to the propeller shaft which is the only part of the Poseidon not underwater but they must face plenty of dangers & obstacles along the way...Directed by Ronald Neame this is the Grandfather of all those 70's people in peril disaster flicks that pitted unfortunates against Volcanos, Earthquakes, Meteors & Burning Buildings. Produced by the legendary Irwin Allen who apparently directed some of the action sequences The Poseidon Adventure is maybe the finest example of it's genre & a film that holds up really well even when viewed today. At just over an hour & fifty minutes it's a fairly long film but no time is wasted, the build-up to the disaster is wisely used to introduce some fairly well rounded character's who at least aren't all Hollywood model types or teenagers & these are the sort of people you can relate too in an odd way & understand them. The script also has a bit of depth, in particular keeping faith & trying to overcome the odds no matter what. There are some spectacular action set-pieces aided by some impressive effects works & grand sets, from the initial tidal wave hitting & the mass confusion to various death defying obstacles that need to be overcome there's plenty going on & the film never really lets up. I am not sure why anyone would listen to the preacher & follow him but that's a necessary part of the story I suppose & there doesn't seem to be much of a plan as what they were going to do once they reach the engine room either but that's nothing major. The script is also quite surprising in who it kills off, it's certainly not afraid to kill off it's main character's which is unexpected. The Poseidon Adventure is also one of those rare films that once you start watching it you are engrossed, it's a regular on telly & if I catch a bit I always end up watching it & have seen it several times throughout the years.The sets & production design are great, The Poseidon Adventure is a great film to look at with it's grandiose & epic feel. TRhe action scenes are well handled as is the effects work although some of the model shots look a little dated now. The Poseidon Adventure was apparently shot in sequence so that probably helped the actor's feel what their character's were going through a little better. While the set-pieces are good they are not too extravagant or silly which also helps keep it rooted in reality, there are no indestructible superheroes here as it really does feel like a bunch of ordinary people are trying to survive a near impossible situation.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 the film looks great, the production values are top notch. The acting is very good from a great bunch of real professionals, the cast contains five Oscar winners including Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons & Jack Albertson who all give very watchable performances.The Poseidon Adventure is a great film, it's very watchable, it's fairly intense & has a few surprises on the way too. The best of the 70's disaster films in my opinion. Followed by the sequel Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) while it was also remade as the TV film The Poseidon Adventure (2005) & the big budget Hollywood remake Poseidon (2006)."
175,"This movie got mixed reviews on its release and you can easily see why.It contains some extremely believable special-effects for its time, and the set-pieces are likewise entirely convincing. The upside-down-ness of the inverted ship is accomplished so well that even after repeated viewings I have never nailed a mistake. For these things alone it is still worth a watch.Suspense is provided by the occasional hazard of fire (though, oddly, never poisonous fumes) and the steadfastly rising sea as the ship settles. The selected-few grub about in the murky bowels of lower deck spaces, constantly ambushed and pursued by the briny. It's all good stuff.There's an interesting pot-pouri of actors. A young, balding priest is played by Gene Hackman (didn't he ever have a full head of hair?). Ernest Borgnine provides his usual sterling performance as someone larger than life in a crude and potentially violent sort of way. His toad-like features have almost always prevented him from playing a heroic leading man, yet he's just as frequently earned top billing despite it. This is a compliment to his acting skills, which - in my opinion - outshine those of Hackman. There are plenty of other B-list stalwarts including Roddy Mcdowell and Shelley Winters. They all do their best.And they need to. Because the parts they play are about as clichéd as they come and the dialogue might have been written on a cigarette packet. The firebrand priest who you know is for the chop (God never likes a smart-arse). The shy middle-aged bachelor who will at last get the girl - albeit half his age (and if you think that will last, you must be from greenland). The kindly fat lady who has 'heart-attack' stamped on her forehead, a policeman who has married a prostitute (gimme a break), and a know-it-all brat you could cheerfully strangle. There's some well-matched conflict between Hackman and Borgnine and one does at least begin to care about the characters, which is what you're supposed to do. There's just not enough mustard with the ham.If anyone has managed so far never to have seen this movie before, they may get a shock to see Leslie Neilsen as the ship's captain, and think they're in for a spoof. Well; daft as some of the dialogue may be, Airplane! it isn't. Neilsen plays it straight.Don't let its age put you off, or the clichés. The post-inversion sequences are so convincing that you'll find yourself rooting for these schmucks even at their dumbest.The Towering Inferno is still a far superior movie, but then what would you expect with Steve McQueen and Paul Newman? If only they had been in Poseidon. They would have demanded plausible characterisation and a better script, and the movie would have been a classic.However.Can a liner remain upside down like that? Maybe. I've seen battleships turn turtle and remain floating for a few minutes, and they have massively heavy armour plating. I sure wouldn't want to find out the hard way."
176,"At one time this all-star ""adventure"" film seemed a trail-blazer.  After all, it started the Irwin Allen-powered disaster film phenomenon of the seventies.  Today, the acting seems melodramatic and characters cardboard. However, that it has characaters we grow to care about is a major improvement over the cartoon figures who walk through modern disaster movies like ""Armageddon."""
177,"An ocean liner is hit by a tidal wave and capsizes.This is a movie that for me works on a number of levels due to its solid production values, simple premise, entertaining characters and memorable dialogue.Sensibly for a movie made in the early 70s the effects are minimal and practical for what it tries to achieve. I found the concept of the ship capsizing plausible without the need to suspend disbelief. Interestingly my four year old daughter understood what was happening without needing me to explain it, which for me is the ultimate sign of success.Another positive is the simplicity of the plot. After the Poseidon flips over we have short number of set-pieces involving obstacles the characters have to overcome in order to survive. Each of the obstacles is plausible and clearly presented to the audience.The characters are clearly defined and I personally find them entertaining. Each has a role to play in defining the movie's main theme of survival. Reverend Scott goes against the general opinion of all authority figures to lead the passengers towards what he believes to be safety. He is played charismatically but sometimes slightly over the top by Gene Hackman. Ernest Borgnine matches Hackman's strong presence as the antagonistic policeman Mr Rojo and for me expresses anger in a more natural and believable way. Red Buttons brings a calming influence to scenes of high drama and his character keeps everyone's focus on the tasks at hand. Shelly Winters as Mrs Rosen considers herself a liability until her moment to shine arrives and she takes centre stage.There are a number of classic lines that are highly memorable. Some have excellent timing and help diffuse the tension. Others I suspect to be unintentionally funny, but they entertain nonetheless. Leslie Neilson as the captain has a serious role, but because it's him and he's so deadpan it's hard not to laugh at everything that comes out of his mouth. On a similar note some moments are slightly silly but never fail to make me laugh, like when Nonnie sees the water level rising through an upside down stairwell and her reaction is a fabulous old fashioned horror-movie type scream.In contrast, my favourite part is when Nonnie is frozen with fear in the midst of climbing a ladder through the ventilation shaft, and Mr Martin helps her to overcome the moment and start moving again. This for me is so brilliantly and realistically done that you feel for the both of them. Mr Rojo also delivers an epic line as he is situated just below them on the ladder.I think if you go into the Poseidon Adventure looking to see the spectacle of a ship capsizing you will be ultimately disappointed. The film is a character study about survival. It is about strength, weakness, compassion, guilt, leadership, conformity and the human condition in a survival situation.For my daughter and I, it provided solid entertainment and a much needed break from Disney princesses."
178,"Gene Hackman is a very interesting actor and you can't really tell his personality from his face and expression. He seems to be a good guy and a bad guy. and I think he's a bad guy more than a good guy. I didn't know what his role is in this movie
Which one is this time?
... I was already swallowed up by the suspense. I think that's the power of Gene Hackman as an actor. And from my point of view, Gene Hackman played an unexpected character in this movie and established the movie quickly.
There are a lot of movies about the Titanic, but I'd take this Poseidon adventure is the best. The story structure is brilliant, the characters are characteristic and vivid, and each episode is interesting...
DiCaprio fans will disagree, though."
179,"We saw this at the majestic Warner Grand Theatre in downtown San Pedro. I was only six, but I was blown away!As soon as videos came out, this was the first time we bought. My little brother and I would watch it New Year's Eve. Good fun. None of the remakes or re-dos can match the original.Make big bowl of popcorn and snuggle up with the kids and have a fun evening.P.S. Gene Hackman did this right after his Oscar win for ""The French Connection."" He stated that he did it strictly for the money and has never seen it."
180,"Knowing what went into the making of Producer Irwin Allen's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, including the sets and special effects, it's obvious that every penny of the budget is on screen. The rogue wave, the rolling of the ship, and the resulting events inside are all iconic. It's also an example of a true ""all star"" cast that meshes and works well together. They also have a bit of substance, as well as back stories. Gene Hackman's doubting priest character must overcome himself, in order to lead the survivors to safety. Ernest Borgnine as the cranky cop, and Stella Stevens as his ex-prostitute wife are quite believable. Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters as the elderly couple, actually seem to love each other. Red Buttons and Carol Lynley are fairly poignant in their roles as lonely people who have found each other too late. This all makes the ensuing chaos and tragedy more palpable. These are living, breathing human beings, and we are pulling for them. Though Allen would soar to even greater heights w/ his next film, POSEIDON stands as the movie that ushered in the true era -AIRPORT was more of a thriller- of the ""disaster"" film..."
181,"There's not a whole lot to recommend any of the cornball disaster flicks of the 70s, but this early one (soon after the prototypical ""Airport"") is about as good as any of them get, largely due to the lovable Shelly Winters, who gained 35 lbs to play the now-overweight, ex-athlete who ""can hold her breath under the water for 2:46""! Take that, ya big dumb capsized boat!"
182,"Let me start this review by giving ""The Poseidon Adventure"" the credit it deserves. Ronald Neame's film is a spectacular entertainment and the accomplishment is even more impressive because way back in 1972, filmmakers couldn't rely on CGI and digital effects. To recreate the nightmarish setting of an upside-down boat with such a gritty realism elevates ""The Poseidon Adventure"", on a pure technical level, into a milestone in the same vein than ""Star Wars"" or ""Who's Afraid of Roger Rabbit"". But the risk with special effects is that they are often taken for granted as the only pillar of the film's success instead of being exploited for the sake of a story. Indeed, even the most dazzling images and impressive stunts aren't enough to hook an audience from the beginning of the show to its end, otherwise, it's called overproduction or simply show-off. A film is still about people and it's of people that viewers care, rather than moving, flying, falling or exploding objects, no matter how big they are. I guess that's the reason why disaster films rely on an all-star cast; there have to be recognizable faces to drive empathy because, given the parameters of the genre, each character has a limited screen presence, so there's no time for getting too psychological about them. This is why among the characters who survived the spectacular giant wave; most of them are Oscar-winning actors, an unknown face, an extra is only a soon-to-be-corpse. And on the casting department, ""Poseidon"" offers a very sympathetic gallery centered on the impassioned Frank Scott, the reverend with unconventional methods, played by Gene Hackman and the sweet and caring Belle Rosen, the Jewish grandmother, played by an Oscar- nominated Shelley Winters. The rest of the cast includes the gentle Red Buttons, the torridly sexy Stella Stevens, a handsome Roddy McDowell and Ernest Borgnine as the obligatory short-tempered character, you know, the one-who-is-always-wrong. There has to be the guy who never pays attention to a child when he gives precious information, to systematically disagree with the hero's choices. And although Borgnine's tantrum gets a little bit repetitive, he's obviously a confused man with arms of steel and heart of gold (Rest in Peace, Ernie!).The performances are unequally convincing, some characters, especially female like the scared singer or the teenager with infatuated with the robust hero, are obviously meant to fill obligatory archetypes, but it's never overused in the film, the center of gravity remains Frank Scott, and the claustrophobic journey he leads in the belly of 'The Poseidon"" from the top to the bottom (the bottom which happens to be at the top, follow me?) a trajectory that will not go without obstacles and a few collateral damages in the process. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" follows a very simple plot line, but this simplicity serves the film because it goes straight to the point in a very short running time, a good choice because more would have been boring. Maybe that's because the scale is smaller than other disaster films such as ""Airport"", ""Earthquake"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" but it fits in the case of ""Poseidon"".Still, there are several aspects that can't be seen in a non-sarcastic way, I, myself, couldn't take seriously the sight of Leslie Nielsen as the Captain, although I'm aware he started in serious roles. I laughed at the one-dimensional managing businessman who orders to increase the speed, I wanted the kid to shut his mouth sometimes and act like a real one who'd be more scared than thrilled by this adventure, not like the blonde singer mind you because that one who almost got on my nerves. Or maybe I was too distracted by the panties of Stella Stevens, or some campy lines such as one passenger who says ""the pursuer is right"" with such passion and intensity, it obviously serves to underscore Scott's position as a misunderstood loner. But I didn't laugh very long because the basis of the adventure and the efficiency of the special effects really grabbed me.I also didn't laugh because I felt concerned by some characters, and that's another positive consequence of the minimal casting that gives another edge over the other disaster films.Without spoiling the events, it's obvious that there are more deaths to go during the heart- pounding journey, but one of them, and the reaction it inspired from Gene Hackman touched me deeply in the heart. It's one thing to see some stuff coming; it's another to genuinely react despite the predictability. The film owes a lot to Hackman's electrifying performance that earned him a BAFTA Award, he plays with the same level of sincerity as if it was a drama, and that's the mark of great actors. He delivers in the early sequence a powerful speech asking people to see themselves as elements of a whole, to find their inner strength in order to contribute to a larger effort, naturally, the whole film comes as a practice of his own theories. It's a speech for the strong, retorts another priest played by Arthur O'Connell, but it's not about strength, it's about courage, and the film does convey this inspirational element, confronting the hero to his own faith during the climax.I could have said that the film only works as a big-screen spectacle, but again, it's short enough, the spectacular effects and the characterization are so well done that it's possible to enjoy it on TV, it's your typically pop-corn film but who said you couldn't eat pop-corn at home. The laughable elements I described suffer more from their overusing in the movies made after, so in all fairness, there's nothing to blame on ""Poseidon"". It can be campy sometimes with this 70's feel betrayed by the looks and the delightfully cheesy ""Morning After"" song, it is often over the top (no pun intended) but it works. It definitely does."
183,"After an ocean liner is capsized, survivors make their way to the bottom of the ship, which by then is the top. Although ""Airport"" was released two years earlier, it was the box office success of this film that truly launched the all-star disaster movie genre in the 1970s and established the recipe for disaster - just add water in this case. The dialog is pedestrian and the acting is uneven, but the film is a lot of fun in a trashy sort of way. Once the tidal wave hits, one is swept into the story (so to speak). Hackman leads the all-star cast as a fiery preacher, but there's the usual assortment of characters, and every star gets to ham it up a bit. Williams adds an ominous score."
184,"*may contain spoilers* Award winning disaster film about ship in mediterranean sea on new years eve. Earthquake causes tidal wave that capsizes ship meaning top of ship is at bottom. Survivors must make way through the ship to upturned hull to escape. Many obstacles along the way including fire, water, debris then try to find way out through hull. Explosions coming from underwater boilers and dilemmas of which way to go to get out. Gene Hackman stars as preacher leading survivors through ship to hull and hopeful rescue. A strong cast including Ernest Borgine and Leslie Nielsen as captain of ship who perishes when wave hits."
185,"I saw the lackluster remake first, and then went back to see and pray to God that the original was better. And it was better, quite a bit better. It was of course dated a tad, but still more enjoyable than the badly done remake. Acting: 10/10Strong performances all around, especially from Gene Hackman. As i am to young to recognize most faces in this film, I cannot say much for them as I could for the remake. Writing: 8/10 A very good script for a very good disaster movie. For it's time it was a script to behold and enjoy and is still enjoyable. Direction: 10/10 The film moves like clock work and is well directed. Nothing too out of place here, there, or anywhere. All is well placed and made, with fine direction. Special Effects: 10/10 Being an older film I expected the effects to be horrible to the point that I might see a stray rubber ducky float by the ship. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that that was not the case at all! The effects were fantastic! Well done, very well done. Cinematography:6/10 Some great shots, but this is one thing that shows this films age. Score: 6/10 Not half as good as expected from John Williams. I have heard worse, seen MUCH better.Final Diagnosis: B"
186,"Another one of those disaster flick box office smashes of the 1970s in the traditions of ""Airport"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" as ""The Poseidon Adventure"" decides to examine natural tragedy on the water. A hand of God-styled tidal wave sends a huge luxury liner upside down in the ocean with a who's who list of Hollywood legends and former Oscar winners doing their very best to literally climb from the top to the bottom of the ship and survive. Gene Hackman leads a ragtag group which includes Ernest Borgnine, wife Stellas Stevens, Jack Albertson, wife Shelley Winters (Oscar-nominated), Red Buttons and Roddy McDowall as they breathlessly attempt to defy all odds. Special effects tour de force that was a mammoth undertaking to make back in 1972. The all-star cast comes through for the most part with Hackman and Borgnine stealing the show from their contemporaries. ""The Morning After"" was one of those songs on everyone's lips for a short time and it would claim Oscar gold along with the film's visual innovations. And yes---that is Leslie Nielsen as the ship's doomed captain. 4 stars out of 5."
187,"The Poseidon Adventure was the first pg film I saw as a kid, and I remember loving it. I finally saw it again the other day (after 30+ years), and I must say, it holds up pretty well. The whole plot of the movie can be summed up in one sentence: big boat turns upside down, and people try to get out. But along the way, we get to watch past greats like Shelly Winters, and future greats like Gene Hackman ham it up a bit as they try to get out of the turtled S.S. Poseidon. Even though the plot is simple, the director keeps the action moving along crisply through a series of small action sequences as the passengers clamber over one obstacle after another. It's also fun to note that there's a weird religious sub-text to the whole affair. Gene Hackman's character is a priest, and much of the drama in the movie revolves around faith and belief. He tries to get the passengers to have faith in him, and that his way to the promised land is up and out; another priest stays behind with the weaker passengers; Rogo's comments of doubt and so forth. Even the last dramatic moment has a bit of a religious twist -- can you guess what it is? Great fun in all!"
188,"After a ship accident which turns the SS Poseidon upside down a small group of survivors tries to find a way out of the ship while the waters are rising in the ship. The basic constellation and the story which results from it sounds not too original and indeed it's the classic but usual stuff we have here: The usual bunch of different characters within the group which together with the dramatic action results in rising conflicts among the passengers. Setbacks, heroic rescue operations, sacrifices all along the attempt to survive. Sometimes the cliché prevails over lively and sensual action. Very good performances especially by Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters. Generally entertaining but highly conventional."
189,"I sat through this thing in the theatre, and I guess I was able to suspend my disbelief, although I never bothered to see it again until tonight. Now I know why. Were it not for the characters constant arguing and bellyaching all the way, the movie would have been half as long! I guess that's the element of ""drama"" at work.The genre this ""classic"" spawned was among the stranger ones that Hollywood has produced over the years. While it's not as bad as the dog movie (or it's latest variant, the kangaroo movie), the disaster genre has had some real gems over the years (n.b. the ""Airport"" movie where a jumbo jet, FULL OF AIR, sits at the bottom of the sea - in the Bermuda Triangle, of course!). Actually, the ""Poseidon Adventure"" was not really the first disaster movie. ""A Night to Remember"", about the Titanic, was an earlier, and better, one. However, ""Poseidon"" was the one that started a rash of copies.If you haven't seen this, it's worth it for a laugh. Watch for Ernie Borgnine's constant questioning of Gene Hackman's leadership and his bullying attitude towards the stereotypical ""inquisitive little boy"". Also, don't miss Hackman's ""sermonette"" at the end. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that. Let's just say that it's obvious why the scene had to be shot from about the knees up.One thing to consider is this: in '72 ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was state of the art film making, but now it's pretty much only good for laughs. How will ""Titanic"" look in 30 years?Oh yeah, some ""adventure""!"
190,"During the early 1970's, the genre of disaster films pretty much began with this film.  The plot was simple, to get a group of seven to ten characters together, put them in a disastarous situation and have them fight for their lives as they try to escape it.  It also doesn't hurt if about four or five die throughout the course of the film.  This is what the Poseidon Adventure began.  The story was simple but the cast and the effects made this film a classic, especially Shelly Winters.  Also, because of this film, Irwin Allen went from being a creator of science fiction series to the definitive master of disaster."
191,it is thanks to this film that I went into film making so this one means a lot more to me than any other film I have ever seen. I am 43 years old and when I saw it in 1972 it bowled me over( i was 13 so very impressionable) sure there were no computer effects a la star wars back then but mechanical effects such as the ones in the dining room and through the ship were a lot more realistic because the actors really FELT the intensity even if it was cheesy but this is the one that will always be my baby
192,"As I have already stated, this movie deals with an incredibly great adventure (anyone heard of a cruise liner going upside down with survivors?), but as far as the script is concerned it wastes the talents of its good stars.  When I watched it for the first time, at the beginning it gave me the impression that it just a low-budget sleazy 70s film.  However after the tidal wave finally hits the ship, things start getting more interesting.  Obviously it contains many loose ends (example: how did the second group of survivors leave the sunken hall? and how did they end up?). Anyway, this movie proved to be quite entertaining in its genre and it was quite a good start for the string of disaster movies of the 70s."
193,"Somewhere in a Hollywood boardroom back in the early 70's somebody must have said, ""Hey, let's assemble a large group of semi-known supporting actors, put them in a cruise ship, have it flip upside-down then watch them try to escape.""Apparently someone replied, ""Great idea, but I think we should add a ton of profanity to make it ""70's"" trendy... Hell, let's even throw a preacher character and failed kid actor from Disney with permanent botox lips and have them use profanity as well."" The reply, ""I love it! But what it really needs is an obnoxious theme song played several times throughout the movie... would be groovy to have a band on board that only plays that one song... over and over, ad nauseam.""Unfortunately nobody ever stopped to think, ""How would a capsized, disabled ship have light?"" Or, ""Who's gonna believe Ernest Borgnine landed Stella Stevens?"" So they ended up making one of the most poorly acted, over acted, poorly directed films in the history of Hollywood. The only believable character is played by Leslie Nielsen, the Captain who dies when the ship flips over.As the film goes on and on for what seems like an eternity, it's almost as if you're hoping these pathetic characters die rather than reach safety due to the fact they are all so annoying, especially the botox lipped kid (Eric Shea) and the fat whiner (Shelly Winters)."
194,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a total waste of talents. Imagine a movie where all positive characters have blue eyes and you understand what I mean. There are a lot of good actors here but their work is terrible. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a movie full of all cliches of film-catastrophe. If you have not seen the movie already, I recommend you not to see it at all because in that case you will be not disappointed with the work of Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine."
195,"I was 15 years old when this movie first came out and I cried my eyes out everytime I saw it, which was quite a few times. Watching it on video in 2002 all I could do was laugh. The only two believable performances in the whole mess were Carol Lynley and Red Buttons.Everyone else is just plain awful. Leslie Nielson obviously got his job on ""Airplane"" because of his thankfully brief performance here. I can't decide who gave the most awful performance here- the little kid who played Robin (Eric Shea), his sister (Pamela Sue Martin)or Stella Stevens. I think I have to declare them all the winners. The little kid was an unexperienced actor who was directed badly, Pamela Sue Martin had nothing to work with except the strident line readings of her little brother and Stella Stevens was just given plain awful dialogue to speak and didn't have the talent to rise above the material. But don't let this review scare you off from seeing this movie. This is the granddaddy of modern disaster films. It spawned a whole bunch more disaster films even worse than this and paved the way for the blockbuster era which has been the death knell of serious movie making in Hollywood. If you want to know why so many studio films are unwatchable these days, this film is a good place to start your education."
196,"In some ways ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a bad film. The dialog is occasionally goofy and the characters are mostly caricatures. But you come to expect that from producer Irwin Allen....as his shows and movies were all about spectacle and disaster and had little in the way of realistic human interactions. In these ways, his films are a bit like Cecil B. DeMille's.I just saw ""The Poseidon Adventure"" today. It was my second time--the first was in the theater when I was a boy. Both times I enjoyed it....but this time I could really see how cartoony many of the folks were in the film. There's the preacher (Gene Hackman)...a profane man who curses a lot and seems to have no faith in anything but himself. Then, there's the obese lady (Shelley Winters) and there are quite a few fat remarks at her expense in the film. And, there's the angry man (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-prostitute wife (Stella Stevens). There are more...all seemingly one-dimensional characters occupying this disaster-fest. But, oddly, despite itself the film IS entertaining and you won't be bored watching it. The special effects are amazing and the film satisfying if, at times, a bit silly."
197,"This is a decent enough movie. It involves a huge ship that tips over in a typhoon and the stories that go from there. Some say it was the standard for disaster movies. It was really only one of many, and it actually came after some of the notable ones. This is again a collection of heroes, cowards, experts, rescue people, old people, young people, lovers, philanderers, and so on. All the stereotypes are there. It is an ensemble cast that includes some rather tiresome people. Some forgettable ones. Some bad actors. Some has beens. A couple of decent actors in other roles. I'm not meaning to dis this film because I rather enjoyed it. It's just that there was nothing all that new. When it was talked about in the day, they always mentioned that Shelley Winters swam under water. That was obviously a high point. Don't get it."
198,"As opposed to the moron who currently has his review on the main page, who casually said ""the cast doesn't matter -- what matters are the special effects..."" well, all I can say to that is: ""thank God you're not in the film business, pal!! Because brother, you haven't got a goddamn clue.""Make no mistake: the cast is EVERYTHING in this film. That's why it's a great movie... along with a fantastic script, great sets and perfect editing that moves the story along at a thrilling pace. And speaking of the cast, in my opinion it's an absolute crime that Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Carol Lynley didn't all win Academy Awards -- or at least nominations -- because they are all superb. In fact, every performance is powerful and believable, adding to the drama and emotion and constantly pulling the viewer into the scene. Because of these performances, the film is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking... NOT because of the special effects (which are fantastic, incidentally, courtesy of the great L.B. Abbott).A good lesson in how NOT to involve the audience can be seen in the multi-million dollar turd of a remake, directed by some clueless idiot whose brain apparently works the way the aforementioned reviewer's does. In the remake, the effects are EVERYTHING and the cast is basically nothing. Not that Richard Dreyfus and the others don't do a good job. They do. But with the lame writing and unsympathetic characters, no one gives a crap. That's why the film failed.In ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" however, every scripted word counts, and every second of valuable screen time matters, dramatically moving the story along, building unbearable suspense and audience involvement. It's a great lesson in filmmaking, which clueless amateurs like Tarentino obviously never bothered to learn (as so painfully demonstrated in his latest snore-fest, ""The Hateful Eight.""As directed by the great Ronald Neame, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is not only the greatest of the 70s disaster films, it's one of the most dramatic and exciting adventure movies ever made."
199,"On New Years Eve a huge wall of water capsizes an ocean liner turning it upside down. A small group of people survive and have to work their way up to the bottom of the ship to survive. There's the lead a progressive priest (Gene Hackman), the bickering couple (Stella Stevens and Ernest Borgnine), the lonely guy (Red Buttons), the equally lonely girl (Carol Lynley), a ship steward (Roddy McDowell), an elderly couple (Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson) and a young brother and sister (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). And, in a dramatic role, Leslie Nielsen as the Captain.The characters are predictable and the dialogue is terrible but it doesn't really matter. The boat capsizing happened fairly quick (30 minutes in) and then the action and adventure kicks in and there's never a let-up. The special effects are still impressive even by today's standards (the boat capsizing is VERY good). Also, despite the bad dialogue, the entire cast is excellent in their roles. Stevens and Borgnine are especially funny. An excellent movie well worth seeing. Ignore the dreadful remake named ""Poseidon""."
200,"From the opening minutes, there's something listless, flat, and tone-deaf about this picture. And it only gets worse from there. Cardboard characters, ridiculous dialogue, and tepid direction distance the viewer from the action so that it all seems faintly absurd.It's fun to see Gene Hackman with long hair, but his part is completely unbelievable and his performance is hardly worth mentioning. Hackman is a terrific actor but no one could rescue this miserable script.When disaster finally strikes, it's hard to believe in what's going on. The setup is ineptly done, the tension doesn't build, and everyone is overacting so hysterically all you can do is laugh.I was so bored that halfway through the picture I switched to the Spanish soundtrack. This made things more interesting because the dialogue doesn't sound so idiotic in a foreign language, and as a student of Spanish, trying to follow the story gave me something to do while waiting for the movie to be over.I'll admit the picture does improve somewhat around the halfway point (or maybe it was just the Spanish lesson kicking in). Shelley Winters does emerge with a shred of dignity, but it's a tragedy that when she died, the newspaper stories all said she was best remembered for the Poseidon Adventure. Now we know how Judi Dench feels about being known for playing ""M"" in recent Bond flicks. Winters was a brilliant actress and this is hardly the best way to remember her. Still, she winds up being the closest thing to an actual person in this parade of cookie cutter characters.This isn't quite as bad as the abominable ""Earthquake"" but only just. Give me ""The Towering Inferno"" anytime."
201,"{SPOILERS}I actually bought this DVD as a second half of a 2 for $20 deal. I remember watching it as a kid on t.v. and being fascinated by it. It seemed so real!Now some 30 years later - well it's almost comedic - the over the top acting is a must see. Gene Hackman seems to yell all his lines, Borgnine couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in this one, Roddy McDowalls plunge and subsequent death by splashing water is marvelous, and Leslie Nielson, well lets just say this must be the role that inspired Airplane!Some other incredible moments - keep an eye on any time the survivors are walking anywhere - I swear it takes them 10 minutes to walk 10 feet. And my favourite - the ending where the rescuers find the group of 6 survivors and are more than happy to take off in their helicopter and leave behind anyone else who might be alive in the ship.This is a classic.And thank goodness we've come such a long way with movies in the last 30 years."
202,"In the wake of 2004-2005 Holiday season, to the worlds grief was an act of mother nature no one had any control....I work aboard a cruise ship and just gotten off of work, took a hot shower and flicked the television on to realize something went wrong while we festively celebrated on the ship....South East Asia what seemed to be in a disaster much worst than 911...I paused for a moment and try to grasp what really happened....Tsunami?....over the Holidays?...Only brought a cinematic classic to view, the Posideon Adventure...and I am on a ship...It would be a absurb to even fathom the idea as a remake to this movie and what a selfish act would even try to film a movie about a capsized ocean liner with people trying to make to the hule of the ship to survive....Then it hit me, it wouldn't be so much a bad idea....people may want to go out and see this movie in wake of the tsunami disaster, its a sense of understanding, and relief to others and it could be an escape for most people to try to logically understand how do we cope with death and survival....So my decided is GREEN LIGHT the remake since it's the latest trend and have this movie be a dedication to the survivors or possibly contribute to the red cross and make people be more aware.....Here is line up of cast that I would want: Keep it young and fresh, the Priest: Josh Brolin, The Siblings: Dakota Fanning & Freddie Highmore, The Cop & Prostitute Newly Weds: Jack Black & Paris Hilton, The Elder Couple: Miriam Ross (Mother from Happy Days) & Jack Nicholson, the singer: Lindsay Loham, Waiter: Kid from the ""Girl Next Door"" and single guy: Ryan Seacrest from American Idol.....or if anyone has a better selection.....God bless and speed to all the survivors in South Asia"
203,"Yes, its a classic film. Yes, it has Gene Hackman in it, and briefly Leslie Nielsen. Yes, there is no cgi, just good old fashioned special effects.But you can see the many differences to modern day films.All the women in the film seem to be of an hysterical nature, when faced with a dead body, water, a closing door, a ladder, a tunnel, a bridge, even the metal pipe banging to tell the outside world you're alive. Screaming, crying, telling the world they can't stand it. For some reason, none of the men were like this, even that annoying little brat.The main character, Gene Hackman is supposed to just be a preacher, but he also seems to be a ship engineer, knows which parts of the ship to go to over the other 100's of people. One thing he's not though, is good at first aid when someone has issues swimming.What's with all the shouting? No-one went further than 1 minute without shouting to each other. No matter if stood next to them, lets yell 'I'M RIGHT, YOU'RE ALL WRONG!!!!!' all the time."
204,"**Contains some spoilers**The Poseidon Adventure the 1972 is one of my favourite movies of all time. Few movies have moved me as much as this one. Everyone in the cast does an outstanding job. Gene Hackman was superb as was Ernst Borgnine. The movie should really be named The Poseidon Tragedy. Since pretty much everyone in the ship despite tremendous heroism dies. There is so much you can take away from the movie. Gene Hackman never giving up in spite of tremendous odds against them surviving is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity makes the ultimate sacrifice so even one person may eventually survive. You really feel for all the Characters in the movie who are all extremely selfless and likeable people and you feel for their loss. This movie is also true to life. There is no real happy ending. Only Pamela Sue Martin and her brother, Ernst Borgnine who wished he died in the ship with his wife rather than survive. This is a tremendous film. Puts into perspective what happens to people and how they are truly tested as people when tragedy and disaster strikes. The acting of Gene Hackman and Ernst Borgnine and their wives and partners were sublime. We are introduced to the lovely American actress Pamela Sue Martin who played Nancy Drew mystery television shows later in the decade and made a name for herself in American television. You really believed they the characters portrayed superbly acted by all concerned, lived the lives they led up to that point and what this disaster had done to them. I think the message of this movie is life is short it could be struck down at any time so make the most of it. Cherish your loved ones. Because you or your loved ones won't last forever."
205,"A passenger ship turns over at sea.According to the DVD of this film, Irwin Allen did not direct this movie, but he wanted to direct it, he was always sticking his nose in the sets, and giving out storyboards (sheets of paper with drawings of what each scene should look like) to the British director...who just ignored Irwin.However, Irwin would have his chance to direct the sequel, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure (1979), which I personally think is a wonderful film filled with interesting (and sometimes amusing) people. John Williams did not score the sequel but another less known composer did a reasonable score for ""Beyond"".So there you have it, you can't just see the first movie, you have to see them both, as they are both great...but stay clear of the 2006 remake just titled: Poseidon."
206,"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was THE blockbuster of its time, and for good reason: it had it all, from gifted actors giving solid performances (working from an excellent script, under the sure hand of a talented director) to some of the most realistic sets and fx to ever come sailing down the pike. When the wall of water was shown rumbling ominously toward us, I was quite literally on the edge of my seat. As the ship began to slowly tilt onto its side, one couldn't help but tilt one's head to follow the action. This was one of the most believable sequences I'd ever seen- and the thought that everyone was now UNDER WATER with no apparent way out was absolutely terrifying. Throughout the movie, the use of hand-held cameras (or tilted sets or whatever they did) lent the whole thing a degree of believability rarely found in feature films; I actually felt a touch of sea-sickness throughout. The subsequent struggle for survival- and the fact that only a handful of people would survive- helped make THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE one of my more vivid childhood memories. The intensity of the performances (as Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine, both utterly believable, went head-to-head every step of the way as the ship slowly sank) only enhanced the overall experience (lesser actors could've rendered the whole thing laughable, but here we had seasoned professionals giving outstanding performances). Why they chose to remake this one remains a mystery- and to do it badly, at that..."
207,"Like the film or not ""The Poseidon Adventur"" has an interesting history.Rather than another review (everyone has their own opinion) here's a bit of trivia for ""Titanic"" fans. The original 1911 version of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was actually being shown in the second class dining saloon the night of April 14th. Films were considered beneath most of the first class passengers but, of course, they were allowed to attend if desired. It began about 11PM and drew enough of an audience to have a repeat showing around midnight. Many times members of the orchestra would accompany the films. By the time the film was over (53 min. in length) viewers may have lost their lives as many of the lifeboats were already launchedThe film was based on the novel ""Futility"" by author Morgan Robertson published in 1898. Two of the film's stars were Donald Crisp and Arthur V. Johnson. Directed by John Emmerson. The title of the ill-fated ship in the book was named ""Titan"" quite a coincidence. Two evenings before the film shown was ""The Lighthouse Keeper"" with Mary Pickford. It proved popular and was shown again on the evening of the 13th. All the films scheduled for showing had nautical themes. So another bit of Poseidon/Titanic trivia. I'm a fan of this film and silent films and would love to see the 1911 version."
208,"There may be some implausibilities in the story, but The Poseidon Adventure is by far one of the better disaster movies I have seen.The special effects here are truly remarkable, as a matter of fact on a visual and technical level The Poseidon Adventure is flawless. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is crisp and the set pieces are lovingly-rendered. The direction is fine too, and the score is never overpowering but hugely effective and the script is intelligent.The acting is what makes the film though, special effects aside. Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Stella Stevens all give wonderfully poignant performances, but it is Gene Hackman who gives the best acting performance of the movie. Call me brash, but Hackman's performance could very well be the only component that is actually better than the special effects, if that was humanly possible, what I am saying is that Hackman is brilliant here. Overall, a very stylish and entertaining film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
209,"I'm sure this has happened to many viewers by now, but I saw Poseidon Adventure after I saw Wolfgang Peterson's remake. I'm not sure If that had any effect on my liking this one more or not, maybe a little. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are far more interesting than Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, and quite frankly, the special effects in the remake were not all that stunning. It feels like more work went into this movie, things are so much easier today with CG, and rather than eye candy, this movie aims at more dialog and character dimension. Well, it works.One night at sea, the luxury cruiser Poseidon, goes from being heaven to a hell hole when the ship is struck by a 'rogue wave' which flips it upside down. The few survivors led by the young preacher (Hackman) must work their way up to the hull (there a phrase you'd never expect to use when talking ships) in order to get out before the vessel floods and goes under.Peterson's version may have been more suspenseful, but suspense alone does not make a good thriller. This one paces itself a little more slowly giving it time to set up the characters, which of course is good. The only thing I didn't like about the pacing was the ending which was rushed by a couple of minutes I think. (I would've like to seen the ship go under just moment after our protagonists escape in dramatic fashion). That couldn't have been such a hard effect to do, wonder why it didn't happen.Oh well, nothing is perfect. Poseidon Adventure was the first major disaster flick, and even though I don't think it is one of the best, I strongly feel that movie goers who haven't seen it yet should do so, not simply for entertainment but to see where the sub genre of thriller took off from."
210,"The story of a cruise ship that is capsized by a rogue wave on New Years eve and the subsequent struggle by the survivors to escape from the now upside down ship.Part of the reason this may have succeeded certainly has to do with the originality of the concept, this was also the era of the disaster film.Featuring the typical disaster film all-star cast we have three Oscar winners; Gene Hackman, Shelley Winters and Ernest Borgnine. We also have Jack Albertson, Roddy McDowell, Red Buttons and a number of other well known performers. Produced by Irwin Allen the king of the 70's disaster film boom.The story's originality as well as some well developed suspense and some good performances combine to make this one of the better disaster flicks.The sequel and both of the recent remakes (on for TV and one on film) badly miss the mark.Nominated for a slew of Academy Awards and winning one for the song ""The Morning After""."
211,i think this was a decent movie.my favorite parts were the capsizing and the ballroom flooding.but couldn't the people in the ball room wait for the water to go high enough and go with the others?but i think it is pretty scary to see like 50 people drown.but i think its kinda lame that they didn't make a ship sink down to the bottom scene it would make the better.but all in all its a really good movie.but you see you enter this ballroom and you see all these beautiful people dressed in their gowns and suits so i think thats quite fitting.but if i was in a upside down ship id go with some people and make our through the top.yep i would
212,"The juxtaposition of Poseidon Adventure with Airport proves one thing: the only way to do a disaster film is over the top. Way over the top.Screw realism. Embrace the corniness! Don't try to ignore it with a suicidally serious series of performances (which, in the end, only makes it even more corny.) The Poseidon Adventure embraces what it is, and I love it. For the famous story of a ship turned upside down by a tidal wave we get Gene Hackman as a loud outspoken preacher born to lead these people out of the chaos, we get Ernest Borgnine a bitter (and somewhat naïve) detective screaming at the top of his lungs at Hackman, we get Shelley Winters pleading that she used to be a swimming champ and can finally help, and Red Buttons bonding with the comatose singer of the band whose depressed over the death of her brother and can't go on--you get the idea.Sure, the acting initially bugged me when I sat down to watch Poseidon Adventure for the first time in many many (many) years, but before too long it played into the overall charm. Without these performances and these actors the Poseidon Adventure had no hope of working at all. Period. It'd be as stale a ride as Airport.It's funny, but the tone of the acting and the fact the film is over the top gives a layer of light heartedness that opens the viewer up. I'll humor the film when it takes a stab at deeper, more thoughtful and heartfelt, moments. In another movie, I'd snore or moan over an elongated death scene, but with Poseidon Adventure I'll give it to them. If nothing else just to humor it. (hey, that's not a criticism. It's more than Airport has going for it.) If nothing else because Earnest Borgnine can snap like no man can snap and still entertain as he thrusts his finger towards Hackman accusingly and shouts--well, nevermind. I won't spoil that.The ship provides lots of visually interesting places to take the characters (and camera) through  from a ball room, up a Christmas tree, through a fiery kitchen, through a beautifully gritty and dirty engine room. And to make these already elaborate settings even more interesting to look at? Turn everything upside down. Maybe send a few stuntmen crashing through furniture, glass, into water.It's kind of a shame the movie fizzles out with a decent (but ultimately unsatisfying) matte shot of the overturned ship instead of some elaborately staged grand finale rescue. Then again, it makes for an appropriate mirror of the (unsatisfying) miniatures that set up the disaster. Minor visual disappointments serve as bookends for the film. But honestly, considering 30 years have passed I can't complain too much about the matte shot and miniatures.Actually, my biggest complaint against Poseidon is the convenience of the water level. It pours in after the stars have departed or (in a moment of suspense) right as they're about to leave for the next part of the adventure. While the presence of a constant threat helps keep the suspense up, the nature of this threat comes across as superficial and controlled  timed to sync up with moments when it really doesn't do any damage or really threaten.It's like the killer who's playing games in a thriller movie  one who could have killed the heroine five times but keeps the movie going because . . . because . . . there is no reason. He just does, okay?! The water in Poseidon Adventure was there, but not really a threat. It never rose, flooded, nor killed until predestined times  and it just drowns out any chance of suspense in a disaster film where supposedly anything can happen and anyone can die.But, really, who cares? Who cares if Linda is wearing high heels and barely anything else? Who cares if we get the ""if I'm not back in five minutes . . . ."" speech followed by the inevitable conclusion twice in the same film (both within five minutes of each other?) Who cares that there's no time to waste, but time for dramatic pauses? We get to hear Hackman justify a blind shot in the dark with the naïve, yet vaguely heroic statement, ""That's one inch thinner than two inches!"" Really, why else would anyone watch a disaster film?"
213,"I always wonder what makes people go to watch disaster movies. In fact saying that you enjoyed a disaster movie and watching people during a disaster should hardly be cheerful watching. Though like a lot of things, the reality is sometimes different. The Poseidon Adventure, like most disaster movies is fairly easy to know what is going to happen next, you know that some people survive and some don't, those that don't seem to be the ones that argue with the leader of the group (or star actor) who has always seem to have a knack of making the right decision. To a certain extent though I think these points can be fairly irrelevant as the 'enjoyment' comes from watching the journey beginning to end. Answering my question in the first line, i think like most people, when you watch a good disaster movie it can have a positive message in that no matter how bad things get there is often a way out. As for the film, I thought the acting was really good, the chemistry between the characters was good, though at times a little clichéd. And the 'special effects' were excellent for the early seventies. All in all I thought it was a very good film."
214,"I read the book first, and since I liked it, I was eager to see the movie. This was my first experience with watching something that had been adapted from a book, and I found the differences fascinating. In the end, I'd have to say the book was better, but this film, while a bit campy at times, is still pretty good.The plot is quite simple. The S.S. Poseidon, on its way across the Atlantic, encounters a huge wave which capsizes it. This happens pretty early in the movie, and the bulk of the action is about a group of survivors who were in the dining room at the time the ship capsized. While the officers among them tell them to stay put until help comes, the Rev. Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a man of action rather than contemplation, figures their best hope of escape is to head for the hull of the ship - specifically ""shaft alley"" where the hull is thinnest. Joining him are Det. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his abrasive wife, Linda (Stella Stevens), a former prostitute; Manny (Jack Albertson) and Belle (Shelley Winters) Rosen, on their way to Israel to see their grandson; Robin (Eric Shea) and Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) Shelby, on their way to join their parents in Greece; James Martin (Red Buttons), a haberdasher from Chicago; Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), the singer with the band; and Acres (Roddie McDowell), a steward. After they climb up the Christmas tree to the steward's passage to the kitchen, Rev. Scott's point is proved when the skylight in the dining room bursts, flooding the room. From then on, it's a race against fire, steam, and rising water to get to the hull so they can be rescued. It's also a guessing game as to who will survive, and who won't.Paul Gallico's novel was a very cerebral book, and that aspect of it wouldn't have translated well to the screen. In order to keep the pacing up, the writers left a lot of those elements out of the book. The movie suffers a little for this, and at times becomes a little campy. On the whole, though, the choices were fairly solid, and the pacing is good, and the obstacles faced exciting.The acting is good, but then the movie boasts a competent cast. Hackman isn't really believable as a priest, but he plays a man of action to perfection. Borgnine's tough exterior works well for Rogo, and his hurt at losing his wife is beautifully handled. Stevens' manages to make Linda a likable character - no small feat if you've ever read the book. Winters does a great job in playing a Jewish grandmother. Albertson, however, seems to phoning his part in. Lynley's shell shocked performance of Nonnie works, for the most part. Red Buttons enthusiasm works quite well. Martin's love struck teenager is a bit over the top. And Shea's precocious kid is a nice mix of both adorable, and annoying traits.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't raise the same kinds of questions that the book does about how ordinary people fare in an extraordinary situation. What is does do is entertain, and that it does well."
215,"Like many here (and on other sites)I am a die-hard fan of Irwin Allen's 'The Poseidon Adventure'. I was 9 years old when the film was released by 20th Century-Fox, and I can clearly recall being figuratively glued to the TV screen whenever the trailer was shown. Likewise, I would turn up the radio when ad spots for the film came on. I also scanned the newspapers and would ""Ooooh!"" and ""Aaaaah!"" over the print ads. I truly think I drove my family insane - or, they thought ME insane - for my obsession with this film, even before it was released! In short, my older brother took me to see it here in Toronto in 1972 - and I was HOOKED, and continue to be so. I remember leaving the theatre literally shaking from the experience.I cannot explain my illogical yet very real attachment to this film. HOW many times did I play 'TPA' in our family swimming pool? HOW many times did I drive my mom insane by flipping over the couch and knocking over the dining room chairs while creating my own capsize experience? LOL. Great memories. That said, I loved the art direction and the whole 'feel' of the film - you truly felt as if you were on-board the S.S. Poseidon. Incidentally, this film, after 'Alien', has the BEST tag line ever - ""Hell, Upside Down"".John Williams score for the film - classic, haunting. The music is so ""sea adventure""! William Creber's art design - Superlative. Special effects - Still hold up. This was BEFORE friggin computer generation. THIS is the REAL McCoy, folks. Kurt Russell? Richard Dreyfus?....and the rest who - will someone please tell me WHO the HELL these people are - please. Mr. Petersen, with all due respect, the whole success and longevity the original Irwin Allen film enjoys is MAINLY BECAUSE of the all-star, stellar (including Stella - *wink*) cast! Not only just 'stars' - this cast contained ACTORS and ACTRESSES. Also, in my opinion, another reason the 1972 version is still spellbinding is because of the awesome (and manually created) special effects. The computer generated crap is just that - crap. Give me Linda Rogo - ""Mike, I saw a young officer on deck the other day - and he looked pretty DAMN familiar - even with his clothes on!"" *Stella Stevens (Who has also played a NUN in ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" - ROCKS! Give me Mike Rogo - ""Do you know what it means to be invited to sit at the Captain's table - on New Years Eve? I'll tell ya what that means - it means the whole idea of those women looking down on ya is a lot of bull!"" *Ernest Borgnine RULES! Give me Reverend Scott - ""Pray to that part of God within you - and that part of God will be fighting with you - all the way."" *Gene Hackman is IT! Give me Belle Rosen - ""No. When we get to Israel, we're staying put. Just think - our grandson is 2 years old already, and talking - we've never even seen him."" *Rest in peace, Shelley Winters. You had a lot of guts, lady - a lot of guts. Give me Mannie Rosen - ""He runs on time, like a train - ahh, you and trains!"" (Can someone explain WHAT the hell this man was talking about here? LOL) *Jack Albertson - I loved you in ""Willy Wonka"" - I loved you in TPA - a class act. Give me Susan Shelby - ""That's heavy, Robin - r e a l heavy."" - NOTE: Pammie, LOVED your fire engine red hot pants and great legs! Also loved the way you and Ernie Orsati boogied down on the dance floor in the ballroom! BIG KISS for Pammie! *Oh, Pamela, how do I love thee? I worship at your Susan Shelby altar. ............ahem.... Give me Robin Shelby - ""I've surfed up to 18 feet - but these look more like 30."" *What the hell ever became of Eric Shea? Anyone? Give me Nonnie - ""Teddy, wake up - there's something we have to do."" *Carol Lynley - blonde, go-go booty-licious - a fine actress. Give me Martin - ""I would have danced to his music - if I had had someone to dance with."" *Red Buttons - gotta love that name! Give me Acres - ""There is no other exit from this area, sir."" *Roddy rules, too Give me Captain Harrison - ""You irresponsible bastard."" ""The Poseidon is too fine a lady to be rushed to the junkyard on her last voyage!"" *Leslie Neilsen - a fellow Canadian - and what a guy! Give me Linarcos - ""Your job is to deliver this ship where we want it - WHEN we want it!"" ""Now, order FULL AHEAD"". - Hsssssssssssssssssssssss! *What was this actor's name? - it momentarily escapes me. Give me Irwin Allen - ""Look, Shelley, you're gonna HAVE to haul your not fat enough ass over to the Brown Derby, and EAT! I wanna FAT Belle - and DON'T start teaching ME about the actors studio method, in case you forgot, Ms. Winters, I AM the producer here, and Mr. Neame is the director!

216,"Billed as ""One of the greatest escape adventures ever"", this unique (not to mention trend-setting!) film remains one of the greatest examples of the 1970's disaster film cycle and still has a rabid (and deserved) cult following. On New Years Eve, the S.S. Poseidon, an aged ocean liner in the midst of it's final voyage to Greece, is struck by a massive tidal wave, turning it upside-down. Revelers in the main dining salon find themselves in an air pocket several stories underwater and have to navigate their way upwards through the bowels of the burning, sinking ship as the water pours in after them. Renegade priest Hackman leads the way and is followed by NYC cop Borgnine and his mouthy ex-hooker wife Stevens, teens Martin and Shea who are traveling alone, meek bachelor Buttons, folk singer Lynley, crew member McDowall and Jewish retiree Albertson along with his loving, but hefty, wife Winters. Personalities clash as Hackman and Borgnine debate the best way out while young Shea interjects tidbits of info he's gathered as a nautical enthusiast. An atmosphere of tension, offset by occasional bits of sarcasm and silliness, hangs over the film until the remaining survivors can reach the hull where they hope a rescue crew will be waiting. Hackman, though he now discounts the film (purportedly due to dissatisfaction with his appearance, but likely also due to the lack of prestige the genre has engendered), gives a strong, intense, committed performance. One of his best scenes involves his genuine grief at the loss of a fellow passenger. Borgnine is gruff and loud, making for some ear-splitting repartee between him and Hackman, but also gives a solid performance. Stevens is remarkable and sexy. She manages the impossible, which is to add appeal to a character who was irredeemable in the novel the film is based upon. Buttons' character enjoys the greatest contrast as he goes from a timid, stuttering mouse to a leader of sorts. Lynley is luminously attractive at times, but her character's whiny, helpless nature can be grating. McDowall isn't given much to do, but offers as much as he can. Martin is unseasoned, especially vocally, but mostly appealing while Shea thankfully loses his early brattiness and winds up rather sweet. Albertson is a tender, kind presence, but it's Winters who walks off with the film. Rarely (at least at that time) has an actress so publicly forsaken her modesty to sink her teeth into a role that involves gaining several dozen pounds and then having that weight made fun of and displayed flagrantly during underwater scenes. Apart from that, Winters gives a strikingly heartfelt performance, fretting over the grandson she's never seen and wishing survival for the small clatch of people she's been thrown together with. Her pivotal scene comes when the passengers must swim an unknown maze of murk and metal and the intensity, passion and heart that she brings to this sequence is astonishing to behold. It very nearly won her a third Oscar. Smaller roles are essayed by O'Connell as a more traditional priest and Nielson as the Captain (who later spun his ability to play straight-faced parts like this into comic gold.) The film has several flaws including some really tacky dialogue, but that only makes it all the more fun when seen today. No one can cuss like Stevens and most every line she has is a hoot! The special effects are unequalled. It takes CGI and other trickery now to create what was done by good old-fashioned stunt people and craftsmen then. Those are real people falling and crashing around, folks! Adding an interesting level to the film is the Biblical symbolism spread throughout. Hackman, as a Jesus figure, gains disciples and carries a Christmas tree on his shoulder as if it's the cross. Only those who believe in him can survive and they must all endure a trial by fire and a baptism. Borgnine serves as a Doubting Thomas while Stevens represents a Mary Magdalene figure. Followed by a preposterous sequel seven years later and remade into an inane mini-series more than thirty years later, Hollywood still wasn't finished trying to top it as a big screen remake emerged in 2006. It was doomed from the start as Stevens' and Winters' characters weren't even included, though perhaps the makers knew there was no point in trying to top them. The original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" will always be revered by its fans as a classic piece of escapism, warts and all, affecting them on a visceral level that borders on obsession (see the fan club site!)"
217,"My all-time favourite movie! I first saw Poseidon when I was 12 years old and luckily taped it. Since then I must have seen it thousands of times. I don't know what it is about this film but I just cannot get enough of it.The stand-out performance for me here comes from Stella Stevens as the acid-tongued reformed hooker Linda. This woman spends most of the film in a grimy pink shirt with running mascara and haphazard hair but looks absolutely gorgeous - despite those clunky silver platforms!! I love the shot of Linda slouched in the bottom left of the screen swilling from a whisky bottle while Ernest Borgnine and Jack Albertson are debating whether to ditch Gene Hackman and follow the doctor and the nurse in the bee-hive wig! Carol Lynley quite often gets a bagging for whining but I thought it a good performance as she wasn't really given a lot to work with script-wise and yet turned Nonnie into a memorable character (even if sometimes I did want to leave her there blubbering in the air shaft!) Gene Hackman's performance for me was a little over-the-top and as others have noted, he shouts....A LOT....Roddy McDowall and Arthur O'Connell didn't really get enough screen time to stand out much. Red Buttons is good, but I can just see Gene Wilder as fantastic Martin, a perfect role for him, and of course everybody loves Shelley Winters as the kindly and cuddly Belle Rosen.An absolute classic which will always have a special place in my heart."
218,"******** Very Mild Spoilers  ******************************Some great actors sail on the Poseidon, but ultimately it sinks.  This is a fun popcorn movie, but that's about it.  The concept of the movie is great. The idea of people being trapped in a boat which is upside down is interesting and fun to watch.  I like the beginning of the movie with Leslie Nielsen.    However, the characters in the movie and some of their dialogue is inane. The characters played by Gene Hackman and Stella Stevens are the two which are most over the top.  It is so campy in places, it is unintentionally funny.  Actually, Gene Hackman's character being a minister made no sense and the scene where he preaches at a church service on the deck of the Poseidon is absurd and insulting.  And Stella Stevens was schizoid and grating in her role.  Nobody could be as dumb and one dimensional as her character.  At times, it feels like the movie is trying to convey some profound message about humanity, which spoils the movie because it's much too pretentious for this movie.The Poseidon works best when it is a straight forward disaster flick.  When it tries to be more, it doesn't work at all.  Kudos to Red Buttons and Jack Albertson for fine performances."
219,"I strongly suspect either Mrs. Irwin Allen was considerably younger than Mr. Irwin Allen or he at least wished that were the case because except for Manny Rosen (whose wife is the same age and chubby, but incredibly saintly), every guy has a waaaay younger, waaaay hotter lady hitting on him. Two of them sporting hot pants, no less! Not only do studly macho men like Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine and Gene Hackman have women 20+ years their junior to rescue and comfort, but they get to chew lots of scenery. While spouting lots and lots of self-righteous, pompous dialogue. What more could a middle-aged to old man ask for? I honestly would have preferred (and believed) Roddy McDowel paired with Carol Lynley. Though Roddy was only 9 years younger than Red, Roddy looked like he was 30 years' Red's junior, his character had already spent time gazing dreamily at Carol Lynley's ""Nonnie"" (was that meant to be some swingin' singer name?)and they actually had chemistry together (Carol and Red didn't do such a hot job of hiding their mutual dislike).I found the references to Stella Stevens' hooker past hilarious. Guys ""looked familiar"". Really??? She remembered her tricks from her street walking days? And they remembered her? This was especially entertaining when she talked about a ""young officer"" who looked familiar. If he was young and this was recent, why was he paying for your rapidly whithering butt, Stella (sorry, but she was 36 at the time and looks at least 10 years past that)??? And if this was more of a distant past thing, then I'm sure he doesn't remember you and eeeewwww, child molestation.I also loved how hip, radical Reverend Gene always wore his turtleneck and jacket---lest you forget he was a hip, radical reverend (or maybe he just wanted to be Banacek).All in all, entertaining in a campy, silly, overacted to the max way."
220,"""The Morning After"" was an incongruous choice for the theme to a disaster movie about a ship turned upside down, yet it fits ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to a tee. Not only do the hopeful lyrics mirror the situation faced by Rev. Scott and the ship's other survivors seen in the film, but it alerts you right up front you are in for a kitschy, cheesy time.On New Year's Eve, the S.S. Poseidon is hit by a giant wave in the middle of the ocean, capsizing the ship. Among the survivors are ten people, led by Rev. Scott (Gene Hackman), who believe their best chance lies in climbing up the upside-down vessel to the engine room, where the hull is thinnest. Will there be a morning after?The answer depends on which member of the all-star cast you are talking about. Will that sweet bachelor with the bow tie played by Red Buttons make it? How about the pretty girl in the red hot pants (Pamela Sue Martin)? They wouldn't kill Shelley Winters, would they? Or Jack Albertson, who plays her doting husband? It's the sort of formula that turned up later in ""Murder She Wrote"": When everyone in the cast is a star, it's harder to guess who lives and who dies.You never forget you are watching a movie viewing ""The Poseidon Adventure."" In a way, this is fine. You don't always need to be sold on the reality of a film you are seeing, sometimes you can get as much enjoyment wondering what it was like to shoot the picture, the backstage arguments, the catering, hassles over scary stunts, etc. But ""Poseidon Adventure"" really leans on this indulgence.In the most famous scene in the movie, when a passenger falls backwards into a giant window, you can't help but see the crash pads beneath the candy glass, a lazy bit of editing. The script doesn't trust you to figure out who the mono-dimensional characters are; instead Scott introduces himself as ""angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade."" When arguing with a passenger played by Ernest Borgnine, Scott suggests that ""we're two of a kind, and you don't like looking at yourself."" Huh?Watching the ship's captain call someone ""you irresponsible bastard"" shouldn't be a laugh-getter, but it is because that's Leslie Nielsen playing the captain and he's doing that same deadpan he later perfected in comedies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun.""The best thing about ""Poseidon Adventure"" is Stella Stevens, who plays Borgnine's hot and whiny wife with real gusto. Unlike five of her castmates, she hadn't won an Oscar, but she seems the most energized, giving a lively performance without going overboard a la Hackman and Borgnine. ""I'm going next, so if old fat ass gets stuck, I won't be caught behind her,"" she says, one of many weight jokes poor Winters has to endure. Plus, wearing only a shirt and panties, Stevens makes otherwise dull ladder-climbing scenes quite stimulating.To say ""Poseidon Adventure"" isn't entertaining would be wrong. It's professionally put together, vividly acted, and satisfying in its big-movie way. But it wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is with people today if it wasn't for its high camp value, the polyester and perms redolent with the aura of the early '70s not to mention that Maureen McGovern AM classic that binds the whole thing together.""Did you like his music?"" asks the singer holding her dead guitar-playing brother. Lines like that make ""Poseidon Adventure"" so bad it's good, or good it's bad. No wonder the ship turned over!"
221,"I was a teenager in the 1970s and this film turned me off cruising or package travel for life! Because of the people I might meet. I have no idea how Hollywood gathered the cast of stars together, but they are terrible. The camp over-acting; the totally unsympathetic characters and the ham-fisted editing meant that it should have sunk without trace (dragging the Towering Inferno down with it, please). It took Gene Hackman and Hollywood a decade to recover. Do I care for any of the cast? Absolutely not! The rescue party should have gone to the pub and read a better script. The producers must have been selling ice to the Inuit and coal to Newcastle to pull this off. The delightful Shelley Winters never got out of the disaster mode and deserves a more dignified memory. Avoid!"
222,"Classic 70's disaster movie that seemed to be predominant at the time.Some big sets that nowadays kind of remind me of a theme park. Classic Hackman acting, seems all his roles at about that time were similar.Which leads me on to the shouting.. the continuous head to head with Borgnine is a headache to be honest and made the 'mute' button useful for once. Was annoying.Good Sunday afternoon viewing whilst the roast is cooking though."
223,"From that time in movie history where our desire to build bigger and better things led us to make films that devoted their entire time do destroying those big and better things, and the Poseidon Adventure has gone down in history as one of the greatest disaster movies of all time. For me personally, it's a very good film, but there are some things that drag it down (pun possibly intended).What's the cauliflower? The film follows the passengers and crew of the SS Poseidon, sailing through the Mediterranean on its final voyage before decommissioning. On New Year's Eve the ship is at full sail, but in order to meet schedule the representative of the Shipping Line insists that the ship continues on course without taking on ballast, to the unsuccessful protest of the Captain. As night falls the passengers gather in the ballroom for their New Year's Party, but reports come in of an undersea earthquake that has triggered a massive Tsunami, which strikes the ship causing it to capsize because it's too top-heavy, leaving the entire vessel floating but upside down. The film follows a handful of survivors as they attempt to make their way to the thinnest part of the ship's hull in the hope that they can be rescued, dodging death on their slowly sinking vessel every step of the way!To me, the film is very very good at building the tension, the fact that these people are trapped inside a giant metal coffin with no way out. They have no idea whether going to their destination will result in the rescue, but that thin slither of hope keeps them going through all odds, and that's what keeps you gripped. You want to see these people escape, and you find it genuinely tragic when many of them die, some more suddenly than others.I do however have some peeves. One is the whole idea of the ship being stuck upside down like that. I somehow get the feeling that the vessel would still sink, with what air is trapped in the hull just finding a weakness and bursting through to let more water in. But that's technical shipbuilding babble that nags me.The other problem is that some of the acting does get a little corny at times, with some of the performances going a little over-the-top. Indeed a romantic relationship between two of the characters is a bit hard to comprehend as well, and ultimately leads to nothing.But other than that, the rest of the film is a very intense, very gripping thriller about escaping what can be some people's interpretation of hell. The sets and locations built to replicate the inner workings of the vessel are done perfectly, making you truly believe that you're actually in the bowels of an upturned ship. The action scenes are also quite poignant, keeping you on the edge of your seat as they dodge death at every turn, from boiling vats of water, to bursting bulkheads and collapsing pieces of the ship's interior.On the whole, as a survival thriller movie I'd say definitely give it a watch!"
224,"In the 1970's, disaster movies took a toll on American cinema. New Hollywood directors were already starting to make movies that they wanted to see. Directors such as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Bob Rafelson and others were making movies that would launch them into stardom. Disaster movies also launch people into stardom. But, one particular director did get recognition for his body of work in the 1970's by creating some of the best disaster movies of all time. His name? Irwin Allen.Allen was a producer who's nickname was the ""Master of Disaster"". One of his earliest motion pictures was Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1961. Because ""Voyage"" was a big hit in 1961, Allen decides to make movies and by the early 70's, he hit the jackpot. By 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was one of the high-grossing movies at that time. It took a while to get the movie off the ground. And doing so wasn't a easy task.The movie tells the story of a luxury ocean liner called the S.S Poseidon, en route from New York to Athens. Among the many passengers on the S.S Poseidon are: Reverand Scott (Gene Hackman), policeman Mike Rogo, (Ernest Borgnine), an shy and meek bachelor, (Red Buttons), an elderly Jewish couple, (Jack Alberton and Shelly Winters), and a brother and sister, (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). All of these characters aboard the S.S Poseidon are celebrating New Year's Eve that night.Just after midnight, the ship's crew and passengers's celebration soon came to a stop when a 90 foot tidal wave, capsizing the ship, sending the passengers, crashing down on what used to be the ship's ceiling. Once the ship capsizes, the remaining survivors must race against time as the liner starts to fill with water. Along the way, the few remaining passengers must work their way toward the engine room in order to escape. The obstacles that they have to cross are the hot and steamy kitchen, the flooded smokestack, claustrophobic vents and pipes and underwater passageways.The Poseidon Adventure is based on a best-selling novel by Paul Gallico. Gallico based his novel on a incident he had on the RMS Queen Mary. The movie though is not excellent nor four-star material. But, it does work for a few reasons. One of them is the visual effects. The F/X are very convincing and very exciting as the ship capsizes although in some exterior shots of the ship, it looks at as if the makers of the movie used a miniature ship instead of a real ship. What I like about The Poseidon Adventure is the sheer camp style of the movie itself. Disaster movies are not really movies that you would overpraise because of the number of stars that they used, but what does makes sense is that they are equivalently exciting as a popcorn movie. This is one of those films where even though today, it looks dated, it can still be enjoyed and still be loved for a very long time.The performances though, aren't really Oscar caliber. Hackman at that time in 1972, had already won the Oscar for The French Connection. I wonder why he would signed on to a picture like this. Ernest Borgnine holds the second best-remembered performance in the movie as the grumpy and profane policeman, who's wife is a prostitute. Even some of the supporting cast like Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Pamela Sue Martin and even Lesile Neilson as the captain does their best to back up the two leading stars.The art direction and set design of the ship is very convincing and very well-done. Even when the ship capsizes, I could tell that the set design was sort of bearing down on some of the actors because of the damages on the costumes.The Poseidon Adventure was the earliest template of what a disaster movie should have. In order to make one successful, you would to round up the best actors that we have in the industry and have them play interesting or no interesting characters and have them either escape though a sinking ship or escape from a burning building. Now, of course, you might say to yourselves, ""Isn't that a bad idea?"" ""Is it a bad idea to have actors do as much physical work instead of acting?"" Sometimes yes and sometimes no. But what does come out of it is that disaster movies are basically plugged in plots and characters. The Poseidon Adventure is the perfect example. On a level of camp, it works. But as a spectacular motion picture, it doesn't work. The reason why is that because disaster movies, in my opinion, don't need to exceed excellence. A few examples of bad disaster movies that I think failed to excite me or intrigue me are The Hindenburg, When Time Ran Out, Earthquake, Aiport 1975, Airport '77 and The Concorde: Aiport '79.After the success of The Poseidon Adventure, Allen continue to work throughout the 1970's. His next big-budget disaster movie was The Towering Inferno, released in 1974. In my opinion, both The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno are probably the two best disaster movies of this particular era. After those two, I don't think Irwin Allen would repeat the same for his other pictures that he produced. His last two pictures were When Time Ran Out in 1980 and The Swarm in 1978. Both films were disaster movies that failed. By that time, disaster movies had ran out of ideas by the early 1980's. But The Poseidon Adventure didn't ran out of ideas for Allen. ★★★ 3 stars."
225,"The Poseidon Adventure was one of those movies where you just sit back, don't have to think and just watch the movie. It is one of those typical disaster movies, made during the 1970's through 1980's. How ironic that movies have come full circle and we are seeing these things being re-made. I found this movie enjoyable, with average, sometimes too much acting (with the exception of Gene Hackman). The movie sometimes becomes too dramatic, or sometimes not enough, and even though the movie was suppose to be really suspenseful, the story lacks any feelings for the character, like James Camron's ""Titanic"". If you see it on late night cable, and have never seen it, I would recommend it ,otherwise it wasn't anything special."
226,"Disaster movies were extremely popular in the '70's. It's really too bad that most of those disaster movie feel terribly outdated today, even at times laughable. Especially the over-dramatized moments and characters are ridicules. Unfortunately ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is no exception. All the typical over-dramatized elements and characters are present here but still this movie remains perfectly watchable today mainly thanks to Hackman's performance and the nice set decorations.Isn't it funny? In almost every disaster movie there are the same type of characters. The main character is always an average Joe that slowly turns into an hero. Other typical characters that are always present in a disaster movie are an elderly couple, annoying kids and a just married/fallen in love couple. No, the characters are not what makes ""The Poseidon Adventure"" a good movie to watch. What makes the movie truly interesting is the adventurous story in which the main group of characters have to find a way to the propeller shaft which is their only hope of escape from the up-side-down ship. The fact that the ship is up-side-down provides some nice and also original, tense moments.The whole sequences in which the ship capsizes is one to remember...because it's extremely laughable. I know, I am ashamed of myself. It was supposed to be a dramatic and shocking scene but I couldn't help laughing when the camera made those weird movements and those people pretended to be falling down when in fact they were just standing still. Seriously, it was almost slapstick like!Hackman is awfully good as the main character Reverend Scott. Looking at this movie it was pretty obvious that it was made in his ""The French Connection"" period. The rest of the cast never succeeds in making their character really likable or emotionally involving enough, with the excepting of Leslie Nielsen's role as the Captain perhaps but his role is unfortunately too small. Not many people realize this but in the period when Nielsen still played serious roles, instead of in silly comedies, he was a pretty good and talented actor. He kind of ruined his own career by appearing only in silly comedies these days.This movie is best watchable if you're a fan of disaster movies. I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of those and the only disaster movie from the '70's I really like is ""The Towering Inferno"" but still this movie is a good second on my list.And for what it's worth, it's in my opinion on par with ""Titanic"" from 1997.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
227,I remember watching The Poseidon Adventure a couple of times when i was a kid growing up in the seventies and i remember it as a superb action movie. Time is not always good to movies and it hasnt been to kind to this. The film has dated a lot and when i was a kid i remember this being very exciting.......not now. The acting seems over the top and some of the decisions made by the survivors seem stupid. I love most most movies with Gene Hackman in but this is not one of his best although the performance from Shelly Winters is good. Nostalga is not all it's cracked up to be. 6 out of 10.
228,"Well, this is definately *not* ""Titanic"", but its a good movie nonetheless. The main characters are fun to watch because their behavior is so outrageous.  The hysterical hippie chick was a little annoying, though. This was a very exciting movie that is probably the best of the Disaster Movie Era, even though I was humming ""My Heart Will Go On"" during some parts."
229,"In the waning days of 1972, people flocked to theaters to see THE big movie of the Christmas season, a little item called ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  As a result of this film's remarkable success and the success of ""The Towering Inferno"" two yuletides later, producer Irwin Allen would become known as ""the king of disaster films.""  The disaster in ""Poseidon"" is the capsizing, by way of a tidal wave, of a luxury liner on a New Year's Eve cruise.  The tidal wave occurs early on in the film, but not early enough to spare us from some horribly scripted, as well as badly acted, scenes introducing the main characters:  a police detective whose wife, a former prostitute, is ashamed of her past and worries that every man she meets may be a former customer; a maverick reverend and his more traditionally minded colleague; a sexy blonde lounge singer; the old couple who spout cliches about life and love; the teenage girl and her brat sibling who knows more about the workings of the vessel than the captain; and, of course, the captain himself, who, as played by Leslie Nielson, is cut from the same cardboard as the characters he so memorably lampooned in ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" years later.  Like a good captain, Nielson goes down with his ship, perhaps out of loyalty, perhaps because he read the script which bears the names of Stirling Silliphant, an Oscar winner for ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and Wendall Mayes, probably an Oscar winner for the only good film he wrote, too (I haven't a clue as to what film that would be).Gene Hackman, fresh from winning both stardom and an Oscar for ""The French Connection,"" may have seen this turkey for what it was:  a means of solidifying his box-office clout with what looked to be a major commercial hit.  Today, I can't help but think he is embarrassed by the melodramatic proceedings and the atrocious dialogue.  Except for Carol Lynley, who, as the sexy blonde singer is both sexy and blonde though not a singer (she lip-synchs the Oscar winning song, ""The Morning After""), Hackman provides the main reason for watching the Ronald Neame directed film.  As the maverick reverend who leads the survivors through the Poseidon's maze of corridors and plumbing as they make their way to the ship's bottom (which is now on top), he is so full of energy that it's surprising that any old tidal wave would have the nerve to topple a ship upon which he is travelling. Hackman may be our greatest film actor, but even he can't carry off some of the dialogue he spits out.  ""How many lives?"" he shouts, presumably addressing either God or the ship itself.  ""How many lives must be sacrificed?""  Hackman could have substituted ""lives"" with ""talent,"" and directed the question to the producers who are so willing to misuse the abilities of Hollywood's finest for such drivel.Shelley Winters, an Oscar nominee for her role, gives her all, as do Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, and Pamela Sue Martin.  On the other hand, young Eric Shea, the smart-mouthed brat, should have been muzzled and drowned before the first reel ran out.  Is he someone's idea of cute?The so-called ""disaster"" cycle that ""Poseidon"" started continued for years, but that was likely due more to the studios having planned new productions years in advance, since after Allen's ""Towering Inferno,"" the audience turned its back on the genre, preferring modest dramas like ""Rocky,"" and space epics such as ""Star Wars"" to stories of capsized boats and burning buildings.  Most of Allen's later films bombed so badly that his 1980 effort, ""The Day the World Ended,"" was re-titled ""When Time Ran Out"" in the hope of deemphasizing its connection to the genre, but even that didn't help.  The film, starring a shameless Paul Newman, was barely released.  But we still have ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" as well as ""The Towering Inferno,"" to demonstrate that cardboard characters should be kept away from both water, which leaves them soggy and easy to tear apart, and fire, which makes them burn."
230,"This film is absolute TRIPE! Despite a stellar cast, this film fails miserably. The entire premise of the film is a total impossibility. The cast tries, they really do, but the story stinks and the film sinks (pun intended). I hated it and you will too. It's simply too farfetched to be enjoyable. If it were sci-fi, it would be better since we'd expect impossible things, but this isn't sci-fi and the result is a completely dismissable film. Bah! Rot!"
231,"The film seems implausible to me and the plot flawed. A 90' wave is unlikely to be caused by an earthquake (yes, a vast moving mass of water, but not very high, is what causes a Tsunami, but would not be a threat to a liner in the middle of an ocean). And freak waves that high probably impossible in the med. Electricity and water equals sparks and fusing, yet everything in the film is light. However, what shines through in the script is the complex nature of the characters and the development of this and the nuances, and what really makes it watchable is the star quality of the acting."
232,It's been a few years since I watched the Poseidon Adventure and I got to say it hasn't aged as well as I'd hoped. That's not to say I thought it was a total stinker. I sat through the whole DVD only fast forwarding from time to time. The story got me in but I felt it was weighed down by all too regular histrionics from the characters. It was as if cast members were directed to go over the top to give each scene added punch. All I felt it did was slow down plot progression and undermine the credibility of the characters. It's a real shame too as this film had a very talented cast. I'm a big Gene Hackman fan and can only guess how much worse this flick would have been without him. Other notables such as Ernest Borgnine & Shelley Winters were capable of much better work.
233,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of those films I'd always meant to watch but never got around to.  Starring a `Who's Who' of prolific 1950's-1970's actors, (Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine & Gene Hackman) it was pretty much the disaster film that started the trend of that decade. The plot is simple:  An enormous wave capsizes an ocean liner, killing all but a handful of passengers who must now climb their way up to the bottom of the ship if they have any hope of rescue.This was an action/suspense film that didn't try to be anything else.  There was really no back story and no character development  when someone died, the viewer's level of shock or sadness can pretty much only be gauged by the amount of time they had spent in the film at that point.   Some of the sets were kind of cheesy looking, but I can forgive that based on the genre. Most importantly, it did what suspense/action films *should* do, and that is move along at a good pace.  I cannot think of an instance where I noticed a lag in the pacing. All told, The Poseidon Adventure is a decent film  certainly not anything poignant or profound, but a good action flick with some great scene chewing by Hackman and an opportunity to see an ultra-buff Borgnine in action.--Shelly"
234,This did not have a very good story line. I do not knew why people like it. It is just boring. I do not knew why it got a 7.1. That is just overrating it. I give it 4 out of 10. Because it is pooh pooh. Stinky stinky pooh pooh. It is find of sad and not fun to watch. It is very slow. I can not believe the same man who wrote a great film like The Swarm wrote this pooh pooh adventure. There should call it The Poseidon Adventure they should call it the pooh pooh adventure. Good actors wasted there talent being in this awful movie. Do not wast your time. And do not wast your money. Do not see this awful movie. It very boring. There so many movie out there better then this one. Do not see it. It is not an adventure it is an argument between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnie. The Poseidon Argument that is what they could have called it.
235,"Arthur Haley should have written this one and called it 'Ship'.
The stock characters, artfully designated in the opening frames are no longer drawn from the ethnic range, but there's just as much bilge, just as little ballast in the Poseiden selection. Thus Gene Hackman, activist preacher, all thumbs and mouth; Ernst Borgnine, red neck detective(she was the only thing I ever loved); Steila Stevens, gritty hooker (get outta her you s.o.b.); Carol Lynely, whining rock singer (I can't I can't), Red Buttons, haberdasher with heart (you can you can); and Shelly Winters heavy Jewish grandmother (That's what life is all about). For preg kid of the year, Eric Shea who masterminds the escape, but with respect, sir, the most exciting sea drama ever filmed - ain't."
236,"There is a moment soon after the capsizing of the good ship Poseidon when the movie seems on the verge of subverting expectations or at least complicating its message. Gene Hackman, playing a brash, new-age preacher who has recently given a sermon to the effect that God helps those who helps themselves, is conversing with an older, traditionalist priest in the ship's ruined ballroom. The older priest is comforting the wounded, the old, and the dying: people who cannot make it out. Hackman tries to get the priest to come with him and a handful of other survivors, saying that in flight there is hope, while those left behind will meet certain death. The priest replies that Hackman's God is the God of the strong, but for his part he will not abandon the weak. It is a moving moment, and one that almost gives Hackman's character pause... but no. This kind of flick rewards strength, and pities and punishes weakness. Hackman declares with unshakeable confidence that the masses are doomed unless they follow his lead, and of course he is right because he speaks with the most authority. From this moment onward the movie follows the most predictable path toward the most predictable ends. Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, and an against-type Leslie Nielson bring some likability to the proceedings, just enough to make the movie watchable."
237,"The movie that answered the question, ""Will Shelley Winters float?"" (The answer is ""yes"").""Airport"" (1970) introduced the world to the all-star disaster movie, and they only got more and more ridiculous from that point on. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is pretty good in a cheesy, riotously corny sort of way. This all-star cast includes Gene Hackman as perhaps cinema's only action hero priest (take that Bing Crosby!), Ernest Borgnine as a detective, Leslie Nielsen as captain of the oceanliner Poseidon, Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson as a frumpy Jewish couple, and a bunch of others, like Red Buttons and Roddy McDowall, who seemed to make a living from appearing as guest stars in movies like this. There's the required movie ballad (in this one it's ""The Morning After,"" sung at a New Year's Eve party in one of the clunkiest examples of foreshadowing ever put to screen); the expensive-looking production design, most of the time much more interesting than the story or the actors; and all of the ridiculously melodramatic plot lines that are supposed to make us care what happens to any of these people. The ship overturns, a man falls through a window, Winters takes a swim, Hackman takes a dive, and the lucky survivors pop out of the ship's bottom into the bright sunlight, no one taking a moment to ask how a giant ship could capsize without sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Was the Poseidon made out of cork?If you need to console yourself, just remember that 1972 also gave us ""Cabaret,"" ""Deliverance"" and ""The Godfather,"" so it wasn't a total waste....Grade: B"
238,"You know Hollywood is getting desperate when mediocre disaster films like the The Poseidon Adventure are getting remade. I've not seen the remake, but I've seen the box office figures and they're not pretty. It barely made 1/3 of what it cost to make! Yikes! The original, after years of availability on the small screen, has actually become a marginal success. It is a typical disaster flick full of stereotypical characters and situations, but there's no doubting the film's star power and intentions. Gene Hackman's performance almost saves the film.The plot involves a luxurious ocean liner (The Poseidon) which is turned upside down by a large rogue wave. Most of the passengers and crew perish while a crafty young minister (Hackman) leads a small band of survivors up through the bottom of the ship and hopefully to the chance at a rescue. Making their way through the over-turned ship is difficult enough, but it proves just as difficult for the young preacher to keep everyone's spirits up and convince them to keep following him toward the engine room in the midst of one hardship after another. The film becomes a testament to not giving up in the face of tough odds and the loss of loved ones. The film, through Hackman's character, is simply reminding the audience to ""keep the faith"".Though the f/x of the 1970s were nothing like what we have today, the film looks decent enough. The upside-down sets look like they were a chore to design, but they appear detailed. Nothing really looks completely hokey or cheap. It looks like this would have been a physically taxing shoot for all of the actors involved.Problems arise from the script, however. The tone of the film once the ship is turned over is wildly inconsistent. One moment will have characters tenderly encouraging each other that life is still worth living. The next moment will feature cast members shouting at one another in furious fits of over-acting. All this while the water level and possibility of death is rising higher and higher. Cast members die off in a mostly predictable order. When it's all said and done, Hackman's performance and some neat sets are really all this film can hang its hat on. One wonders why anyone thought to spend so much money remaking this film.5 of 10 stars."
239,"What a magnificent effort this represents. The writers must have scoured the cinematic archives, the musty libraries of modern and ancient literature, the brains of innumerable fourth-rate dramatists, in order to come up with this compendium of clichés. My hat is off to them. It's a disaster film of Biblical proportions in every respect. A stupendous cast, a colossal set of sets -- every one of them a hull and not a one of them a null. What a human drama! Love, conflict, pity and stupidity. Yes, the mind boggles. What the hell else is it supposed to do -- a toe dance to the Nutcracker Suite? The S.S. Poseidon, a passenger liner, is capsized by a giant tidal wave and floats upside down long enough for a handful of survivors led by the brutally pragmatic Reverend Gene Hackman to find their way upwards -- that is, to the bottom of the ship's hull -- and be rescued by helicopter. They're a diverse group, those passengers, with one of the couples (Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens) straight out of ""Dinner at Eight"", or was it ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Weekend at the Waldorf""? Alas, some of the initial survivors don't survive the trip. First, Roddy MacDowell drops down a water-filled funnel and that kills him. Why it kills him isn't immediately clear because when Borgnine jumps in to save him, Borgnine emerges in the same shape as when he went in.But let's not dwell on too many of the plot holes because it would deflect our attention from the plot per se. What I mean is -- we'd have to start at the very beginning. A big earthquake, for instance, does not produce a big slow wave at sea. It creates a shock of energy that travels through the water at a couple of hundred miles per hour causing only a slight swell at any given point. (It can get a LOT bigger when it reaches shore.) Then, when Captain Leslie Nielsen spots the fictitious monster wave approaching, he just talks it over with the crew, until the ship takes it on the port bow. There's not a heck of a lot you can do with a huge wave, even a phantasmic one, but at least you can try to minimize the damage by receiving it head on. Enough to make you wonder if the skipper was on mushrooms as, evidently, the writers were.I don't want to get too far off the track here but since we're at the beginning, I have to give an example of what I meant by saying this was ridden with clichés. There is a sharp exchange before the wave is sighted. The Captain wants to proceed at normal speed but the owner of the line wants to break a record or something and demands full speed ahead. Captain Nielsen finally caves and orders portentously, ""Full speed."" The decision is treated as an omen of ill tidings. But the fact is that the speed of the Poseidon has NOTHING at all to do with what follows. (If anything, it would have increased the ship's maneuverability.) But since it's a reliable cliché, lifted bodily from the many stories of the Titanic, it's shoe horned into the story.Hackman is, as I said, the group's leader but the group can't seem to understand the simple fact that the ship is upside down, and the hull is down by the head. That means, if they want to get up to a rescue point, they have to head towards the ship's propellers. Oh, there's a lot of conflict and shouting over that point. It has Gene Hackman tearing out his hair, one of the things that may account for his balding in later movies.Well, I'm making too much fun of it. There are two very nice features. One is seeing the ordinary fixtures of a passenger liner upside down. The urinals are on the ceiling and look a little daunting. The gas burners on the galley ranges are flaming away on the overhead, or underhead. Curious stuff.The second virtue is seeing Stella Stevens in her scanty underwear, and Pamela Sue Martin and Carol Lynley in short shorts. In a well-conceived and, I thought, extremely artistic scene, Stevens swims underwater with her man's shirt billowing up around her shoulders. And the director, Ronald Neame, gives us lengthy, thoughtful, rather philosophical shots from below of the other two babes climbing several ladders. Some very nice touches here, Mr. Neame.It's a piece of Hollywood junk but it preceded many others and it takes place at sea, so we'll give it a bonus point for originality. Reminded me of the time I was on a ship wallowing gently at a Pacific weather station when it suddenly took a sharp roll of about 40 degrees and sent all the crew and equipment tumbling up against the bulkhead. We all laughed and untangled ourselves. At my current age, if that happened again they would find my lifeless body at the bottom of the pile. Overall, it's mindless and entertaining."
240,"The most disturbing aspect of these movies is the end where we are supposed to cheer, but when three people just died, including the most interesting character, how can you? And will somebody slap some sense into that crying girl in the short shorts and shove the toy boat down that kids throat. This movie has the most annoying group of people, either sanctimonious(THE PREACHER) or whiny(everyone with the exception of Acres and Mrs. Rosen who both die.) Then there are the obvious religious undertones of a preacher leading a group up to salvation. Add in some pathetic special effects, a limp script, and a lack of humor and you have one dated, depressing movie. Three things to watch for: The scene where the ship flips over and the water comes in is scary and exciting as is the overall tone of the movie until Shelley Winters dies, which takes away the movie's heart."
241,"The ""awe"" has gone from this film. Shelly Winters in unintentionally funny as she bravely swims underwater. The ending is anticlimactic as we are only shown the stern of the ship near the propellers. (Yes, they do show the smokestacks when it first capsizes.) So did they run out-of-budget for the special effects and miniatures in the finale? It should have been subtitled ""Who Dies Next?"" Dreadfully out-of-date since 1972. Watch ""Titanic "" instead and ignore the few ""cuss"" words and very brief nudity."
242,"I'm an action movie guy, so ""The Poseidon Adventure"" should be right up my alley. And it's not exactly bad. But this film is overrated, and I'm guessing its because a lot of IMDb voters are thinking back using nostalgia, rather than trying to gauge the film's relevance to today -- when people are trying to decide whether to rent a videotape.A lot of stuff has blown up in action movies in the last 30 years, and ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is now a little dated and cheesy, especially in the bad acting by the minor actors who play freaked out passengers. The plotting is a little too straightforward and the melodrama is bumpy. Still, you gotta love can't-fail actor Gene Hackman, and it's nice to see Ernest Borgnine, whose career I mostly missed. It's not arty, deep, or original enough to be classic.Who should see this film:-- Action / thriller movie buffs on a rainy day with nothingbetter to do. Or better yet, skip it.I'll give ""The Poseidon Adventure"" a 5 out of 10."
243,"*Let here be SPOILERS* 'Who will survive The Poseidon Adventure?' the trailer for the movie asked. I just want to ask 'WHO CARES?'. The only characters I cared for were Acres, Linda, Rev. Scott and the Rosens. The other ones annoyed me to no-end, especially Nonnie the retard (I want to see other Carol Lynley movies to see if she's always that awful - was her acting any wooden I'd have called her Pinocchio), Robin the know-it-all (that kid is nothing but annoying), his stupid sister (I would've let her throw herself into the fire) and Rogo the idiot killer (God, is Ernest Borgnine awful in this one). Did all the cast forget how to act? And, does anyone think that the script is truly horrible? I was yawning in the big 'climb-the-tree' scene. And LAUGHING at Gene's acting. For God's Sake, was the script so bad he couldn't make it believable? Sure it was. But the thing that saddened me the most was that Mrs. Rosen's death scene was idiotic. 3, 2, 1, bring your hand to your chest, scream and then fall... it was bloody obvious it was staged.Bottom line: 'The Poseidon Adventure' is the worst disaster movie ever. And yes, I have seen 'Swarm'."
244,"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is an entertaining and rather dated film. Some of the story's flaws get in the way of totally enjoying it, though.It's pretty obvious in the beginning after the ship has capsized that we are going to be with these ten characters for the rest of the story, when nobody else is willing to climb up the tree to safety. I had a hard time believing that only ten people would be logical enough to realize which way to go especially if the captain and the other ship personnel were dead. And why was Roddy McDowall the only employee who survived the capsizing? There were no other people working in the linen department with him, or in other areas on that level of the ship?When the water started rushing into the ballroom and the crowd started to frantically climb the tree, we knew it had to topple over, so that we were left with only ten stories to follow. As the survivors started to climb up through the ship's levels, a great deal of the action was delayed. In other words, it seemed stretched out to accommodate a two hour running time, and also to save on sets. But in reality. I think they would have moved much more swiftly and made their way through various compartments (some of them dead ends). The film also contained a lot of over-acting. Some of the bit players, even the extras whose death scenes were played out in the background, were done with a major dose of ham. The top cast members, most of whom were method actors and disciples of the Actors Studio, seemed to think that if you screamed your lines, you were being dramatic and registering shock and/or panic as the plot unfolded. There was very little subtlety.A minor complaint I have, but one that is worth mentioning, is that if this ship was en route to Europe, how come everyone spoke English? There should have been one person who spoke a different language, or spoke fractured English. And speaking of fractured, it's hard to believe that none of the survivors wound up with broken arms, broken legs, cracked ribs, something. There were no injuries, no bad back or headache among them. The sound effects were not as realistic as they could have been. Many times our main characters would barely escape a tide of rushing water, jumping up to the next level. But we seldom (almost never) heard water in the background. Only when the camera would cut to a quick shot of the rushing water would we hear it. And finally, I thought some of the death scenes were played unevenly. Roddy McDowall's character dies in about two seconds flat. But when Shelley Winters died, she was glimpsed laying dead for nearly ten minutes. It may sound like I am complaining. I did give this film an 8 out of 10 rating, so obviously it was an enjoyable motion picture overall. But I do think there could have been more flashes of brilliance (like the other survivors headed the wrong way) and a lot more subtlety with the performances."
245,"The film must have been exceptional at the time of release but unfortunately did not stood the test of time. The ship so clearly is nothing more than a model in a pond. The ship's interior scenes were far more realistic and here the sets were quite impressive. The script was corny and silly, though, and at times it felt I was watching a comedy or spoof instead of a dramatic disaster movie. The dialogue was really bad - no, terrible, actually. At times the silly dialogue was just downright inappropriate and I couldn't help but wonder what the hell they were thinking! The acting was also over-dramatic and over-sentimental, and not believable at all. None of the characters were really fleshed out and seemed very one-dimensional. How did the preacher (Hackman) know so much about the ship anyway that he was able to lead everyone through an upside down ship to where they needed to be? At one point he says ""Just one more door and we're home"". What did he mean?? They're in the middle of the ocean on a capsized boat!!! They had no idea what was waiting for them on the outside...At the end our hero (Hackman) also seems to simply give up by 'falling' into an inferno. There didn't appear to be any struggle on his behalf - he just let go for no reason. I didn't find that scene one bit believable. I actually never realized how bad this film actually is."
246,"Yes this movie does contain a towering performance from the mighty Gene Hackman and I like the tidal wave effects but the rest of the supporting characters are completely annoying and stupid like that kid, Pamela sue Martin and Ernest Borgnine and worst of all Shelly Winters (oh my god!). After the ship is capsized we are shown the liner fully yes fully underwater so how in gods name when miraculously they make contact are they COMPLETELY above water?!?"
247,"I honestly don't understand what people see in this horrible movie. It's such a feast of bad taste, plain awful! It has whole the lack of taste that characterizes the seventies, and is so unbelievable cheesy that words cannot say. The acting is really miserable, the characters are empty, the effects totally unconvincing, in one word: it makes you puke. Stay away from this monstrosity and, for all that, from the people that apparently appreciate it. They are to be pitied. It sticks out that almost never ever a seventies movie can captivate or even amuse me. In my opinion the seventies demonstrate a total decline of taste whatsoever. Maybe there are exceptions for the music (though the introduction of commercial motives has severely damaged it), but in most other parts of the creative process (art, fashion, movies, opinion) the seventies are a disaster. It's typical for the nihilistic mood nowadays that a revival of that decade is seen; people evidently lack depth of feeling. Anyway, this film is a disgrace for the movie business. I don't value it higher than a 3, and it should kiss my feet for that."
248,"Some of the finest scream-acting of Hackman's career. Borgnine comes in a close, screamy second."
249,"When a huge ocean wave capsizes a cruise liner, Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) must lead a group of survivors to safety.Irwin Allen's first disaster film is surprisingly good. The special effects and set design, as usual for an Allen film, are excellent. Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters and Roddy McDowall are all good. Overall, an entertaining enough film, though not quite as good as The Towering Inferno.Rewatch. 3/5"
250,"The Poseidon Adventure is a fairly mundane affair.It's not bad in any way, just nothing out of the ordinary. There are no standout characters, nothing memorable. I don't want to imagine how much more dull it would have been, had the girls not been wearing those hot pants."
251,"""What More do You Want Of Us? We've Come All This Way, No Thanks To You! We Did it On Our Own! No Help From You! We Didn't Ask Ya To Fight For Us! But Damn it, Don't Fight Against Us!

252,"An A-List Cast is Dirtied Up and Told to Bicker Constantly and Keep Moving. The SFX in One of the First ""Disaster"" Movies are Ho-Hum and Hardly Impressive, Even for 1972. It is Mostly Mishandled and Nothing is Exceptional, Remarkable, or Subtle. It is a Film that is Highly Regarded by Emotional Types but is Overrated to the Extreme. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine's Constant Head-Butting is Tiresome After Their First Scene Together. Red Buttons is a Wimpy Bore, Carol Lynley is No Actress At All, Stella Stevens Still Looks Pretty Good at 36 Until She Covers Up Those...Never Mind...Roddy Mcdowall is Underused, Don't Take a Drink Every Time the Kid Says ""Sir"" or You'll Miss the Second Half of the Movie, and His Sister is Forgettable as is Frank Albertson.See 300 Pound Shelley Winters Swim, Said the Posters (no not really), but it Said a Lot of Things to Ballyhoo this Sinker, eh, Stinker.Not the Worst Movie Ever Made but it Can Not be Forgiven for Starting the Trend for This Type of Thing. With its Big Budget, Even Bigger ""Oscar Winning Cast"" (for past efforts), this Tries to be Another ""Gone With the Wind"" (1939), and it Turns Out to be Nothing More than Gone With the Wave."
253,"This is an entertaining and exciting disaster film that still works without computer-generated special effects.More interesting for me, however, was the obvious symbolic subtext. It is somewhat eclectic, mostly Christian Gnostic but mixed with European paganism. We begin with an upside-down underwater world, reminiscent of the Celtic otherworld. The characters seek salvation by ascending through the upside-down ship, which makes it symbolically a descent at the same time, as they are heading for the bottom of the ship, referring to the ubiquitous myth of the initiatory descent into the underworld.The first stage of the escape takes place via a tree. Again, the tree is symbolically upside-down as its base is on the ceiling of the upside-down ship, another image from European pagan mythology.The Gnostic structure begins with a speech by the main character, a priest with a Nietzschean individualist will-to-power philosophy. After the disaster occurs, he is contrasted with the dull character of the ship's steward who encourages people to play it safe and stay where they are, resulting in certain death. The steward represents the exoteric Church, which leads people into the service of the Demiurge, the false creator God who wants to trap people in his illusory created world by withholding Gnosis from them as in the story of the Fall in Genesis. The priest character is the Gnostic Christ who leads people to salvation by revealing the falsehood of the Demiurge. He leads them to repeatedly risk death in order to escape certain death, which, taken together with his introductory speech, represents the radical self-assertion of the Gnostic initiate or the Renaissance Magus, who dares to know the inner reality of the Godhead for himself, through his own efforts. He attains apotheosis in a self-crucifixion which saves the other surviving characters.One is only left to ponder on the motivation of the director to go to such effort in order to construct a symbolic sub-plot that probably less than 1% of his viewers will understand or even notice. Secret personal satisfaction or an attempt at subliminal education in comparative religion?"
254,"The 1970s was chock full of disaster epics and probably the best of them was one of the earliest - The Poseidon Adventure. The action focuses on the Poseidon, a cruise ship hit and capsized by a rogue wave. With up now down and vice versa, a rag-tag band of survivors, led by embittered former preacher Gene Hackman, attempt to make their way to the top (bottom) of the ship to hopefully meet a rescue party.One of the biggest problems with the film is that the once impressive visual effects are now almost laughable. The moment where the wave hits the ship and unleashes disaster comes across as quaint rather than especially impressive. This was the area in which the inferior remake actually overtook its predecessor. Watching a group of extras slide across the floor and then fall through plate glass in painfully choreographed scenes seems oddly mundane.Unlike the remake, however, the film actually does manage to sustain interest after the wave hits. There is certainly a grand guilty pleasure watching the eclectic all-star cast trudge its way towards either their doom or rescue. While the characters are paper thin types and fail to generate any emotional attachment, one cannot accuse the cast of sitting on their laurels. They cry, sputter, swim and have hysterics with the best of them. It is not their fault that what passes for character development is so flaccid and that each death is anticipated only with mild interest rather than genuine concern. The suspense lies far more in wondering who among the familiar faces will be next to meet the Grim Reaper than in any particular action set piece.Of the cast, undoubtedly the best performance (and the most well known) comes courtesy of Shelly Winters, as an aged Jewish grandmother and former swimmer. You just know that swimming background is going to come in handy and give her a BIG scene and neither Winters or the film disappoints on that front. Gene Hackman is also first-rate as the strong-willed lapsed preacher who leads the survivors. Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens are a bit too over-the-top as a vacationing police officer and his former prostitute wife. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea bring the newcomer/youth element as a brother and sister en route to their parents. Blink and you might miss Roddy McDowell as a waiter and Leslie Nielsen as the captain. The worst performance is arguably by Carol Lynley as the ship's wimpy singer, who basically acts catatonic and gets dragged around by a too-old-for-her Red Buttons.The pace never really lags, but the film does have its share of sluggish spots - it never really has another truly exciting moment after the capsizing of the boat. The film is definitely showing its age, so it works best being viewed through the filter of the past."
255,"An all-star cast with the Oscar winning song We May Never Love Like this Again, sets the stage for ""The Poseidon Adventure.""Poseidon is the ancient Greek god of the sea. ...And was there ever a time that his wisdom was needed.Gene Hackman is a preacher who has lost faith. Yet he and some others will have to lead the surviving passengers out of this horrible predicament.Jack Albertson and Oscar nominee Shelley Winters are an amiable surviving couple coping with disaster. They are going to see their grandchildren but you know that fate will intervene and prevent that.The picture is to be credited for great special effects. Being upside down is no laughing matter.It is really torture to view how so many met their endings. It was horrible but done realistically.Carefree people, rich and not so rich alike enjoying themselves on a cruise until destiny intervenes. A powerful drama questioning the human spirit."
256,"There are a few movies I remember being surprised at as a child. These were movies that I saw on television or Beta/VHS that were made before my time and not meant as children's stories. Some of them were genuine classics like To Kill a Mockingbird that instilled in me a sense that beauty and art can be found in a film. Others were like the Poseidon Adventure that while not particularly masterful films still showed me that there were many other films out there besides the ""family"" films being churned out at the local cineplex. These films eventually opened up to me the world of cinema.I first saw the Poseidon Adventure at Grandma and Papa's house. I had been dropped off by my mother for an afternoon while she went shopping or some other mundane task. After flipping channels awhile I came across this great sinking ship and fell mystified into a grand epic adventure. To this day I recall my mother coming home during the final 20 minutes or so and me making her stay because I just had to see the ending. She had seen the film, but praised it as a classic adventure and allowed me to see the end. Periodically I have caught bits and pieces of the movie again on cable and always pause to watch a scene or two. I bought it in a bargain bin a few months back and joyfully added it to my collection. Last night Amy and I decided to watch it.Watching it on DVD I realize this was the first time I have ever actually seen the very beginning of the movie. As a child I caught the picture 10-20 minutes into and all subsequent viewings have all been by catching it part way through on television. I am afraid the movie as a whole doesn't hold up all that well to my childhood memory. Oh, it's a big, grand adventure, but like the ship of the movie, it starts to sink under its own enormousness.It has a basic 70's disaster movie plot. Big ocean cruise liner is hit by enormous wave and is turned upside down, killing nearly everyone. A few survivors are followed as they make their way up (down?) the ship and try to escape. It is way over the top and it almost seems as if the director Ronald Neame told his actors to ham it up in every scene. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine do their best howling at each other in every other scene.The script follows very basic rules. It rolls like something you would see in a basic screenwriter's class. You start with an establishing shot, follow it with a basic introduction of your main characters while making sure their essential character motivation is directly handed to the audience in their first few minutes of screen time. Then you set your plot into action. It's disaster is even set into action by an evil corporate leader. Leslie Nielson plays the good captain who is hounded by a goon sent from the ships corporate owner to ensure it ports for its final time on the right date. The corporate goon orders Nielson's captain to increase speed though Nielson argues this will surely cause the old ship to sink. The corporate goon, of course, wins and sets up the disaster. On a side note it is unintentionally funny to watch Nielson in a serious role when everyone knows his slew of later, goofier roles in movies such as the Naked Gun and Airplane.This film acts like it invented implausibly. Gene Hackman reverend moves, acts, and orders others around like he's the ship's captain though he has no previous knowledge of how the ship's design, or conceivably the physics of a cruise liner. Yet his motivation for acting like this was set up earlier. Before the ship sinks we get a sermon from this unorthodox preacher who believes in helping onesfelf instead of relying on Divine intervention. Likewise all the other characters follow along in their previously established types, never budging from this set character mold and certainly not evolving in any meaningful way.All of this is not to say the film isn't enjoyable. It is not high art after all. It knows full well it's purpose is to entertain the audience and nothing more. It does this quite well. Though its plot is strained it moves along with a quick pace and maintains a claustrophobic tension throughout. I have not seen many of the other disaster movies of the era so I cannot place the Poseidon Adventure accordingly amongst their ranks. But as an action/adventure flick you could do worse."
257,"I was flipping through the channels and saw this movie playing. I heard so much about it, so I decided to watch it. I wasn't disappointed.On the contrary, I was riveted. The dynamics between the survivors was fascinating. It drew you into the plot. The acting is good enough to make you care about the characters, and to feel anger when they do something stupid, and pain when they die because of their stubbornness or bravery.I can't give this movie any more than a 7 because it borders on camp in places, and is too dark to see in others, but it is still a very enjoyable, riveting movie."
258,One day out to sea it starts a beautiful day on a big cruise. But what happens when a dangerous tidal wave suddenly turns the ship upside down. How would you get out and survive. This movie tries to answer that question. With great suspense and excitement you wonder how a band of survivors led by Gene Hackman will make it out alive. This movie was good but Titanic was better. Although it had great actings by Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. It failed at with less excitement. But I still liked it. Still it could have been better in some parts of the movie. As you watch as read about this you wonder what they could've done to avoid this situation from being so bad.
259,"Just as for some of the people who commented on this movie, this was one of the first movies I actually sat through in the theater and followed the dialog. I must say I didn't like the dialog parts very much back then - I found it all way too heavy and overplayed - and I like it even less by now but working my way to the great actors themselves as opposed to the roles they are screaming rather than speaking, the movie works. The story is a bit too constructed but it is an exciting concept that belongs to the best of the 1970s disaster flicks. Of course the only real problem here is Leslie Nielsen who appeared after this in so many spoofs (playing it straight as in his former serious roles) All his scenes are unintentionally hilarious. It only (probably) works if one never saw Nielsen in any of his spoofs. The acting and dialog sound today as if they try to emulate a popular stage piece or TV sitcom. The disaster movies that immediately followed are very similar in tone with the exception of (if it can be considered belonging into this category)""Jaws"" which has much, much better acting that didn't age one bit (Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are perfect in this).So this movie belongs to a string of big budget (mostly disaster-) flicks that played it heavy and more stage-like as opposed to naturalistic, low key or over-the-top but virtuoso (Hackman comes close but the script and direction definitely are in the way here). This is rather sad since this actually is a throwback to the 1930s. Naturalistic and realistic dialog goes way back to the 1940s. I remember Earthquake to be worse than this and The Towering Inferno to be just slightly better in the story/acting/dialog department. By now these movies play very heavy since we live in times where dialog - in real life and on screen - has a totally different feel to it.The set pieces are very good for the time and even the model work during the early parts is more than acceptable. I can see that the parts playing on deck have been filmed on the Queen Mary at Long Beach, CA. Very nice seeing that the modelmakers and set pieces took great care to make the ""Poseidon"" matching the Queen Mary regarding look and feel. Only Jim cameron's Titanic had the budget and technology to take it further.This still remains a cornerstone movie - as it set the tome for a string of disaster flicks (1970's Airport was only the forerunner, not the pioneer - this goes to ""Poseidon"") and it works when one is willing to see the actors for themselves. Otherwise: check how many terms in Roger Ebert's glossary (=cliches) can be found. I have the feeling a very large number is there...."
260,"I'm all for the suspension of disbelief, but there are limits. I'll overlook the fact that it is impossible for an ocean liner to float upside down, or that a tidal wave only achieves giant size when it reaches shallow water, because without this you wouldn't have had a story. But the absurdities increase exponentially thereafter. After the ship capsizes, Gene Hackman, Moses like, leads his flock in an ascent to the ship's stern. Hackman lustily chews the upside down scenery, and in this has plenty of company. The film's best line occurs when the group finally reaches the stern, and Ernest Borgnine looks up at the impenetrable hull and says, "" Well now what do we do?"" What follows is the twentieth century equivalent of the parting of the Red Sea. Their ensuing rescue should qualify for an award as the most absurd Deux ex Machina ever conceived; unworthy of even a grade school author. The movie is good for a few unintended laughs."
261,"Never did get all the hoopla about this film. It has some decent scenes, and the story is compelling, but it is done rather poorly. The over-the-top heart-tugging stuff is hard to watch, and Gene Hackman's overacting is laughable. I normally like him, but he was terrible in this."
262,"Everything that can go wrong, and a lot of things that couldn'tpossibly go wrong, go wrong here.But the people in charge should read a little bit of physics. Just thebeginnings, let's say ""The Feynman Lectures in Physics"", or maybeAlonso/Finn, or Haliday/Resnick. Just to make sure you know thattsunamis don't happen in open seas, it's only when the water gets soshallow that the water volume doesn't fit between surface and bottomthat the waves rise. (Okay, I'm simplifying here, get one of thosephysics books to learn that it's the short waves that catch up withthe long waves in shallow waters). But there are NO big waves in openseas, only on beaches, every surfer knows that. Well, maybe if areally big meteor hits the Earth, but then the wave will move insupersonic speeds. That wave would be essentially solid, it wouldinstantly turn the ship into a two-dimensional structure and each ofthe passengers into a pizza-shaped pink pancake.Well, let's give those guys a break, they tried to make a movie, not aphysics class. However, it's just a ""b"" movie, not even a capital ""B"".The one thing you can say for this kind of film is that one doesn'tknow who will die and who will survive to the end. Well, the kid weare sure he will survive; he is just too insufferable to die. Buteveryone else is at risk. And here they did a great job, the suspenseis constant to the very end, when we see the steel plate glowing fromthe blowtorches that are cutting it from the outside. Every singleinstant, from the time the ship capsizes, we are never sure of whatwill happen next.All in all, not too great, but not bad either, I gave it a 5/10. Goodfor keeping the kids out of the street for an afternoon."
263,"Remember the bit where they climb the upside-down Christmas tree? ""You'll have to take off your skirt,"" says Reverend Frank Scott, to Susan.  Good call! - and actress Pamela Sue Martin dutifully disrobes.  ""And your dress,"" he says, to Linda.  An even better call.  Actress and former Playmate Stella Stevens protests that she's not wearing a bra.  ALL RIGHT!  But, alas, Ernest Borgnine lends her his shirt, an item of clothing that manages to remain opaque even when drenched by the Atlantic Ocean, and we aren't allowed to see her magnificent, plunging cleavage ever again.  Why tease us like this?  I don't really mind how heavily dressed Stella Stevens is; what I object to is being promised a strip show and then denied one.This, my friends, is a supremely silly movie.  It probably seemed less silly once.  It's an accident of history that the Leslie Nielsen, who plays the ship's captain, ended up playing so many deadpan comedy roles that we're tempted to think he must be doing the same thing here.  Yet converse reasoning also applies.  Gene Hackman has become famous since for straight drama; in HIS case, we're tempted to think that he wouldn't be making such a complete ass of himself unless he were doing so deliberately.  And look at Ernest Borgnine!  He never so much as cracks a smile.  But we know he can't POSSIBLY be serious.  It's hilarious.Actually, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is by no means contemptible, so far as disaster movies go.  There's the usual bunch of characters (microcosm of humanity, and all that) thrown together by the misfortune; but unlike most disaster movies, this one doesn't make the mistake of telling us too much about the characters before the misfortune strikes.  (Well all right, it does, but most other disaster movies make the same mistake to an even greater degree.)  The characters here have a clearly definable quest (stupid, but clearly defined) and their actions more or less make sense given their ultimate goal.  And they get on with one another well enough to prevent the story from falling apart.Of course it would have been better if it hadn't been so idiotic.  (It could have been witty, it could have been gripping, it could have been touching - there are many ways of failing to be idiotic.)  But it's still somehow sturdy and watchable.  Apart from the cruel way in which we are denied a good look at Stella Stevens, this is one of the least objectionable bad movies around."
264,"Before Titanic and Storm of the Century there was Poseidon. The grandest luxury liner on the seven seas has set off with a star studded cast on an excursion trip in the mediterranean seas. As the minutes leading up to midnight, on new years eve, approaches and the band strikes up a chorus of ""Old Lange Zyne"", a towering wall of water washes over the mammoth liner capsizing the ship and placing it's crew and passengers in harms way. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Shelly Winters, Stella Stevens, and Jack Albertson team up with others to find away to safety. This first movie gave way to its sequel 'Return To Poseidon' With Telly Savalas. This is a classic of film making which any 70's film fanatic must see."
265,"This was among the first of the `All-Star' disaster movies of the 70's, and which were so well-spoofed in `Airplane!'.  The plot involves a tidal wave that manages to flip over a large cruise ship, and the all-star cast (at least in 1972), which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Red Buttons. With the exception of Hackman (is this how you follow The French Connection ?), the rest of the cast was better suited to the Love Boat, and not this boat.  The dialogue is inanely silly, and Hackman, playing a cussing, derriere-grabbing reverend, just screams through most of this.  It may have some larger cultural significance, but The Poseidon Adventure simply sinks."
266,"Since I like ""Towering Inferno,"" I thought I would like this film as well. I was pretty disappointed. The sets are impressive and the John Williams score is good. But the acting, dialoge and characters left something to be desired. It felt like a Michael Bay or Devlin/Emmrich film for the 70's. I'd recommend skipping this and watching ""Towering Inferno"" or ""Airport"" instead."
267,"When The Poseidon Adventure first came out, I was about 14. I went back to see it that summer about 12-15 times, not because I particularly liked the movie, I just wanted to see Pamela Sue Martin because I was absolutely in love with her. As a result, I came to memorize the entire film, line by line, is that pathetic or what? After seeing it again recently, I was amazed at how oblivious I was to the overall cheeziness of the production, especially the acting and the screenplay. But, I suppose it was a product of it's time, and the special effects were actually not bad for that era. Producer Irwin Allen must have taken a page from his ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" experience. But it's hard not to wince at the Hackman/Borgnine histrionics and the blubbering of Shelley Winters. And entire sections of dialog seem to have been lifted wholesale from a Beginning Screenwriting 101 handbook. But Pamela made it all worthwhile."
268,"Some good acting and suspenseful moments in this early-in-the genre 70's flick, as well as some characters that are so bad you would rather have them overboard. Moviegoers are forced to endure a lot of close-range shouting between Hackman and the ever-perspiring Ernest Borgnine in this one. A pretty disappointing script, but Borgnine is solid and Hackman great as usual. There must be a funny story behind the incredible abrupt ending."
269,"This movie was a big deal when I was a kid.  It doesn't hold up at  all and I would be hard pressed to watch it again.  It can't hold a candle to ""Titanic"".  There are too many Oscar winners trying for another trophy, and its all very heavy-handed."
