0,"I loved it! A very sweet (and different) story. It pulled me in enough that I got invested in the characters, which allowed me to laugh and cry (a few times) at the end. It's movie that, if you allow it to, makes you think - and appreciate. I loved it!"
1,"I was almost not going to see this movie because of the rating! I'm so glad I decided to give it a go because I would've regretted it. This movie is great and I dont even like Christmas romance comedies! It wasnt overly sappy and filled with sex scenes like the regular theater movies and even with people spoiling the ""plot twist"" it was still well worth the watch! The storyline is very simple but nothing wrong with a little simplicity. Not all movies should be unpredictable. Predictable doesn't mean unsatisfying. I find the more UNpredictable the movie, the less satisfying because who wants to watch a whole bunch of random scenarios happen in one movie? Not this girl. That would be wAY too much."
2,"Saw this last night with my wife, who needed some cheering up after a tough week. This wouldn't have been my pick, but once I saw the cast and the Christmas vibe I thought 'why not?'Another draw was that Paul Feig directed it. Who doesn't love Bridesmaids?!It follows a down and out type character played by Emilia Clarke, who plays it pretty much to perfection. I'm not that familiar with her, but she really bears her soul here.The film balances comedy and drama skillfully, I won't go into too much detail, but the audience here in Australia was laughing out loud throughout and my wife and I had tears by the end.This is what I go to the movies for.The good:
script is funny and touching where it needs to becinematographymusic by George Michael - really flows well with the visualsthe pacingNot so good:
a few moments are a bit clichesome characters are a bit one dimensionalpolitical correctness in some scenesMy advice would be to leave your cynicism at the door for this one, I am recommending my family and friends to watch it for sure!"
3,"If you're looking for a lighthearted feel good movie, this is perfect. Sure the script and plot aren't out of this world, but the movie had me smiling and shedding a few tears too. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were amazing (as always) and the ending really touched my heart.
Deducted one star for historical accuracy, but then again the family's background was not the central focus of the film so the inaccuracy did not take away from the plot. Nonetheless, for such a renowned team of filmmakers it's weird to see such a slip-up happen.
Don't pay attention to the reviews bashing it for the inaccuracies and 'political intentions' of the film, it's a wonderful feel good movie that really touches you."
4,Surprisingly good was expecting a cheesy rom/com holiday film. But instead the Movie make you look up and appreciate what you have in life 😊
5,"Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant to Britain, with her family, coming after Yugoslavia broke up. Once singing in church, she longs to make it in musical theater. However, life has thrown her off track. Her mother (Emma Thompson) is overbearing, her sister is a successful lawyer with sharp disagreements with Kate, and our Katarina has health problems. So, now, Kate works at a year-round Christmas store, as an elf-saleslady under the direction of store owner, Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Its a living? Well, yes, but Kate has been couch surfing and has no permanent home but her parents house. One day she meets a handsome man on a bicycle, Tom (Henry Golding) who advises her to ""look up"". Its akin to stop and smelling the roses but Kate wants none of this gooey philosophy, at first. But, on subsequent encounters, Kate begins to notice things she's never seen before and to appreciate the friendship/love Tom has been offering. Can Tom change Kate's life for the good? This lovely new addition to the repertoire of Christmas cinema has a strong foundation in its script by Emma Thompson, a wonderful cast, lovely sets and costumes, and the eternally grand music of George Michael in its soundtrack. Be prepared for laughter and tears, as unexpected happenings keep arriving. But, in short, don't be last in line for Last Christmas!"
6,"Never mind the bad critics. Go see the movie. A lovable feel good holiday movie. The storyline is not very strong though. These days most movies are about horror, evil, action. Mostly senseless. This film is about unconditional love; a woman who loathes herself, but has her heart on the right place; about being there for one another despite differences, with wit and humor. Also about family. ""The real meaning of Christmas is the giving of love everyday."" Song by the Ray Conniff Singers in the sixties. That song came to my mind."
7,"Yugoslavia in 1999? Did not exist. I am from Serbia and I agree with fellow croatian who said it is very much confusing and why did they escape from Croatia 1999? How strange.
Anyway the movie is cute and christmasy so why not enjoy in it."
8,Last Christmas... the movie was so so so beautiful.. made me cry ... love hearing George in the cinema. It was like voice of a angel ..very emotional ..
9,I love Christmas movies and I love a good feel hood chick flick so I loved this. Emilia Clark and Henry Golding were a great pair. I've read many harsh reviews but I thought it was great.
10,"""Last Christmas"" is a funny, heartwarming, ultimately profound movie. It's being marketed as a romantic comedy but it's more of a dramedy. There are funny lines throughout, but ""Last Christmas"" deals with some tough issues, and towards the end it sends a beautiful message.Emma Thompson co-wrote the script. Thompson previously won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for ""Sense and Sensibility."" ""Last Christmas"" traffics in unflattering stereotypes of Eastern Europeans and it tries to hard to be politically correct, but its wit, warmth, and the chemistry of its stars, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, won me over.The movie opens in the former Yugoslavia, in an Orthodox church, of all places. Petra (Emma Thompson) is watching her daughter Katrina sing a George Michael song.Fast forward decades later, and move to London. Kate (Emilia Clarke) is an unlikable mess. She works as an elf / clerk in a year-round Christmas store run by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Kate is homeless and couch surfs, sleeping with friends and one-night stands. She dresses in clothes that are a little bit slob and a little bit tramp. She's hard to like.One day she looks out the window of her Christmas store and sees Tom (Henry Golding.) He's a very nice guy. Charming, handsome, and kind. Kate is suspicious.Eventually Kate and Tom get close enough that Kate confesses her dark secret to him. She had been ill for a long time. Her mother seemed to enjoy too much having a chronically ill daughter, so Kate had to move out of the house. A year earlier, Kate had had a heart transplant, and she hasn't felt like herself since. Tom encourages Kate to get her life together.Kate returns to her natal family, now living in London. Petra, Kate's mother, is a stereotypical Eastern European. She is always sad, she sings mournful songs, she uses outlandish curses - ""I will nail you to my p----"" - and she refers to a dessert brought by a gay guest as ""lesbian pudding.""The TV broadcasts coverage of Brexit protests and Petra bemoans that people dislike her because she is an immigrant. But she is a bigot herself, albeit a comical one. ""I blame the Poles,"" she says, about current anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK. All this is played for laughs. Otherwise, the movie bends over backward to be politically correct. Four relationships are highlighted in the film, and all four are biracial, and one is a lesbian couple. The one group this politically correct film recognizes it is okay to make fun of is Eastern Europeans. Even so, I loved the movie.There are no spoilers in this review, so I can't tell you how the movie handles Kate's transformation, from a total mess at the beginning of the film, to someone we can take to heart at the end, but I found the plot device to be quite poignant, and I left the theater with tears rolling down my face. The critics who have given this film a low score need to have their credentials revoked and their minds and hearts opened. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding have terrific chemistry, and I'd love to see them reunite in a more traditional romantic comedy."
11,"With the film industry laden with drugs, war, death, shady politics, doom & gloom, this is a bright little ray of sunshine in a very dark world.
It's so nice just to be able to go to the cinema & laugh again. We NEED more joy in our lives. The soundtrack is just phenomenal too, I mean, too much George Michael is never enough!
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Being a George MEGAFAN, no doubt I'll be watching this every year until the end of time. Do you you know what, the thought of that makes me super happy.
Just go to the cinema, check your worries at the gate & just enjoy yourself for a bit. It won't disappoint, I promise!"
12,"Thank you Emma Thompson for producing this very underrated movie. Does it have the quality of Game of Thrones character development and storylines? No. Does it have the same appeal as Crazy Rich Asians? Probably not. But, does it do a great job putting a musician's catalog of songs into a fictional story? ABSOLUTELY!If you're a George Michael fan, and watch the movie from his song's perspective and get past the romantic comedy category that this film falls under, you'll appreciate what it does to his music. Is there cheese? Sure, but that's part of the charm to get to the twist.Not knowing the twist is the best way to watch this movie to experience what it is doing in dedication to George Michael.I would have rated this movie a 10, but they missed out on some of George's songs that they could have included, but for whatever reason, they didn't.If you got this far in my review and you haven't seen it, and you're a George Michael fan, and you're into the Christmas spirit... Go see it."
13,"Maybe I'm in a cheesy mood. Maybe it's because it's a Christmas movie. I love Emilia Clarke as well. Combine all that, and I loved this movie. I saw it with my parents and fiancé. It made us laugh and look forward to the holidays even more. Ignore any negative reviews. This movie is perfect for what it sets out to do. It reminds you what the holidays are all about.Enjoy!"
14,"I really want to say I liked Last Christmas - Henry Golding is disarmingly charming, the happiness is helping other people message is sweet. This is how a Christmas film should be....you laugh, cry, laugh some more ...with a theatre full of strangers who are doing exactly the same. Not ashamed to say I loved it."
15,"Better than I expect it to be, this is one really heartwarming film. Not your typical rom-com or holiday film. The story is a 10/10 for me. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding really shines in this, also Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson. The movie also has a lot of lessons in it."
16,"The film was much more than expected. The beginning seemed like the movie will not offer a great, deep story, but just wait till the end and you will me amazed. There are also plenty of really funny moments and Emilia is just wonderful in portraying them."
17,"The first half of the movie was a big smile on the face all along. Emilia Clarke is amazing, cute, beautiful and perfect for this part. Henry Goulding is good too. I didn't like the big twist at first, but after some thinking I think it can work. I'm not completely sure how I feel about it. Lovely movie with a great cast."
18,Good rom-com!Her smile and energy are fantastic. It was a bit early for a Christmas movie for me but it didn't seem to matter.
19,"First Hit: It started off on the silly side, and by the end, I was very touched by this heartfelt story.I'd seen the previews for this story and thought, oh, this could be a silly sort of way to spend an hour and a half. However, I'm glad I didn't judge the movie by the preview. It has a beautiful and deeply touching message.The story begins with watching a young Kate (Madison Ingoldsby as young Kate) being the lead singer in a Yugoslavian church choir. Her mother, Petra (Emma Thompson), Ivan her father (Boris Isakovic), and her sister Marta (young Marta played by Lucy Miller) are in the audience watching. There is a moment in this scene that plays out later with the sister Marta looking at another person in the choir.Roll into the future, and the twenty-something years old Kate (Emilia Clarke) is living in London as is her whole family. Kate is working at a Christmas store that's open year-round, owned by ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh), who loves Christmas and the magic it brings. Kate is her employee and dresses like an elf. We get that Kate isn't a perfect employee but that Santa likes her for some reason.Kate rushes out of the store to make singing and acting auditions but is usually late, rarely prepared, and seems to have lost her ability to sing as well. We soon get that Kate's in a rut, which is compounded by her almost always homelessness. She's often shown dragging around her roller suitcase. At times, when she needs a place to sleep, she picks up guys in bars, sleeps with them, but something invariably happens, and she's back on the streets.Her friends, like Jenna and Rufus (Ritu Arya and Ansu Kabia respectively), give her a room, but within two days, she's messed this up, and they ask her to leave. She tries to reconcile with her family, but her mom is tough, and her father hides from her mom as much as possible. She and her sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) seem to be at each other's throats, and there appears to be no love lost anywhere. The family dynamics are really screwed up.All during these scenes, we are under the impression that Kate has no common sense, is flighty, and very ungrounded. Some would say unlucky. There is some hint that something happened to Kate about a year ago, but at this stage in the film, we are not privy to that part of the story. Did this event cause this ungrounded flighty nature?One day Tom (Henry Golding) pops into her life one day and impresses upon her to take a walk with him. She declines, but on the second random meeting, they walk, and you can see his caring and compassion for others, including Kate. The chemistry is strong between them, and he just seems like a wonderfully lovely person who's taken an interest in Kate. She wants to see him again and asks for his mobile number, but he says he doesn't use it, and it's kept in a kitchen cupboard at home, so giving Kate his name would be useless.On one of the walks, Tom takes her to a homeless shelter. Thinking he's trying to get her to stay there, she discovers; differently, he volunteers his time at the shelter and says she could help as well. But as Tom is prone to do, Tom disappears for days at a time. No one seems to know where he is.Kate begins to sing outside the shelter, collecting money, hoping that Tom will pop-up again. Alas, he doesn't, but just as she becomes even more despondent Tom shows up again.One evening she tells him what happen to her a year ago and why she doesn't feel like a whole person anymore. It is genuinely a sweet scene. He tells her that she can change her life by being open to others and by making kinder decisions. She's not a victim and can change her life.Tom's influence has a positive effect on Kate. She starts to make amends with ""Santa,"" her mom, dad, and sister. She volunteers more at the homeless shelter and is more thoughtful. An example of this is early in the film we see her getting picked up at a bar from some guy using a standard line. Now, we see her in a bar, she gets the same pickup line from another bloke, and she makes a better decision.A fun secondary story is about ""Santa"" trying to find companionship dates for herself. One day ""Santa"" meets ""boy"" (Peter Mygind), and how they engage with each other is so sweet and funny.I cannot delve into what happens to Kate that made her feel the way she does, nor how Tom is there to help her see the light, but the story is sweet, and the ending was fun and touching.Clarke is a hoot and actually inspirational as the film moved along. She did a great job of making this character work. Golding was beautiful as the man who pops into Kate's life to provide hope and inspiration. Yeoh is hilarious as the Christmas store owner who can see Kate's sweet side. Mygind was excellent as ""boy,"" the man who brought joy to ""Santa's"" life. Arya and Kabia are fantastic as Kate's friends, who keep supporting and allowing her to get better. Thompson was oddly funny and entertaining in her role as Kate's mother. Isakovic was terrific as the browbeaten husband of Petra and Kate's father. Leonard was harsh in her role as Kate's sister, with whom there were a lot of animosities. I didn't think this part of the film was developed enough, and their conversations felt too jarring at times. Thompson and Bryony Kimmings wrote this screenplay that didn't telegraph the ending, and that was a good thing. Paul Feig got the feel of this story right.Overall: After the end credits, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this film."
20,"Last Christmas is sweet and sappy and the lead actors are charming. The media reviews have been bad, but this is a great Holiday feel good movie that I really enjoyed, so back off with the cynicism professional reviewers."
21,Seldom you watch a movie that makes you cry.... it's truly a heart touching movie!! It's sad that movies with such innocence are not made these days..... all the actors did their best! Would love to watch it again!!
22,"A beautiful film. It's not trying to be anything mind blowing but it has laughs a tears, perfect for this time of year.Highly recommended."
23,This has so obviously been review bombed. The movie is the truest form of christmas giving. It will join my collection of xmas greats that must be seen every year. Bravo
24,A classic Christmas movie with perfect casting beautiful songs and excellent performances by the actors! 10/10
25,The movie really made my smile and lifted my morale. It doesn't matter how incorrect the facts are but one has to understand that is not the point of the movie. Throughly enjoyed it. Certainly recommend.
26,"I hadn't really watched the trailers so I didn't know what to expect. I was ready for an OTT Rom Com, instead I got a beautiful story that made me sob (a little close to home), with a fabulous performance from Emma Thompson who had me in stitches. It was laugh out loud and a sob fest in one. My only criticism, not enough George Michael/Wham songs but that's just the nostalgia kicking in."
27,"People don't usually expect much from Christmas movies, they are all more or less the same - plenty of Christmas music, nice atmosphere and warm stories. The trailer promised a whole lot of that, but the movie itself did not live up to my expectations, which were quite low to start with. The concept itself is quite okay, Katarina is working towards a better life after going through a heart surgery, but is generally a mess. Who isn't, by the way? This storyline is perfect for a Christmas movie, she meets a man (or more precisely, imagines a man), he helps her, everything is cool.
BUT the other storyline, relating to her Croatian roots is a bigger mess than she is. The opening scene, a children's choir in a church in Yugoslavia... well, we all know how plausible that is. I'll tell you anyhow - it is not. Not only because the religion was not ""a thing"" back then, but also because it says 1999. Yugoslavia was long gone by then. The language they speak throughout the movie is anything but, it was a messy hybrid between Croatian and Russian and Macedonian and I don't even know what other language. Also, if they all come from Croatia, how come her mother's Croatian is so much worse than her father's? The casting was done terribly in that sense. A Balkan actor for the father, but an English actress for the mother? I'll pass.
Also, her mother blaming Poles for the situation makes no sense at all, and neither does the fact that they curse at each other at the dinner table. We don't do that. The respect for other family members is a huge thing here, and we would certainly not say those things to our parents just out of the blue.
Finally, the choice of George Michael's songs did not fit the story points at all, it all seemed misplaced.
In my opinion, it is just not worth watching. Go watch Home Alone for a 1000th time, you'll have more fun at least."
28,"Okay, so you have a Christmas-themed movie with Emma Thompson in it and it's not Love Actually. Guess what? It's not trying to be Love Actually! So, if you give it a chance, and simply suspend disbelief, you might find yourself enjoying it. It's kinda like Christmas in that respect. As George Michaels would say, ""Ya Gotta Have Faith."" No, it's not going to become an annual Christmas classic, but so what. It's a sweet, decent, amusing and (believe it or not) somewhat endearing little tale of redemption and humanity. It's not complex or deep, and it's not trying to be. So, ignore the Grinches out there and go see it. But be careful. You just might have fun!"
29,"I liked it a lot it had romance, comedy and drama. I liked the main character she was very relatable about how life can sometimes be tough. There is a plot twist at first I didn't like it but makes you still realize to appreciate life and the little things !! Yeah"
30,What a sweet holiday movie! I like the little twist in the movie. I also love the message in the movie... helping each other.
31,"Ok, I thought that this movie would be something funny with simple romantic storyline. But, it turns out that it's really heart-touching film. I know Emilia Clark from Game of Thrones and Me before You. In "" Me before You"" , she did a really great job. And here, this is also her new outstanding movie. For Henry Golding, I first known him with Crazy Rich Asians. After that, "" A Simple Favor"". I won't spoil anything here. Please just watch it. You will know something which is good enough to feel alive."
32,"My wife went to see this with her friends (pun not intended) last Christmas and really enjoyed it, despite me seeing loads of negative reviews. I think reviewers tend not to like it when a film doesn't work for them yet somehow everyone loves it. Plenty of examples..! Anyway, she made me watch it tonight. Here we go, I thought... although I always like Emilia Clarke films, as she always fits the part. It made me smile, made me appreciate things, laughed at it. It made me think and I enjoyed it. Iiked the characters and I don't care what other people thought as it made me happy watching it.... And then as everything unfolded, it absolutely broke me."
33,"I saw this film in theaters last december and was initially FURIOUS at how obvious it was. everyone pointed it out and i thought 'they can't possibly think we're that dumb'. they did and i was PISSED. but on a second viewing, it's a sweet movie and genuine romcom, which i can't say for 'crazy rich asians' which was NOT funny. this was genuinely funny until the end, where it tears your heart out. knowing the end does tear your heart out on the second viewing (and begs logistical questions) but its worth it."
34,"Is there a plot-hole?
I'm not sure whether there it is or not.
I see just a something like delusional vision or imagination, or even a miracle.
But above that all, I like Kate's slice of life that shows us a moral value about being a good person is a good thing.
Rom-com movie that shows us an easy-to-follow plot and a bit entertaining."
35,"Sweet movie about a lost girl who works in a christmas shop who comes from an estranged immigrant family. While she can't acheive fruitful relationship with her mum and sister and resorts to alcohol and sex to numb her bad luck as she couldn't acheive her dream of being a singer.
She meets ""Tom"" a peculiar guy who lets her see life with different eye and turn her life upside down for the better, she gets attached to him and even wants him to be her boyfriend. But the ending is not as expected of how a man or love can change your insight to life. I really liked the unordinary nonstreotyped ending"
36,I don't know if it's because I had no expectations but I found this movie fun and enjoyable and there's also a surprise ending. It definitely stands out from the generic cheesy romance movies and is a really good Chrismas movie to watch.
37,"Often people get too caught up in the deeper meanings and quality of movies and rate them as if each film expects to be Oscar worthy. In reality some movies are made to entertain, not just preach a life lesson or sob story with A list actors and prestigious directors and win awards. ""Last Christmas"" was fun, entertaining, heart
warming, and thought provoking. Surprise! Sometimes the simplest of movies are the best at what film should do. This movie is what you expect and more, and does so to the best of its ability. Now call me crazy but to me that's a 10/10."
38,"I haven't written a review in a long time but was pushed to do so from all the whining from many reviewers.First of all, most of us go to the cinema to enjoy a 'make-believe' world for a few hours. Unless we're watching a documentary, we're not worried about history, geography or language inaccuracies. Grow up people....... who cares if they didn't have carol singing in a 1999 Yugoslav school.... why does everything in life have to be bloo..... politically correct for some of you.Secondly, this was a fairly decent portrayal of mental health issues........ and it dealt sensitively with it...... we all have our demons and if a movie can show someone fighting their demons and trying to win over them it deserves a fair watch as it might help someone in real life.Live and let live people......... there is already so much negative in the world........ having an opinion is one thing but running something down just because it's not politically correct or looks pretentious is just plain silly."
39,"I really enjoyed Last Christmas, and it was not as I expected but that was good. It was a nice simple story that is well told and beautifully acted with great casting. It wasn't laugh a minute but not was it meant to be. It is one young woman's rediscovery of herself and purpose in life with some funny moments. Don't expect it to be like Love Actually and you will enjoy. Let yourself go, and enjoy. And yes that is Amelia Clarke actually singing. If anything it's a bit Bridget Jones grows the f up!
This will be a Christmas TV favorite in years to come and I think will be more enjoyed in the future when people no longer expect it to be Love Actually or Bridget Jones."
40,"Quite good performances from all actors. Nice visuals and music.
Cute story and adequate Christmas stuff.The small political nods (Brexit, racism, lesbianism) were totally unnecessary, but they didn't ruin the movie. It's just annoying when writers feel a need to cram in political commentary in an otherwise unpolitical and cute film."
41,I don't see why people are hating on this movie. Yes it was predictable but still funny and emotional .
42,"I love Christmas movies!! I love happy endings!! I love love! That being said ...I thought that ending was sad. I wanted more. Sure she matured at the end... The twist was a downer.
And why the political message? There was no need for it!!!"
43,And you dont have to give it back. A new favourite Holiday movie with laugh and tears. And emotional roller coaster in the best way. Also Emilia Clarke is not just the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and the Dragons but with this character she became the Queen of the romcoms too.Forget the critics and watch Last Christmas. Even your boyfriend gonna love it.
44,"Im from Croatia and the war ended in '95, not '99Nonetheless, the writing and the acting is horrible.
Plus, Croatians do not speak English like the Russians and that was not Croatian language, except for the father (who is actually Croatian)
Also, an African american kid in the choir at the beginning, seriously? Thats so unrealistic because there weren't any African Americans in Croatia back in '99.I would not recommend wasting your time"
45,"I don't understand why the critics have been so harsh on this film - I thoroughly enjoyed it!Yes, it's predictable, but what Christmas film isn't really?With a wonderful central performance from the ever lovely Emilia Clarke and with good support from Emma Thompson, this is a wonderful film with a lovely message.I would say give it a chance, you won't be disappointed."
46,"Last Christmas is not nearly as good as I expected it to be. This film is a mess. I can't even list all the things that are wrong with it. Emma Thompson playing a Yugoslavian mother? Really??? George Michael songs that, on their own merit are great but, are played during scenes that are inappropriate for what the song is about. Multiple storylines that are shoved together without properly being fleshed out. It's like this was a school project that the students procrastinated on doing and threw it all together in a rush to make deadline. This film had so much potential but in the end is disappointing."
47,"Renowned luvvies Emma Thompson and her lap dog Greg Wise have penned this ingenious screenplay inspired by the George Michael song.I'm afraid it turns out to be a complete insult to the great man's legacy; a moralising, preachy load of rubbish.It is a script full of cheesy platitudes, Brexit-bashing, happy homeless people dancing, a squeaky clean London, an overt attempt to ram home ""diversity""... this is the definition of politically-charged schmaltz.The story is weak and terribly boring, not to mention completely predictable. I was rolling my eyes every 5 minutes.It is also supposed to be funny. I didn't laugh once. Thompson and Wise try to have their insufferable lead Emilia Clarke utter what they believe to be the wittiest lines you've ever heard. Newsflash, talking at 100mph and using stupid similes/metaphors isn't funny.This is probably the most annoying film you'll see this year."
48,"Not sure what all these 10 star people are smoking, but the writing was so bad even Hallmark wouldn't take this on. I'm still wondering how such a great cast could create such a horrible movie."
49,"Never have I seen a more contrived Christmas film this in love with itself. With a terrible plot and bland acting to match and the ridiculous nod on Brexit, this film fails. Also probably one the most predictable plot twists ever, so predictable that literally thousands of people pointed it out after the first trailer. This holiday film will quickly be forgotten."
50,"This really is a mess of a film. It looks and feels like an indulgent vanity project for Ms Thomson. From Brexit, LGBTQI rights, Trans actors ,Immigration AND Survival Guilt you'd be forgiven for wondering where Xmas fits in.
To be honest i'm not going to honour this disaster with a dissemination...
I'd advise folk to give this one a wide berth and if you must see an Xmas film look at the classics, Love Actually, 'Bad Santa' or 'A Muppets Xmas Carol'.
Don't waste your money on this dross."
51,"For me what could have been a touching love story was ruined by a constant stream of politically correct stereotypes. That and the obvious literal interpretation of the title made me sorry I'd paid to see this excuse for a movie. If left-wing politics isn't your thing, perhaps stay at home with your loved ones. I guarantee you will enjoy it more than seeing this movie."
52,"I was really looking forward to a cute feel-good Christmas rom-com but was left wanting.
Emma Thompson should really do her research. The ""Croatian"" she spoke was something with rolling ""r""s that resembled Russian but had no connection to any real language. KGB that she fears so much was an SSSR intelligence agency, not Yugoslav. And btw, by 1999, the Yugoslavia she sets the opening scene in, did not exist as a country (for at least 7 years). I'm surprised that Emilia Clarke, who spent years filming Game of thrones in Croatia, did not notice some other absurdities about the way it was portrayed. Or maybe that was what made her acting so unconvincing. At least her brows were moderate in this movie. And whoever chose the costumes should reconsider their calling."
53,Why is this guy directing for big studios with Zero returns for their millions? What an absolutely horrible waste of time and money I won't get back. It's 2020... is this the best they got? Yawn😔
54,"Things are starting to look up for Emilia Clarke. From all of her work, this might be the best so far. Her singing was amazing. Yet it's not the best acting from her. She was just alright. I just never really felt that her character Kate seem that alcoholic and depress about her past near death experience. Don't get me wrong, she does do a bundle of bad decisions including one that should had gotten her fired from her job as an elf in a surprising year round Christmas shop never seem to have an off day with customers. However, the movie directed by Paul Feig & written by Bryony Kimmings and Emma Thompson, who co-wrote the story with her husband, Greg Wise doesn't go too dark on her struggles and explore her trauma too much due to the PG-13 rating. We never get an explanation of why the surreal events are just now happening. Instead, the movie focus way too much in the beginning digging through her childhood rather than her troubled adulthood. Like honestly, did we really need all those historical inaccuracies scenes involving Yugoslavia in 1999? It could had been cut. The film is also oddly over political about the current immigration problem. Those scenes like the one on the bus felt a bit random, forced and somewhat one sided on the issue. Plus they don't really related to the main story as much as it could had. Despite that, I get what they were going for. I hate discrimination against minorities but I do understand those who travel to another country to live should do it legal through their host immigration laws. It's a very complex issue that the film try to make it seem so easy. It wasn't really needed for a film like this. As with the sub plot of her sister Martha (Lydia Leonard) being afraid to come out as a lesbian to her parents, Petra (Emma Thompson) & Ivan (Boris Isakovic). I felt it try to be too current and took away some of the focus of Kate's main story. Regardless it was just nice to witness such a diverse well acted cast of characters especially the leading man. Asian Male Love Interest is very rare to see in European movies. Henry Golding was great as Tom Webster even if his dream boat good looking but kind character seem one dimensional all boy-scout too good to be true. I just wish he suffer similar issues like Kate but dealing with it better. After all both share a huge bond once you figure out the plot twist. Don't get me wrong, both Clarke & Golding had great chemistry with each other. However the way their characters met could had been better with a more sophistical mature approach. Instead of a silly random out of the blue curiosity scene involving a bird outside her store. The movie could had shown them briefly meeting before Kate's unexplained illness, and then meeting at the hospital much later as he is one getting sick while Kate drink herself to death in front of him. Better yet just have him be related to Santa (Michelle Yeoh) to show why the boss is bitter with Kate's current life choices yet cool exterior enough not to make Kate's life worst by firing her due to irresponsibility. These might have help fill some of the bigger plot holes like how Kate gained access to Tom's apartment or know how Tom look like once the plot twist is reveal and why was on the phone in the cupboard and what is in it. Those weren't never explained. Just think how stronger the story would had been if they went those types of routes. Nevertheless the plot twist is pretty predictable seeing how the title of the movie is based on a song about giving a piece of yourself to your love ones or the fact that the singer George Michaels die from dilated cardiomyopathy. You didn't need the dumbing of the audience flashback to explain what happen to Tom in the past once the plot twist is revealed. The title is good enough. Even if you didn't pay attention reading the title, the movie overplays that song to the point that you have to be deaf not to figure the twist out. The song does get somewhat annoying as well due to the repetitive nature. After a while I really couldn't stand listening to it any longer. Despite that the rest of the soundtrack was pretty good even if it's clearly a collection to Michaels' greatest hits. I just wish the movie establish the music being sung in story a little better than a minor mention of Kate being a huge fan of Wham & a cameo during the Christmas show. As for humor the movie was a mixed bag for me. Some like the mean-spirited judging panel and the homeless people stealing biscuits was out right awkward to laugh at. I just found the majority of the jokes to be meh. Since comedy is subjective; others might find it funnier or a lot duller. Overall: Despite the bitter sweet ending and the movie not being that romantic or comedic. The film still has a very strong message about trying to be happy by doing good deals for others or at least be thankful that you're living rather than six feet under. While not the best romantic Christmas movie. At least, this Christmas rom com is better than most Hallmark Channel films. It's still worth watching."
55,"Review:
'Last Christmas' is a romantic-comedy film directed by Paul Feig.
First things first, this is not your typical Holiday film. I would go as far as to say it's not one you have to strictly watch around Christmas time. The movie wants to be a romantic comedy at heart, and it pulls it off.
The film stars Emilia Clarke as a cynical Christmas store worker who forms a relationship with a mysterious man (Henry Golding) and begins to fall for him.
Emilia Clarke is a goddess send down from the heavens to be shown among the world. She was excellent in this movie and stole every scene she was in. Henry Golding was also good in his role of the film and he and Emilia Clarke had very good chemistry on screen. The side characters get kind of lost in translation throughout the film and are what I call 'throw away' characters. But, Emma Thompson as Emilia Clarke's mother brought most of the laughs and tears in this movie.
I enjoyed the story, but it was quite predictable. I don't know if it's because I've seen all Hollywood has to produce and nothing surprises me, or if it is the fault of the directing itself. From the beginning you can see where the movie is going, but it still didn't take away from the entertainment. Where I had a problem with, the movie was some of it's editing choices. I can't give any examples without giving spoilers, so I won't, but it has to do with the day to day routines of our main character.
Overall, the movie had laughs and heart which is was a romantic comedy needs to have, as well as likable characters. Also, what an amazing soundtrack! I thought it was going to be full of George Michael's songs just because of the title of the film; and it does have a lot of George Michael, but it makes sense. Go check this one out.
3.5/5"
56,"The story of Katrina (Kate), working as an elf full time, meets a wonderful gentleman and realises that she's quite heartless. Superbly executed and wonderful characterisation. Katrina has a little Bridget Jones about her and this is t a typical low budget seasonal flick."
57,"Man pick, and we only lased 40 minutes and walked out. Nothing redeemable, and while we normally like Emilia Clark, even she couldn't save this poorly written, and ridiculous movie. Emma Thomas should stick to acting, and George Michael is rolling in his grave at this cringe fest."
58,Whole film was a mess from start to finish ! Didn't make one bit of sense. Do not waste your money going to see this movie.
59,He's an EFFING GHOST. oh my god this movie blows sooooooooo hard. Like no redeemable qualities. None. Zip. Zero. Zilch. NADA.
60,"First things first. I like Emilia Clarke. Her performance in Game of Thrones was top notch. In this film, not so much.
""Last Christmas"" on paper has a good premise. In my mind it would be someone's last Christmas, probably a tearjerker. Wrong!!!
Bad Script, Bad Directing, Really Bad Casting, Zero Chemistry between any of the actors/actresses.
I almost fell asleep several times. Finally in the last 15 minutes the movie sloppy comes to an end.
Be warned! Pass on this one!!"
61,"This was the most painful 1 hour 43 minutes of my life. Like, what the heck? Why did I pay money to see this travesty of movie? It's as if the Sixth Sense shagged a Hallmark movie and had this wretch of child, Last Christmas. If awkward comedy and disturbing, dead people romance is your thing, then go ahead and make the mistake of seeing Last Christmas. If that's not your thing, stay home and do literally anything else.To be a little more specific about what makes this movie a grievance to humanity, let me explain things concisely: There are a migraine-inducing number of plot holes, the factual inaccuracies will make you weep, and it was as predictable as the sun rising in the east.To emphasize how much I detest this movie, I made a list of activities I would rather partake in than see this movie again:
-Chinese water torture
-Fall into a pit of vipers
-Pet the bear Leo fights in The Revenant
-Move to an island inhabited by cannibals
-Be trapped in Jumanji for 26 years
-Exclusively eat Jack In The Box for the rest of my lifeIn conclusion, I do not like this movie. I want to be a a good citizen by warning humanity about how terrible Last Christmas is. You will thank me, and so will your psychiatrist. If you've already seen it, I'm sorry I was too late. At the very least, there are others in this world, like myself, who understand and can relate to the trauma you went through."
62,"The most boring, predictable, soppy, tear-jerker of a movie ever!!!!!"
63,"It's a shame I need to say this because I adore Emilia Clarke. I'm unsure if it was her fault given the script, but this was incredibly difficult to get through.Anyone giving this a 10 star is not worth listening to. The acting was appalling, it was an incredibly cliche story line with no redeemable features. You don't actually need to see the movie to know how it ends.The trailer WAS the movie, if you saw that - don't even pay. Trust me. It's painful."
64,"I went on a total whim to the movies last week after a long hiatus from going to the movie theater...and I picked this one out of the blue...
And I found it to be quite delightful. I particularly enjoyed the tapestry of George Michael music, London at Christmastime and all the quirky aspects of the characters. I think it might become a Classic Christmas 80's -90's singalong 🎄👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
65,The story to this film hits so many important points. The comedy makes you laugh and smile. The romance and singing gets you in the festive spirit!
66,"Last Christmas tells the story of Kate(Emilia Clarke). Kate is at a low point in her life & she begins working as Santa's elf, at a Christmas supplies store. Soon, Kate meets Tom(Henry Golding). Nothing will ever be the same again.Last Christmas is a superb movie. Director Paul Feig has given us a hilarious, heart-warming & emotional film. The soundtrack featuring George Michael's songs, is an absolute delight. The plot is not predictable but, the plot twist is a tad bit disappointing. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Emilia Clarke is spectacular as Kate. Henry Golding is outstanding as Tom. Emilia Clarke & Henry Golding share effortless chemistry, in all their scenes together. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Santa. Emma Thompson, Boris Isakovic & Lydia Leonard are fantastic as Petra, Ivan & Marta, respectively. The supporting cast is brilliant. Last Christmas is worth a watch for romantic comedy fans. A perfect film for the Christmas season."
67,"Hot on the heels of a raft of films using classic pop as their driver - Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Yesterday, Blinded by the Light - comes Last Christmas.Directed by Paul Feig and co-written by Oscar-winner Emma Thompson, who also appears, Last Christmas uses the music of Wham! and George Michael in its bid to usurp Richard Curtis's copyright on all things London rom-com.The story centres on Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke), the daughter of Croatian refugees (Thompson and Boris Isakovic), who works as a sales elf in a Covent Garden Christmas store. Recovering from life-saving surgery, her chaotic lifestyle leaves her dependent on the goodwill of friends for places to live. Unfortunately, her annoying habits soon dry up any good will and she is constantly moving on. Into her life comes the mysteriously benevolent Tom Webster (Henry Golding) who flits in and out seemingly arbitrarily.Perhaps Emilia Clarke plays the irritating Kate too well as it's difficult to have much sympathy with her homeless plight; she rather brings it on herself you feel. Henry Golding as Tom is expected to do little but smile and look winsome, as he did in Crazy Rich Asians, and he does this with consummate ease.The script from Emma Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Byrony Kimmings is low on humour, preferring to take aim at what it perceives as a xenophobic strand of British society. Yet Emma Thompson herself goes for cheap laughs with her fractured English and misunderstanding of English idioms. It culminates in a penile joke, the like of which hasn't been aired since Mr Humphries asked if he could have Spotted Dick in the Grace Bros staff canteen circa 1975.The film's use of George Michael's pleasant pop also misfires through lack of imagination. In Rocketman, Elton John's music was used extremely well as a compliment to the evolving storyline. Here, the songs simply strike up on random play adding nothing to the plot or purpose of the film.Oh, and 'the twist' and its denouement was a carbon copy of a Hollywood classic from twenty years ago. This, and the obligatory shots of a gleamingly lit pre-Christmas London seen many times before, sum up the whole film as derivative and unoriginal. It was also unforgivably tiresome.Is there anything good to say about Last Christmas? Well, after watching this you'll probably think of Love Actually as being a seminal work of art.As the whole film was a self-contained cliché, it seems quite appropriate to describe it as a Christmas turkey to be avoided like the plague."
68,"I'll start by saying I'm not a huge fan of Christmas or Christmas films so it was really just Emilia Clarke being in it that convinced me to go & see this. I came out at the end with a huge smile on my face! It's lovely, funny & charming, not over the top with anything Christmassy & just fun to watch. Every actor did a great job with their character & the twist (no spoilers) was very clever. Loved it."
69,"If you are searching for a fun lighthearted (pun intended) christmas movie please skip this one. Not a very feelgood movie, really wish they had left out that heartwrenching plottwist. The cast however is great and there are lots of quick lines and funny moments. Still I wish I hadn't seen it."
70,"I was looking forward to an early Christmas film with family,(admittedly biased by the trailers showing Emilia Clarke looking her best) but even early on this film showed no promise. We stuck with it to the end, hoping for improvement but there was none. Don't get me wrong, we weren't expecting a masterpiece but we weren't expecting something so embarrassingly bad."
71,"I felt like this storyline could've been better. The side story with the story owner was wierd and somewhat dull. The main characters were enduring and likeable. This movie has a twist you don't see coming. Not really a cheerful Christmas movie, better to watch another time of the year in my opinion."
72,"It tries to be Notting Hill or Four Weddings or even Music and Lyrics, but it fails on all points.Just doesn't have the charm. Tries too hard"
73,"This film didn't really suck me in for a while, but I'd gotten to the point of no return, and I'm SO glad I stuck with it.For me, it was a shock twist that took me completely by surprise (I'm normally sharper, but I'm a bit hungover) and I instantly balled my eyes out.A gorgeous film which will make you rethink yourself and how you act, but brings a nice amount of joy to your life.Needs a higher rating."
74,"Let's get the obvious out of the way, this is a feel good film, yes it has nothing groundbreaking story wise but it so wonderfully written, acted and presented that it hits every button you expect.It feels small and intimate and whilst you know where it is going half way through you don't care.Sometimes you just need something nice that prods the emotions.I love action films, political thrillers , gross out comedies and then on a winters evening as Christmas approaches a little gem like this. Henry Golding has a gentle kindness in his character and as expected Emilia Clarke is just charming naughtiness personified.I even liked the writing and delivery of the little roles , especially the two police officers who are perfect.Simple, emotional and charming."
75,"How can you go wrong by blending a full suite of George Michael's classic hit songs, a Christmas themed film that is so well written (with a surprise twist) and stars the very multi-talented actress Emilia Clarke. Mrs. Shullivan and I decided t make this our first Christmas film of this the 2020 holiday season, and the film left us with a full heart of FEEL GOOD romance, family dynamics, social inclusiveness, and most importantly it left us both with that wonderful Christmas spirit reminiscent to watching an age old Christmas classic such as ""It's a Wonderful Life (1946)"" and/or ""Miracle on 34th Street (1947)"".This was a great Christmas spirit themed film and sure to become an annual Christmas classic for many decades to come, on so many entertainment and family value levels. Michelle Yeoh, plays store owner Santa, in her Christmas themed two storey retail store in which she employs Kate as her top elf and salesgirl. Emma Thompson who plays Emilia Clarke's immigrant Yugoslovian mother who suffers from depression and we see that the family dynamics between Katarina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) her mother Petra (Emma Thompson), her father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) who has a law degree from his homeland of Yugoslavia but has to settle being employed as a mini cab driver in London, and her estranged sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) who has a secret of her own not shared with her parents.Katarina/Kate is struggling to find peace, sanity after enduring a serious illness a year ago and to come full circle with her parents and her sister and as the film progresses we see how Katarina slowly through a series of her own misfortunes she finally comes to attain her inner peace in both her mind and her soul that we all strive to achieve in our own personal life struggles and our own family dynamics. Mrs. Shullivan and I laughed, and we cried, and the music score of so many George Michael's classic songs made the film a perfect 10 out of 10 IMDB rating. We also get to see the city of London, England dressed for the holiday season, and as the popular holiday song written by Frank Loesser in 1944, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the actors worked through the cold London winter on the River Thames to make this a Christmas classic for the ages.It's a MUST SEE and will become an annual Christmas classic on many top ten holiday lists. Watch it and you won't be disappointed."
76,This movie is exactly what you want Christmas movie to be. Amelia Clarke and Henry Golding are perfectly cast.
77,"What a captivating beautiful story! Funny, diverse and thoughtful! The unlikely chemistry of the characters took me by surprise. There's so many points in this movie that just wanna make you love more, forgive more. Pls watch. I highly recommend. Absolutely love this movie!"
78,This movie is very like a Bridget Jones film meets Elf. It's sweet and Emilia Clark is charming!Henry Golding is enchanting and Emma Thompson as ever riveting! Add some great characters like Michele Yeoh and Lydia Leonard and you have a sweet treat! Grab some popcorn and have an enjoyable time!
79,"I always like watching Christmas themed movies and this was quite different from what I usually see. I love the feeling while watching this movie but I was shocked, and left me very sad in the end. I overlooked ""it"" while everyone already know what it will be about. But I like it very much!"
80,"There are only so many Christmas movies that are tolerable, I found this one to be such. It gives you the feels even if some feel like is corny TV film. I enjoyed both the leads so that helps in all together reviews of any movie. I would watch this every Christmas season. It was cool how they made all George Michael's songs put into the movie and work. May he R.I.P 7/10"
81,"Last Christmas is an enjoyable watch if you know what kind of movie you're watching. It's terribly written and very corny, but it's filled to the brim with Christmas spirit. Films like Last Christmas and Love Actually fall into a category of films that I like to call 'Christmas Cringe.' Crappy Christmas romcoms that are just bathing in their corniness, to the point that you just can't judge it critically and have to except and enjoy these movies as a staple of the Christmas season. However, Last Christmas does have other things going for it. Emilia Clarke is amazing in the lead role and delivers a lot of warmth and likeability to the movie, despite the initial selfishness of her character, and her journey throughout the film is interesting and it's rewarding to watch her become a better person. Emma Thompson is amazing and delivers most of the the movie's funny moments, with her great comedic timing. However, Henry Golding is the weak link. He does fine with what he's given to work with, but his character is so generic and bland that literally any other actor would deliver the same performance. Also, the plot twist is one of the most predictable in film history. I called it just before I even arrived at the cinema. Because it does deliver on making you feel the Christmas spirit, I'd recommend Last Christmas. It's corny, but it knows it is and is having fun being so. However, if you've already spent too much money on your Christmas presents, then rewatch a Christmas classic like Home Alone or one of the A Christmas Carols."
82,"I just got back from watching Last Christmas. I enjoyed it.
The chemistry between the two leads is excellent and despite Emilia Clarke's character Kate being a hot mess, she comes off as likeable and I found myself rooting for her.
Henry Golding is gorgeous as ever, and he has such an expressive face ... and Emma Thompson was enjoyable as Kate's mother.
The ending was excellent, and I enjoyed the music.
My main problem was the execution of the plot twist... it was truly and horribly forced."
83,"I guess this is the kind of movie that exists only because it's supposed to make you feel something. Well, that's probably the objective of most of movies but there are some of them that only have this as their main goal. And that's where ""Last Christmas"" is headed.
Underneath a poor-ish screenplay, we have a deep and relevant message with a great dose of Emilia Clarke.
To begin with, she is refreshingly fabulous as Kate, or either Katarina, as she discovers herself as the story goes by. And pairing up with George Michael's legacy, we have the perfect christmas combo.
Henry Golding is sweet and charming. Emma Thompson, well, is Emma Thompson. This woman can be anything she wants to be.
And also, why isn't anyone talking about Michelle Yeoh? What a charismatic and light role she played! I really do think Santa suits her.And, as an advice, do NOT watch the trailer before watching the movie because it can be a major spoiler. But still, even if you did watch the trailer, go to the theaters anyway.
Everyone need a warm cup of love and christmas lights in the daily basis. And that's what Last Christmas it's all about.
I guess if we all watch movies like this and keep their very best message as a life lesson, this non-caring and low of self-love world would turn out to be a very nice place to live in."
84,Loved it!!! Such a special and meaningful film! Definitely wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did!
85,"First 75 minutes were descent but the movie took a sharp turn after the surprisingly good twist where the movie did not end In a typical Christmas movie cliche. I really liked that. You also get the meaning of the name ""last Christmas"". The movie got very good the last time 30 minutes but before the twist it was bland. The acting was pretty good with Henry Golding as the best one. Overall a descent Christmas movie."
86,"I am glad I did not listen to any professional reviews going into this movie. As usual, they all copied each other attempting to pan it.Emilia Clarke is great, those who have been You Before Me will know she has more range acting wise than her Westeros expoilts potray. It is exciting now that show is over to see which roles she will undertake in the coming years.Back to this film, the characters are likable, the brightly lit production design of London is superb, and the soundtrack containing pretty much all George Michael songs fits the story perfectly.Now on to the twist (SPOILERS) I thought this was a similar sort of idea to JOKER with the love interest not actually existing, but LAST CHRISTMAS did it more effectively. You wont catch many comparing this film to JOKER ;)All in all, an enjoyable, easy to watch Christmas film."
87,"So with Christmas upon us, ring that bell for battle of the Christmas movies. Accompanied with the missus, got myself enough treats to settle in for the siege, but surprisingly, I found the movie to have a good story, Emilia Clarke was on point, funny, witty and really sended home a message throughout the story about living you're life, embrace and second chances. Henry Golding, you're an absolute beauty, I look forwarded to seeing you in more roles to come."
88,That should be the title. Holy Jesus... it's the 21 Century and your remaking this crap? Why?
89,"Where do I start.This is most politically correct yet incorrect movie of all time. The only white, non-immigrant, non-disabled, non-homeless, non-LGBTQ person, was giving racist abuse to an immigrant couple on a bus.This movie is exactly what's wrong with the ""Luvvie"" generation.It's such a shame because this had the potential to be lovely film but it just left me seething!"
90,"This move was ridiculous. It never really had a beginning, middle or end. It was pure torture. Nothing made sense. The surprise ending was so stupid. I hated this movie. My husband slept thru it. Save your money people. Not even the sappiest lovers of Christmas movies will like this corny movie."
91,"Short and sweet review...Attempt to make a film as good as
Love actually completely failed
And with a twist that copied straight from return to me
Ina way. But not only that the twist was not needed! When it could have just been a nice love story Xmas film. But he wasn't even there..... she's mentally not well then lolSweet little film til that destroyed it.
Great performances by all just lacked in story.And probably made just to push brexit lol
No where near and 8 or 10!
Would have been happy to watch on Netflix but not spend my Money"
92,"Politics, LGBT themes is frankly speaking the least you await from a film about Christmas. It was everything but Christmas. The only actor resqueing the whole thing is Emma Thompson.To cut it short, or isn't the film you would want to see with your husband to get into the Christmas spirit."
93,"Not a feel-good Christmas movies for sure. The main female lead played by Emilia Clarke is unlikeable, the ""exYU"" sterotypes are somehow both completely inaccurate and offensive with misfires that could have been prevented with a two second Google check. Clearly the producers just couldn't be arsed. Shame Emma Thompson was dragged into this. On the plus side, the male lead was very sweet."
94,"I can't see why the ""professional"" critics don't like this film. It's a lovely story with an unexpected twist. It started a little slow but the characters are all likeable and there is some humour dotted about.
Certainly worth a look"
95,"There are too many loose ends when this film mercifully ends. Was it a dream? How did she know him? Was he dead? Why is she such a thoughtless, inconsiderate b---h? Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money."
96,"Went expecting a bit of pre-Christmas Rom-com. Instead got a 2 hour lecture in wokeness and political correctness draped over a weak storyline, poor dialogue and cheesy acting.This is film set in the capital of the UK in which, the only speaking parts allocated to non-minorities in this film are to portray them as homeless or bigots. Reverse racism of the most nauseating variety!"
97,"Yugoslavia 1999? Really?? Is it hard to do just five minutes of research before making a movie? Pathetic... Movie plot is more less ok, but I am sick of this stupid mistakes and I'm giving 1/10."
98,"Fans of schmaltzy rom-coms rejoice! Last Christmas is here and it's a sickly-sweet holiday treat that will either leave you wanting seconds or asking for the bill after the first bite. Call me The Grinch, but I wanted a refund.The film stars Emilia Clarke as a hapless mid-20-year-old stuck in a dead-end job as a Christmas store elf. Things take a turn for the better when a mysterious stranger (played by Henry Golding) enters her life, helping her piece her life back together just in time for Christmas.It's never a good sign when the film's trailer feels like the whole movie, but you would be right on the money with Last Christmas. As soon the first trailer hit the web, the film's twist had already been dissected in the YouTube comments and those holding their breath for something more will leave sorely underwhelmed.Sure, you don't go into a film like this expecting to be surprised but neither do you want it feeling like it's three steps behind you just because you've seen the trailer. Yet, as soon the film delivers its climactic plot twist with the earnestness of a kid tying their shoelaces for the first time, the film quickly trips over its own feet.It's hard to lay blame on the marketing department as there's not much to work with in terms of the film's story. Taking its title from the 1984 Wham! pop song Last Christmas, the film treats George Michael's music with the same depth as Yesterday treated the Beatles; as window dressing. When it comes to the actual film, it's nothing more than your typical Hallmark movie of the week. Watching Clarke bumble around is endearing enough for the first half or so but it wears thin quickly and the predictable story line does little to keep things interesting.So, the question remains: how far can a film go based on charm alone? Well, your mileage will undoubtably vary based on your tolerance of saccharine love stories as Last Christmas is as sweet as they get. Its lack of cynicism and Clarke's infectiously bubbly lead performance will likely be its saving grace for many, but Last Christmas' story feels like a lump of coal wrapped up in pretty packaging."
99,"What a waste of my time. Terrible storyline, bad acting."
100,"It was just so cringeworthy. Same Hollywood formula film, everything carefully drafted from every woke stereotype cast member to the every derivative storyline to the ordinary dialogue fluff. It's been done a million times. Just too familiar. Try something new and original once in a while with REALISTIC cast members that isn't based on a forced woke diverse twitter list.Stop making films where you base your decisions on making sure every sexual orientation, color and gender is represented. It's unnatural and phony.My only curiosity was that the film was based on a Wham song and I wanted to see how it played out as a feature. It didn't do well. Better watch the original music video as it is more emotional and realistic.SKIP IT!"
101,"""Last Christmas"" would be a major hit on Netflix and LIfetime without the A-list ensemble or top-shelf boss. But this romantic comedy is a subpar experience as a cinematic element, where aspirations are naturally lower. ""Last Christmas"" is so candy sweet that even the most optimistic of Santa's Elves will leave a bad taste in the mouth. ""Game of Thrones"" actress Emilia Clarke plays Kate, a twenty-something reckless woman who works in a London seasonal store run by a woman who goes by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Santa respects Kate as an employee but has recently taken its toll on Kate's growing cynicism and self-destructive behaviour. A fun montage reveals that Kate and most of her peers have burned bridges. And make matters worse, a medical problem cut off Kate's singing career. But when she meets Tom (Henry Golding), the kind and considerate, Kate's prospects start looking up. The highlight of the film is the performance of Emma Thompson as Kate's daughter, Adelia (Emma Thompson), a Yugoslav immigrant who is overly protective. Thompson, who is co-writing here, saves for herself all the best jokes. She puts on a thick accent and has an excellent comic timing. The rest of the picture is tonally distorted, synthetic, and lazy flat-out. Those who demonized ""Green Book"" last year's Oscar winner could also easily send their rage on ""Last Christmas."" Part of the narrative is about the work of Kate in a homeless shelter. You will instantly recognize the artificial essence of the one depicted here if you have ever visited or worked in one of these important places. Kate steps in as the facility's sort of savior. It's wince-inducing negatively. It's cinematic experience incapable of unsophisticated filmmaking. My wife and I have happily watched the latest Netflix Christmas deals for the last two holiday seasons. These cheesy films are lovely time-wasters. We put them on in my office last year while wrapping presents secretly, and these absurd films provided cheerful background noise. ""Last Christmas"" is better seen in that atmosphere, where you only sporadically concentrate on the film, enjoying the funny parts. But the cracks are magnified if you are forced to sit silently in a crowded theatre."
102,This is a sickly wishy washy load of rubbish that is really not worth spending time or money on.The story has no credibility whatsoever and is jam packed with stereotypical performances of one dimensional characters - and an obvious lack of research by the writer.All in all this was the waste of a film budget so that the 'luvvy' brigade can massage their own egos. it is purely a cash generator.I strongly suspect that the high rating reviews are false - because this gets nowhere near even a 4 however you look at it.
103,"Bad acting, bad storytelling, predictable, too much going on, advertised as a george michael tribute but that's just bs because his songs are just background radio noise instead of actual soundtracks. All in all this is probably the dumbest movie of the year. Don't even know why I'm giving it 2 stars."
104,"Oh Dear! Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I had ""high hopes"" for this film, but as a real fan of the goo-fest that is ""Love Actually"" I at least thought this might fill some seasonal void in the run up to the festive season. ""Best Christmas film of the decade!!"" screams the marketing. Er... no.This review will be spoiler free.The plot: Kate (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant from the former-Yugoslavia now living in London. She has a dead-end job working for ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh) in a Christmas shop in Covent Garden. She is perennially lubricated both with drink and other bodily fluids thanks to her hedonistic lifestyle. And she really likes George Michael.But life just seems vacuous and to have no purpose for her anymore. Her composure is not helped by her mother (Emma Thompson) constantly fussing about her health, since Kate has only recently recovered from a serious illness.Dropping into her life then comes Tom (Henry Golding). Smartly dressed and calmly reassuring, Tom seems to have the potential to start turning Kate's life around. But is she prepared to listen?There are startling similarities here with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's triumphant tribute to hedonistic 30-something sex-addicted females everywhere.... ""Fleabag"". Kate is similarly louche, hopping from bed to bed in a heartbeat. She has a dysfunctional family and - most strikingly - she has a particularly difficult relationship with her high-achieving sister. This is not helped by a remarkable similarity between the actress playing Marta (Lydia Leonard ) and Fleabag's Clare (Sian Clifford). But whereas Fleabag is both brilliantly written, heart-rending and hilarious, this simply is not.There were a total of two laughs in the movie for me. Period. Both were lines delivered by Emma Thompson, and if you've seen the film you probably know the ones. Now, I'm aware that Thompson co-wrote the script and she is, of course, a national acting treasure. But here the script is clunky and all of the ""comic"" scenes are so laboured and forced that they land like leaden weights.And some of it makes no sense whatsoever. There is some strange Danish sauerkraut salesman (Peter Mygind) with a crush on ""Santa"". He suddenly appears in the shop acting like some escaped mental patient. When he first appears, acting bizarrely, you think, ""oh, there must be some fascinating backstory between these two - a murky past they are trying to rekindle"". But no! This is the first time they have EVER met? It's completely bonkers!Much was made of this being Michelle Yeoh's ""first comedy"". Sorry, but if she proves anything here it is that she is not a comic actress.Emilia Clarke is still looking to land in a decent mainstream role outside ""Game of Thrones"", after a failed Terminator sequel, a half-decent weepie (""Me Before You"") and the commercial failure that was ""Solo"". Here she certainly looks curvaciously cute as the Christmas elf. But unfortunately cute can't save her from the car-crash of a script.Similarly Henry Golding is well-dressed eye-candy for the ladies, almost doing a re-tread of his cool and laid-back character from the excellent ""Crazy Rich Asians"". Without the same need to be ""zany"", he fairs slightly better from the script. But again, this feels like one to shuffle into a quiet corner of his CV.What can I say that's even remotely good about this? Three things:1) London. It looks glorious, decked out in lights like some chocolate-box-cover cum tourist-board publicity shot. London is one of the most photogenic cities on the planet, and I could relate to Tom's mantra to ""look up"" and see all of the architectural quirks and foibles that exist around every corner in that wonderful city;
2) The payoff. Exactly when you get the payoff will depend on how much you know going in (if you've managed to avoid the trailer... continue to avoid it!) and how attentive you are. There's an ""aha!"" moment. And it's nicely played out.
3) There's a topical xenophobic Brexit angle, that's a little clumsy in the exposition but - in my view - is good for the telling.This is a movie desperately trying to blend ""Love Actually"" with another Christmas classic (no... not ""Die Hard""... but to say more would introduce spoilers!) But in my view it misses badly.The director is Paul Feig, famous for ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Spy"" and infamous for the female ""Ghostbusters"" reboot.There are clearly lovers of this film. At the time of writing it has made an impressive $51M on its $25M budget. But I went with another three cinema-goers from my family, all of differing ages and sentiments: and we all universally agreed on the rating for this one.(For the graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web. Thanks)."
105,"I really wanted to like this movie but ended up yawning through the whole thing. It was so bad that I actually heard someone snoring in the back. Emilia Clarke's acting was super annoying and over the top, just like how it was in Me Before You. The editing felt messy and the humor was horrifyingly awful. Michelle Yeoh's monologue about the names she used in her former workplaces was so cringey that you'd think those lines were written by an eight-year-old. Overall, everything felt forced and cliche in this movie, even Henry Golding's charisma could not save it. If you want a real holiday rom-com, this ain't it."
106,"Just another boring, dumb romantic drama garbage that has every possible cliches. If you watched a random romantic/comedy movie before, then you already watched this movie. Anyone who gave it more than 5 stars has no brain at all."
107,"I just didn't like this movie at all. The main-character, Kate, was insanely unlikeable, as was the rest of the characters. The story was so cliche and try-hard. There was no charm whatsoever. Emma Thompson's, which was the comic relief in the movie, acted well but her Eastern European accent was horrendous."
108,Could be one of the worst movies I've seen. There's nothing redeeming about it except for maybe the last 5 minutes.
109,"Slow pace, fairly predictable love story plot. The actors are delightful but the story is lackluster. As soon as the main characters had interacted for 5 minutes I leaned over and told my friend what I thought was happening, and sure enough at the end I was right. Not the worst movie ever, but quite ho-hum."
110,"This was a great movie, with the right amount of laughs and a few tears. It had a great underlying message and the music was great. Who new this young lady from Game of Thrones could also be so humorous with a surprisingly good singing voice. I really enjoyed this light hearted feel good movie and it will be one I will watch every Christmas. A new christmas tradition."
111,Ultimately this was a feelgood movie so don't be put off if it seems a bit confusing to start with. You may feel that it's a bit disjointed but we found that it was worth sticking with as it all comes together well. Good cast & magical settings just right for getting into the Christmas spirit & the soundtrack of mostly George Michael songs was a bonus.
112,"Good: Emilia Clarke is great and is the one that brings the heart to the film. Henry Goulding is fine for role cast but can feel off at times. There are funny scenes to be had but not numerous. Emma Thompson is good as always.Bad: Michelle Yeoh is a big miscast and role did not fit in with the movie. Although writing could be funny at parts, there is not much for the cast to work with as the story is run-of-the-mill and generic. There are filler scenes and not much to see.Overall: There is nothing new here and will probably not be a Christmas staple. Although Clarke excels in her role and is great to see her on the big screen, she is the only one that holds the movie together.2.5/5*The movie focuses more on Clarke's arc than on romance so do not expect a mushy-gushy romance."
113,"OK, so - there are some stuff in it that is obviously a bit silly (the twist, sorry but that was not for me), but this is quite a heartwarming and charming film, which I did not expect when seeing the trailer. For a romantic christmas film it did deliver on both and even though I watched it in September, I thouroughly enjoyed it."
114,"This movie is so sweet. It's not your typical romantic comedy, which is a good thing. Emilia Clarke is adorable and fun, despite her character starting off as a pretty crappy person! Her character arc is satisfying. Goulding is charming and sweet. I found myself smiling at multiple points, and sobbing at another. I will say the twist was relatively predictable, but I appreciated the slow reveal. My only complaint is about the various political statements being made -- even if I agree, I don't love movies making them."
115,"I loved this film. It had me laughing out loud, a few somber moments, and a whole load of christmas lights magic. Emilia was amazing and adorable, Henry was charming, and Emma was a singular treat; she had me roaring with laughter. Don't analyze and dissect. Go at it as pure fun...which it absolutely is!"
116,"A charming rom-com based on George Micheals song Last Christmas! Paul Feig is pretty good at making most movies except the rubbish ones. Typical romance movie with quite a bit of brightness and heartwarming vibes. Very lovable in many ways, I'm glad it was more appreciated by many!"
117,"It has a lot of mistakes, exaggerated anthologies that they sometimes forget and undecided approaches but it fulfills the objective of being a cute, fun, cheesy and entertaining romantic Christmas comedy with your family (yes I cried with the plot twist)"
118,"For a start, a movie is not as bad as a movie, but there are many uncertainties and imperfections in it. First of all, it says at the beginning - Yugoslavia 1999 ... OK, but then it is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) made up only of Serbia and Montenegro that existed until 2003 and the only war that could be escaped then was the bombing of the NATO alliance, though, I can safely say that those who were running away were very, very rare...
Secondly, swearing at the dining table in the family circle is simply not acceptable to any Balkan family (I take into account here that the film refers to the SFRY in spite of the stated year) and especially not to such swearing that was said in the film!
Third, Petra as a middle-aged woman speaks worse in her native language than her daughter (Kate), who went to live in another country as a teenager. Really?!
They should have asked Boris first to explain to them all about the Balkan culture and language...
Overall, the movie is not bad at all, to someone who does not know the culture and language of the country being talked about, and despite the imperfections, it has my warm recommendation."
119,"When i read the synopsis of this movie before watching it, I didn't know what it would really be about. I figured it was simply a Christmasy romcom, which I was okay with, but expected no more. I was surprised in a great way.
The movie is very character driven, as most romcoms. In fact, it uses the same structure as it is, for 75% of its length, a movie of that genre.
The plot twist changes it all. But even though it is unexpected and surprising, it is not unjustified. In fact, by the time it is revealed, it has been setup very carefully, by showing us there's something odd about Tom, nobody knows him, and by having Emilia's character tell us about her heart transplant situation in a scene that is disguised as only emotional and as a bonding between characters. The plot twist makes sense, fits well, and is fulfilling.
To be honest, I didn't like Tom for most of the film. For me, he was preachy and too perfect to be any relatable. However, by the moment he tells Kate that she can't depend on him, it all made sense. He was there to teach her that she had to stop clinging to every men and relationship she had, and start to do things by herself, to be herself and free herself. I feel Kate's flaw could've been setup in a more deeply way, by having her affairs really having a negative impact in her life. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and, save for the expected cheesy romcom moments, it was very good!"
120,First of all I went in with very low expectations and I came out really enjoying myself and I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone (except children under 10).
121,"We really enjoyed this film ! Simple feel good movie with a twist. Political undertones reflect current situation nationally.
We laughed out loud, clapped along, sang along and cried.
Emma Thomson was wonderful and she made us smile inside and out.
Please ignore those high falutin reviews and go see a lovely film."
122,"It's quite a stagnant plot to me from the beginning but I'm glad to have such an unexpected and touching ending.""A little help could makes you feel happier"", a great movie to watch during this Christmas thanksgiving season."
123,This movie was slightly predictable but it will pull your heartstrings and hopefully make you hope again. It is a sweet and much needed reminder not to be so worried about what you don't have but to appreciate what you do. That means people as well. Listen to them. They might surprise you.
124,"Last ChristmasThis movie was much better than the often over-sentimental mush we usually get every Christmas. Emelia Clarke was great and is quite a comic talent, and she sang really well as well.The script was tight the whole ensemble were great and the subtle way George Michael's music was woven in was a triumph and watch out for Andrew Ridgley in the crowd.I really enjoyed this 6/10"
125,Surprisingly good was expecting a cheesy Rom/com holiday film.
126,"Forgetting all about Thanksgiving and moving to Christmas, Last Christmas is the perfect Holiday movie about how miracles can change lives. A story laired over the sounds of the late Great Gorge Micheal. Is this how those broadway musicals inspired by recording artist work? I'm guessing Emmy Thompson who starred produced and wrote this movie had a thing for the singer.
Overall,Last Christmas does get you in the mood for Christmas but the magic of the Holliday is not all there. Sometimes it's trying harder than it needs to making it cornier than it needs to but I guess that's ok for getting us into the Christmas spirit. Although it does make the movie feel like it should be on the Hallmark channel not it theatres."
127,Wow ! I didn't see that one coming. Absolutely brilliant. Beautiful story.
128,If I could give this 0 stars I would. Shocked Emilia Clarke put her name to this. I walked out after an hour. It is brutal.
129,Good story line. Emilia was stunning and henry was also good. Great performance both of them.
130,"Amazing story. Comedy and I lose all the cast and act..
Watch and enjoy"
131,"Sweet and charming holiday movie with a twist, with Emilia Clarke at her most radiating self. She has that Julia Roberts quality in her charm, but with an English bite to it. Watched the movie with my wife and we laughed and enjoyed ourselves, not expecting a terrific movie. But judged on its on merit, this is a perfect holiday movie. Would watch it again."
132,Good movie for all ages. If you watched the trailer before the movie you will know exacly what the movie is about.
133,"I don't foresee this being a classic. I thought it was a fun 3/4 of a movie. The two leads seem to have good chemistry with each other. I love Michelle Yeoh, but she seemed unnecessary in this movie. I guess they need more than one mother-figure who criticizes Kate/Katarina.
Unfortunately, the pleasantness has a twist. Not a good one either. It feels like the rug is pulled out from under the audience. The remainder of the film tries to bring a happier closure, but the damage is done. I understand the message it tries to bring, but being a Christmas movie, you kind of expect a more positive or happy ending. Perhaps if it wasn't set at Christmas time, the downer could be over looked. Or maybe there could have been a way to rescue the film. Unfortunately, while the twist was something different and unusual, it was like walking happily on a street, then falling down a sewer when you didn't know the manhole cover was missing.
If you want to see a cheerful Christmas movie, I'm not sure if this is the one for you. It's also a bit more sexually suggestive in language and content, so it's not a family movie.
Maybe somewhere down the line, someone could do a remake of this film, perhaps give it a better recovery from the depressing ending. So I give it a pass because it is a fairly good movie up to a certain point."
134,"Absolutely awful movie that I had such high hopes for considering the talent starring in it. Completely predictable, and the only parts that were laughable were the ones where it was by no means meant to be funny, it just happened to be that way by the movie goers making fun of said movie. Don't waste your money."
135,"I am dumbfounded how this is even considered a good movie, the screenplay, script and characters are so bland and the story is so preposterously stupid I came out of the cinema speechless at how shocking this movie truly was. To date the worst movie I have ever seen at the cinema. This women is truly truly delusion. It's not love in the slightest."
136,I didn't believe the acting... ... poor storyline... I didn't enjoy!
137,Poorly written with a storyline that reminds me of a 50s 'B' movies used to preview the main feature at the picture house (in the old days). Poorly conceived and should have been positioned more as an afternoon TV movie. Total rubbish. I'd suggest you ignore and move on.
138,It's not a good Christmas movie that makes you feel guilty for wishing Emma Thompson had been shot in Yugoslavia in the 90s.
139,"I'm a sucker for Christmas movies, but this one I would have to rate as one of the worst I've ever seen. My wife and I were the only ones in the theater watching this dribble, and I can see why.
I'm a big Emma Thompson fan, but she's embarrassing herself here in her dual role as scriptwriter/actress. The script was as loose as watery jello, going everywhere and nowhere at once. Her imitation of a Yugoslavian mother was cringeworthy. You could almost think director Paul Feig felt the same way of how bad things were by punching in a pedestrian, plodding camera placements hampered by unnecessary quick cross-cutting editing.
Only two positives: the George Michaels/Wham music numbers were great (but were really short snippets) and the twist was somewhat interesting. Otherwise, a total waste of time and money."
140,Really enjoyed this film and cried buckets at the end. Cant understand why the rating is so low. Emilia Clarke is fab in it and her mums character played by Emma Thompson was brilliant. Loved it!
141,"I don't understand why this film has such a low average. Acting is brilliant, writing is brilliant, story is great - funny but not cheesy. And I was stupefied how well Emilia and Emma Thomson can speak Serbian! Without any accent at all."
142,Just a terrible movie. It's another film where diversity is being forced on us at every opportunity.
143,"I really like Emilia Clarke but she has to get a new agent. She carries this movie on her back. But it isn't enough to save it from the paper thin screenplay. Can we all just admit right now that Emma Thompson is just not that great a screenwriter? I mean sure if she is tweaking a great writer like Jane Austen she can do ok but on her own - very over rated.The movie concerns Kate a young woman who had a heart transplant last Christmas. Since that time she has been lost and making a series of poor decisions. Kate likes to sing but no one seems to want her to as they won't pay her to do it. In the meantime she works at a Christmas store. Kate meets Tom who is too good to be believed and somehow gets her to start making better decisions.Like a lot of Feig productions 30% of the screen play is ad libed. 3 sub plots are in this movie but seem to have none or little relation to it.In the end Kate is taking care of herself, happy and helping others... but the big question is why. No one convincingly wrote a story whereby we would really see why. All of that is just glossed over. Loving or liking someone else has zero relation to that."
144,"Bad writing but so much fun, the chemistry between like all of the characters is really good, also kinda felt like a direct opposite of Joker (meaning instead of good to bad she goes bad to good) which was a surprise"
145,"Last Christmas is a new romantic comedy directed by Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids, Spy and The Heat.The film is about the young Kate (Emilia Clarke), who has had a difficult period behind her back, which makes her now a bit more moody. For example, she works as a cherry elf in a Christmas shop, while she would prefer to earn her money as an independent singer or a singer in a Christmas choir. When she meets the mysterious boy named Tom (Henry Golding), her life seems to take a positive turn. Kate keeps on seeing Tom again and again and the chemistry between the two starts to grow, causing Kate to fall in love with Tom.This film is a somewhat early romantic Christmas comedy, which remains good for a long time with the story of the film. The film does contain a plot twist, but it is somewhat predictable. The twist first comes across in a beautiful way in the film. Unfortunately, the film is also filled with extra separate story lines that deal with the problems of other characters, for example, or political messages to make the film more up-to-date. Because of all these extra storylines, the film suddenly no longer seems to focus on the main story about the relationship between Kate and Tom. It would have been better if they could end this film a little earlier and leave out all these extra storylines for a better story and conclusion.The title of the film is based on the song of the same name by Wham !. This film is also filled with well-known songs from the band and others from lead singer George Michael. With all this music and other Christmas elements, they are trying to get you into a Christmas mood with this film, but we are only in the beginning of November. This makes these attempts to get you in the Christmas mood a bit too early. They should have released this film a month later in the cinemas."
146,"Sorry, but this Xmas cheesefest stinks to high heavens.
The story is god awful (double that once you get to the main story twist).
The dialogues are painful beyond cringe factor.
The acting as can be expected with this dreadful script is horrific
Emma Thompson's worst job in years. Emilia Clarke was never a great actress and she plainly sucks - there is nothing charming about her character.
Michelle Yeoh did not seem comfortable in her role and should return to martial arts flicks ASAP.
Henry Golding is the only cast member that managed to put a likable character on set.
Oh, and as for the Brexit/Xenophobic ""finger pointing"", you know exactly what you can do with that finger...."
147,"Waist of time. Made me so angry, the worst movie I've seen for years!!!"
148,"The latest from Paul Feig (Bridesmaids/The Heat) is a misbegotten love affair co-written by Oscar winner Emma Thompson (who won an Oscar for adapting Sense & Sensibility in 1995) starring Emilia Clarke & Henry Goulding. Clarke is the atypical misanthrope who loves drink a bit much, is on the last legs w/her friends as far as favors are concerned & the only job she can hold is at a PartyCity-esque shop which is Christmas themed where she sells tragic yuletide trinkets dressed up as an elf & gets no respect from her boss (Michelle Yeoh co-starring w/Golding again after last year's monster hit Crazy Rich Asians). Just when you think things can get any worse for her, she meets a guy who shows her the error in her ways where she slowly but surely begins to turn a page & make herself a better human being & yada, yada, yada. Not working as a straight rom-com or a twisty fable (which when it comes loses any audiences who've tuned in for the love story bromides). The novelty of having a chock-a-block of George Michael songs feels shoehorned in to the point of blood loss. How can something so effortless in conception become such a rigamarole of contrivances in execution? I may never get an answer."
149,No.. the story..just no.. and .. i dont like the male actor.. nope.. felt annoyed
150,"The problem with any film is that you cant get a refund if you didn't like it. I can understand that it stops people trying to get their money back, but surely the film itself has to have certain standards. This would be the story, does it stand up to scrutiny, does it have artistic merit, if it says comedy on the poster, does it make you smile. Next would be the acting. Do they come across as believable. Then you have the production, including direction and editing. Does it show a level of talent you would expect from a film with this much hype.
Unfortunately Last Christmas fails on all counts. The story is bland, with a bit of politics thrown in, as if Ben Elton wasn't doing this thirty years ago. The acting is more wooden than toy soldiers, and it all just feels as if someone worked out that this sort of film would make around 80 million, so lets spend a million buying the theme tune, and then 20 million on the film, possibly 5 million on advertising. You are left with something that doubles the investors money, but left the viewers feeling short changed."
151,This movie was pure garbage. My friend and I went into it thinking it would be some dumb romantic comedy we could make fun of. It was just plain terrible. I don't understand how people actually think that this sad excuse for a movie is entertaining.
152,"So, looking forward to this movie, maybe expectations were too high, something was missing, not a movie I would watch again even at Christmas! Best description OK!"
153,"I've watched it after long day at work, and it was unexpected, refreshing, very good scenario, took me through many kinds of emotions."
154,"I think they tried a little too hard and added too many subplots and tried to get a few too many messages in. It was all over the place, and frankly pretty half.Emilia Clark usually comes off as a very likeable person, and this movie was no exception."
155,"Where to start... extremely boring I had difficult to keep my eyes open at times, The George Michel songs where unrelated to what was going on, the script is so weak, the characters are so uninteresting and weird but not in good way. Zero chemistry between all actors, casting was so bad. A couple next to me left in the middle of the film, I couldn't blame them. I've seen same silly film, some very light entertainment so light that weren't almost there, and this one doesn't even cut into that category. I don't recall when was last time that I came out of the cinema like this time saying ""oh no, bad so bad!"". Watch it on television don't spend money on it."
156,"Watched this movie tonight in a local cinema. Never seen such a bad and utterly boring movie, there was only one funny moment of 10 seconds but the rest was a TOTAL DISASTER! I wouldn't recommend going to this movie and waste your money."
157,"So apparently Yugoslavia lasted up to 1999. Haha! I mean it's just amazing how people spend so much money on produciton, but somehow can't google Yugoslavia or hire a good slavic linguist or even maybe slavic actors. I laughed at all scenes that were in ''croatian''.
Besides poor knowledge of slavic culture, language, history and stereotypes, it was an ok movie to watch if you need to rest your brain and not think much."
158,"(Parents and black and Chinese people beware.) Bearing in mind that 12A means six-year-olds, nine-year-olds and generally kids under 12 can attend if accompanied by an adult, the coarse language and crude ""#x22; jokes were WAY too plentiful and to the fore. The plot itself was banal, the acting bland, and some of the scripting was stereotypical to the point of being racist. Others have pointed to anachronisms and other poor historical and linguistic details, so all in all, this doesn't deserve a rating but a ranking: it is RANK!"
159,"Was hoping this film would be great. It wasn't.London looked nice, but what a dull story."
160,"This movie is AWFUL, The storyline that exists doesnt even end, in fact pretty much none of the loose ends are tied up at end of film. This was clearly written by someone who is not a writer (and she isnt very good at an eastern european accent either)..
Go and watch Jungle book instead"
161,"As I had read some very mediocre reviews prior I confess I only went for the locations shots of my ""soul home"" London"" where I lived for 5 years, plus I am a Christmas tragic and am a fan of both George Michael and Emma Thompson.
How the latter ever became attached to this project beggars belief.
I naively believed all the former would be enough to satisfy however not only did I fall asleep from sheer boredom but I literally had to get up and leave half way through it was so bad. This story lines, not funny, farcical plots, uninspiring dialogue and Emma Thompson absurd in that role frankly."
162,"Nothing to see her, keep walking.
This are movies that are made based on statistics.
You put all the ingredients in the pot, stir and ""voilà!"" Your cheesy Christmas movie.
No one will remember or talk about this movie in a few month."
163,"From the trailers I thought this is a movie about pure depression and selfhurt trauma, and that's why I loved the character before it is released in theaters. Now that I watched it and now the actual plot, I love Katarina even more. Wow, what a movie. I hope it gives the same joy to others as I have felt while watching it. Thank you for this brilliant movie"
164,I've seen lots of hallmark Christmas films and the usual cheesy story lines but this Christmas film was different. Not only did it have a fantastic soundtrack but it allowed me to just forget everyday life for a couple of hours and get into the Christmas spirit (even if is it November)You'll read negatives but that's only someone else's opinion. They don't know what you like. Get out and see it and just enjoy it. If you hate it then at least you found out for yourself but I think you might like it if you like Christmas.I hate coffee. I didn't read a review to find that out. I tried some (different types) and found it out for myself.
165,Such a disappointing star-studded movie. Emma's character gets on my nerves. Not funny. Stupid
166,"Christmas is, always has been, and always will be, my favourite time of year. Not just the gifts, spending time with family and festive traditions, but also seeing over and over many Christmas films, specials etc. Have never had any bias against romantic comedies and the cast was not a bad one. Emilia Clarke was great in 'Game of Thrones' and have also loved a lot of Emma Thompson's performances (she also has a great talent for screen-writing).So there was never any bias against 'Last Christmas'. Far from it. Actually thought it looked like a pleasant diversion and wanted it to work, and am being completely honest here. Seeing it, a large part of me was underwhelmed. By all means 'Last Christmas' is not a complete bah humbug and there are things that make it semi-watchable. There is however sadly nowhere near enough to it to make it a Christmas cracker and, despite good intentions, has too much wrong with it and ones not much different to flaws that a good deal of Christmas films made today have.'Last Christmas' does have good things. It looks lovely, those locations and how they utilise the festive season are just magical complemented beautifully by the photography. The soundtrack adds a lot to the atmosphere with a healthy dose of George Michael, it's great music on its own and actually didn't have as major a problem with the placement as others did.There are moments of charm and amusing moments, while Clarke is an earnest but not overly so lead and not out of sorts in the comedy department. Michelle Yeoh also shows bundles of charm.Was not impressed with the rest of the acting. Did find Henry Goulding quite bland and slightly too creepy, while Thompson is disappointingly a bit too on the melodramatic side. The chemistry seemed to lack warmth and that's what the story, on top of being paper thin and too conventional, generally seemed to lack too. The whole thing feels competent but too bland, complete with a bizarre and not particularly necessary twist. Paul Feig's direction is a long way from amateurish but it seemed to lack spark and seemed too safe.Found the script to be disappointing and quite weak, which surprised me seeing as Thompson co-wrote it and it was difficult to believe that it was from the person who wrote the sparkling script for the wonderful 'Sense and Sensibility'. The comedy was not enough and lacked freshness and wit, found it very try too hard. The romance needed more warmth and veered on a bit on the creepy side, while the drama was a bit too maudlin from sentiment being laid on too thick. Also felt that they were not always well balanced. While its good intentions were admirable, the film tackles politics and homelessness for examples and they felt shoe-horned and needed more subtlety.Summing up, appreciated its good intentions but wanted to like it much more. 4/10"
167,"OK, now 10 days too late for the actual review of a film which had been screened TWICE in my city ! For those smart enough to see the 20 minute gay-friendly short ""Cognitio"" and liked it, you will like this 102 minute film even more.
Emma Thompson had the approval of George Michael to proceed with a film regarding the lyrics to the self-titled song, and after nearly 10 years it has come to fruition. Initially paced at a common formula romance story emblazes once a major twist develops. ""Game of Thrones"" Emilia Clark shines as a lazy worker with a history of medical problems which unfold later in the story. The attractive Henry Golding appears as yet another love interest in protagonist Kate's life, but develops into something more than ever expected. Life is not always as clear or simple as it seems. Writer & mom of said protagonist sparkles as an immigrant with truth and fear personality traits which many in today's narcissistic & too conservative society need to be more aware & empathetic towards, including but not limited to the homeless , whose characters play a pivotal role in the story line. Alternative lifestyles are accepted as they should be in this story as well. The Christmas Spirit is alive and well, not to mention, (in a Dickens-kind-of-way, Ghosts of Christmas past.) Michelle Yeoh's courting relationship exemplifies a character of truth and honor, something most lacking in today's environment, & I couldn't help wanting to see more of it, yet, Ms. Thompson stays true to the plot, and gives proper focus to Kate & Tom's affinity about each other, as a well written story line should be. A feel good story which emanates from every fiber of Kate's being, alternative lifestyles, paying respects to older generations and current generations who are down on their luck, which will illuminate the need for one to pay it forward this Holiday season and in the future, as today's society about honor , dignity, and truth are sorely lacking. Hopefully, this will become a Holiday classic in the style which Dickens originally intended, brilliantly portrayed by Emma Thompson & her husbands written story of a very prominent ""Last Christmas"" for one, if not for all. God Bless Us Everyone (who shows empathy towards one another, not just certain someone's narcisstic Scrooge self-centeredness.) Lessons to be learned for sure."
168,"I have three key points from this film.Brexit is racist...Filmmakers must be seen to be social justice warriors or they do not think they are doing their jobs.Emilia Clarke manages to shine in spite of this being an awful, awful film.
Brexit is racist.
Brexit is racist... yawn. Do please give it a rest creative industries. You are very boring. I do wish you could go to the movies now and not be inundated with political points that leave you feeling annoyed. Why go out of your way to annoy half a nation, plus most the rest of the nation that wants a bit of escapism from their movies, not more nonsense.There were a few funny lines against a very obvious plot that moves remarkably slowly for what I think is fairly short movie.Emilia Clarke however, is actually very good in this. She plays her character remarkably well, in a way that makes you both like and dislike the character as befits the situation of the film. Her co star is a bit of a wet blanket. Not familiar with him and I certainly won't be looking for any of his other works any time soon.In short, I will never watch this film again and begrudge the fact that on one of our very rare nights out, having hired a babysitter, I ended up watching this point scoring predicable dross that seemed more preachy than entertaining."
169,"I liked this movie and I didn't expect to. I had very low expectations and happily they were more than exceeded. This is a very sweet movie that moves in very unexpected ways. I love that Emma Thompson is a somewhat unappealing character and she played it well. Not an easy thing for someone who has achieved so much in movie land. All in all, a better movie than was reviewed in the papers."
170,It brought me to tears more than a couple of times & the climax caught me completely off guard. What a lovely movie! Very well done.
171,"I can't wait to see this movie again and again. The entire cast was on point, George Michael's melodies were perfectly intertwined to the story, incredibly clever dialog and character development, and such a serendipitous performance by all. I laughed so hard and cried so hard."
172,Loved every second of it! Will watch it thousand times more!
173,"No spoilers here but this movie has a huge twist in it. At first I hated the twist but then I came to love it. Let's just say that near the end of the movie everything changes completely. However, it remains a beauty of a movie and to me the three big reasons to see ""Last Christmas"" are: 1. The George Michael songs. 2. The fabulous London Christmas scenery. 3. The excellent cast of great actors who are all fabulous even if they're just reading the phone book. There's a lot of love and loveliness in this movie so I think I will probably watch it many times in years to come."
174,"It's not a perfect movie. But the ""huge disappointment"" label is extreme. if you come to the movie theatre wanting a good holiday experience, then I think you will like it...I did. George Michael was more popular with the Brits, than in the U.S., but I always liked his voice and many of the songs. The songs do not always mirror the story exactly, but pop music is ""the soundtrack of our lives"", so if you think of the songs as what the characters were hearing in their lives, it works. I liked the characters and thought that the actors were good in their parts. the actress that plays Kate is adorable. I think she is sort of like a Bridget Jones character and anyone who liked those movies, should like this. Am I going to go out and hire Emma Thompson to play a Yugoslavian mother, not really. But I did not have a problem with her acting here. (better than Meryl Streep in Mary Poppins Returns!) My favorite thing that Emma Thompson does is appear on talk shows...she is sooo funny, so if I have my choice then SOMEBODY please write her a funny, OVER THE TOP part! (And while I liked Late Night, that was not very funny.)But the reason that I am writing this review is because my personal Christmas is not looking to be great this year And so I am very thankful to Emma Thompson and company for writing and producing this movie, because I could surely use some cheering up this holiday season!!! I will be going back to see it again. So my comment is when you go to see it, don't be a HUMBUG , just enjoy the season."
175,"Spoiler alertMaybe Ms. Clarke will find her way to bigger films.But seriously I was expecting Bruce Willis to show up,
Not as clever as Bruce's film and not nearly as many dead people"
176,Super cute movie but definitely have tissues near if you cry easy and plan to watch! I'm not sure why it's getting bad reviews because it was sweet and cute though a little sad too BUT with a good ending. Would definitely recommend!
177,"The worst movie I've seen for a very long time. Appalling script, wooden acting, zero chemistry, the most horrible irritating main character, obvious plot twist. We were obviously meant to get emotional for Kate but she was so unlikable I really couldn't care less; and I usually cry VERY easily! This film is clearly trying to be edgy, cool, funny and heart-warming but it failed on every level. Please do not waste your time or money."
178,There were times when the pacing was too slow but overall there was a great combination of moments that made me and my friends laugh and cry. Emilia and Henry have great chemistry and the other actors were a delight too. I would suggest just experiencing the movie with no expectations and just going along for the ride and you'll definitely enjoy the overall Story development and how it ends.
179,"This a very funny and heartwarming film, if you like any of Paul Feig's previous work, you will love this film!!"
180,"Sure it's not a masterpiece and it's not the best christmas movie ever but It's a christmas movie that I simply enjoyed watching. Great cast, great acting, good music. A movie doesn't always have to be groundbreaking to be fun to watch. The holiday spirit is definitely strong here."
181,"Completely lost control of my emotions towards the end of the movie...Emma Thompson is genius. It is humane, touching, compassionate, and absolutely heart-warming. The tiresome cynicism in the world of film critique is just the opposite of what this movie is about. Go ahead, watch it, and let tears roll down your cheeks."
182,"I went with my friend and we both loved this film. It's entertaining and funny with likeable characters. It easily passed the six laugh tests, but it also made me cry. What more do you want? It may not stimulate your brain but frankly I go to the cinema to escape. Easily the best film I've seen this year."
183,"**Contains Spoilers**Disregard what the critics in the mainstream media say. It just goes to show you have to watch a movie yourself and make your own mind up about it rather than go on what so called critics say. I personally found this movie a very enjoyable charming little movie.The movie has a surprise at the end which I am not going to fully reveal. Suffice to say that this movie is similar to the 1990 American movie Ghost. That of a love story between a woman and man who died and became a ghost.I thought the two lead actors Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding did a fine job in the movie two talented actors. This is a charming love story of tragedy and hope of some Londoners set in London.Emilia Clark as Kate is a young Londoner who works at a Christmas souvenir shop in the run up to Christmas, with ambitions to become an artist and follow in the footsteps of her hero. The 1980s British pop icon George Micheal. Henry Golding Tom Webster a fellow Londoner works at the local homeless charity. Tom Webster interest in her and eventually knowing that Kate despite her outward happy bubbly outlook is hiding the deep unhappiness inside the unhappiness of her home life and the fact that she did do as well as her sister in life who became a lawyer as her parents wished, Because kate had different ambitions to become an artist and was already auditioning for acting and singing roles and had applied for one of the art schools in London. Not going to say what happened in the movie except Tom Webster comes along when she was at her lowest ebb showing the elusive nature of finding happiness. That just being a human being in this world is hard and Tom fully understands fully what Kate is going through. Tom also tells Kate the reason why he works in the Homeless Charity is because that is where happiness and fulfilment can be found. When as Kate says at the end. ""Happiness can only be found when you help others."" What a wonderful message from a movie to send out. Kate joins the Homeless Charity and helps out and she found her unhappiness slowly dissipated gaining fulfilment from helping others less fortunate than herself a gift Tom showed her. Kate and Tom fall in love.
Later she goes and visits Tom at his apartment or flat as they say in London. To discover an estate agent their. To her shock she discovers from the estate agent that Tom Webster was the previous owner and was killed while cycling in London.Tom is revealed to be the one who's heart was donated when he was killed while cycling in central London. Then ending had similar tones to the ending of 1990 American movie Ghost. This is a charming move and I for one enjoyed and took away an important message away from the movie. Finally, it's great that talented George Micheal is remembered nearly 3 years after his passing. I believe George Micheal will get the recognition finally that he didn't really get when he was alive for being truly great artist. Like Emilia Clarke says in the movie George Micheal an extremely talented artist, who was under appreciated in his time. The movie ends with a carving of Tom Webster on the wooden bench after Tom visits Kate for the last time."
184,The whole cast was wonderful. Made me laugh and cry. Definitely got me in the Xmas mood and now I need to go to London to see that beautiful town. George Michael music throughout the movie was the best1
185,"I liked it all the way up to the point where they ripped out my heart. Pun intended. I had just completed my midterms, and needed a good, uplifting movie; this is not that movie. I just wanted a schlocky Christmas romance. Shame on the marketing dept for advertising it like one."
186,"I'm gonna be straight with this one because no one put too much thought on this movie anyway: this thing is emptily forgettable, disgustingly political (and contradictorily so) because nowadays any movie director that doesn't have the wit or the guts to make a fine peace of work have to shove politics to fill the blanks, annoying inconsistent characters (like Emilia Clarke's, is she promiscuous? does she want to commit? it depends on the scene I guess), unearned manipulative pathos in the worst Spielberg style imaginable, an endless number of plot holes, absolutely not funny at all (and boy it tries), weird scenes that don't make sense, a boring and pathetic romance which it's just another of those made-up Hollywood fantasies we've seen thousands of times, a final twist that will make you want to throw up and, what is maybe the worst of all, a movie trying to be ""deep"" and ""emotional"" when it's just nothing, a bland pile of nothing.
Positives? Not very much. I got to admit, the addition of Emilia Clarke to this movie really helps it, without her the movie would be even worse. She acts well, she has charisma, and she has the moderate charm this movie needs. The direction is not something to gawk at but it has a few surprises.All in all, there's 0 reasons to watch this. I never thought I would say this, but watch Love Actually instead. 4/10"
187,"I didn't have much expectations, thinking ""oh, it must be just another typical Christmas movie, nice, but nothing special"". But it was so much worse.
Main character is just totally unlikeable, rude and not particularly bright for no good reason. The plot is insanely predictable and all secondary story lines never lead to anything. Playing around with historical and/or political events is not a good subplot for a silly Christmas movie if you are not careful and don't give it enough attention.
Christmas miracle is not self explanatory in the way this movie is trying to show us, and nice songs are not an excuse for anything.
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, just stick to the classic if you want something sweet and holiday-like to keep up the mood🤷"
188,"So many things are wrong with this movie....
But most of all - I think it suffered from the absolute unlikeability of the two main characters....
That, the terrible acting, the boring story, the numerous clichés, the completely unbelievable ""diversity"", and of course, the really bad plot....
Don't bother !"
189,"Was really cheesy and very predictable. Nowhere near the level of a good Rom com like Notting hill, Love actually and Bridgette Jones. Yes, it s watchable but very forgettable too . Sorry, but it has some positive moment, like, George Michael/Wham songs. Although, not enough of them either .
Merry Xmas peeps ."
190,"Really wonderful watching Emilia in such a role, she is doing a lovely character, very pleased with her presentation. She is wonderfully enhancing all the scenes. Emma also lovely and brilliantly moving in her role. Do not know much about the British societies but this movie covers a few topics that I understand could preoccupy the people. Eventually, those are topics that regard all of the societies and this is beautiful in this movie. Lots of nice scenes, the photography is very interesting. Night and colourful lights and cold weather in the city where a young woman works and finds herself not comfortable. She is trying to reach what her childhood memories indicating but life shows another path for her. The story unfolds slowly and extremely beautifully through every scene. A meaning comes up continuously and the spectator is caught up. There is not a chance to feel bored. It comes a sweetness for life with this film. A precious feeling of contacting with people that life brought around. It is not about gifts and shinny holiday. Soul and heart release a fantastic human energy in the process. The actors the production the screenplay the costumes the whole company of people creating this film have done a gorgeous job. Not a wasted line, words come naturally and dialogs bind with the places and characters to give not entertainment but feelings. The intensity of the feelings generated is so cleansing that the mind cannot avoid asking for a re-watch after a few days. Families couples singles friends can find a piece of gold for themselves in this story. Love it when such movies define cinematography. Enjoy !"
191,"I was a teenager in the 80s and the music gave me the feels. I love George Michael and Wham. I saw you, Andrew Ridgeley! It felt like a love letter to George. I enjoyed the movie, very sweet."
192,"My wife knows that if she falls under a bus, Emma Thompson will be next in line of succession if I have anything to say about it. And she is cool with that. Emma Thompson is my hero, my favorite person that I have never met.So, when my wife said there's this new movie that Emma produced, directed, and performed in, I thought we should watch that.I am really glad Emma did so well with it.Even though I am a steely-eyed missile man, it seems I get all misty when I watch a really good romantic comedy (just about all the Meg Ryan ones, also especially Nothing Hill, and Love Actually for sure).But anyway... this is not that exactly.If you like those, you will like this.But this is not that.It's something Emma made for us."
193,"On the surface and before I even saw Last Christmas, it appeared to me to be one of those easy-going romantic comedies that come out of the assembly line, especially during the holiday season. It isn't exactly that and that's actually one of the best things that I can actually say about this movie. It feels like they were trying to go for something different, they absolutely failed in that endeavor, pretty much catastrophically I'd say. However, I will start with the positives. Like I said, the movie does try to go for something a little different, even though it becomes pretty predictable after a certain point, which also happens to be fairly early in the film. Emilia Clarke does a decent job, I think she's very charismatic as an actress and does what she can with this script. The cinematography is fine, it's not an ugly movie to look at. And that's pretty much all the good things that I can say about Last Christmas.Like I said, after a certain point, you can pretty much guess exactly where the film is going with every single plot point and character. This would be a good time to talk about the characters, which are all bland, generic and provide zero originality and there isn't a single thing that is remarkable about them as people, other than nationalities, sexual preferences and race. I actually think this is something Paul Feig, who directed the movie, doesn't understand, Now, I get that he didn't write the script for the film, but this is also something that happened in his all female Ghostbusters remake, so I'm going to comment on this issue. The issue being that simply because you insert a character who is either female, black, gay, lesbian, russian, asian, etc. does not mean you have a special character who is even remotely interesting. I couldn't tell you a single thing about any of the characters in this movie (except perhaps Emilia Clarke and the main guy, who I'll talk about in a bit). A fair amount of time is dedicated to other people other than the main characters and there is nothing to them, they are just generic people in a bland movie.Anyway, I thought the guy who plays Tom, I believe he's called (I called him the main guy before), was completely uncharismatic and acted poorly in the film. The rest of the performances are fine, I guess, even if the characters are extremely superficial. But perhaps the gratest fault of Last Christmas is the comedy. This is by all means supposed to be a comedy, and it attempts to be funny, but the film falls completely flat almost every single time it tries to be comedic. I sort of (but not really) chuckled once during the entire film.I said the movie is predictable, and it is. There's a certain plot ""twist"", which is also entirely predictable, by the way, and it's just dumb. I thought it was one of the dumbest plot twists I'd ever seen in a film, it makes zero sense and it tries to push the message of the movie, which has to do with having a good heart and recovering after (literally) having your heart broken.I'm done talking about this movie. Last Christmas is not subtle, predictable, not funny and tasteless."
194,"If, like me, you love a good rom com and you don't mind the fact that this is a highly predictable cheesefest then you're in for a real Christmas treat."
195,"I'm always a sucker for a good romcom from time to time and I was actually genuinely interested in this based off of the cast, director and writer. The movie comes from Paul Feig mostly known for his comedies and yes ""that"" Ghostbusters, but in the past he has proven himself a very solid director. And Emma Thompson penning the script had me intrigued and overall I enjoyed my time with this film.For one I think this is a solid movie to watch around the Christmas time, drenched in the Christmas landscape it at times can feel like a bigger budgeted hallmark movie, but the cast is way better. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are terrific in this film and showcase some genuine chemistry on screen.The film also has a lot of heart and is at times very magical. The script that Thompson has written goes into some interesting directions with some twists that at the end of the day may seem heavy handed but I found them sweet and pulled off well in the context of the film.Perhaps the films biggest flaw is it's familiarity and Hallmark channel vibe, but it's actors and the spirit of the film managed to get to me and made this ultimately a win. It's a fun film, not the best this genre has to offer, but for a film taking place around Christmas it's something that's at least worth one watch."
196,"I didn't watch this at the cinema when it came out as I'd heard some negative reviews but this turns out to be a wonderful, heartwarming, uplifting story and I hope it becomes the Christmas classic it deserves to be."
197,"What a great little movie with a very touching message. Love the charisma between all the characters, especially between Kate and Tom. Make this a must watch every holiday."
198,"Beautiful Christmas film. The right amount of cheesiness, charm and romance.
With some amazing scenes of the best the best city in the world!
Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as well."
199,"Well not being one for these sort of movies, I really wasn't engaging for the first 10 minutes, but then as the story unfolded, the characters are nicely revealed, subtle humor throughout.
All acted very well..
Not what I expected at all, pleasantly surprised, not a classic Christmas movie, but a watchable one none the less."
200,"It does justice to the Britcom tradition of Notting Hill and Love Actually while pursuing its own very distinctive path.
The focus is on the two leads, but there are strong performances from a number of other cast members, with Emma Thompson and Michelle Yeoh outstanding in very unusual roles.
Some of the situations are a bit cliché, but I find helping the homeless and condemning an all-embracing 'go back where ya came from' hostility towards immigrants to be perfectly compatible with the spirit of Christmas.
Offsetting that, Emilia Clarke brings a very sharp and sometimes caustic wit to her lines, without ever losing touch with her thoroughly decent and rather sweet and vulnerable core.
The film shows how important it is to be able to laugh, at ourselves and at life, and to really appreciate what we have, because for all the failings of modern society we are nevertheless extremely privileged compared to those that have come before us. And here is a Christmas film to remind us of that.
Oh, and of course the film is also a running tribute to George Michael's legacy, which is a nice bonus."
201,"What a great film. I was bored, it was new to Sky movies, I though I would give it a go. I was really pleasantly surprised. This movie was a breath of fresh air. And, without spoiling anything, I didn't expect the twist, didn't see it coming! I literally gasped out loud when the penny dropped! Lovely movie, great acting and who doesn't live a bit of George Michael?! Did everyone notice Andrew Ridgeley in the audience at the end?"
202,"So romantic, funny and sad. I dont understand all the bad reviews... I suppose you should have tried the main characters issues before you get the point of the movie ...."
203,This movie is one of the best holiday movies of 2019 and who doesn't love George Michael's music! Henry Golding did a phenomenal job in this film. Must see for sure.
204,"I love this movie, it explores themes of loss and connection in a heart touching funny & surprising way. A well acted and entertaining must watch new Christmas movie!!!"
205,"It feels real, unlike alot of Christmas movies, I initially thought it was a romcom but it's so much better.... because Christmas films don't feel real... they are over sugared or over dramatic... I never liked it, this movie could change my viewpoint on that"
206,Bought this for my wife thought it would be terrible .... it's not it's great!!!!
207,"Ignore the Scrooge's who gave this movie a bad review. It's in a league of its own. If you have even half a heart (see what I did there?) you will enjoy this flick. It's the sweetest film I've seen in a while, but bring tissues. It's sad, but with a higher ratio of happy, so it will go in our Christmas movie rotation. Give it a chance. You'll likely love it with your whole heart ;)"
208,"This movie was such a pleasant surprise for me. To be honest, I thought it was going to be the usual lame Christmas-themed piece, but boy was I wrong! (I've chosen it because of Emilia Clarke who I adore.) The story is adorable, funny but sometimes also very moving, and the characters are extremely likeable. I also enjoyed Emma Thompson's ""foreign"" character: I am also from Eastern Europe -living in the States-so I completely understood her point of view and behavior.
Such a beautiful film, highly recommended!"
209,"Katarina ""Kate"" (Emilia Clarke) survived a life saving surgery and is now a mess. She is temporarily homeless and couch surfing her remaining friends. She's bad at her job at Santa (Michelle Yeoh)'s Christmas store. She's avoiding her mother Petra (Emma Thompson). She keeps running into nice guy Tom Webster (Henry Golding).Obviously, somebody was inspired by Mamma Mia to do another musical with a different artist. This time, it's George Michael. Emilia Clarke is being her super adorable self and this is mostly a cute single sitcom gal trying to fix her messy life. I actually like her chemistry with Michelle Yeoh the most. Emma Thompson going ethnic is a little bit off. Henry Golding is a nice guy but he doesn't have much heat with Emilia. I do like his niceness rubbing off on her. As for the reveal, I was working out two competing twists at the time and it ends up being a combination of both. I actually don't like reinterpreting the song but that's a minor sour note. In that one, the problem is that the rest of the song gets sung. All in all, Emilia's natural cuteness and the story's harmless niceness make this a cute, appealing Christmas film."
210,"A great film that will makes you feel happy and sad at the same time, Emilia Clarke was beautifully amazing, the story is super sweet and the twist is surprisingly sweet, one of the best romantic films in years."
211,"I normally just leave a rating, instead of writing something. Here's what I would suggest: watch it. Let it sink into the little spots in your heart that need some TLC."
212,"Yes. This one is amazing! The character Tom Webster is so profound! You will not be bored anywhere the initial half is a bit slow and uninfluenced but it catches flow soon . The Story is awesome , but it can be presented more efficiently."
213,I'm a big burly straight guy but this melted my cold heart and I love Ms Clarke and all the George Micheal tunes. Emma Thompson and her husband Greg Wise really surprised me with this one. Bravo on the perfect script!
214,A surprise to a beautiful story with a very beautiful ending
215,"Okay so who doesn't love Clarke? She's great in any role so that's the only reason I decided to watch it - yes in August, I'm one of those people who are on countdown already.
Acting great, heart warming, lovely twist - made me and husband fill up, enjoyed the comedy so much, just flipping great.
Can't wait till it's closer to Christmas so I can watch with my mum & step dad, they'll love it 😃"
216,"I knew I'd like this one but I didn't think I'd fall in love with this one. It's beautifully done so full of love, hope and laughs. This IS a Christmas movie and it has all the things us Christmas movie lovers want in a movie. + an amazing soundtrack. The perfect package ... no the perfect gift. Open your heart, get some cocoa (or fermented cabbage if that's your thing) and watch this movie. You'll laugh, you'll sigh, you'll sing and well I hope this isn't a spoiler but you'll cry."
217,"I am usually good at figuring out our movie well and/or what the surprise will be, but this one actually fooled me. I knew there was a twist but I was wrong about what it was. It was a cute movie and I would watch it again. I really loved the George Michael music."
218,"I expected this movie to be corny and hokey. But, was pleasantly surprised and watched the whole thing! It's funny, sad, and will have saying ""Wow, I didn't see that coming!"" Why isn't the rating higher? Perfect casting and the she can sing!"
219,Probably the best Christmas film since love actually. Was really well done with a great cast and the story was unexpected with a good twist. Really emotional and heart warming and a perfect Christmas story.
220,Usual story or concept we've already seen on the screen but still the movie is likable.
221,"I liked the story, it was cute and funny. Movie is entertaining and gives a feel good vibes. Now it lacks in historical accuracy, war in Croatia ended in 1995. so there would be no reason for the family to leave in1999., it makes no sense. I have to say i love Emma Thompson and Emilia Clarke but to hear them butcher the Croatian language was painful, also that is not what a Church looks like in Croatia, not in present day and not 20 years ago. This is the reason why this movie is a 5 for me, if the actors spoke better Croatian and the historical and cultural segments were accurate this movie would have been an solid 8. I expected a lot more especially from Emma."
222,"A nice Christmas movie, a simple movie gets great as it progresses, the soundtrack of the movie is George Michael and wonderful.funny, entertaining, surprising, and sad towards the end, it can actually cry, I like it unlike critics I enjoyed it I recommend it to everyone."
223,"When I saw the trailer, I actually wanted to see the movie but I was surprised to see it only had a 6.5 rating so I was a bit hesitant. But I'm I watched the movie because absolutely loved it, great story and Emilia Clarke is just perfect for the role. Definitely worth your time"
224,"I really liked it, and I am just writing a review because the ratings are not where they should be. Go watch it :)"
225,That's my favorite christmas movie. I don't understand why ratings are not so good. It's beautiful and not like all the christmas films i've seen. It makes me wanna cry and feel good. There is a moral at the end so watch it!
226,Lovely and Unpredictable movie. Really really liked it and but fells really bad that it don't have its desiring rating. Because no A rated film stars in the movie. All should watch this movie and give some good rating. Worth watching.
227,Honestly whY so low rating?? Its one of the simple and yet best movie. All the emotions are soo real. Its looks you are actually living into that movie. All the actors were perfect for their parts. I definitely recommend if you need something simple yet amazing.
228,"I only watch these kind of movies because of my wife, I find most of them cheesy and full of clichés but this one was pretty okay, there are real emotions in it and, at least for the protagonist, real character development. Emilia Clarke was a superb choice for the lead role, she was cute and believeable. Even without the plot twist, which was clever by the way, I would have enjoyed the movie."
229,"Wanted to take my my wife to the movies last December and this looked interesting but reviews were so bad I hesitated. On reflection all the bad reviewed movies I've always loved so off we went. I was expecting a Love Actually type movie which it wasn't but enjoyed it all. The music is great and I've played the end music to death this past 4 months. Will be watching it again and again.
The ending was like a huge punch to my chest and left me in tears."
230,"I love romantic comedies, but this one hasn't caught my heart. The two leads don't have much chemistry, mostly because their encounter is very contrived. Kate is very unlikable, which doesn't help at all. The most likable character is actually the sauerkraut expert, a very minor character."
231,"Some parts of this movie are pretty awful and some parts are quite good. The good thing is because of the surprising twist ending it doesn't feel like a typical Hallmark style Christmas romance. It was actually quite moving. Emma Thompson acts quite well as the Yugoslavian immigrant.Some of the dialogue is too fast and many of the jokes fall flat. The way Michelle Yeoh's character acts is painful at times. Luckily Emilia Clarke is winsome enough to smooth over the rough edges. And she and Henry Golding have a good rapport.
There is an anti Brexit message. And a very diverse cast racially and by sexual orientation. The George Michael song sounds quite good too."
232,"Instead of making nice Christmas romantic movie with beautiful music of G.M they come up with some kind strange agitation: with unnaturally mixed multi cultural cast:
asian, east Europeans (with russian accent), black, german, handicap, homeless people, immigrants, gays and lesbians... and bow and there subtly sticking it up to brexitieres culminating With a very poorly made scene with a white guy (probably British and brexitiere) insulting, for unclear reason, some Croatian pair... Very unnaturally: propoganda style... And I'm unfortunately from russia so i know propoganda when i see one...
I could not call this movie a ""bad Christmas movie"" but a long propaganda clip.
Don't waist your time..."
233,"This movie was really really really bad. We went to the theater with girlfriends just to have some nice girl's evening, but it has changed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. This does not have anything common with Christmas romantic comedy. It was pretty huge cliche and when my friend just from fun said: ""Oh, I got it! He is dead and she has his heart"", we were laughing: ""Nooo, it cannot be so terrible"". Guess what? It is! And the dialogs in the movie? So looong...probably should awake some feeling in you, but without any chance and trust me, one of us is pregnant. And I am not speaking about other staff as Brexit and Juhoslavia...just please if you really would like to see it, wait to see it online, spend your money better."
234,"There are movies that are made to encourage deep thought and analysis, but this one is not that. If, like me, you can also appreciate movies that are simply sweet and entertaining and leave you feeling uplifted at the end, this is one to see. I went in to it without watching the trailer or reading reviews and was able to enjoy -- without preconceptions -- the delightfully Emilia Elf character as she overcomes her personal demons and achieves self-actualization on her own terms."
235,"They had some really big effort to include all the woke stuff of 2019 inside this movie. Which is a pity, because the actors/actresses are quite good. We were looking for a new romantic movie to watch but this was a bad choice, we couldn't even finish it. If you want to force diversity then why the main character is a white girl? Anyway... Let's hope this wokeness is not gonna stay forever. Quality is more important than being woke and hunt tokens."
236,"I loved this film. On a par with Love Actually for me. I'm not one to re watch films but this is a film I will watch every Christmas. It's happy, sad and funny. A must watch for Christmas."
237,"Last Christmas, by all accounts from the trailers and advertising, seems to be a romantic comedy. It however, is not. It is a powerful message of trauma, PTSD, hollowness, and grief. It is a movie that needs to be watched at least twice to understand the entirety of the film. It is a movie that will leave people who have never had trauma and loss in their life confused and angry at the ""lost potential"", and leave people who have had trauma in their life grappling with the possible triggers that encompass the entirety of the movie once we realize what is going on. It is a beatiful film that really grapples with what it means to be a survivor of a horrific accident, and what it means to be told ""Your lucky to be alive""."
238,Ignore the trolls who give this movie low marks..most I suspect haven't seen it or have hearts of ice. To those ranting on about accents...this is not a docudrama nor does it pretend to be! It is an incredibly sweet movie with a very sad twist. Acting is good and it is laugh out loud in places. I won't rehash the story but if you enjoy a rom com you will enjoy this. This a not a festive film as such but Christmas does provide the back drop. Enjoy the movie but be prepared for a few tears. If you watch the film carefully you may see the twist coming but you will enjoy the journey.
239,For me romantic comedies have to be good or they just become yet another cliche! This for me was very well acted and the musical score was well aligned with the plot. Do you self a favour go and see with a loved one or the kids you won't go wrong. Ignore the critics and definitely don't read the spoilers the twist was surprising particularly in this genre! Loved it
240,"I was dubious to whether it would be a very average or even cringe-worthy sub standard rom com.How wrong was I!This is not what anyone will expect. This is an instant perennial Christmas classic with many layers leaving you wondering if the two main characters are a metaphor for the conflicting characters that made up the musical maestro whose classic pop songs provide the soundtrack.I would place it just below a Wonderful Life and Love Actually but way above A Miracle on 34th Street and everything else way below.It's a seasonal rom com without the abundance of cheese. You know something is coming but there is nothing that prepares you for the tide of emotions that yanks you from the laughter and floods your cheeks with a river of tears.It is testament to George's talent and diversity that a soundtrack crammed with GM classics sounds like a soundtrack filled with many different artists.And, not a single one shoehorned in!It's difficult to determine whether hearing George singing the MTV Unplugged version of Praying for Time stirs you most or the crescendo of emotions that converge to bring this story to its heart wrenching conclusion but either way - take your tissues.This is not a cheesy pastische of a pop star's classics set to a cobbled together script propped up by current popular actors.This is true Christmas classic - just like Last Christmas was 35 years ago!"
241,"I saw ""Last Christmas"", starring Emilia Clarke-Game of Thrones_tv, Terminator Genisys; Henry Golding-A Simple Favor, Crazy Rich Asians; Michelle Yeoh-Crazy Rich Asians, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and Emma Thompson-the Men in Black movies, Love Actually.
This is a rom com that is written by Emma Thompson and directed by Paul Feig-A Simple Favor, Ghostbusters_2016, Bridesmaids. Emilia plays a young lady with problems. First, she had health problems and had to have a heart transplant. Next, she keeps making bad decisions in her life, such as alienating her family and friends and becoming pretty much homeless-nobody will let her stay with them for long. Even her mother, Emma, gives her lectures on her lifestyle choices. Michelle owns a Christmas store and gives Emilia a job as one of her Santa's elfs. Then, Henry walks into Emilia's life and tries to teach her how to straighten up her act and enjoy life again. Yep, this is a rom com alright but there is one little plot twist near the end-it involves a famous movie but I can't say much about it without giving too much away. There is a lot of George Michael-and Wham-songs throughout, with the title of the movie being one of them.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes.
It's not one that I'd buy on DVD but it would be a good rental."
242,One of the worst movie I ever seen in my life..
243,"90% of the movie:
This was the first movie I saw this year and it just made me so happy. It was so adorable and sweet and wholesome. I loved how he was helping her find a way to put herself back together. I loved the Christmas setting and the store and her elf costume. So wonderful. So magical. Freaking loving this.The last 10% of the movie:
As soon as the real estate guy said that the old owner of the apartment was dead, instant realization hit me like a train and I just started sobbing. I cry at everything including many movies, but usually I tear up in the theater and then go home and am just fine and ready to move on. When I went home after watching this movie I just wanted to curl into a ball and sob. I was just so not okay and screw this movie for doing that to me. Maybe I should have seen that coming but I remain furious with the movie and not with myself."
244,I watched it with my boyfriend and both of us teared. It's abit of rom-com and it contains a plot twist which you'd never have guessed. They deserve better ratings!
245,Strange disney and bollywood combo! Disapointing .... bad acting.... hollow story!
246,"What a wonderful film Last Christmas is, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are stunning actors, The film has loads of laughs, Beautiful Cinematography and also made me cry! Bonus was also getting to hear George Michael's music in glorious Dolby cinema Sound!"
247,Finally a feelgood Christmas movie again. It is really good and it gives you the happy feeling. Please go and see this movie now.
248,"One of the best movie that can make you cry. Appreciate the story and cry together.
Will recommend this movie for couples."
249,If you like British rom coms you won't be disappointed
250,"Went in the cinema knowing very little about this, but hearing some negativity towards it in the media. Loved it! It was heartwarming, funny, sad, Christmassy, and British! Don't read the media reviews, just go see it!"
251,"It's nice to see a movie that isn't the cliche love story, especially like in for Christmas. Ultimately, it's about self-love. I love how the title of this movie which is the song fits perfectly with the story, literally. That moment gave me the ""aw"" but in an inspiring and uplifting way. It was a nod to Tom. Overall, I love how expressive Emilia is in her acting. It would cheer just about anyone up. It is a light-hearted warm comedy great for the holiday mood!"
252,"Four of us watched the movie. Great film and acting. Some great messages throughout the film. Funny, sad, typical british comedy film. We all loved it. Emma Thompson stole the show for me hilarious!! Great soundtrack too. Don't hesitate its a great Christmas movie. 9/10"
253,Hated the Kate character at first but getting to know her back story she grew on me and I loved the film doesn't deserve as much hate as it's getting
254,"I don't get the negative reviews ... this was an excellent Xmas movie and the 2 leads had Great chemistry . It has humor , it has tears , it has an unexpected twist at the end and is definitely worth seeing ."
255,"Ignore the stuffy critics reviews. This is a rom-com with heart that will get you teary as well. Great soundtrack, excellent cast, gorgeous London scenery and a beautiful Christmas theme. A winner in my books!"
256,"What a little gem of a movie! I did expect an average cute Xmas movie and there I get something that goes further than that! It is located in London and has this charming European Xmas touch. This is a wonderful movie to watch any time, Xmas or no Xmas. Acting is great, it was such a great time for laughter, smiles, joy, tears and reflection. We really enjoyed it much more than expected!"
257,I saw this movie about two weeks ago it just sucked
258,"2019 is the year that film industry crashed so hard that they don't know what to do next. On one hand, we have the masterpiece - Joker which speaks loudly if you make a good film without forced educations people will flood to watch it. One the other hand, we have so many big name franchises bent to the will of the progressive lots and bombed with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.Enough of my complaints, to this film.
A well directed drama with fantastic casts. I actually enjoy watching Emilia doing drama rather than Game of Thrones, especially the last season. This is where her acting really shines, you can feel her joy and pain and those in between. Emma Thompson puts out a very convincing performance for a migrant mother with control issues, and her foreign language skill is on display. Henry Golding did not out perform himself in this film than the Crazy Rich Asians due his role's supporting nature and film's narrative. I almost hoped for an interaction between him and Michelle Yeoh, which would be interesting. Surprisingly, Michelle did something out of her usual tough woman roles that got me completely.Soundtrack is great, and if you don't already know, Emilia Clarke is quite a capable singer.Points lost for the political correct scenes and the love drama routines. Ain't London a very diversified city? I feel those educational scenes rather forced and unnecessary.All in all, you will not be disappointed unless you generally don't like those stupid political messages in entertainments."
259,Last Christmas is a film that will satisfy you with Good humor and a good chemistry between the lead actors.
260,"Heartwarming and thought provoking... though the premise is predictable, the gentle touch that it uses to handle mental health issues, addiction and empathy are a rarity..."
261,"I saw this primarily because I'm a huge fan of Emilia Clarke and I personally loved it. I was reminded of It's A Wonderful Life a bit throughout given the subject matter around her illness and the role Tom plays in her life, but obviously it was much different than that movie as a whole. Emilia's character, Kate/Katarina goes through levels of growth from her selfish persona to someone giving by film's end and that progression was really wonderful to watch. Her chemistry with Goulding is strong and I personally loved the quirkiness of her family and her boss (who starred in Crazy Rich Asians as Goulding's mother so that was fun). As a whole I loved the movie and felt it was really touching."
262,"As far as romcoms go, this is about as good as I could've wished for. Emilia Clarke is adorable and the story is perfect for the holidays.The low rating bothered me, so I felt I'd leave it a high one. It's not the kind of movie I'd normally attend, but even the moment I'd kind of see coming managed to make my eyes wet.There is laughs and tears throughout, and a positive message. The critics need to be ignored on this one. We enjoyed it."
263,"As many have claimed, this is by far the best Christmas movie of the decade. Not only does it perfectly embody the issues of immigrants and Brexit, it also is a very feel-good Christmas movie that makes you think about your life choices and puts you in a better mind state. The outstanding performance of Emilia Clarke makes this film even more soulful. This film as well embraces important subjects of mental health, financial difficulties of being an adult, the complexity of human psychology and the importance of caring for other people. Despite the mixed reviews by the critics, Last Christmas is a huge box office success for an original holiday movie that is also a rom-com. There are many reasons why the cinemas were flooded with people during its' release month and after, with the biggest reasons being a story full of hope and great performances from Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding, Emma Thompson, Michelle Yeoh and Lydia Leonard."
264,"Perfect balance between comedy and romance, as well as making you feel extremely grateful for what you have in life. I really loved this film and it was beautifully done, ignore negative reviews!"
265,"Let me start by saying, that Emilia Clarke is perfect in this role. Though intolerable at first, she's never not charming and I was rooting for her character the whole way through. I was entertained for the duration of the movie, but a few changes would have taken this movie from good to amazing.
I like that there was a lot of different characters in the movie. The people at the homeless shelter, the policewomen, Santa and the cabbage-man (being a dane myself, it was a fun surprise seeing a fairly unknown danish actor). But there where too many unnecessary people in there (especially the couple on the bus) and sometimes things went from quirky to too weird (like Santa and the cabbage-mans interaction). And, as others have said, far too many political messages without true substance, but just kind of squished in there.
The family and the christmas concert was my favorite parts, and in the end I enjoyed the movie!"
266,"Enjoyed this a lot. Sure, there are moments where it feels a little too 'hit the marks' needed for the PC viewers.. Kind to the homeless, tick. Misunderstood refugees, tick. Cycling hero? Tick. Preachy. But hey, it is Christmas, 'tis the season to be jolly and all. It drew me in. It held my interest. It surprised me. It made me laugh. It made me tear up a little. The leads are great. The guy is a fair-dinkum modern-day version of an old fashioned hollywood star if you ask me. Smooth as. Well done to all."
267,"Forget the critics poor reviews, we really enjoyed this movie."
268,"Oh dear. Just when you think cinema and TV can't get any worse this comes out.
Abysmal from start to finish.
Emma Thompson over acting as always.
They were trying to imitate the likes of Four Weddings but failed miserably.
Avoid."
269,Boring MOVIE STUIPID CORNY PEOPLE IN. The movie were snoring!!!!!! The producer the actor actress need to be fired do not waste your money our time watching this corny movie
270,"So bad that for the hour following the few that we wasted watching this skid mark of a movie, the 4 of us sat around and belly laughed over the many other terrible reviews received by this movie."
271,"Definitely did not expect the plot twist but omg. The movie was great. I'm so happy that wasn't one of those cliches Christmas love movies or one of those where the person is bad and then has a bad dream and then they change blah blah, you know what kind I'm talking about. This one I loved and laughed from heart."
272,"Only 3 stars because this is very offensively for us who were part of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia ended in 1991, and they presented in the movie like the war still lasted in 1999. Please google information before you put wrong information in movies! Also they poorely pronounced Yugoslavian words, like they are Russians, but ok.The movie itself is not bad and cute, but because the lack of correct history, here is only 3/10."
273,"I absolutely love Christmas films, I love that warm fuzzy feeling you get when all of the twinkly lights are shown and the main character finds love and all of that crap.
This film is not that.
I love Emma Thompson and was hugely optimistic going in but I was shockingly let down.
The George Michael songs are wonderful but they chose really bizarre songs at odd moments in the film, ones that didn't suit the scene at all.
The plot is not good. Yes it's predictable but that's not my problem with it. The film makes a big deal about certain points and then entirely dismisses them until things are wrapped up neatly with a Christmas bow at the end.
There are some truly heartwarming parts but not nearly enough to rescue it. It's a shame really, I was hoping for another Love, Actually."
274,"I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie. I didn't think it was going to be fantastic, but I thought I was in for a nice little Christmas movie to put me in the holiday spirit.It did not.The acting and atmosphere was fine but the story was weak and there were so many stupid moments that I couldn't believe I paid to see this. The critics are actually right about this one. I previously thought they were being harsh but now I see the validity of their remarks. The ending was nonsensical and the editing/continuity was terrible. I don't think I'll ever watch another Paul Feig film again. His movies are never real enough, the characters are too unnatural for my taste. I'm truly shocked at the glowing user reviews here. This is not a 10 star movie."
275,"Are the bad reviewers watching a different film? This was heartbreaking, nuanced, a little cheesy but full on Christmas and a celebration of the things that bring us together as a society. Exactly what we need right now."
276,"Last christmas2019
12A
director: Paul Feige
starring: Emilia Clarke,Henry Goulding,Emma Thompson,Michelle Yeough,margaret clunie etcoverall rating 44/100Last christmas focuses on the character of Kate ( Emilia clarke) whos life is a mess with her having no place to stay and issues with her family. But when she bumps into Tom ( Henry Golding) at the christmas shop where she works her world is turned upside down a relationship is formed and she gets her life back on track but not everything is at it seems. I wanted to like Last christmas a lot more then what i did but i just couldn't get over the films flaws especially its terrible twist ending lets talk about this.Lets start off with the films great christmas aesthetic and its great soundtrack. The films visuals were charming and made you slightly christmasy which is what they were going for so this was executed well as you couldn't help but watch in or at all the lights and decoration,so i applaud Paul for making things that are so simple so beautiful. And second the films soundtrack was great. As it was called last christmas all the songs were by wham or George michael, And all the songs they chose were perfect and fitted with the overall tone of the film well.However two problems i had were how predictable it was and its pacing issues. I could predict most of the events from the movie, which made it get boring after a while. I could guess the jokes before they were executed and i could tell what was going to happen with Emilia's character. And the film was just slow and clunky for me. There was just a large majority of the film were either nothing exciting was happening or hardly anything was happening at all,which is a shame as this was one of the reasons why i didn't connect with the movie as much as i wanted to. Which proves my point that there just wasn't enough plot to justify its runtime.Next my favourite parts of the movie which largely held it all together was the fantastic performances from Henry Goulding and Emilia clarke. Henry Goulding did a very charming performance here and his character despite being slightly strange was very likeable. His romantic development between him and Emilia Clarke was fascinating and lovely to see. And for me definitly the best thing about this film was Emilia Clarke. She was fantastic here. She sold her serious moments. But also was hilarious,relatable and charming. And her development of being a better person and doing good was excellently executed.Next i thought the film had very random and not well thought out political statements and severe tonal issues. The film randomly decided to follow in some peoples negative attitudes to immigration and foreigners that felt rushed and didn't blend with the film at all. So this could of either been cut which would of been the better option as its a comedy or more fleshed out and developed. And the film had severe tonal issues. The film overelied on its humour so when it tried to be serious and emotional it didn't work as they added in a awkward joke to break the emotion. This made me lose connection with the film sadly.Next i thought the films humour mostly landed. I laughed a fair few times in this film especially from Emilia Clarkes charecter. So this kept the film good throughout the first half. However as the film went into its second half the humour for me went stale and got very repetitive. Michelle Yeoughs humour became flat. I could guess when people were going to make a joke or fall over and i just think the humour lost its creativity as the film went on which was a massive shame.Now my final big positive would be how heartwarming the tone was. Emilia and Henries relationship was very sweet as you could tell thats what kate needed in her life. And Kate rebuilding her life and reconnecting with her family whilst also doing some good at the homeless shelters gave us many scenes of joy which made your heart melt.But my biggest issue with the film which really hit the nail on the coffin for this film would be its terrible and cheesy plot twist at the end. This really annoyed me. It turned out that when Kate had a heart transplant it was Henry gouldings charecter who gave her his heart meaning he was dead during the whole film. Making his character not exist at all was a terrible decision . It made the film pointless and confusing and Made Emilia clarkes charecter completely insane. I get what they were going for with the song last christmas but i thought it was a cringey and terrible idea for a movie.Overall despite excellent performances and heartwarming moments that keep the film together. Last christmas gets slowly worse and worse as the film goes on and is completely ruined by its terrible ending."
277,"Text: Last Christmas made me laugh & broke my heart at the same time. In other words too, Emilia Clarke's character without a fail made me laugh & most especially BROKE MY HEART. It had such a conflicted ending na its subjective to one's interpretation if it's a toss up between a happy or sad ending. Bittersweet? I think that would describe it."

9 because i wanted and needed more"
279,Got dragged along by the girlfriend didn't fancy it one bit but really enjoyed it and Emma Thompson just killed it 10*
280,"Simply put, I don't love movie like this very often. I don't HATE them, but I often ask myself ""why would I watch (generic romcom) instead of (movie with rave reviews, that I havent seen yet). My girlfriend dragged me along, and I fully expected to add this to the pile of movies I've rated between 4.5 to 6.0. The pile that isn't awful but is very forgettable. Anyways, I was quite happy to leave the theater liking the movie. It's a low-7 for me, which is above average.In terms of what I liked... well.. (no spoilers), it wasn't cookie cutter. You have to watch the entire movie to get a perspective which tells a deeper story than what's on the surface. The rest is what you'd expect for the most part.That's it really. If you love these kinds of movies, you'll probably love this one too. If you don't love movies like this, give this one shot and it might impress you."
281,"An interesting premise (thank you, Emma Thompson) but the story was really poorly developed. The first part is chaotic which robs the audience of finding in the characters an emotional centre to which we could relate, then, when we were just beginning to get beneath the tangle that is Kate, the whole movie changes. Fantastic cast: Emilia Clark brought her quirky energy to a fractured character we really wanted to like (no frosty queen of fire and ice here); Henry Golding, tender yet mercurial (and hunky, of course); Michelle Yeoh, always a consummate performer; Emma Thompson, always splendid in her self deprecating, idiosyncratic roles. Eventually, all the performers found some footing, and for that I give the film a 6 (fair) out of 10. Oh, yes, and should I mention that the soundtrack is George Michael and WHAM saturated? Well, I guess I just did! Last Christmas, the song that is at the heart of the film (excerpted five times) is finally performed with great skill by Emilia Clark (what can't she do?). {Holiday RomCom/RomDram}"
282,"This was a very different, very unique, and very very heartwarming Christmas film."
283,"Luvvie celebrity crap. Nothing really about Christmas other than the shop. BREXIT is not Christmas, forced politics is not Christmas. Bad enough we have to listen to millionaire celebs banging on about how the average person is a racist and how they understand the world from their ivory tower. JOG ON.Film about a selfish person who was ill, gets better, becomes a better person. Oh and London is full of xenophobic middle class white people.Dont care if you want to make this crap, everyone is entitled to make whatever films they like, just be honest on the synopsis. Should read. Preachy celebs, shoe horn politics into extremely dull film that occurs around Christmas, may contain humour."
284,"Overall I liked this movie I thought Kate(Emilia Clarke) was a fun character and I liked that at a certain point the movie became more about her personal growth than the romance. However I hated the twist with Tom's character b/c it was like having the rug yanked out from under you and suddenly you're watching a completely different movie from what you thought it was. While it irritates me the whole he was dead all along thing, once I started thinking about it it actually made sense. Like whenever they were together she was the only one who talked to or acknowledged him and when she talked about him to other people no one had heard of him. I still think they could have made the twist literally anything else and it would be a better movie. The only reason it gets six stars is Emilia Clarke's acting, I found Kate to be endearing and entertaining but I won't be rewatching this which is big for me b/c I always like rewatching movies."
285,"I dont even know where to start. Its just an awful movie.Clarke does such a bad role. I kinda waited for the moment where i go ""oh shes cute and nice"" about her character. Just annoying from start to finish. Even though its meant to be a ""from the bottom to the nice girl""-kind of story.The script, the casting... The whole mixing cultures and forcing asians into this movie just makes no sense. I get that its for the chinese market, but seriously: just stop.The ghost factor was fine... But just none of the actors fit in the roles (What the hell Emma Thompson...).1/10, worst movie ive actually watched for a long time... this movie with another cast, with a re-done script might be an okay holiday movie, but this. Hell no. Do not hire the director and writer anymore."
286,"I loved the beginning because it's funny and interesting. Then, the middle gets really heartwarming, cute and romantic but the end, is sad and overall disappointing due to the fact that Tom died. I was expecting to see Tom and Katarine together but it turns out that he's gone due to her stupidity. YES, she changes throughout the film and becomes herself again and does good things but I was expecting to see love like a story not the messed up ending. I get the idea that we should put homeless people first and help out during christmas since it's the time of the year when we all get together. This review is given by a college film and media student."
287,"So someone had the 'idea(!?)' to take the lyrics from Wham! song quite literally to create this clichéd, virtue signalling, politically correct, stereotype ridden Richard Curtis-esque mess of a movie.It is just dross from start to finish; stealing ideas from all the other Christmas feel good movies out there, introducing a twist which has been done over & over and for some reason cramming it full of unnecessary political correctness whilst stereotyping and misrepresenting the culture and history of the Eastern European family at the core of the story.It is supposed to be a 'love story' but this movie only seems to be in love with is blinkered self."
288,I honestly can't understand how anyone can give this movie a bad review. It's a FANTASTIC movie. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are incredible together. This movie has so much meaning.. I cried my eyes out too. It will seriously pull your heart strings. Don't read the negative reviews. Watch it for yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed.
289,"I wanted to find something to like in this film, but it was just so awful. So much cringe! I didn't care for any of the characters, and the supposedly sentimental parts were just dull. Emilia Clarke has a nice signing voice, but it seems she lacks confidence as her singing parts had no soul, even in the ""big finale"". I usually love Emma Thompson but her fake Eastern Europe accent was again, so cringey. Not a movie I ever plan to watch again, and it definitely won't be pulled out at Christmas."
290,"1. Emilia so pleasant. You can't help but smile.
2. Golding was a surprise. Also surprise the Chinese people are not related in the movie
3. Michelle so funny and beautiful
4. Emma So funny and brilliant
5. Christmas decor at high street
6. Heartwarming family story
7. Music!
8. Emilia singing
9. About all sorts of LOVE
10. Hope it becomes the xmas movie classic"
291,Boring in the first half; heart-warming for the rest.
292,"I'm writing this review just after I came back from cinema. One of the best movies I've seen in months. Henry is one of my favorite actors and one of the reason of watching this movie was he. The story is very beautiful, but in one way very heartbroken. No one expected the thing what happened on end (of course I won't spoil it here)... My heart stopped to beat for one minute...
To sum up everything: really worth watching and this movie deserves waaay higher ratings <3"
293,I loved watching this. Emma Thompson is fantastic! The storyline was lovely and the main character is very funny and the whole cinema were laughing lots. It has a lovely message and the ending was very unexpected. Give it a watch!
294,Its all about love and tolerance. All my family loved it. I personally enjoyed every second of it. Great thank you for the makers. Thank you!
295,"I went into this movie not knowing much except Paul Feig was involved & ive loved just about everything he touches, this was no exception. A beautiful movie filled with a lot of heart. I don't usually get caught off guard with twists but I did not see this one coming. I can understand why some people wouldn't like this twist but the more I look back & think about it, it makes total sense. Anyone that likes Feig's other worm will know there will be a little bit of political messages but I didn't find them over the top. I enjoyed the subplots in this film. Emilia Clarke & Henry Golding have amazing chemistry. I really recommend this movie, it's a pretty great Christmas movie but don't expect a predictable, natural, Christmas movie!"
296,"I would watch this again. Coming form a person who doesn't generally watch this type of movie and was dragged to it. It had a good story line not like other romcoms with predictable plots, and you don't get bored which is always a plus. Actors were felt as if they were genuine and it's a film that stays with you for a while after watching it"
297,"I liked the film a lot. Go to enjoy it, not dissect it and you will enjoy it too. Lots of Grinch's here in the review who are mad about diversity. It had love, laughter, surprises, tears AND great music. It's a fun Christmas film. I don't know why everyone was expecting a historical masterpiece. And for everyone saying Love Actually...let's remember that a lot of Love Actually revolves around a bad marriage."
298,"This is a great Feel Good, Awesome,Funny and Heartfelt Movie!
I loved this movie! Great, Great acting and story line!
I was in awe, as it has an unpredictable ending. I can't wait to see it again and I am not one to watch just any movie over again! Loved it!!!"
299,It was a worth watch cristmas movie a simple but a good story. I hate that people are giving it a bad rating not every film should be suspense full and great plot twists
300,"I saw last Christmas the movie, andI was very surprised I don't like too many Love Story comedies but I gave this an A - it was a surprise and worth seeing. Some parts really made you laugh but the overall impression someone down on their luck depressed and trying to start over it's uplifting warm-hearted and I got to tell you a shocking surprise at the end. Last Christmas is a difficult film to review because it turns on a plot twist I can't describe without ruining it for you.Compared to standard genre fare, Last Christmas stacks up well. It's blessed with some good actors: Henry Fielding (T0m) gives sincerity, yet a mystery. Emilia Clarke (Kate) projects spontaneity, and enthusiasm yet an immaturity that , until She realizes her downfall, until she meets Tom.Along with generally good acting, this movie is packed full of positive messages initiated by a caring GIFT! It's got individual themes on the need to accept yourself and forgive others. Parents will particularly love Tom's advice about intentional living - the belief that we become what we do each and every day, thus our every deed shapes our characters. The film also demonstrates the benefits of forgetting yourself through helping others. As Kate throws herself into helping the homeless, after learning from Tom and his GIFT to her she renews her zest for living, and focuses on others and not self.
It was a BIG Surprise, Worth an A, If you don't like it you don't have to invite me over for Christmas. LOL"
301,Well written. Well acted. Beautiful Christmas story. Bring the tissues. Would highly recommend. Didn't give it a 10 only because I guessed the ending. Emma Thompson is at her usual awesome self. Funny. Clever. Easy to watch. Lots of humour in this movie. For the reviewers who didn't get the brexit mentions didn't watch it properly. It's very relevant to the story and why Emma Thompson's character is the way she is. I'll go watch it again.
302,Really unexpected twist which made me sad. Overall a beautiful movie. Nice songs. Great acting by all casts. Michelle Yeoh bring her most beautiful ever.
303,"This movie was awesome. There a few things worth mentioning about this film, first emilia clarke is gorgeous. In the film she is stunning,funny,warm vulnerable and very relatable. She is certainly one of the brightest rising young stars in the business . She is incredibly charismatic . The second thing i loved about this film was its overall theme about having and adventurous spirit and not only being open to all life has to offer ..but actually taking the time to enjoy it. This film is about love,love of self ,love of others,love of life . Awesome life affirming movie! Another thing the was awesome about this movie were the filming locations, it captures some parts of london that are not seen on film often if ever,great location work. Lastly the cinema photography
for this move was stunning..it was a visual treat for the eyes..and george michael's music made it a treat for the ears, the ending credit visuals and music were particularly wonderful. Bottom line awesome fun cute really warm movie....see it !"
304,"I wanted to like this movie more than I did. I really like Emilia Clarke & hoped this would be her breakout movie post Game of Thrones. Alas, I think not. For me, the first 2/3 of the movie was too slow & Emilia's character was more annoying than likeable.
One odd storyline was Michelle Leoh's love interest. I was expecting an interesting background story about how the couple met in the past but it was not forthcoming. A missed opportunity for some character depth.
I enjoyed most of the last 1/3 of the movie & it even brought a tear to my eye towards the end. However it was not enough to sustain the rest of the movie. Last Christmas is no Love Actually & not one that I would sit through again."
305,"Almost allowed the critics to sway me into giving this one a miss. So glad we went - it is brilliant.The entire cast is superb, especially Emilia Clarke, who is just such a natural and beautiful talent. The script is laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreaking all at once, and you definitely need your tissues to hand.The George Michael music adds that extra special touch and my husband and I loved everything about it all. If you're not touched by this film, there's something wrong with you!"
306,Beautiful festive feel good film with laughs and heartfelt messages a plenty. Left me feeling really uplifted. George Michael music throughout and fantastic acting from both Emila Clarke and Emma Thompson.
307,"I was expecting your average cheesy yet cute rom-com, which is was but even better and with such a beautiful storyline. I won't say much because I don't want to spoil it, but it is a lovely christmas movie worth watching. Plus with Emilia Clarke and Emma Thompson comes 2 very entertaining and well portrayed characters that had me laughing with tears by the end of it."
308,"After reading reviews of this film I nearly didn't bother but I'm so pleased I did. It was surprisingly good and is sure to be a Christmas film rolled out year after year. The casting of all characters was great, it was current, romantic without being sappy and was very funny at times.You think you know where it's heading but don't expect the Hollywood ending. It's better than that! It's very touching and perfectly executed by the cast.Give it a go and don't listen to the cynics if you're a Christmas film lover!"
309,When Praying for Time came on during the ice rink scene; I was a gonner (and couldn't find my tissues in the dark!). A must-see for George Michael fans.I really enjoyed it. Go see it.
310,"I absolutely loved this movie! Especially the ending. Yes, it was off to a cheesy start and yes, i totally understand that the people from the former yugoslavia thought Emma T did not do you justice.Does it matter? No. Me and my friend sang along to the last scene thrilled with the awsome story. Let's eat lesbian pudding together <3"
311,"So I went to see this because my wife loves rom-coms, George Michael and Christmas. I wasn't hugely fussed but I came out of the cinema really enjoying it. A nice plot, some good acting and genuinely very fun and heartwarming scenes with George Michael providing the soundtrack. If I have one gripe it's a completely unnecessary complete of scenes that are a dig at Brexit that would be fine but it literally adds nothing to the story, just Emma Thompson stroking her Liberal ego, no issue with Brexit being used but Jesus make it important to the plot. I would of given 10/10 if it wasn't for that."
312,"In order to stand out, critics are always sorely tempted to exaggerate... The worst film ever, eh? Where does that leave Blubberella? No, Last Christmas is not as bad as it is made out to be. It is not very well done though. Its greatest failing is that the protagonist is pretty unlikable throughout the story, or so unlikable initially that redemption comes too late to warm to her plight. Emma Thompson could not make her character work; I kept seeing Emma Thompson. The twist was too predictable and most (though not all) of the jokes fell flat. On the upside, the side plot of ""Santa"" and ""Boy"" is fun and the sound track contains some entertaining classics.
Do I regret seeing this film? No. Would I want to watch it again? Nope."
313,"I absolutely loved this because it didn't follow the plot of boy meets girl, they hate each other but end up together . I'm a Christmas tragic so wanted to see this purely as a Christmas movie. The George Michael soundtrack is brilliant and I hadn't realised the movie was written around George Michael singing last Christmas. Oh Emilia Clarke, she was great but those eyebrows have a life of their own"
314,"First time review
Don 't realy like christmas ore christmas movie. but realy liked this movie.
I have spoken."
315,"Very heartfelt Christmas movie, Emilia Clarke was fantastic, emotional, funny, and an unreal story."
316,"I just got out of Last ChristmasThere are several laugh out loud moments in this and my audience seemed to really enjoy it, but it didn't always work for me.George Michael's music is the highlight of the movie. They especially use the track Heal The Pain really well, even more so than the use of Last Christmas.Emilia Clarke (Danaerys Targarean from Game Of Thrones) is an actress I have a real soft spot for, and she does well here, probably the best I have seen her in a movie since Me Before You. Henry Golding is fine as the male lead, Michelle Yeoh made me smile a few times, but for me Emma Thompson got the biggest laugh in the movie.Clarke's character is not particularly likeable to begin with, she is a selfish, promiscuous, heavy drinker who constantly upsets her friends and does not seem to care about her actions. You know she will have changed come the end, as in all good Christmas movies, but if anyone but the loveable Clarke played the role, if have had a hard time caring about her.It is more than a tad predictable and is heavy on the foreshadowing and at times hits you over the head with its message, I don't think it is designed to be a Christmas classic, but it's an ok 90 minutes, especially if you like George Michael's music, Emilia Clarke or Emma Thompson.My cinema was pretty full, And they seemed to enjoy it"
317,"Has arranged some sort of ""Drug Deal"" (probably involving America's notorious ""Mad Mayor,"" Rudy. G.) proffering a Quid Pro Quo (aka, ""bribe"" or ""extortion payout"") to the corrupt minions ""curating"" comments about LAST CHRISTMAS. Those reviewers astute enough to notice all the horrors providing ""jump scares"" every five minutes throughout LAST CHRISTMAS--ranging from the Horrors of Sauerkraut, countries formerly known as ""Yugoslavia,"" driving a London minicab in the Age of Uber, muffs and muffins of all sizes and persuasions, delicate fish, fragile knickknacks, double-dealing shopkeepers, smothering mothers, singers out of key, skaters out of synch, sibling rivalries, Munchausen by Proxy, Pale-faced Nationalists, red double-decker buses running amok, haunted park benches all the way through psychos in the shower, are redacted, deleted, censored and silenced. But if you want to try something different this Noel, you can check out LAST CHRISTMAS."
318,I took my wife to this movie expecting to sleep but actually enjoyed it. It told a story I had expected but the way they put everything together made it worth watching. Honestly I recommend watching this.
319,"Emma Thompson really annoying, brexit, clean London, happy homeless, cliche after cliche and the 2 policewomen....dont get me started. Gave it 4 out of 10 only because its Xmas and I'm in a good mood."
320,"This is such a heart warming festive movie.Funny, emotional & beautiful with loveable characters and a lovely message, great George Michael soundtrack too.If you like Love Actually then this is right up your street!"
321,"No girl from Yugoslavia would lay down on bed in her shoes, never! 😂"
322,"A cut above the average Christmas movie. Great story, well produced, fantastic performances. Wonderful music, and unexpected twist. Watch this - you really won't regret it! It will surprise you. Congratulations to all involved, it was obviously a labour of love, and a love letter to George Michael to whom we all miss so much, at this time of year. Love you Yog. X"
323,"I was sceptical at first thinking it was another naff Christmas film but decided to take a look. It had everything, heart, feelings, comedy and the backdrop of London with a good soundtrack. First Christmas film I've watched with bad language. Do watch it."
324,Saw at the cinema last year! Wasnt sure on first viewing! However dont get hung up just on the music! It is such a heart warming story. Seeing it for the second time just makes it better. Can say that it has become a favourite christmas film.
325,"I'm not ashamed to say I cried my eyes out! What a beautiful story. Kate, who works as a elf in a year round Christmas shop, is messing her life up. Ruining friendships, drinking heavy and has no compassion for others. Until she meets Tom. Slowly she starts to make small changes and help others, with Tom by her side.
I love Emilia Clarke in this role. The message of this films tugs at your heart strings. To be happy we should help others and live life for love.
Get your tissues ready. My favourite Christmas film by far!"
326,"I love Christmas / Emotional movies
Surprised about the ending."
327,"It's easy to criticise. BUT it tells a genuinely realistic story, in modern day London, fuses 2 people together and allows you to connect with the characters in many ways.
Yes the script isn't the best, and sometimes the acting can be a little poor, BUT yet again it scores as it touches the heart and gets you really thinking about life. And for this along with an excellent soundtrack makes it an excellent film, it's not all about overacting, big words, big stars, or big budgets..."
328,"Rating and poor trailers/advertising has me uninterested in what looked like a run of the mill or even more poorly made movie of the like. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. its very real, touching on things that people feel but never talk about."
329,"Emilia is truly adorable in what may have easily been too sappy to be happy. Her emotion-grabbing, rubber-faced twisted eye brow takes are on par with Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett. Who knew? The big surprise is how the cast sticks every abrasive and loving note of the solid yet predictable script. The joy is in the execution. This movie is a much appreciated escape from combined stress of the election and Covid quarantine. Hope to watch it next year with a roomful of friends. C&B"
330,Funny romantic Christmas film with top actors. Unfortunately tearful end.
331,Absolutely loved the main actor she held my attention but there didn't seem to be a story that one could get involved with. Sorry to say I gave it away about three quarters through.
332,"I clicked on last Christmas because I thought it was the Ben Affleck movie Surviving Christmas. Once I seen it wasnt, I was about to change the channel but something made me stay. It seems like I caught the last half hour of the movie. I liked the main character and when she sang I was hooked. I seen when she's being standoffish to commit to a relationship but when they relieved who he was and how they meet crushed me. I said ""wow"". ""What a unbelievable twist. I was in tears. I'm a middle aged man and I was in tears. I have to say no movie ever touch me as much as this one. Close would be"" 29th Street"" and of course,"" It's a wonderful life"".Now of course I have to watch this movie in its entirety which at this time of posting I have not done yet but I'm sure I'll be satisfied. This is going to be my new Christmas movie to watch."
333,"Tremendous job by all cast and crew! ""Last Christmas"" is now on my annual holiday season movie watchlist. Throughout the movie, all I kept thinking about was when I could travel to London during the holidays. Unfortunately, it will not be any time soon, but luckily I have ""Last Christmas"" to watch and keep my festive spirits high year-round. Be aware... have a box of tissues by your side."
334,"It's such a great movie , it has a unexpected twist which made me cry , loveeeed it"
335,"This movie is not what you expect it to be. I feel like the trailer and leadup to the movie make it out to be another typical cheesy and predictable romantic comedy revolved around the holidays, but this movie is (for the most part) not that. This movie is so much more. It tells the story of Kate, a girl who used to be very ill and had a heart transplant. After her procedure, she never really felt like herself again. She went on a downward spiral, started drinking, eating bad, not exercising and having one night stands. This created a rift between her and parents (who are separated), and her sister, who is a lesbian but hides that from her parents because she fears being judged. It also ruins some of Kate's friendships as well. But in comes Tom, a sweet and selfless guy who Kate turns to during her difficult time. You can see them falling in love immediately, but it's so much more than that, they seem to connect in a somewhat spiritual level. Even though he's helping Kate in whatever way he can, you can see that Tom is hiding something, but you're not sure what. One day Kate goes to Tom's apartment looking for him, where she sees a realtor selling the place. She starts talking to the realtor about Tom, and the realtor becomes confused and tells her that the man that lived in that apartment died about a year ago. That's when the plot twist becomes clear. The reason why she can feel Tom and he seems so real to her is because the heart that she received for her transplant, was in fact his. He was hit by a bus and was dead immediately. Tom and Kate have one last moment together. He tells her that his heart was always going to be hers, in one way or another. Changed by the influence Tom had on her life, Kate starts to make positive changes in her life and rekindles the relationships that she had ruined in the past year.All in all, the movie adds a fictional twist to help explain the story of a young woman struggling to find emotional and mental stability. Oh and Emilia Clarke was brilliant in portraying Kate, her performance is fantastic and you definitely feel and root for Kate in this movie.
Despite the fictional aspect the movie, which comes as a complete surprise, I still certainly enjoyed it, a lot more than I would have if it was another typical Christmas rom-com."
336,If you are looking for a wholesome Christmas film this ain't it. It's like a cross between In Her Shoes and the Sixth Sense and it just gets really unbelievable and weird. If people felt this way after a surgery I feel like we would have known about it it by now. Acting was good and the ideas were good but not my favourite.
337,"It's such a wonderful, warm and charming movie. There were historical mistakes, but it didn't ruin the pleasure. Enjoyed the film very much - great story, wonderful actors and the plot twist was amazing! I'm surely going to watch it again (probably every Christmas). Thank you!"
338,"This movie besides cute and heartwarming acting of emila Clark and the cast
Has some interesting messages which as an imgitan I understand and enjoy.
The twist was nice and refreshing while Abit tear-jerking.
But the winner for me is the mom.l, Emma Thomson.
I understood her pain and worry.
In the end. This movie had many messages beside it's cute love story.
Or actually maybe a self love story."
339,"When I started watching it, I wasn't too sure. I'm so happy I hung in there. It was charming and such a real feel good movie!! Made me cry!! Definitely recommended!!"
340,"Yeah, there are some technical issues with the story (Yugoslavia in '99?), but it's still a good movie. Nicely crafted plot with a heartwarming character arc."
341,"I liked the premise of the story. There are other great movies with a similar theme, however, in this particular case, there was a gap between the two main characters. It's not bad, but it doesn't take advantage of all the potential it had. Either way, seeing Emilia Clarke's smile is always worth it."
342,"A beautiful movie which was sad but moving at the same time.
A must watch."
343,"""Last Christmas"" isn't the best Holiday movie you'll see but, it's a fun time that will fill your heart and get you in the holiday spirit. It's also a perfect date night movie or if you need a holiday kick start. It's a film, too, that very much feels like the product of the 90s, but that's not exactly a bad thing. It uses this familiar approach to add a bit of relevancy, while also sending a positive message. Film benefits from charming performances and chemistry between Emilia Clarke & Henry Golding who shine here together. Memorable and heartfelt ""Last Christmas"" is one of those movies that's for sure will become as much of a holiday tradition to watch as baking up a batch of gingerbread cookies. Ultimately, it's far from perfect and there are plenty of logical leaps to make and ideas to buy into, yet it's delightfully heartwarming and sweetly entertaining when at its best.Rating: 8"
344,"I thought this was a typical feel-good Christmas movie that centers around romance, family and love in general. I mean, I would be happy with that already because I'm a huge sucker for Christmas movies. But this movie exceeded my expectations and delivered a story about a young woman who grew up and became accountable for her actions while she experienced a love and friendship that transcended time and space. Loved the love story and when the plot twist was revealed, I teared up. Also, the cast was superb so kudos to the casting director."
345,Once again I didn't pay attention to the low ratings and I am super happy about it! It had an amazing and very inspiring story! This movie had one of the greatest endings I have ever seen and I was all covered with tears at the end. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!
346,"A Christmas movie that doesn't have many Christmas features. The Christmas tree, Santa Claus and Christmas ornaments are all in the background in the story. Its normal to expect the same story in theaters at this time of year and that is what makes this film - not stand out - but different from the rest.
The characters in the film are quite eccentric and none of them escapes this adjective. Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson have the strangest characters - in a good way - from the plot of the film. A Christmas store attendant with peculiar tastes and who has a romantic and secondary plot with the character of Peter Mygind, who can possibly get some laughs from the audience. And a mother from a broken family who is very protective of one of her daughters and is very afraid of being deported to her country of origin. Lydia Leonard's character has a small plot that I could call a dramatic and essential background, but it just stays there.
Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding for being the protagonists, are the ones that stand out the most in the film. As stated before, none of the characters shy away from the adjective eccentric and strange. Emilia Clarke puts her essence of romantic comedy characters here and manages to be funny without being forced, possibly captivating the audience with the situations that surround her created by the script and is mentally messy. This all makes us want to follow its history and learn more about it. In the case of Henry Golding, they make up a very correct character and who possibly does not make many mistakes in his life. That's what makes the character weird.
What may have surprised me in the entire film was its ending. It can be a little predictable if we think a little more outside the box and take the idea a little more than half of the film. In this case, it didn't happen to me. I was surprised and a little sad by the situation.
The film is full of imperfections, such as the little importance they give to the dramatic background of some characters, but it is full of fun scenes that make your heart warm when you see them."
347,"If was lovely in a weird way, didn't expect the end at all to be honest which added something special to it..."
348,"It's cheesy, it has a preposterous set-up, the accents are borderline offensive... Even with all that, it can be forgiven - IT'S GREAT FUN! Must watch!"
349,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Last Christmas"" (2019) is not the most memorable romantic comedy you will ever going to see, but its a pretty solid one. This is a sweet and cute movie. Performances were very good and story was pretty involving and surprising as well. Add here a superb soundtrack by my all time favorite George Michael and this a sweet movie i can only recommend it to watch. A good Christmas movie as well as a good date film."
350,"Last Christmas is a heart felt movie. I really enjoyed the plot and Emily was lovely. I admit that I sensed something off there but didn't see 'that' was coming.
Thank you team for this beautiful movie!"
351,"What a beautiful lovely feel good movie that was...is... a very simple little story but the meaning behind it so poignant ""look up"" I really really enjoyed that and It made me cry ... a great film with a lot of ""heart"" and a nice little twist George Michael songs all the way through was just the icing on top of a fabulous little rom-com cake. Highly recommended 10/10"
352,"When you choose to make a film based around a holiday you run the risk of the film being bypassed once that holiday is over. Even during the holidays I had no real desire to see the film LAST CHRISTMAS. So imagine my surprise to find it one of the most delightful films I've seen in some time.Emilia Clarke stars as Kate, a young woman living in London who works in an all year round Christmas shop dressed as an elf. Her boss is simply named Santa (Michelle Yeoh), an owner who has a habit of stocking some unusual items in her store. While working there Kate also attempts to launch a career singing in productions, auditioning for nearly any part available and never landing a role.Kate is in the middle of a bad period in her life. Her career is going nowhere, she has no place of her own to live, counting on the kindness of her friends to put her up. But even there her luck runs bad as she doesn't take long to do something that results in her being kicked out. Her love life is on the outs as well with frequent hookups that lead to nothing more serious than a one night stand. Her relationship with her sister is one of mutual disapproval and the one with her mother is even worse.Kate's mother (Emma Thompson who also wrote the story and produced the film) calls her by her proper name Katerina and worries about her non-stop. Much of this is due to an illness Kate had the previous year which we don't get details on until later. When all of her friends boot her out Kate has no choice but to return home to live.Then one day something happens. She sees an attractive young man outside the shop looking up at the sky. Going out to see what he's looking at, he points out a bird to her claiming it's unusual to see this bird in the city. They talk a bit and he convinces her to walk with him later. Doing so he shows her a small alley, giving her the history of it and showing that it ends up in a small garden courtyard with benches that people can sit on.Kate becomes infatuated with the man who she learns is named Tom (Henry Golding). He tells her he works late nights but before he goes to work they continue to spend time together. One place he lets her know he works is a mission for homeless people. When Tom doesn't show one night, she goes there looking for him only to be recruited into helping.The relationship between Tom and Kate builds as the movie progresses but they never sleep together. He tells her he's old fashioned like that. As they spend time together things begin to change for Kate. She becomes happier. She becomes less selfish. She starts helping other people, especially at the homeless shelter. But will that happiness carry on? Will Tom be there for her forever? Will something happen that changes everything?In spite of revealing a lot of what takes place in the film so far I'm holding back on much of it. That's because this movie did something that so few do for me these days. It surprised me. It caught me off guard. I've seen so many movies that rarely happens and when it does it make me happy to see that this is still possible.The surprise is not all that makes me recommend this movie. It has a bright, fresh feeling to it in spite of the life that Kate lives when we first meet her. The film doesn't rely on naked bodies or four letter words to present a story of two people in love unlike most films today. Instead it harkens back to the romantic screwball comedies of the past relying on witty writing, great performances and a story that captures the heart.Clarke is known mostly for her role in GAME OF THRONES but shows that she has so much potential to move past that into Sandra Bullock territory, a romantic lead with the ability to make you laugh as well. Golding is a surprise, having only been in six films to far, his first being CRAZY RICH ASIANS where he did an amazing job as well. Thompson is hilarious here as an immigrant fearful of everything and concerned for her children.As I said at the start, I had no interest in this movie when it was released. I not admit that the film was a charming, refreshing change of pace that will entertain, enlighten and make you think twice about the world we live in. With music obviously written by the late George Michael used throughout, it's a movie that you should watch, in spite of Christmas having come and gone."
353,Pleasant film coupled with a good majority of the George Michael discography.The music has me bopping my head & singing along.The story at some point becomes obvious as to what the ending will be. But that didn't take away my enjoyment of the film.A lovely holiday inspired film. If not for the music though - the film would only be about a two or three star.
354,"10 out of 10 is what should be given to this movie. Not many drama, not many brain-hacking stuff. Just a wonderful story about a girl who heart-broken, and now being healed.But why many people hate it? Because it reflect the world we are living right now. We, the people, always finding another reason to blame someone who is completely irrelevant to the root of the problems. We feel uncomfortable to talk about what we have done. We hate Hitler because what he have done to the Jewish people. But look at us today, do some of us ever have the feeling that we are doing the same thing just like Hitler and German had done in the past?
To be honest, this movie is really great because it dare to talk about we feel completely uncomfortable about, and dare to push people's comfort zone.
If you doesn't watch it yet, watch it. Because It will worth your time
Thank you for reading. Have a nice day!"
355,"After watching the first 5 minutes or so, I was thinking of turning this off. Emilia's character was such a mess and I thought this film was going to be a waste of time. Then, it started to pull me in and I kept watching. I am so happy that I did.This movie has so much heart.
The story turned out to be entertaining and uplifting. All of the actors did justice to their roles and it turns out that I enjoyed this movie immensely. While it reminded me of some other films, it is definitely not derivative. Also, if you enjoy George Michael's singing,then you are in for an additional treat. I was pleasantly surprised by Emilia's singing and she is quite good in the film.If you enjoy uplifting entertainment, give this a try. You won't be disappointed!"
356,Didn't think it would take the turns it did..... was nice to see a film which made one say a silent prayer of thanks as we pressed the stop buttons and reflect on many a thing!! Loved it
357,"""Last Christmas"" opens in the beautiful setting of a church in Yugoslavia. A child with an angelic voice is singing in a choir. We instantly fast forward a number of years when the child is a young woman residing in London. After being picked up in a bar and spending the night with a man she just met, the woman is confronted by the man's live-in girlfriend, who returns early from a trip and asks her ""Did you shag him?""The disconnect described above reveals a deep flaw in this film. For nearly half of the movie, the character of Katrina (Kate) is the Grinch trying her best to ruin Christmas for everyone. She is a recalcitrant worker in a shop selling Christmas toys. She is estranged from her Croatian family and her doting mother. She is a human wrecking machine for all who surround her.Then, at the midpoint of the film, we learn that Kate had a bum ticker and received a transplant. She now has visions of her donor, a kind man named Tom Webster, for whom a bench is named in London. Kate begins to help the poor and sing for shillings outside a shelter. She now lives by Tom's adage, ""Every little action of the day makes or unmakes character.""The film would have been better if we had learned the background on Kate's heart at the start of the film. As it stands, it was difficult to feel for the character, based on her Scrooge-like conduct for the first half. When Tom tells her, ""Take care of my heart. It was always going to be yours one way or another,"" the sentiment comes much too late. The Grinch-like Kate looks up to the sky and receives bird poop in her eye. The reformed Kate looks up and sees miracles. This movie is two separate halves that never come together.""Last Christmas"" was a film that failed to deliver much genuine feeling. It was also unfortunate that the actress playing Kate appeared to have a nice singing voice, but it was under-utilized in the film. The production values were decent, and the cast was good. But the intended heart-warming effect of the film came far too late and failed to deliver much holiday cheer."
358,"It's a really great and light romantic movie. Some unnecessary and historically incorrect Yugoslavian implications, but overall nice movie."
359,I unexpectedly kinda did enjoy this movie. Two gorgeous actors doing their best with a sad gripping story. Watch this!
360,"Just when we think the gush of Christmas commercials and specials are over, along comes LAST CHRISTMAS, and if ever there were a film that could enchant, this is one that does. Written by Emma Thompson (who also plays a significant role in the movie) and Greg Wise with screenplay adaptation aided by Bryony Kimmings, the film seems a bit of fluff, overly decorated, until the messages begin to sink in. And by the end the film is elevating, thanks to some fine acting and direction. George Michael's music plays a primary role, also.Katrina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store owned by 'Santa' (Michele Yeoh) is not good for the wannabe singer. However, there she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a kind-hearted man with a mysterious past who challenges her cynical worldview. Kate slowly comes to realize that Tom is 'significant' and her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. Completing the entourage is Kate's Yugoslavian immigrant family - mother Petra (Emma Thompson), father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) and sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) - each with conflicts and problems of their own. It all comes together with a discovery (one that should not be shared) and the grand finale at the homeless sanctuary is rich in honest goodwill - 'helping each other.'This is a feel good movie, well acted, and one that can be uplifting - if you've a mind to be uplifted!"
361,"When I saw the trailer I thought it would be just another cookie cutter romance much like a hallmark movie but this one had a little more depth and substance.The twist killed me, even though I figured it out a quarter way through. It was still very enjoyable. I say give it chance."
362,"George Michael as a writer. But it is actually pretty good. Unexpected I must say, but totally enjoyable. Using one of the best Christmas songs in this way."
363,"I almost quit watching in the middle of the movie because it was kinda slow and ordinary.
But I persevere and the later part of the movie picked up a little and have an unexpected twist.
In the end it was an ok movie.One thing they could improve on though, is if the main character is supposed to be a singer, then use an actress that sings well.
On the other hand, the mother played by Emma Thompson does not need to sing well but she actually sings better than Kate."
364,"I don't understand why has this movie been given such low ratings.
It is a very sweet, simple, fun and emotional movie. Everyone's acting is great and I liked this movie a lot."
365,I love this movie more than I can possibly tell you!!
366,"After seeing the trailer, I was almost put off from seeing this because the whole story was ruined before it was released, but I'm so glad I gave it a watch.Kate (Emilia Clarke) works at all year round Christmas store and somehow manages to survive couch surfing day by day.
While spotting a confused looking man out the front of the store, Kate goes out to see what he's looking at and meets Tom (Henry Golding). After the two share an instant connection, Kate opens up and grows closer to others while enjoying the little things in life.Even though I knew what the twist was, I still really enjoyed this film which even brought me to a few tears. It's a cute romantic Christmas story that also tackles issues such as racism.
I highly recommend this film if you just want to join a film that will make you feel warm inside."
367,"I am so happy about this watching, actually i am a Rom Com freak and i never missed any, but i am so intrigued by watching this that i am ecstatic by watching this movie. I love the Emilia Clarke acting in this. She is genuine at every thing. I haven't seen GOT but now i am thinking about giving it a try. Henry Golding bus brilliant as well and so charming and decent and a complete gentleman. So guys I am recommending anyone who has a Romantic touch in there hearts to watch it and enjoy every bit of it."
368,"Will be added to my rom com collection! Right up there with the ugly cry of PS I Love You, A Walk To Remember...just makes it more bittersweet knowing George Michael isnt here with us anymore on Earth."
369,"The brits just know how to play your heartstrings... if you love the classic movie love actually, you'll love this! And this one doesn't have any sex in it so it's a movie the entire family can watch! It had a very ""return to me"" vibe and about 40 minutes before the ending we called it ... kinda of. Lol. But it was a nice return to me sixth sense feel good feel. Would def recommend it! We loved all the characters in it specially the two female cops they need a show all on their own and loved all the homeless people. Of course it had the Brit twist in it liberal political preaching but it wasn't to harsh to the point where I couldn't stand it. It was a sweet message of love and hope and forgiveness and being kinder and easier on ones self and above all self love. Very sweet message."
370,"I put off watching this film, because I heard it was a chick flick, but I loved this film, Emilia Clarke and Emma Thompson were brilliant, this film covers so much, and brought a tear to my eyes, I really did enjoy this film so much."
371,"Romantic comedy. The film was directed by Paul Fig, known to us for his disgusting behavior in one notorious social network, which removed the wild horror called ""Ghostbusters"" and Emilia Clark, the famous Daenerys Targaryen from the notorious series with a terrible end, became my interest. Frankly speaking - I was waiting for a prowler with a licked romantic line, but I got ... In general - it was worth going to the cinema for this, it is better with a girl, but I don't have one. Nevertheless, I decided to look - and this is just a WONDERFUL romantic picture. Emotions beat over the edge, therefore, I apologize in advance if there will be extra confusion and ""chewing snot"" in the text. Here is my brief opinion - my personal winner of the Oscar 2020! No more and no less, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. I choke with delight when I write these lines, but the experienced look does not sleep, therefore I will paint both the advantages of this wonderful picture and the shortcomings that hurt the eye.
So, the advantages:
1. The song ""Last Christmas"" of the English group ""Wamp"", namely George Michael - it is the germ from which, like a tree, this wonderful picture grew. Before viewing the title of this song, it didn't give me anything, well, the song and the song, but as soon as it began to play at the beginning of the picture, I instantly remembered its chords and began to sing along to the heroes. Although the song is not new (it was written in the mid-eighties), it is recognizable all over the world. How I remembered it and where I first heard it is a big mystery to all of humanity. Maybe the reason is the simplicity of words or music!
2. London - I love this city (as you know), I love its cozy streets, large squares, famous monuments, right-hand drive cars. I hope that one day I will be able to visit this city and walk along these streets myself. All the action of the picture takes place in London, which I am incredibly happy.
3. Christmas atmosphere - what not to take away from this picture is precisely this. And it shows exactly the modern atmosphere with smartphones, selfies, a bunch of unnecessary gift junk that goes to the trash soon after the holiday, happy smiles on their faces, a feeling of warmth and care. Maybe the atmosphere was embellished, but still it blooms with bright colors here.
4. Humor - for the most part, he was good. He laughed heartily at some points.
5. A romantic story - it is beautiful, both with the main and secondary characters. Two people completely unlike each other fall in love. The standard reception of all the romantic comedies of all times and peoples, but here, which is the most surprising for me, is more or less chaste, just in the spirit of the old classics, like ""Roman Holidays"". Between the heroes, first quietly, like an obsession, then more and more the same ""spark"" arises that everyone can feel. Despite some wariness and some skepticism - I continued to look and in the end I was rewarded!
6. Shocking finale - this technique is not very often used in the paintings of this genre, because I experienced a real shock from the finale. I believed in the love of the heroes, I rejoiced with them, I tried not to pay attention to anything else, and here - blow, discharge, blow - and despair. Now I understood why it all happened, how could I not have guessed it myself?
So, the disadvantages are:
1. Gay and lesbianism - how I don't want to describe those moments because of which I did not give the highest mark to this wonderful picture, but I have to, because I really got it. I could now expand an entire article about how this whole ""talerastiya"" terribly infuriates me and why it is disgusting, terrible and the like. And immediately those who rummage over me with a moron, a homophobe, a freak and so on. I have already come to terms with this. All this is bad, and I do not need to write that the author of the wonderful song ""Last Christmas"" was gay, I know this, but the emu says goodbye, because he created a musical masterpiece. Tolerasts! You can attack, I do not care.
2. Some inconsistency - in the picture there are ""sagging"" both in central history and in secondary ones. What to do - alas, nothing perfect happens!
3. Rough physiological humor - in general, it is perfectly inscribed in history, this cannot be taken away, but sometimes it infuriates so much that there are no words.
A little about the main characters:
1. Kate, played by Emilia Clark, is an employee of a Christmas store with eternal problems, the appearance of a cheap prostitute and big ambitions, but behind all this masquerade she hides real pain and longing from a past in which a terrible thing happened. Her tricks amaze, amuse, make her worry, and after that - I just want to hug her, comfort her and kiss her. Emilia personally proved to me that she can play not only the mother of dragons, but also someone else. Her character turned out to be lively, extraordinary, funny and touching. From a closed egoist with kooky at the end, she turns into a kind and caring lady with an open heart and with a sense of joy from life. Amy's whole pen!
2. Tom performed by Henry Golding - a romantic young man whom Kate met. Veselchak, a madman in the good sense of the word, capable of melting all the ice in the North. Strongly influenced Kate, giving her guidance and instilled a love of life itself. This Malaysian came to my liking. Before that, I had never seen him in a movie, and I must admit - the debut turned out to be gorgeous. Well done!
I could have painted each of the heroes like that, but I've been writing this text for more than an hour, so I need to round out and summarize the final results.
If this picture is Paul Fig's apology for his past creation, then I accept it. Emilia! I thought you didn't know how to play, and more than once I saw confirmation of this, but with this picture you convinced me of the opposite. I don't believe that I'll write it now - but I was wrong! Forgive me!
As a result, we have a wonderful romantic comedy with an unexpectedly shocking ending, a wonderful Christmas atmosphere, wonderful music that could not do without cons. Emilia and Henry are a wonderful couple!
My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"
372,"Got this movie because I like Emilia Clarke. I became a fan with her work on Game of Thrones, and watching her many talk show appearances, where I found her personality delightful.Last Christmas is just a fun movie. A romantic comedy with a twist at the end. All involved did a great job, and Emilia. as expected was adorable. Sometimes it's fun to watch a movie just to be entertained. For me, this filled that bill. The only danger was the possibility of a cuteness overload.If you just want to relax and really enjoy a movie, I highly recommend Last Christmas."
373,"It would be a great fun for actress Emilia Clarke
the story took a very sudden turn and became sad"
374,"I like every thing its my new favorite film for the year
the ending was suprised the best drama film"
375,I really loved it in time I needed something to cheer me up So I really recommend it very muvh especially in time you're bored and messed up
376,I like the plot twist and the second part of the movie goes to deeper meaning which is rare in love movie
377,Story could have given us so much more. The way this was billed we should expect love actually 2 but really we got the makings of a really good Christmas film. Nothing to do with the acting but more the story has been done before. Not saying it missed but not what we were told
378,Couldn't wait to see this at the cinema. Definitely watch it if you like romcoms
379,Very good comfortable film and I would recommend the watch heart warming
380,Amazing movie for holidays . A good romantic scenes and actually a movie full of Christmas feelings. And good actors
381,"Yugoslavia in 1999. ??? It ended 1992. And to top all that you mix Croatian and Serbian language, they are not the same!! And all that mistakes for nothing because it did not have a point."
382,"I wanted to like this movie but the fact that the twist is so obvious that most people get it from the trailer spoils the fun. I spent the entire movie expecting her to realize that Tom doesn't exist, because it's that transparent. The cast is good and the songs are too, obviously."
383,Last Christmas is exactly the same I expected. The movie is filled with clichés but the movie works as an one time watchable as there are some memorable moments. Emilia Clarke did a good job and took the whole movie in her hands and rides with her beautiful smile along with a decent performance from Henry Golding. It's actually Emma Thompson and Michelle Young who made the movie alive along with Emilia Clarke. Last Christmas is a movie you can try out with your family on Christmas seasons.
384,"Beyond my expectation. Now I know why it's called ""last christmas"" because of its lyrics. A feels movie. Boy meets girl vibe with christmas spirit. Good twist tho."
385,"The film itself is not very interesting or dramatic.
I should have given it 5 or 6 stars in normal days.
However, it's Christmas, a film's star to me is not only determined by how good it is but also by the one who you are going with.
And the one I was going with is so pretty that I would give this movie 7 stars.
Merry Christmas everybody!"
386,"I knew something was up. I knew that Tom had to be fake. But when the truth came out I was shocked. And the line ""you would have had my heart either way"" broke me. I didn't think the movie would be that depressing. It was a good movie with a beautiful story of a wholesome journey of self discovery and change. But the snag and the end shatters the heart and makes you never want to give it away when you realise how fragile life can be"
387,"If you want a film with a few laughs and not over complicated plot, this is for you.
Saw reports saying it was rather cliché and poor;ly written. Yes and No. Yes it is cliché but its a romantic comedy (sort of). Yes I spotted the twist early on. Yes the ending is a little sugar coated. Did I feel cheated out of the petrol money, car parking money, snacks money and ticket price....No!
Throughly enjoyed it and would happily add it to the video cllection when it comes out."
388,"We thought it would be an easygoing-careless-lighthearted flick, to spread a bit of festive mood around. Well, yeah, it has that element to it too...and much more, so if you really just want to switch your brain off, choose some other time to watch this.
The ""story"" if almost not existent, and yet, there is still meaning, leaving me stirred even after I got home from the cinema. Performance of the actors is very strong, accross the board; from that angle we are in for a treat. And yes, there is George Michael's music all along, though that wasn't the selling point for me (sorry...), and you definitely won't look at ""Last Christmas"" the same way ever again after seeing this movie.
Overall, well worth watching, just be prepared for something a bit deeper than yeat another silly little Christmas-themed romantic comedy."
389,"Seriously , Only 10 person watching this movie in the theatre With me . Haha , I guess commercial movie like "" marvel "" or "" star war "" are much attractive . Is getting fewer and fewer movie like ""lovely actually "" ( is hard to compare to ""lovely actually "", so many top star in here ) ""home alone "", inside the story mainly happen at xmas , is rarely few producter to invest such a movie cuz it doesn't earn high profit. Sadly , this s the movie cycle now .This movie pick the right cast for it. Sure everyone know "" mothers of dragon "" to summon the relative fans to watch , like me . Hahhaha
It s the best choose cuz she is the main /key play the whole movie. Actor also is the right person on it "" so sweet ..😍😍.."" . Coustion single person may drooling .Finalise , although it was so good , sure it won't be the worst , Juz hoping they invest more like this kind of movie. BTW , this ending is unexpectedable ( shld say it doesn't make sense, but is Juz a movie 🍿 no need to be serious) ."
390,"This movie I will buy and will be seen more by me. One of the best since years. Good jokes, not too romantic so my husband enjoyed it too."
391,"This movie is easy and fun. However, drama and deep meaning are hidden in it. He gives hope and restores faith. Emilia Clarke plays great. The embodiment and representation of the characters she plays is always on top."
392,"An excellent story line and some humorous moments, but generally awkward scriptwriting with a dollop of overacting. Worth a watch"
393,"This is a bit like Bridget Jones meets love actually. It's a feel good film for Christmas and although it's a bit of a slow start it does improve.The story isn't bad although it's a bit obvious. It's not the deepest plot but I guess it's not meant to be.My main gripe about the film is that they really under utilised the Wham and George Micheal back catalogue. Although they use the songs they are almost background music for the majority of the film and seem like they were almost just there as a selling point, which is a real waste of brilliant music."
394,"Trying too much to throw in everything sweet, quirky, cosy and love-actually-like aiming to create The Perfect Christmas Movie. The result is rushed and superficial, lacking in depth and strangely unengaging. Even despite the twist in the end. But nevertheless, with almost every cliche in the film-recipe-book Emilia Clarke is a sweet main character and overall I'd say the movie is a nice li'l bagatelle to escape from the world with for a couple of hours."
395,"Saw the movie over the weekend and it didn't disappoint. Cute Christmas movie with a great soundtrack of George Michael songs. Worth watching just for them alone. The movie was slightly spoilt by the  undertones that Emma Thompson with her lunatic left wing views obviously felt the need to put in. It's an insult to the 17.4 million majority who democratically voted and won the #Brexit vote. I'm fed up with these holier than thou actors who wrongly portray so many good people.Thompson is known for her crazy political views, the movie studio maybe should have told her to drop her political bias from a feel good Christmas movie."
396,"Feelgood film +George Michael Songs, what a great combination. Loved the film, great acting by Emilia, Henry, Michelle and Emma. Don't pay attention to the critics. Just watch for a feel good time."
397,"Okay, the movie started out sooo good, a typical Christmas movie, cozy and all. Emilia plays a woman who thinks her life is really bad, then she meets a boy who makes her change her life in different ways which makes her happier.But! Here comes the twist. The boy is a ghost! I feel like I have to tell you that Emilias character earlier had a heart transplant and now we find out that her heart belongs to this boy that she's been seeing, talking to, kissing etc. So... He's a ghost, because she has his heart he's following her to make sure she takes care of his heart or something. That was an awful twist and it brings the movie down a lot.Still a cozy movie though and worth watching."
398,The song. The lyrics. Literally the plot of the movie is in the movie title and the theme song !!!This movie took a while for it to be something but it is definitely a feel good movie for the Christmas time. The true meaning of Christmas is to give to others and that was the theme throughout the whole movie was to see the benefit of giving to others to help yourself be happy
399,The message in this movie was perfect. The acting is phenomenal and I can't wait to own this to watch it all the time. It's a must see!!!
400,I loved this movie. It kept me intrigued the entire time and I left the theater feeling inspired. This was such a feel good movie.
401,I thought the movie was very funny and made you appreciate what you have and who you have in your life
402,"I watched twenty minutes and quit. This was so bad in every way- the main character is flighty, the writing is pathetic and the acting mediocre. I liked Emilia Clarke in GOT, but this was a total let down."
403,"Rom com with music from George Michael.Love story with a twist, directed by Paul Feig, had its ups and downs (but mainly downs) - Henry Golding characterisation of a mysterious man with endless optimism was by far the best bits.Emma Thompson's terrible accent and writing were by far the worst!
Could this be any more anti-Brexit! Emma T included several appalling political elements, just shameful!"
404,"I really don't understand the negative reviews for this movie at all. I adore all the actors, so I went into this movie with zero expectations but enjoyment and I came out loving it and as far as I know, so did everyone else in the cinema - I live in New Zealand. Have movie reviewers all gotten so cynical and bitter that they just can't simply sit and enjoy a movie full of love and goodwill? Sigh. I don't want to say anything else except I never listen to the critics and don't you dare. Just go see it. Personally, this one goes under A Good Year for me, which the critics hated, but it is one of my goto movies for when I feel like the movie equivalent of a big, massive hug."
405,This movie was amazing and let's you evaluate the person you want to be.
406,"Last Christmas could have been great. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding both give great performances and have amazing chemistry. Emma Thompson and Michelle Yeoh are also great. It's consistently funny throughout and heartwarming at times. The pacing is really good and the soundtrack is also great. However, it's brought down by a third act twist that's surprisingly bad but overall it's still good."
407,"My immediate thought leaving the theater was that I wish this film just popped up on Netflix one day without any marketing or promotion. That way, we wouldn't have had the theories about the trailer (and a certain character) to potentially ruin the experience. I won't say that my experience was completely ruined, but it was certainly impacted by a simple internet theory that may or may not have turned out to be true. Is that ultimately fair for the film? No, but I review the movie based on my experience along with the quality, not just the latter. Last Christmas is far from a bad movie, but it's also nowhere near a great one either. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding make for a solid romantic team on screen, the music is solid (both soundtrack & score), and I was never bored. However, the dialogue is cringey more often than not, some of the supporting performances feel mailed in, and the plot is as predictable as you think after seeing the trailer. But if you're looking to kickstart the holiday season with an enjoyable yet flawed Christmas flick, then take a shot with this one.6.2/10"
408,"It's a sweet, feel good movie. Loved every bit of it."
409,"Love this movie so much! I laughed, smiled, cried, and felt inspired to help others. What a great message! I became a huge fan of George Michael/ Wham about 3 years ago. This movie brought so much joy having his songs throughout. Can't leave out the cast! They were wonderful!! Can't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack and will definitely see this again. If you enjoy a positive message to help inspire you to help others, romantic films, and are a George Michael fan, you will love this film!Please don't be hesitant on the negative reviews. Honestly, I don't understand them when it brings such a positive message for people to do in this world. We could all use some happiness and positivity to put out. The more we do the more happiness it shall bring to us and our character. :)"
410,"I usually avoid these type of movies like the plague but I was smiling the entire movie. May not be for everyone judging on the other reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
411,"This film start with a girl ""Kate"" singing with the choir at 1999 Yugoslavia, and she flirting with a man in a bar at 2017 London scene! As turnout, this film is about Kate imagine she in love with a man ""Tom"", who donate his organ to her! Entire film full of boring conversation and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of flashback scene of Kate causing fire scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the annoying song playing at the background scene, and overuse of Kate having argument with her family scene! Barely laughable scene is, a bird poo at Kate face! At the end, Kate realize Tom actually already dead! She having feeling with Tom because Tom's organ inside her body! At the very end, Kate celebrate Christmas with her family and looking up at the sky as told by Tom! That's it! Another disappointed film by Paul Feig!"
412,"I honestly can't gush enough over this movie. It was funny, adorable, sweet and surprising. I will never be able to see it enough times. Not to mention that George Michaels songs are strung out throughout the whole movie. As a huge fan of his it made it that much better. I love the mess that Emilia Clarkes character is and the sweetness Henry Golding brings to his role. Go watch it!!"
413,"I Saw this yesterday on a whim because I had the day off and a Christmas movie with Emilia Clarke dressed as an elf on a Friday afternoon just seemed kind of nice. This is the first Paul Feig film I have seen. I had been interested in ""A Simple Favor"" but never got around to watching it, but this was to my surprise not too bad. It's a perfectly decent little Christmas movie, anchored by a wonderfully charismatic performance from Emilia Clarke. The biggest flaw is the plot twist, which you will see coming a mile away. It's just painfully obvious. Also it's really not a romantic comedy per say, it's a comedy-drama, but fairly light on sex or romance, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you're bored and want to get into the Christmas spirit, go see it. It kept my interest and didn't overstay its welcome"
414,"I love sloppy Christmas films, Love Actually, White Christmas and Wonderful Life are compulsory watching every year. I was hoping that this film would be number 4, mostly due to me being a George Michael fan.
Sadly Clarke's character is totally unlikable and her role was only semi-saved by the guy she met.
But could this film have been anymore 2019 politically correct? Everything was thrown into this one, a whole years supply of different genders, sexuality, mixed race relationships etc. There was more diversity in this film than I have experienced in my lifetime. Give it a rest people.
I cried at Frozen II, yeah middle aged man bawling at a cartoon, Last Christmas did not do this for me.."
415,"The real mystery is not the plot twist. The real mystery is, what happened to our expectations about movies to make so many people think they can easily find a ""better"" X-mas movie somewhere else, making it OK to give this one a low rating? For the last few decades, some 95% of all the X-mas movies produced have come from Canada, using basically the same actors and writers, and they do not even come close to this one. This is a real movie that engages and holds the attention, with real talent both in front of and behind the camera. Cmon people, follow the example of the main character in LAST XMAS, grow up."
416,"This movie doesn't claim to be something that it's not so i don't know what it has got so much flack. You don't go to see what is clearly a feel good Christmas movie and expect deep dimensional characters and a complex, thrilling plot. But at this time of year a feel good movie that tugs at your heart strings is welcomed. I love a serious drama but there is a place for this type of movie too. It was heartwarming, funny and thought provoking. I wasn't expecting the ending so it got me thinking. Emelia Clarke and Henry Golding are great in it. Emma Thomson's yugoslavian accent was quite impressive and it's nice to acknowledge politics without going into it so heavily, just showing its impact on people's lives and their children's lives.It's 100% worth a watch so ignore the critics and if you're a George Michael fan you'll flipping love it get yourself to the cinema how."
417,"I don't understand why it's getting bad reviews. I don't usually like Christmas movies but this was brilliant, so funny and good cast."
418,"I feel it was a nice kinda film, but i think it had to much forced agenda, on the bus there was no english, the only english in the film were homeless or telling the foregners on the bus to clear off out the country!! The english arnt really like that!! Its such a shame to portray the english as racist or homeless!!! But ye the film was ok to a degree"
419,The best romantic comedy since 4 Weddings. Highly recommended.
420,Such a mess of different subjects that don't need touching in a Christmas movie and one sided opinions by the terrible writing almost walked out. But the story isn't bad. Peace out
421,"Very good film , funny with a surprisingly sad twist"
422,Omg it was so worth it.funny..heartwarming..i cried at the end..but it had a rich meaning to it..luv luv luv it xx
423,"I am so glad I ignored the critics, it is a lovely feel good dramedy, a few tears, lots of laughs and a gorgeous soundtrack....enjoy it for what it is....no agenda and no virtue signalling....Hopefully you too will have a huge smile at the end of it."
424,"I was really looking forward to this film. The first 85% was awesome - funny, sweet, festive, poignant. The PC agenda was a bit tedious but I got over that with the rest of it being so awesome. Then the twist...seriously?! After a dreadful few weeks, I was looking forward to something to make me smile - some escapism - and this was just sad. It's a Christmas movie! It's supposed to be happy! Overall, just disappointing experience in the end :-("
425,"Last christmas is one cute film for couples to watch with solid twist but that doesnt save it for having cliches and repeting staff from past, films they should try to make something more different and the the finishing reseult would be better and also my opinion of it,but if you have someone to watch it give it a chance and ignore some staff and it will be good watch"
426,"I liked the Christmasy feel to the movie, I liked some of the characters and a twist in the movie, however, it left too much of a sad feel in the end, in my humble opinion. Plus, Emma Thompson could've learned better Croatian, Emilia Clarke's was much more convincing."
427,The story was obvious from the beginning nothing new about it
428,"Great fun, laughs a plenty a few tears and a generally heartwarming experience with extremely likeable leads and a perfect pace. Best Christmas film and Rom com in general for a good few years. A real must watch."
429,"Ok, so this movie is not going to win any oscars. Good romantic comedies are hard to find and this is definitely good. Well written, good acting, feel good, satisfying ending. Both my wife and I felt that we got our money's worth. I wish Hollywood made more like this."
430,"It's an ok film, but the plot twist is akin to something from the Lifetime Channel. As soon as you find out a little more about the protagonist, it's VERY obvious who the mysterious Tom is.That said, it has its charm and the characters are all very likeable. However, don't expect the songs of George Michael to be as integral to the film such as Bruce Springsteen for Blinded By The Light (2019) or The Beatles for Yesterday (2019).However, ""have some lesbian pudding"" is my favourite line out of all the 40+ films I've seen this year!"
431,"It made me laugh, cry and it was entertaining from start to finish, who cares if the dates are wrong and the accent is off ? It's a movie not a documentary. Emma Thompson's character was so funny everyone in the cinema was laughing and I am shocked at the bad reviews"
432,"Its FUN. Its FUNNY! ALL AGES - JUST GO SEE ITIf you want to escape the drudgery of day to day life you will. I work 6 days a week 12 hour days. This took my mind off of life. Its excellentEmilia Clarke is cast perfectly in the lead as Kate. And, Henry Golding is a Colin Firth of the movie and probably the future. The supporting cast are all brilliantEmilia portrayal is both convincing and incredibly amusing, and comes across as someone we've all known, fun, unpredictable, and a personal bad decision maker. Who we all can't stop caring about.The music is a constant and is excellent with various versions of well known songs that bring them a new life.The ending isn't predictable, and I think is perfect.
This ranks with the Bishop's Wife - Cary Grantand Its a Wonderful LifeMaybe some professional reviewers should stop taking there jobs so serious. They review everything as if each new movie is a direct challenge to Citizen Kane. And the reviews for Last Christmas are a prime example. There opinion amounts to nothing but bitterness at there own failures to make anything of themselves in theatre, film or the arts in general.Its a feel good movie, which I think we all need."
433,"I'm a male, retired and enjoying life. I make it a point to see one movie a week with a friend where we get to choose what we see every other week. Well I was taken to see Last Christmas this week and I rolled my eyes to my friend as she purchased the tickets.I figured I could put up with 90 minutes of a Lifetime type Holiday RomCom! I could at least enjoy my popcorn.I love movies and going to the cinema and consider myself a movie critic and buff to my family and friends.I have to tell you ... Last Christmas is an outstanding movie all the way around. Great acting, great directing, great cinematography and awesome supporting cast.
As the movie unfolded I could tell right away it was NOT a Holiday schmalzy type of Hallmark production.
The story was great and I was hooked after the first five minutes.Last Christmas will be a modern movie classic in the years to come. I will not give anything away because the twist towards the end had me and my friend gasping out loud when it happened - we didn't see it coming !!! I'm so glad I knew nothing about this film prior to watching it. I loved the way I just let the film take me on the journey it did.I get to choose next week what movie we see and I'm repeating Last Christmas. This time I'll look for clues and some foreshadowing I missed the first go around!See it!!! It's not a chic flic ... you won't be sorry !!"
434,It's Christmas early and it should be released again closer to Christmas! It's cheese mix with holiday love. I think it's a feel good movie with a great eulogy to George! It's a great thoughtful script from Emma and a I just loved it. Have an open heart and everything else falls into place. It will be a movie that will become a classic for Christmas.... loved it.
435,"There's a problem with this rom-com. It's short of leading characters. I mean, Emilia Clarke, has a wonderful character written down for her, and she does wonders as Katerina/Kate the girl on the path of self distruction. But she needs a counter part. It's going with the territory, one must have two for a tango and for a rom-com. Problem is, they couldn't write a complete, flesh and blood character to stand against her, so in a manner of speaking they chose the easy way out. You'll have to see the film to understand what I mean, but once you do, I'm sure you'll see I'm right. And it's a big problem here. Since romcom, is the last bastion of male chauvinism in cinema. The last place where male is still the knight in shining armour coming to save his damsel in distress. If the male character is incomplete, flat, you've got a solo tango. And no matter how you turn it, what we've got here is a tango for one. It does have wonderful backup roles. Especially so with Michelle Yeoh, and with Emma Thomson who might be the only one playing this cartoon of a mother and still pulling it off. Everybody else in this movie is so very professional, but no matter what, we're short of a second lead and I'm not sure whether any actor could build a character in this case with the given source material."
436,"There is always something about the Christmas time of the year that brings out the good will in movies. Somehow the monotonous television specials, the move theaters itself, and even the atmosphere are all given a renewed glow that seems to lighten us up. Yet, in a flooded market trying to capitalize on the big time of the season, we can sometimes get things crammed in that don't need to be crammed in. So in November at this early stage of the holiday months, getting a Christmas movie makes me wonder how the quality of the film will be if coming out this early. As always, Robbie K coming in to give you his thoughts on whether or not the movie will match what the trailers suggested it would be. As such, let's get started as I take a look into:Movie: Last Christmas (2019)
LIKES:Good Acting
Comedy That is Not Overdone
Fun and A good atmosphere
Good Message For The Times
Fast Run Time
The MusicDISLIKES:Predictable
Dryer Sense Of Humor Required
Needing More Time To Tell A Detailed Story
The Semi-Superficial Romance
The Overdone Ending
Lacking That Big Punch
SUMMARY:Let's face it, I was not the most excited seeing the trailer for this film, but I was hoping that there would be some Christmas magic to assist with bringing it to life. Well my wish came true in the form of acting, with all the leads making for an entertaining, dysfunctional group. Emelia Clark was of course my favorite, especially taking center stage, bringing the roundabout character of Kate! Henry Goulding's charm works to offset the theatrics of the supposed messy character, his calm level headedness bringing its own magic that lvies up to the theme of the movie. And as for Emma Thompson, well another new light for the woman who wears so many faces. Outside of the quaint characters with major flaws, Last Christmas attempts to find the means of being different while still sticking to its guns from the trailer. For those looking for a typical American based comedy, you're in for a surprise as the movie turns to British roots for a comedy style that is a bit drier and catered to a more finite audience. Despite not being the comedy line craziness that most are expecting, the movie maintains a fun atmosphere, capturing the meaning of the season and sort of infecting you in the Kate's journey with this strange man. This atmosphere of feeling good compliments all the previous mentioned likes and somehow gave me some energy to stay immersed in the film. Of course a Christmas movie has to have a good message right? Well, Last Christmas delivers its morale laden plot right in your face and manages to keep the time honored tradition in line with the movie without being too cheesy or over the top. Yet for me, the music is the key to why I had fun. Last Christmas does not saturate in the Christmas themes, but instead blends both traditional songs with some other tracks to keep things lighthearted and in rhythm with the messages. If all of this does not sound good and you are being forced to go on a date, the fast run time should keep you satiated and not lose too many minutes of your life.So let's get into things that people will most likely not like or expect. First off the movie is predictable. A fine attempt at a twist, I had the surprise figured out well before stepping foot into the movie (yes the trailers were that obvious). It's a fine attempt, but the bread crumbs were a little too traditional so I can't say I was moved like many of my fellow audience members. As stated earlier, you need to have a drier sense of humor, and while I appreciated the wit, at times a nice wet joke sequence could have helped lighten the mood a little more. Thus again, be warned this is not your average rom-com. While the time limit may be beneficial in terms of getting out of there, it also limited the detailed story I think most were looking for. Last Christmas held potential to balance all these elements it wanted, but like much of today's trends the stories were sort of rushed and irrelevant plot points were hastily tied up when not needing to be included. This included the semi-superficial romance that while cute and endearing at the beginning was also not the romance aspect I expected they would go, (there are many Hallmark movies that do better than this one). Again its sincere and a bit more sentimental, but it needed more time to get the full effect for me. When the ending does finally arrive, it finds almost the perfect place to stop, but then like the ending of Return of The King, the movie goes one step too far to show how things are going to be okay. This ending montage approach is nice to show the future, but about five minutes earlier would have been better for me. Finally, I think the thing most are hating is that the movie is lacking a big punch that Christmas movies need for the theater visit. This movie sort of lacks that and I think from some of the thing said by fellow audience members, I have to agree that it needs that final ounce of oomph to get to gold star status.The VERDICT:What you see in the trailer of Last Christmas is almost what you get with this film. The cast shows good chemistry and brings their bag of tricks to the mix to make for a fun cast of characters that I think will charm most. It's nice that a Christmas comedy managed to still have heart and fun, not overdoing the humor and giving me a film that had good life lessons and positive atmosphere to enjoy, with a fun accompanying sountrack. Still, the movie fails for me in terms of bringing that big Christmas punch that I expect from these films, suffering from superficial gimmicks, semi complete story lines, drier humor, and a relationship that is sentimental but not what I thought it would be. Overall, the movie is enjoyable with a group, but I think it would find a better home on Hallmark or a local streaming. However, if you are looking for a feel good Christmas movie this early, check this one out.My scores for its genre are:Christmast/Comedy/Drama/Romance: 8.0
Movie Overall: 5.5"
437,"My Review- Last Christmas my rating 6.5 /10There were a few moments in the first half of this movie when I thought I'm not going to like Last Christmas, one in particular when a very strange German suitor appears in Santa's (Michelle Yeoh's )Christmas shop but for me there were more likes than dislikes in Last Christmas.I just loved Emma Thompson's moments as Petra the over protective Bosnian mother to her problematical but loveable daughter Kate.
Kate of course played by Emilia Clarke would have to have deep psychological problems after bringing up 2 dragons and conquering 3 Kingdoms in Game of Thrones and she is a very versatile actress and good in comedy.I'm sure Last Christmas was a welcome and refreshing change from her Mother of Dragons past but as lovely as she is in this movie I just felt that her role was too large for a movie where she is rarely off screen and at times was irritating.I also enjoyed fellow Crazy Rich Asian star Henry Golding not being rude but his part could have been larger that's one problem I had too much Emilia and not enough of the good supporting roles.I would have liked more development of the other characters especially Michelle Yeoh and Kate's sister Maria ,one of the best scenes is the whole family reunited together and Mother Petra singing and I must find out her recipe for Lesbian Pudding.Emma Thompson wrote the story and screenplay and she is a very accomplished writer with The Further Tales of Peter Rabbit and Nanny McFee and Last Christmas has moments of great fun ,romance and sentimentality but not in the league of other British romantic comedies like Pride, Finding Yourself, Love Actually Notting Hill or Bridget Jones .I did like the surprise conclusion I wasn't expecting it quite clever and you'll have to see the movie to find out.I'm sure Last Christmas will get some negative reviews from critics and audiences too but if you like British contemporary comedy romance as opposed to American rom-com in your face brashness and I do you'll probably like this heartwarming average but well produced movie."
438,"Good movie with nice story but can you at least use googe search so you wont mix nations. War 1999, so it was Serbia bombing. But at the end of movie the say croatian and showing ortodox chruch at the begining.
I just hate lazy writers who cant evan use google search.."
439,"Ignore critics and listen to your fellow audience-members: this is a very enjoyable movie, and perfect for not only the holidays, but year-round. (Though the Christmas music sets the mood, George Michael's music is always a delight, and there's plenty of both.)I went into it knowing literally nothing about the story except a woman dressed up as a Christmas elf. Well, that's our lead character Kat, who has alienated everyone around her by being selfish, self-serving, and destructive to herself and everyone around her. Then she meets Tom.The story unfolds with charm and quiet strength, and a few surprises. Emma Thompson knows how to write a lovely, moving, and seemingly simple story - and every character in this movie matters."
440,"If ever a film deserved 10/10 stars, this is that film.Phenomenal acting from Emma Thompson, Henry Golding, and of course the treasure that is Emilia Clarke, who delights us and melts our hearts both on AND offscreen.Sheer brilliance of comedy combined with a profoundly emotive, moving, and memorable storyline, which will stick with you long after the credits have come up. (Especially due to the very Dickensian twist!)And above all, it will get you into the festive spirit like nobody's business, probably even if you're watching it in January.
I heartily disagree with all reviews stating this film is corny or mediocre: it resonated with me in a way I did not expect. I whole-heartedly recommend this."
441,"I'm glad I didn't see reviews before going! This was a delightfully different kind of holiday movie. It's not for young children, but we adults need more holiday movies anyway! The messages are solid, I laughed plenty, and I appreciated the departure from the usual. Highly recommend."
442,"I heard that Emma Thompson was making a movie based on the music of George Michael and Wham! months and months ago. The trailer for this movie looked like it could go on to become an instant Christmas classic, like a new Love Actually. But there were mixed reviews, but I chanced it anyway, written by Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Nanny McPhee, Bridget Jones's Baby), directed by Paul Feig (Grounded, Bridesmaids, Spy). Basically, Katarina ""Kate"" (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke) works a dead-end job as an elf at an all year round Christmas ornament shop in Central London. While at work she notices a man outside staring upwards. She initially shuns him, but they strike up a conversation, she learns his name is Tom (Crazy Rich Asians' Henry Golding). Kate has a habit of making bad decisions and has recently become homeless after being thrown out by her flatmate. She has aspirations to become a singer but is unsuccessful in her recent audition. Kate sees Tom again and they go for a walk, where he charms her with his bizarre observations of London. The next morning, she discovers that she forgot to lock up the shop, leading to a break-in. Her boss, referred to as ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh), is most disappointed in her, saying that she has changed from the charismatic and friendly person she used to be. Kate isolates herself and is forced to return to her parents' home. Yugoslavian immigrants, her mother, Petra (Emma Thompson), suffers from depression and her father, Ivan (Boris Isakovic), a former lawyer, now works as a taxi driver. Kate hates her mother, who cherishes her while ignoring her sister Marta (Lydia Leonard), a successful lawyer. Kate begins spending more time with Tom, who rides a bike and volunteers at a homeless shelter. She looks for Tom, who doesn't keep a phone, leaving it in the cupboard, and often disappears for days at a time. Kate was initially critiquing Tom for working at the homeless shelter, begins helping there in the hope of running into him, but the staff have never met him. While celebrating Marta's promotion, Kate inadvertently outs Marta as a lesbian in a long-term relationship. She then runs into Tom, who takes her back to his apartment. Kate reveals that a year earlier she was seriously ill and had to have a heart transplant. Kate says she feels half dead and questions whether she has the talent to make it as a performer. After opening up to Tom, Kate tries to initiate sex, but he declines. After spending the night with Tom, Kate starts to improve her life, taking care of her body, setting up Santa with a Danish man (Peter Mygind) who loves Christmas like she does, apologising to Marta and her girlfriend, and busking singing Christmas songs to raise money for the shelter. After a few days she runs into Tom again, but he shuts down the idea of a relationship, she walks away thinking he does not truly love her. Nevertheless, Kate continues to try to do good in her daily life. Later, wanting to make amends, Kate returns to Tom's apartment, but an estate agent reveals it is for sale, as the previous owner died in a bicycle accident a year ago. Finding his phone in the cupboard, Kate realises that Tom was the organ donor whose heart is now inside her, and that all their interactions were hallucinations. Kate returns to a small garden, she encounters Tom's ghost, he says his heart will always belong to her. Kate organises a Christmas talent show for the people at the shelter and invites all her friends, new and old, Santa and the Danish man and her entire family. Kate performs a solo the Wham! song ""Last Christmas"", during which flashbacks of her so-called ""encounters"" with Tom are seem, then the curtain raises, and she is joined by the band of performers. Later, Kate and the family celebrate Christmas together joined by Alba (Jade Anouka), Marta's girlfriend, for the first time. The Christmas celebrations end and it is summer, Kate is looking visibly healthier, sitting in the garden on a bench with a plaque with Tom's name and birth and death years. Kate is happy and smiles, and follows Tom's advice, to always look up. Also starring Patti LuPone as Joyce, Rebecca Root as Dr. Addis, Sue Perkins as Ice Show Director, Peter Serafinowicz as Theatre Producer, Rob Delaney as Theatre Director and Amit Shah as Andy. Clarke gives a charming performance and does have a nice singing voice, Golding is more strange than seductive as the mystery man, the chemistry between them isn't too bad. The lyrics ""last Christmas I gave you my heart"" are taken very literally, this is the main plot of the film, otherwise it is full of scenes with ""Heal the Pain"", ""Too Funky"", ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"", ""Fastlove"" and of course the title song playing in the background. Unfortunately, this film is a bit all over the place, the sentimental stuff is often hit and miss, the homelessness and charitable stuff sort of works, there a hilarious discussion of the difference between ""penis"" and ""dick"", otherwise most of the laughs are average, it is often odd and clichéd, and the ghost twist is daft, overall it is a predictable, silly and disappointing seasonal romantic comedy. Adequate!"
443,"I was expecting a lovely Rom-com Christmas film with the theme of George Michael songs, instead it seemed more like political propaganda with some Christmas and romance thrown in.Would have given it a 1/10 but gave it an extra mark because Emilia Clarke's performance was very good. I love Emma Thompson but saw in the credits she was very involved with this film and it's screenplay, so very disappointed in her.If I wanted to hear about the migrant issue I'd watch the news but as I live in the UK, I'm already well aware and didn't want it thrust down my throat at the cinema with the premise of a Christmas rom-com.Unfortunately it wasn't that funny either, there was only one moment where ~50% of the audience laughed. The romance part wasn't much better either.Left the cinema feeling disappointed, cheated and a little bit angry that a potentially nice Christmas film had turned into a vehicle for something else altogether. Just glad I didn't see it any closer to Christmas."
444,I am so 😞 that this movie was so plain and boring. Emilia is such a delightful actress and they wasted her in this Hallmark Christmas movie. It is barely a nice time. It wont be remembered as a Christmas classic.
445,"This movie is a great little Christmas movie. Emma Thompson is great as always and has created a great movie.
The story is heartwarming and have a delightful balance.
Emilia Clarke is wonderful and has in my opinion a great talent.
I guessed the twist before it was reviled but it didn't spoiled the rest of the movie. There is so many supporting actors and actresses. I will definitely make this apart of my Christmas movie collection.
If you want a movie with a good story, a lovely entertaining cast and a good soundtrack thesis's Christmas movie for you."
446,"I wasn't bothered about seeing this but it was all that was on at the local cinema whilst away. I'm so glad it was as this is a great movie. I love the story and good cast therefore some actual acting not too cheesy and some lol moments.
It's a must at Xmas time as nice scenery of London at Christmas time.
Give it a go honestly if you liked love actually and the other typical British movies you will love this."
447,"Last Christmas, I give you my heart 🎵 the song is literally and perfectly defined the movie 😭 a perfect romcom in the season of the year and I was so touched by it 😢 The think I learn is we are all so lucky to be alive, don't waste every moment. Just live and appreciate it."
448,This one is really for family to watch....it shows what happened in the family's relationship....it's really good this one...the story is wonderful ....... what we do is do good things to others then we will be happy .....
449,"Last Christmas is not your typical Christmas movie with some of your typical Christmas moments with a twist. Emilia Clarke has done an amazing job at portraying her character with some health and life challenges before something unexpected happens to her characters life for it to change completely. Love this movie totally gets you in the Christmas mood even though the film has a lot of adult humour, therefore it is not your typical Christmas movie it is truly hilarious masterpiece with lots of ups and downs with plot twists along the way leaving you overall emotional and euphoria."
450,"I so desperately wanted to like this movie. I'm a huge Christmas nut, I absolutely adore Emelia and love George Michael but WHAT A PILE OF RUBBISH!! Where to start with this hot mess?!1 - It's a Christmas movie, why on earth did they confuse it by adding a political agenda with no clue which angle it was supposed to be headed in?! What was the point in adding the Yogosalavian/Croation element other than to prove Emma Thompson can do an accent? It was factually incorrect, confused the story, confused the viewer and generally just added bitterness to what could have been an ok movie2 - Due to previous point, they then had no time to develop the actual storyline and rushed the ending so quick I can't even remember what happened and I watched it yesterday3 - The plot 'twist' was obvious from the start, how anyone didn't guess it is beyond me. So we all expected it but they could have done it better...made it more sentimental, given them more screen time4 - Kate's God awful sister was a terrible person full of bitterness and hatred. To give her character a complete turnaround needed more time and development, not a bottle of champagne on a doorstep and suddenly she's singing Christmas carols5 - Was it supposed to be a comedy? Or a political movie (the whole Brexit 'you lot go back to your country' bus scene and the bi-racial homosexual angle and how this is accepted in other cultures). These are serious political matters, perhaps not best tackled in a 30 second scene during a Christmas movie. I don't remember laughing once now that I think about it so perhaps it wasn't a romantic comedy after all?!6 - Did anyone else notice that even Emelia's gigantic and usually captivating smile couldn't hide how much she just was not committed to this?!I could go on but you get the point. Go see it because it's Christmas but don't expect a lot. And you'll be ok to take a nap during the movie too."
451,"The writing is witty and fun but also deep and meaningful.
The acting of the entire cast is on point.I would like to mention Emila Clark's performance specifically - as someone who only knows her as Khaleesee (and the Solo a Star Wars story role she did...) - she totally disappeared into the role for me. I forgot that she WAS Khaleesee and I got sucked in completely into the movie. She is an AMAZING actress with the right material to work with.The premise is interesting to watch and the executions of the plot twists are done right and with an emotional impact on the viewer.Love this movie."
452,"After doing Game of thrones web series,emilia clarke has prove again that her acting is so good game of thornes, but after watching the trailer we can expect that her acting will also be good in this movie.so from the trailer we found that her family forced her to get a boyfriend but he don't want a boyfriend as bcoz she dont love anyone but suddenly she fell in love with henry goulding as we seen in the trailer but he also fell in love with her.so this movie will show the jouney how will they live together and understanding between them."
453,"Is this a good film? No
Did it make me feel Christmassy? YesAll of the bad reviews on here are 100% true.Not only did it manage to awkwardly squeeze in every single minority in Britain (not complaining), but It did seem to piss off ALOT of Croatians / Yugoslavians. You can't please everyone.I didn't want to kill myself after this movie, but would I watch it again? Probably not"
454,"Really great movie, which completly surprised me! I was expecting a feel good christmas movie.. that's not what this is. I think that might be the reason why it hasn't recieved a higher rating. The movietitle and the marketing is wrong I think."
455,I've seen many Christmas films over the years and this is one of the better ones. It's got some genuinely funny moments. It's overall message is that we should all be nicer to each other which I suppose is a decent Christmas ambition.
456,"My hubby doesn't care a great deal for Christmas films but we settled down to watch this because the choice of films on Sky Movies is often abysmally samey-samey or unacceptably violent for most of the time, and this was the least of all evils. Although it started out seeming rather bland, and I couldn't help seeing Daenerys Targaryan in elf's uniform every time I looked at the lovely Emilia Clarke, I soon warmed to it, especially on experiencing Emma Thompson's superb, realistic and endearing portrayal of her Eastern European mother. It just got better and better as the story unfolded, engrossing and with superb acting by all and a twist in the tail, a movie great in my opinion."
457,"I never review anything, but I was completely surprised and touched by this movie. Don't be discouraged by the weirdly low rating, this movie is definitely worth a watch!"
458,"The best Christmas movie in a long time! 1st time watching it, it made me goosebump! It has such a powerful moment that just makes you shiver! It's happy, got an amazing story! I love it!!"
459,"I cried con this movie , the plot twist was soo great , it's a very good movie"
460,I loved everything about this movie! I'm surprised at the rating it's getting.
461,"Enjoyed every minute of this film, great acting, great music, lovely story.
A little different from the run of the mill christmas film, romantic but not corny, and funny but not slap stick. Think even my partner would have liked it and he hates romantic christmas films. So think i might just have to watch it again with him."
462,"I love Christmas movies, I love romantic comedies, I love Paul Feig, I love George Michael's songs and I love Emilia Clarke. But I just watched ""Last Christmas"" on Sky Movies and I feel like kicking the TV screen in. The final twist becomes obvious about 20 minutes in, which leaves us twiddling our thumbs for over an hour without a decent joke or a properly realised character to keep us company. You can combine all the promising ingredients you want, but if the script is rubbish the film will be rubbish, and this one could have been written by a bot. Emma Thomson should hang her head in shame."
463,"It's very unclear whether the movie is a romantic comedy, a drama or just a mumbo jumbo of everything badly mixed. And it's shocking to see near to zero chemistry between the two protagonists and I found it quite hard to feel any sympathy for the main character who displays quite unrealistic personal traits..."
464,"I love this movie. I've seen it three times, and it gets better every time.Because I know what everything means, and what's going to happen, I start crying when important scenes take place.Emilia is gorgeous, so is Henry Golding.I must admit, I hated Emilia's character a little bit in the beginning, being so irresponsible, and a simple tiny thing like her banging her suitcase into the paint of the wood of the door of her work, and chipping the paint made me growl with anger - but she earns it all back near the end of the movie.The soundtrack of this great movie is one of the best you'll hear in years, and DARN, but Emilia can SING!!Emilia is such a pleasure to look at. The movie may make you so happy at the end, and I normally HATE any Christmacy movie - but this is a joy.And TRUST ME - this movie gets better every time you see it."
465,Not normally one for Xmas movies but this was an absolute gem of a movie. Lighthearted throughout and had me in tears by the end.
466,Movie was delightful. Dialogue was fast paced and humorous.
467,"Ok so, from the outset we know something is up...what that is, we have no clue, but we are led to believe this movie will eventually prove to be a cinematic effort with a bit of substance...
Oh hell no!
Tom is not quite right...something about him is just...fishy...
anyway, Emilia is pretty cute in a Elfish sort of way, Michelle Yeoh is worth watching, Emma T. has gotten playing the hag down pretty good, but overall, we realize, this thing is a very preachy social justice statement covering a broad range of left wing babbling talking points, and WELL before the end we are jsut fed up with it.
We stayed to the end, as we were just too lazy to switch it over to AccuWeather and see what the weather is going to be like in the High Desert tomorrow, which is infinetly more interesting than anything about this turkey.
Future Note to the woman in my life who watches movies based simply on the Title and does not bother to read a review or synopsis or see who wrote it or is in it: Get your own TV and don't touch my remote EVER again.
EVER!
Anything that the Hag known as Emma T is involved in is going to be a social justice statement and not entertaining at all.
At All.
Nuff Said.
And (the guy is a ghost)

468,"There's no doubt that it means well, with this Emma Thompson penned and George Michael inspired feel-good effort always having its heart in the right place but its overtly sappy and almost too clean feel makes Last Christmas a wannabe Love Actually like yuletide classic that never truly gives off that special Xmas cheer.Curiously directed by Paul Feig, who really dials things back from what you'd expect from the man behind Bridesmaids and Spy, Christmas tells one of those too good to be true like love stories and finding oneself drama's as it focuses on Emilia Clarke's ditzy but kind-hearted struggler Kate, who finds potential love and direction in her budding friendship with Henry Goulding's mysterious Tom in the lead up to a wintery U.K festive season.Everything about Christmas feels fairly familiar, with both Kate and Tom cut well and truly from the cloth of movie romantic tropes but the chemistry between Feig's two leads never heats up proceedings and his cast and Thompson and Bryony Kimmings script ticks off a series of predictable boxes that not even a supposed twist finale can help overcome.Instead of creating its own world and own vibe, Christmas feels constantly like its playing the easy game with its storytelling and delivery and while usually Feig is accustomed to delivering some very funny cinematic moments, Christmas is devoid of any standout moments of comedy genius as it trudges along its way through a procession of movements and scenarios that aren't going to be surprising anybody that's ever seen such a film.With this being the case, there was an extra load of pressure on Clarke and Goulding to push things up a notch but they're not given a lot to work with here with both Kate and Tom relatively so-so lead characters that don't do a lot to make us want to invest our emotions in them, even if the film seems intent on trying to wring out some unworthy emotions come the latter stages.Christmas isn't a terrible film and for what it is its most certainly watchable but with its underused foundation in George Michael's back catalogue and with an overall sense of blandness and acceptance of just being another member of the pack, you can't help but feel as though there's no real reason to recommended that anyone spend their quality time in this particular adventure.Final Say -A calmer Paul Feig gives Last Christmas a professional edge but its so-so story, weak chemistry between its leads and generic procession ensures it's not even close to becoming the new festive classic it clearly wanted to be.2 narrow alleyways out of 5"
469,"Yes, you have a point: You can't rate a Christmas film at the same grade that the films competing for the Oscars. Sure. But a Christmas film is not a blanck check to put togheter some typical festive motives and tie it with a nice knot. There has to be more, not only a story that transports the protagonist from the wrong place (heart speaking, literally) to the one where he/she reconnects with himself/herself. And byt the way, poor Emma Thompson, I know you can not be a top performer in each film, but the director shoudn't waste a precious resource.By the way, it's a nice film to cuddle with someone you love, that's true, so enjoy the film, but more importantly, enjoy the company."
470,"A surprisingly clever, funny, and charming flick- Last Christmas hits its heartfelt moments tenderly in all the right ways, even with providing some small funny moments throughout. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are by far the standouts in the film, providing some truly great chemistry and poignant performances in the film. The acting is just one surprise of many in the film, as it is often clever with it's writing and progression of the story taken forward. The film does have a bit of an issue with editing, but nothing that ruins the film in a whole. It also is a bit corny and formulaic at times, providing typical tropes seen in movies of a similar nature, that just feel out of place, and if not, just plan obvious. However, the film is able to turn itself around from these remarks and become something truly special, and by all means heartwarming. The film is purely enjoyable, at times surprisingly inspiring, and full of an absolutely wonderful soundtrack of tunes from the legendary George Michael. In the end, Last Christmas surpassed my expectations on every account, and proves to be more than just a christmas romance film in all the right ways.
My Rating: 9/10"
471,This film didn't really hold my attention and if it wasn't for the unexpected event it would be scored even lower.I openly cringed on several occasions when they needlessly brought Brexit into it and implied that Brits hate foreigners.It doesn't help that in her personal life Emma Thomson is an outspoken anti Brexit campaigner.
472,"Wow, this movie was painful. It's horrible. Forced quirkiness. Zero chemistry. Stilted dialogue delivered with all the precision of a deafened adderall binge.I like Emilia Clarke on Game of Thrones, but she was a poor casting choice here, and her comedic chops are just not there.The plot? There is none. Girl meets guy. Guy kind of stalks girl. They walk around and point at things. She has no goals or obstacles. There are no stakes. There is no structure. And Don't even get me started on the twist.I'm a big fan of Paul Feig, Freaks and Geeks being my favorite series, and have never seen a Paul Feig directed comedy that hasn't had me laughing out loud ie: Bridesmaids, Spy, The Heat. But after the spectacular Comedy / Thriller, A Simple Favor, I really thought he had become a master of comedy enough to fuse it with historically incompatible genres with surgical precision. But this was disposable hallmark quality garbage. The script is the biggest issue here, but the performances are so wonky, I can't help but wonder if he was even on set when he ""directed"" this film. What the hell Paul!?Anyways, BOTTOM LINE - If you enjoy hallmark style ""christmas movie of the week"" type films with absurd plots and bad casting, then this is that with a much bigger budget and lots of
George Michael music. Everyone else, this is no Bridesmaids or even Notting Hill for that matter."
473,"Ever since Crazy Rich Asians I've had a huge crush on Henry Golding and I adore Emilia Clarke so I was excited to watch this. Katarina/Kate was such an immature, selfish character that I was rooting for her demise. She's ashamed of her ancestry, lives recklessly with little regard for her health or safety and feels sorry for herself. I was so annoyed by her attitude then the big surprise comes and I was furious. A better ending would've been if she met and fell in love with Tom, she needed a transplant and he died and then she got his heart."
474,"It could've been a really nice movie. It's not too cheesy, not too Christmasy even and has great plot twist. But I just don't get why they had to make Kate's family Eastern European immigrants. It seemed totally unnecessary for the story but I guess if they had to make it they could've done a better job. Were they Serbian? Croatian? What Yugoslavia in 1999? What war? They didn't bother to check a single fact.And I love Emma Thompson but why would you have like the most British actress play a Balkan mother? Her fake accent, her whole character - it was just offensive.I liked Henry Golding though."
475,"I knew that Emma Thompson wouldn't just have made a simple romantic comedy ...and she didn't ! It was so meaningful ...so many messages ...i haven't cried that much since Billy Elliot ! Must see ...and especially if you are in a ""weird place"" in your life !"
476,"Emilia Clark is so talented. And the movie has a great message. Plus George Michael 's music . It's a really touching story about family , love and the choices we make"
477,"Sadly, Emilia Clarke hasn't been in very many films (yet). I remember watching Me Before You and thought she was perfect for that type of role. Well, here we have Last Christmas and I think she is perfection again. Let's be clear, the film itself isn't perfect, but there is more than enough good to make you forgive the bad.Emilia has always struck me as being 100% present and engaged in her performances, including those world famous eyebrows! She really carries the film, although everyone else does a surprisingly great job as well.Anyway, for sure worth a watch and I enjoyed this film far more than any of the blockbuster junk that's come out recently..."
478,"Omg this movie made me feel a lot of emotions,Sad, angry, happy, laughter and quite a bunch of goosebumps along the way.I am not really a fan of drama movies but this one certainly fits the bill.The movie is happening, with clear story to tell and almost everything in the movie was well put up and there's no really anything that will be wandering in your mind after watching it.You will fill enjoyment and satisfaction. At least I felt it that way.I'll be honest I was watching it because of Emilia Clarke promotional vids on Youtube where she explains its not the typical movie of this genre. And I am a fan of her lovable acting and beautiful smile.Such a happy pill to swallow when watching her in action.Certainly would recommend it to other people.My honest rating is a solid 7 but if I'm being generous I would give it a 7.5.Absolute masterpiece"
479,"Enjoy the film and don't over analyse the small details. If at the end you don't have a tear then sure, give the film a 5 or lower, you are not human so who cares about your rating.I found it really sweet and a good Christmas Romance movie. The theme has been done before, I realised what was happening, just before it was explained, because of a great film from 1999. Anyhow, no spoilers here, enjoy the film for what it is. No need to dig too deep. It is a find yourself, romance, enjoy life and don't miss what you have in front of you film.As a separate note, seriously if they got Yugoslavian details wrong who cares. If we rated down every film that got Eastern European language/details or general stuff wrong we wouldn't have anything to watch. Especially fantasy vampire films:))"
480,"What a great feel good movies, it's just makes me feel happy plus the music is absolutely brilliant by George Michael 👏👏👏👏"
481,"Kinda boring the first 50 minutes. I know it's long but I skipped a few parts and near the end it really gets better. Wait for it and it will definitely surprise you. If it didn't end the way it did, I would give it a 4. But now it's a solid 7 ..."
482,It made me cry sooooo much! Really touched me. It was way deeper than I expected it to be. I was very pleasantly surprised. Way better than all the other rom coms out there. It actually taught me lessons that I can apply in my real life. It told me what I needed to hear at this stage in my life. Thank you thank you thank you!
483,"I almost made the mistake not watching this move. I can say that it is a very good one. It's not a typical romantic Christmas candy movie. Surprise is the word I would use. The movie has a simple story line, but that's the good about it. Simple and surprising."
484,Its a very nice and lovely movie with a lovely actor emilia and i like the iran flag in the park secen😆
485,It's like a dream in those cold nights but you still have that place which warmth your heart
486,The film is very interesting and contains a deep message. The end of the film is great .. Thank you
487,"Dont listen to bad reviews, treat yourself to a wholesome feel good, funny holiday movie. An impressive story that will make even the coldest of us think about ourselves. Emilia clarke plats such a wonderfully complex character and by that I mean she plays her outstandingly well also. Emma thompson is so funny as the slightly crazy mother to Emilia's character who herself us a little cooky. Watch out for Emilia's singing too which is yet another highlight.
Not only that but a stunning unseen twist makes this film a real tear jerker and one you will remember."
488,"OK so it's time to review this. all first go how are the first second and 3rd act. so the first time it was intriguing just met Kate or Katarina either way the same thing. So we basically meet her she's messages working as an elf and selling Christmas themed presents and toys and stuff. So the first act it is good it set up one part of the story and from there we move on to the second and 3rd act. 1 second deck was more or less the same as every other romance film: yeah everything is great and stuff and then we have the basically dark night of the soul which is the emotional downfall essentially. and after that we will talk about that later and we get the 3rd act which is a good end to the story I would say. OK so let's talk pros -- the mean essential story is very well thought out I would say. the first 30 minutes or so were funny and the next our it was just normal romance film. So one of the things that influenced my rating was the twist at the end of the second act and the beginning of the 3rd act -- And that was the guy that she supposedly was ""seeing"" both literally and figuratively was actually a hallucination because she had transplant surgery and she got the heart from Tom guy she was supposedly seeing let say. And that's the thing the pros boosted my rating. I mean if I watched it more carefully I'm probably picked up so far along the way and probably soon that's how it's gonna happen but if you watch it at midnight then you're just watching it, but that's besides the point. So as someone who is from Croatia my first 30 seconds we're just like God Jesus Christ who wrote this s***, as I saw 1999 Yugoslavia -- at this point I was just like you ""get your facts straight"". Now just one more cons and then we gonna go to characters. press I would say it's not that much of a as it actually is and that is they put a lot of feminist s*** and a lot of PC bulls*** into the movie, We got lucky and that didn't affect the core story just some random aspects of it nothing too major. OK so now let's talk some characters -- 1st we have Emilia Clarke's character -- she played the girl from the start of the film Kate, she starts the film distressed and everything and her character for the first part of the movies was silly and funny and then the second part is got full dark and not so funny nor happy. I mean at the end the movie ends kind of tragically but at the same way happy. Tom's character and from the beginning of the film he seem kind of off and at the end we find out why, but all in all his character was more supporting ten main. So we find out they are a family from Croatia. And the casting choice for more or less everyone except for her mother was great more or less. Her mother really annoyed me -- She couldn't even speak proper English like everyone else in their family despite the thing today lived there for 20 years more or less. And on the other hand she had a Russian accent, she didn't speak any normal Croatian just some weird words and mixture of other similar countries that she didn't even get right so I think if they could have found someone like Kate's father that can speak with normal accent and normal Croatian. I don't see why it was so hard to find someone for her mother that can do the same. It is probably for some agenda or something or she could be an executive producer or something, I don't know. OK and now some final thoughts -- so first of all kudos to Emilia Clark for learning Croatian words. And I just don't get how this movie's a PG13 and not R rated with all this sweating at the dining table somewhere in the second act, it's had more s**** and d**** said then in any other PG13 movie, so that's that. And also I just can't figure out why they got so many facts wrong specially the one at the beginning of the film literally the first 30 seconds. So when you look on overall film, just looking at the main plot and the main characters, that was great, but the other plot points that are really s*** and I'm glad that none of the political stuff was involved in the main story. Overall I think I'm being too generous by giving it 7/10 but if we're just looking for the main stuff(Characters and story) and put all the back story about her family a side I say it's alright not the best, but alright."
489,"Such a beautiful story with a fabulous cast. Unfortunately just a few seconds into the trailer it was obvious how the story would unfold.Tom is only seen by her, always wears the same outfit, cycles in London (duh) and his place looks pretty empty. It was just too obvious that he was dead..."
490,"I actually liked the homage to George Michael. The casting was excellent, and I really liked Henry Goulding's acting. Admittedly I know very little of Croatian history, which seems to set off a few viewers.The story isn't your typical boy meets girl and falls in love forever after. You will love the movie if you don't want the already known happy ending. It's on my list to buy."
491,It's absolutely fantastic and I really like the ending.Highly recommended!!
492,"This film is an obvious attempt at delivering another *Love Actually* around Christmas.. the only problem is: It's not Love Actually.. it doesn't have the parade of famous actors.. the humour and dialogue is not as good (why do they use the word 'dissimilar' so much? - at least 2 or 3 times on different occasions).Since i'm originally from the Balkans, i very much liked the refugee angle..
I like how they chose Yugoslavia as the country of origin for the main character, but i'm a little disappointed she didn't put in as much effort as Mrs. Thompson language-wise. Apart from the lullaby, Thompson pretty much nailed everything .. from the pronunciation to the portrayal of the mother (reminded me of my mom, in lots of ways). I have always (since the early 90s) been impressed by her talent and acting ability. I'd go as far as saying that she's pretty much in the same league as Streep and other actresses who enjoy seniority (Dench etc.).Michelle Yeoh as Santa was a surprise.. i very much like her in the role.. very versatile actress as well.Other than that i cannot really say too many good (or great) things about the film. It's another rom-com with an undeniable Christmas theme.. it's very enjoyable.. no doubt about that.. i would give it a clean 6 out of 10 if it weren't for
Thompson and Yeoh.. their performances/appearances kick it to a 6.8 for me.. that's how good i thought they were.."
493,"Pretty silly mashup of Christmas, romance and homeless people. At least ending explains some of it.+ Emilia Clarke in elf costume
+ Emilia Clarke swearing in Croatian etc. other things Emilia does
+ Ending has a turning point I haven't seen to be used before in romantic movies"
494,"I got emotionally exhausted. Tears all over.
Top acting, casting, script."
495,"I'm not sure why the movie didn't receive high ratings? Is it because it doesn't have a happy ending?
I watched the movie to soak into the Christmas feeling in London and didn't expect there's a plot twist. The unexpected plot makes the movie very interesting. Not the usual sugar coated romance movie. Really enjoyable."
496,Heard mixed reviews about the movie and decided to go and watch it in the end. A combination of cheesy and emotional feelings. Really enjoyed it.
497,"T is worth seeing. It almost went unnoticed in the cinema, but it is a very good light film. I loved it"
498,"Last Christmas has a lot of plot elements, but at the heart of the story is where its strength lies. it is not just a cliche holiday movie , this does something different that literally broke my heart. Still crying bout this beautiful films."
499,"I was expecting cheesy romance, but it was nice comedy/romance movie."
500,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I'm not the biggest fan of straight-up romantic comedies (rom-coms). I don't think I absolutely love a film from this genre, and if I do, it probably doesn't solely belong to the rom-com's list (they could also be musicals, dramas, etc). Most of the times, I appreciate them enough to feel fulfilled. Very rarely, I feel totally disappointed or with a hate feeling towards one. Paul Feig delivered a couple of great comedies during his career (Bridesmaids, Spy), and the underrated/overlooked A Simple Favor, which I enjoyed very much. With Emma Thompson (Adelia) as both supporting actress and screenwriter, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as protagonists, Last Christmas grew on me in the week of its premiere, making me genuinely excited for its session.This Christmas' movie sort of falls in the middle. I don't exactly ""like"" it that much, but I still left the theater happy and reasonably entertained. It actually possesses a dramatic tone deep within, but it never fully explores it, maintaining the lighthearted and festive vibe throughout most of its runtime. Clarke and Golding share amazing chemistry, and their scenes are very romantic, sweet, and emotional. However, it's more of the same. Last Christmas doesn't bring anything new since it follows the same cliches every other rom-com does.Its only bold and different take on the story is a plot twist that raises too many logical questions. Instead of carrying an emotionally powerful impact, it merely delivers an initial shock that goes away once people start to really think about it. Nevertheless, I praise this storytelling choice. It's never easy to pull off a twist, but the truth is that if Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings didn't take this missed shot, I wouldn't have spent the whole trip back home thinking about the film. I would have probably forgotten it as soon as I got into the car. So, congrats on trying something different, even if it didn't quite work for me.Thompson ultimately shines as Kate's mom, though. No missteps here. She's hilarious, and she has some of the funniest lines of the whole thing. Michelle Yeoh (Santa) also has a couple of fun moments, but her subplot feels a bit strained. Emilia Clarke incorporates the clumsiness and awkwardness of her character seamlessly. If you're familiar with Clarke's interviews and public persona, then you know that Kate is basically the over-the-top reflection of Clarke. Despite her lack of luck, she's still charming and a good person that went through a traumatic event that changed her life (duh). Golding is glamorous and perfect as expected, especially since his character needed precisely these attributes.Their relationship grows in a not-so-realistic way, and while this might be justified by the last act's twist, other plot points are not. My main issue with the movie is really those last 20 minutes. In addition to the twist, every single subplot is closed like nothing happened. From a particular family situation regarding sexual orientation to Yeoh's entire side story, all are either solved off-screen or way too easily. It's a rollercoaster of good and bad writing decisions. It has a couple of exciting downwards slopes and tight turns, but most of it is a slow ride with nothing truly thrilling or astonishing.Last Christmas tries to be ""the next big thing"" concerning Christmas classics, but it falls short of its goal. Boasting a fantastic cast, with two charming, compelling leads in Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, Paul Feig delivers a lighthearted, festive film, but stuffed with cliches and a twist that doesn't quite work. Emma Thompson shines as a supporting character but has some missteps in co-writing the story with Bryony Kimmings, showing significant struggles in tying up the loose threads left by the side stories. Despite its storytelling issues, it's a flick I recommend to anyone who loves seasonal movies with a beautiful message, some fun moments, and a score packed with our favorite George Michael's songs."
501,Not a lot of substance to the story and most of the plot is pretty random. Decent acting from Emilia Clarke helps you power through and Emma Thompson just steals the show. Good for a laugh but would definitely wait for the dvd.
502,"Yes it's predictable, but c'mon it's a Christmas movie they're always predictable. It's got such a sweet, heartfelt message, and is incredibly funny at times. Definitely worth a watch."
503,"I loved how this movie took it's original idea of a cheerful colorful Christmas film and put in some important issues that are happening in the world and the sadness and fear that some people feel even around the most cheerful time of the year, I was actually surprised to see how smoothly that went without making anyone defensive or uncomfortable it's not just a normal Christmas cringey film it's more than that, I highly recommend it, just watch closely."
504,"I'm a GRINCH, my daughter is an ELF, and we both loved this movie! Confession: Love Paul Fieg movies and LOVE Emma Thompson, but they had me at George Michael.
Lovely and Charming, with strong funny performances from 3 actresses - and the lead actor - the Xmas lighting and visuals were sumptuous. Take your mates, take your Mum, take your daughter/gal pals and just enjoy.
Grinch or Elf, this is a must-see and ""see-every-Xmas"" movie."
505,Typical Christmas romcom. Thought it was good but typical Emma Thompson using it as an opportunity to knock Brexit
506,This is such a cute Christmas film. Didn't expect the unexpected twist towards the end. Will make you laugh and shed a tear. Reminds you to be kind and be grateful for what you have.
507,"It was a very touching story. Even my partner had tears in his eyes. It was fun and touching! As soon it's out on dvd, am gonna buy it 😍"
508,"The movie may appear to be cliched, but the film is so far beyond what the trailers made it look. Also a great tribute to the late singer George Michael, a good portion of his songs are playing through out.Kate(Emilia Clarke) has become a train wreck, after a heath scare a year ago, her family life is gone crazy. And her job is also going down, and during the time of Christmas. And things start to change when she meets Tom(Henry Golding), a handsome nice guy who tries to take her out of her misery, but is he too good to be true?
I really like the way the film was not trying to be predicable, I mean you think it's going in one direction, and it surprises you. There is a twist, which I won't reveal, although I kind of saw coming. Emilia Clarke does shine has Kate, scenes you like her even though at times you're not supposed to like her, but you can't help but like her. Henry Golding is also quite charming, his scenes with Clarke, are quite joyful to watch. Michelle Yeoh is also good. A well made comedy drama Christmas movie."
509,"This is quite a joyous little Christmas film with an interesting twist at the end and a gentle reminder for us to consider those less fortunate at this time of year. Emilia Clarke carries off her role as a slightly self-destructive elf quite charismatically - though the script is a touch wordy at times. Emma Thompson and Michelle Yeoh steal their scenes and the Wham/George Michael soundtrack adds a soupçon of nostalgia to the proceedings. The hero is, however, a bit of a drip. Easy on the eye, but he is still a bit of a wet blanket. That said, they all look like they had fun making this, and that does come across. At any other time of year, I probably wouldn't recommend this at a cinema, but it does put a smile on your face so go on, give it a go!"
510,"The plot and story, everything has been told already.However, it pisses me off that they got everything related to their roots wrong. First of all, they mentioned they are Croats. The movie begins with her singing im Churc in Yugoslavia 1999 and Emma Thompson mentions later they moved becausw of the war. In 1999, Croatia was not part of Yugoslavia any more! Afterwards, when Kate screams KGB to her mother to scares her ??? It was security agency in Soviet Union. Again, nothing to do with war and her trauma from Croatia. IT IS NOT SO HARD TO GOOGLE THIS OR I DON'T KNOW... MAYBE READ A BOOK OR ASK SOMEONE. And last but not least, the ""old croatian song"" they sing at the end - not at all Croatian. Maybe Polish or Russian. So to conclude, very badly managed, history was shown wrong and they mixed all Eastern countries."
511,"An average movie , saved only, almost, by the likeability of it's stars. A pretty gruesome script, not quite sure whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, and largely failing at both, maybe it was just an excuse to use some songs by someone called George Michael on the soundtrack, harmless enough I suppose if you want to kill an hour and a half, but can't see it being remembered as one of the classics!"
512,I loved this movie. If you liked Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill you will love this. See it soon and avoid any reviews with spoilers.
513,"Finally a lovely movie with excellent Music, many emotions, humor and a message for our life without violence and sex scenes. Well done!"
514,"Oh my word you can tell Emma Thompson wrote this...2 scenes that are blatantly pro Remain..... then the ""twist"".... seen it so many times....Fight club, the 6 sense... could have been great..... but it wasn't."
515,"If you wanted to put croatian in a movie, you should put croatian, not combination of serbian, macedonian, english.. actually, the smallest part was real croatian..
also, war ended up in 1995 and yugoslavia did not exist in 1999.. why would they leave Croatia because of the war 4 years after it ended?except that croatian part, the movie is really great and in some parts funny."
516,"It was a good movie! Even my husband, who does not like romantic movies, liked it. It was funny, cute, and kept me on my toes. Emilia Clarke was adorable and did a great job! It wasn't too sappy, pretty clean, and not completely focused on sex. Really was a cute movie!! Go see it!"
517,"Went to see this one with 5 persons. Due to the unexpected twist at the end the results of the jury: one cried, one fell asleep, 3x a 7 (the girls), 2x a 6.
The main character Kate can get on your nerves at times as she plays her role like a teen that lacks attention. But, London at Christmas time around Covent Garden, a charity ball for the homeless, newly found family luck for Kate's war affected family and the main treat: the outcome of the real nature of Kate's relationship with Tom (I'm not gonna spoil that one here) make it worth to go and visit. If you have a romantic nature, that is. Otherwise you're better of watching Terminator."
518,"Last Christmas is a Christmas tale with an out-of-place musical hook that works better than it should. For a film that hinges much of its story on a single Christmas song, I found myself unexpectedly moved by it. It has a touching story about doing good for others, which we're all capable of, and not letting hardship keep you from reaching your full potential.Kate (Emilia Clarke) finds her life at a standstill, mostly homeless and frequently drunk with a loss of ambition or drive. She is about to get fired from her job as an elf at a Christmas-themed store when she meets the jovial, yet mysterious Tom (Henry Golding), who helps usher her into a new era of her life. Kate begins to help those she has done wrong and view the world in a more positive light as the Christmas holiday draws near.Emilia Clarke gives a surprisingly layered performance as Kate. Her character is written fairly blandly, but Clark gives it depth when the screenplay doesn't. Henry Golding plays Tom with exuberance and energy. His thoughtful approach to life makes him a nice foil to Kate's blatant cynicism. Emma Thompson puts on a Slavic accent in a scene-stealing comedic performance as Kate's painfully honest and worrisome mother. There are some moments in this film that are painfully reminiscent of other films in the rom-com lexicon, but there's a consistent charm here throughout, more earnest than contrived. This charm is amplified by the likability of its two leads, Clarke and Golding.The film's sound tracked is from the music catalog of singer George Michael. They serve as smooth transition between scenes, but at times feel tacked-on and gimmicky and don't fit in with the rest of the film. Last Christmas has a third act that turns the movie on its head and, while the shift isn't shockingly surprising, it's well-executed and re-contextualizes much of what has come before.I give Last Christmas 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18 due to sexual references and language. There's nothing too scandalous, but it's still worth noting. If you're a fan of this genre, you'll probably love this film and its holiday charm is hard to resist. In the end, we go to the movies to be entertained and in that respect; Last Christmas certainly gets the job done.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

519,"It's the middle of November and I know what a lot of people have on their mind; Christmas, right? The TV channels are already airing a lot of the typical Christmas movies and the shops are all decked out for the season. Of course we still have Thanksgiving to get through, but it's perfectly understandable if you're a bit annoyed by the over-commercialization of the season. That might make you a Grinch or a Scrooge, but you also don't care. I would completely understand that as I wish everything would at least wait until after the food coma has set in from Thanksgiving, but I also understand from a business point of view.When I was on my way to the movies, I overheard ""Last Christmas"" on the radio and thought to analyze it. It's not one of my favorite songs, but its one that happens to play every year (perhaps more due to the unfortunate death of George Michael). I think it's because of two things; first is the love story. The lyrics talk about a person getting a new chance to love but they deny it. Second is the synth sound that's both distinctly 1980's and is rarely heard in Christmas music. Now we have a song adaptation with Last Christmas because... I can't quite spoil it.Young woman Kate (played by Emilia Clarke) is stuck in a rut, as she continually loses a place to stay and doesn't want to go home to her parents. She's also loose with men as she doesn't want something to commit to. Her only stable thing is her job, in which she works at a year round Christmas shop run by ""Santa"" (played by Michelle Yeoh). Despite her aspiring singing career, she seems to have no push or motivation to move beyond the Christmas shop, considering that she's also becoming lazier on the job.While working, she comes across an odd man Tom (played by Henry Golding) who seems to be coming into her life more and more. At first she tries to push him away, but seems to start liking him quirk and how he seems to try to get her to do better. At the same time, after getting thrown out once more, she finally goes home where her parents berate her with more medical appointments from a heart condition and her countries traditions from Yugoslavia. Perhaps this Christmas, she may find more heart to give.Last Christmas has been marketing itself as a romantic comedy a lot like those Hallmark movies...and that seems about right. That isn't to say that this is a bad movie, but the trailer is likely the best place to figure out if your going to like this movie or not. It has a similar story, similar kind of acting, and same kind of music. There's even a similar plot twist that I will not give away, but let's just say that it makes Last Christmas a literal adaptation of the Wham song.If I'm gonna offer phrase, it's the script and it's actors. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding do have a lot of chemistry and I was never board with their scenes. They make a lot of banter that a lot of young couples do (especially in Christmas shops, like in one scene). Though I was afraid, I also got into Michelle Yeoh's story of her running a Christmas shop and a potential suitor. It's clear that writer Emma Thompson and director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, A Simple Favor) know how to write comedy and even nice scenes with couples. Character is clearly the first thing forward.As I said, there is a twist that happens in Last Christmas that will either make or break it. In my case, I thought it was fine as it adds needed weight for the main character. This is typical for a lot of holiday romance stories and I think this is what Paul Feig had wanted to make; an edgier version of those Hallmark movies. If this doesn't appeal to you, then your not going to like this. But if it doesn't bother you, you may be very forgiving of it's predictable nature as it's still an easy sit.I'll give this six Last Christmas albums out of ten. While I don't know if this is going to be another Christmas classic, it's inoffensive enough that it'll still play around the holidays for a while. It'll put you in the right mood for the holiday. Just be willing to be okay with the slower aspects. Check it out to see if you'd recommend the very next day."
520,"I absolutely loved this movie, the music, the actors and the story . I've seen it 3 times already! I ugly cried every time I saw it. Must see!
Such a lovely love story."
521,"This could have been a perfect movie, but I spent the first 70% of the film wanting to punch the wardrobe person. It's 2019, do we really need the main character walking around looking like a homeless person in a dated ugly leopard print coat that seriously looked like it smelled. Emilia Clark's homeless person look was completed by the hair and makeup department with dirty, unwashed hair and trashy eye makeup. Seriously! I still want my Christmas rom-coms to be somewhat magical!
Thankfully the story developed enough for me to forget this about 70% through....
Everything else was great: supporting cast, music, story, Christmas cheer, etc etc.
There was no need for a token black person lesbian though, when all the London extras were white!"
522,"A good script, good supporting cast but those eyebrows out of control make me to lose interest in the film. Or Emilia Clark learns to control her eyebrows or they are going to have a different agent"
523,"This is not a romantic comedy that you leave feeling good. It´s predictable, the characters are unlikeable and shallow. A waste of time."
524,A delightful Christmas present. Lead actors: just perfect. Wonderful scene-stealing show from Emma Thompson and a variety of bravura cameo performances (Anna Calder Marshall is an unexpected treat). A rom com with edge ... an emotional roller coaster ... truly cathartic. So worth the NOW TV sub!
525,"Who to f...k are Yugoslavians??? Those never existed...Yugoslavia was, thank God, dead in 1999. Very strange mix of ortodox church, Croatia, family name Andrich, KGB, russian accent, war in 1999??? Is it so difficult to research it
Other than that, nice movie"
526,"After about five minutes you will hate everything about Emilia Clarkes character.
After the following 95 minutes you will hate all the other annoying characters, the stressful and unnatural dialogue (people do not act and talk like this in real life) and christmas in general.
A pathetic attempt of making a new Love Actually."
527,"The story itself isn't so bad, especially just about a girl with a dysfunctional family life and some emotional problems she needs to work through. But I was disappointed because they market it as a Christmas movie. Other than the lead character dressing like an elf in order to work at a Christmas decoration store, there is really nothing about Christmas in the film. But that's it, that's basically the entire plot of the whole film. A girl who lives in London, has a dysfunctional family and has some personal emotional problems she needs to work through. It's basically a Hallmark channel film. I mean, the acting is good, the cinematography is OK, but it isn't a Christmas film. There's also some weird questions, like why does the lead character and her family have to come from Hungary? That doesn't really add anything to the film."
528,"Amazing how many people still line up to see Christmas movies. This one is yet another of those so-called Christmas 'holiday season 'movies that are as much about Christmas as that Bonny Bouncing Bunny is to Easter. It's somewhat of a 'La La Land' wanna-be, without the easygoing feel and charm that one at least offered.Some of the dialogue and situations are crass and the sleep-around 'Christmas Elf'' didn't help whatsoever. The sudden turn to being a supernatural feel good/bad fantasy surprise --was a bit of a difficult twist to take-- especially amongst all the rather superficial PC philosophising being shovelled around like the fake 'santa' snow in the gutters of ole London. The cast tried but with the sour- treacle script reaching for heights it didn't quite earn, it was mostly uphill.Maybe fine for the easily pleased or woke 'idealists'. A movie based on a song, with other songs in the background that didn't quite fit the subject."
529,"It was very Unpredictable actually, I never thought that Tom Webster is a GHOST
so ""LOOK UP"" tom said."
530,"I wasn't expecting a fantasy movie when i sit to watch this one. I enjoyed it until the male character turned out to be a ""ghost"" ! Why would anyone make a sad Christmas movie? And rest of it just doesn't make sense, it forces the ""appreciate what you have"" motto. I enjoyed watching Emma Thompson though, stars go to her."
531,Starts as a good movie but on the half of it you find out that is not actually a love story ..just that the girl has halucinations and mental problems..terrible script but the story is nice
532,I loved this movie!!! I sobbed at the end and so wished it could have been different! Great chemistry between the 2 main characters. Enjoy but have the tissues ready
533,OMG this movie is really inspirational and heart warming at the same time.Makes you think about your choices in life an if you appreciate those choices and be proud that your alive.Its funny with romance added along the way but you will never be disappointed watching this movie.Loved it !(No Spoilers)watch for your self.
534,"I don't celebrate Christmas myself but I always enjoyed watching Christmas movies, one of them is this!A little bit apprehensive at first because it has a low rating, but after giving it some consideration I decided to give it a go! And I'm so glad that I did because this movie is far from my expectation, it's so fun and light and not boring at all! A little bit cheesy here and there but you know, it's a romantic comedy after all. Also I really didn't expect to get a plot twist, like I enjoyed it a lot I didn't even have any suspicion, at all. So yeah, it's really heartwarming, I cried a little bit too much lmao"
535,I love this movie. Yeah the twist in the end was predictable but the journey was still worth it. Emilia Clarke is a good actress. I love the rest of the cast too. Beautifully done movie. Definitely deserves a higher rating
536,"...quite a good little movie.
Fat Nixon cultists are going to hate it, but that just makes it that much more enjoyable.
Watch it, have fun...after all, it's Christmas!!"
537,"Wanted to watch this for a long time, Was kinda put off by the reviews on here but the eyebrows an charm of Emilia drew me in, Very good entertainment throughout and a nice message to boot 8/10 from me Emma Thompson was hilarious as Emilias Croatian mum ""lesbian pudding"" 😂"
538,Last Christmas is a charming film and a good Christmas movie - at least for the first 2/3rds of the film. But that last act really took away everything the film was. The twist and the suddenness of the characters turn to do good felt so forced that it breaks down the characters arc that genuinely destroyed what could have been a decently good time.
539,"Watched this with the missus and all throughout it guessed the ending various ways, all of which were wrong. Which is a good thing, as the ending was a surprising end to a beautiful film about coming together in a most seasonal way. Both us convinced it was filmed around the Eastenders setting lol definitely worth the watch if into coming together at Christmas time, family - loved ones and friends!"
540,"I went with my wife to an early showing and was the only man in the cinema. I think the ladies will certainly appreciate this film. Having said that, I found it a lovely heart-warming film which makes good use of an excellent George Michael soundtrack. Great witty dialogue too."
541,It was an alright film in total but then plot twist was just dumb. It was un needed and just felt tacked on
542,"See this film!! Don't let the nay-sayers put you off.
Yes, it's over the top, but that's what Christmas films are for! It's lovely, the storyline is just the right side of ridiculous. It's warming and just what is needed on the run up to Christmas.
Emma Thompson steals the show once again, but Harry stole my heart!"
543,"Great acting with a really interesting plot. Personally, I'd have set the start of the movie in 1990 Jugoslavia so as to be historically accurate, even if that meant having 5 year olds singing, in order to match Emilia's age. That aside, the movie is a wonderful story of personal awareness and improvement. Well done!"
544,"I have been a George Michael fan since 1983. His music is very important to me and even though I never saw him live on stage, I felt incredible sadness when he passed almost 3 years ago. When I heard that this film - Last Christmas - was being made, I got excited. The music of my hero being used and it was quite well documented. It even felt a little bit too much for me, because I couldn't believe that my hero's music meant so much to so many people and on such a broad scope.The term ""christmas movie"" is also important to me. It should be a feel good movie with a happy ending. I have many faves in this category (It's a wonderfule life... Love Actually, Scrooged, Christmas Vacation, The Holiday ... etc.) but Last Christmas enters this group right away. I saw the film with my wife in Glasgow and apparently I was a little bit excited because the moment we hear the first song I whisper: oooh... this song is in it ... and whenever a song by GM or Wham! was heard, I got so excited. Especially ""Waiting for that day"" ... it was truly great for me. Of course I think the song ""Last Christmas"" is the best Christmas song, but a whole movie based on it ... I couldn't believe it, but Emma Thompson's script was perfect. Yes, there are stereotypes of course but the banter and the one-liners and ... well, the basic plot was done so beautifully.The ending was of course both sad but yet so satisfying. I didn't see it coming. And the song ""Last Christmas"" - at least a few lines - suddenly have more powerful meaning ... ""I gave you my heart, but the very next day..."". Tom and Katarina (Kate) are fun characters... opposites ... but getting a new heart and being a heart donor is something so beautifully done and described here. I love Tom's character but I also love the development of Kate's. It's ..yes... a classic cliché : the selfish person matures and at the end is very caring and giving. But I love surprises and at the end (and on some occasions in the film) I was ... well, there was something in my eyes... ;-)Acting: superb - main characters great and supporting characters as well (especially those at the homeless shelter).
Script: sometimes clichéd but very beautiful and I loved the plot/ending.
Directing: must have been fun directing this but overall the job is beautifully done.
Music: no doubt that GM's music and songs play a vital part (as GM does in the story as well) but to a fan like me, I found his songs more important to me and it was strange thinking about it afterwards how the usage of the songs in the movie affected me. I really really connected to the movie better because of this.Emilia and Henry had a wonderful chemistry, she was very believable as the annoying and selfish Kate, and even more so as Katarina :-) It's a gem - this movie - not a flawless one, but one for repeated viewings in the future.""There ain't no point in moving on till you got somewhere to go...""Thank you Paul and Emma and all the cast, but special thanks to my hero and his music: GM - I truly love you and your music!Must see film!"
545,This movie has a lot heart without being too sappy. It has a positive message and is a great film to see surrounded by family and friends. I'm so glad I went to see it. We need more movies like this.
546,"Paul Feig directs a chocolate box of Christmas with Last Christmas, and there were tears. Emilia Clarke is Kate, a George Michael loving Saturday Elf, now full-time, in Michelle Yeoh's 'Yuletide' Covent Garden store. She's rocking around the Christmas tree in Chinese silks while Kate is in elvish green velvet, it's definitely Santa's grotto in there. And I loved the Covent Garden setting, the ideal place for a year round Christmas shop, and my old stamping ground, plus I lived in Islington, shout out to Upper Street Market. And as a Christmas buyer I recognised it all. With George Michael and Wham on chorus, this was ready for a party. Never recognised a bus though, the geography was a little all over. Hackney, Brixton, the tunnel? Who lived where? But let's not quibble about geography. It's London as its most glittery and Cecil Court is still a gorgeous little bookshop yard. Unsurprisingly Last Christmas had to be filmed in the middle of the night.Emma Thompson as Kate's Croatian mother Petra, and the film's co-writer, may have written a cutesy Christmas film, but this is Britain in 2017, and with the Brexit vote an Out, foreigners are not welcome on some buses. But there's humour as well as sadness. The family had to leave Yugoslavia after the war. And all Petra's friends were killed. That's funnier than it sounds from Emma Thompson! But it's not a happy family. Dad Ivan was a lawyer then, played by Boris Isakovic, he now drives a taxi, and stays out of the house when his wife is awake. Petra also blames the Polish for all this unrest with foreigners! Eldest daughter Marta, played by Lydia Leonard, is the lawyer sister to our Fleabag Kate. They don't speak. She has a lovely, let's call it Islington, town house. Kate however is a mess, something inside her doesn't feel right, and she has nowhere to sleep except sofa surfing with her friends. Other than her parents house of course. With her friends she has something of a history with frying fish, (hilarious), burning ships and squashing geometric models. Sorry! Drinks 'like a pirate', eats a terrible junk food diet, and takes no exercise, unless you count one night stands with inappropriate guys. If nothing else the film will remind you to look after your heart.And Emilia Clarke twinkles her way through it all with those amazing eyes and eyebrows of hers. Isn't it time she had a break and met a good guy for once? And Henry Golding is the gorgeous Tom who she keeps bumping in to. He's always there at the right place at the right time. Except infuriatingly when he's not. He works nights you see.And while Kate is not falling in love with Tom who is not her type, she's trying to make it as a singer, she was a former Yugoslavian church choir soloist, she must get the voice from her mother! But seriously Emilia has a good voice. And she even auditions for Frozen, on ice. Tom has never heard of Frozen, but takes her skating for the thrill, as she actually cannot skate. She'll just wing it. And unbelievably he keeps his phone at home in a cupboard. It makes life so freeing. Kate has never met anyone like him before. I'm not sure any woman will. Or man, as the film is very aware of the LGBT and BME community and gives them all space, this is London after all. And it is George Michael's music on the playlist.There are sensitive portrayals of the homeless and disabled, of course Tom, who must be an angel he's so damn perfect, helps out at a shelter, or something to do with the church it's attached to, and encourages Kate to help out too. And she enjoys it. The day job could do with some Christmas sparkle though, Michelle Yeoh calls herself Santa as she loves Christmas, she also called herself Kitten when she worked in a pet shop and Muffin when she worked in a bakers! But she has weird ideas of Christmas decor. It's the Chinese suppliers she knows Kate tells Tom! Mind you I was never big on safari animals for Christmas tree ornaments, and look at the menagerie in store now. I'm not sure about a Christmas gibbon though.I dare say there are faults with the film. Especially for critics who are paid to watch every film and a Christmas feel good movie is probably not their choice. But Last Christmas has a cracking cast and a charm that pulls you into Kate's world, and we enjoy seeing it through her, and Tom's eyes. Matchmaking for Santa with the equally crazy about Christmas lovely Danish man played by Peter Mygind, who has a job in something to do with sauerkraut. We know him from all the Danish dramas we watched. A really sweet romance. And Kate is putting together a Benefit for the Church shelter. Where she gets to perform again. Last Christmas of course. Which you'll go home singing because it's Christmas, if you have a heart.Paul Feig's Bridesmaids which everyone raves about, was funny, but a little too earthy for me, but I loved his A Simple Favour and Last Christmas is a cosy slice of Christmas cheer."
547,Another predicable Christmas film. The actors were great but the characters actions did not make any sense. No one can change that much in a few days from meeting one person.
548,So did this movie. The best I can say is that if the two leading actors were replaced it would have been decent... boring dialog...Amelia Clarke has no presence on the screen... for that matter no one else did either... George Michael soundtrack was good but too many of his songs were a bit much
549,Bonkers is all I can say about this movie. Not anywhere near as bad as early reviews suggested but still a wasted chance. Two really likeable leads this starts off bouncy and fun but there's an awful leaden stretch in the middle where Emma Thompson seems to want to fit in every worthy cause possible. Just as I'd lost interest though a truly bonkers twist happened. I have to admit I felt a warm glow and left the cinema with a smile on my face and the soundtrack is good but not as dominant as I'd expect. Approach with caution. I'll never watch again but it has redeeming features.
550,This is a beautiful film with all of the festive feel good. Excellent throughout. A new film on my yearly watch list
551,Probably watch it again. I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed and cried more then I expected. Love the cast and loved the story line. 😁
552,It's a Christmas movie with an inspiring message. Ignore the miserable haters and go see it. Clarke and Golding are enchanting.
553,"The film was absolutely funny and interesting with totally unexpected end of a plot.
Everything was great except the thing that Yugoslavia in 1999 didn't egzist.. the accent of the mother was everything but croatian/bosnian/serbian xD, I know that she isn't native speaker but she sounds like a bad russian.."
554,"Lots of great positive messages whilst celebrating the Christmas theme. Loved it
More George Michael music would have been even better"
555,Hmmmm i did try and like this film but i didn't the only reason i gave it 5/10 is the last 30 mins as it really picks up a bit of pace and as for the big twist i can't understand anyone who didn't see it coming ......? can;t fault any of the acting they all did a good job and emilia clarke sure is a good looking lady ....!!!!!!!!
556,It is such a beautiful story. It's gonna worth your time.
557,"How this is say at 6.6 is beyond me, not a big George Michael fan or wham so I was skeptical going in, but boy did I enjoy that!"
558,"Bring on the Christmas movies. It is officially the holiday season so of course we are going to get some festive themed films. I actually forgot that Paul Feig was the director of this. He's a fairly good filmmaker and I like his work for the most part. I also wanted to see Emilia Clarke take a lead role where she could dabble in comedy. Also, the film features songs by George Michael which felt kind of weird to me just because the music is just kind of there and not strongly linked to the story.I thought the film was decent, entertaining when it needs to be but it goes through predictable cliches.The film is about a woman who is going through a bit of a crisis in London during the holiday season. She's at odds with her family, has no place to stay, has trouble going on at work, and is a former singer who is struggling to find her break. She one day meets a mysteriously charming man who enables her to appreciate the spirit of giving and also the enchanting world that they live in. The two soon form a very close connection although she strives to get closer to the man, although it seems impossible.Emma Thompson as a Yugoslavian mother is on point and funny. There is good humor around the film and a lot of the entertainment in this film can be attributed to the charm and spirit that Emilia Clarke brings. I don't think she always acts well as Daenarys Targarean on Game of Thrones but she had this role figured out. The music of George Michael is nice I guess although to me it seems more random than a tribute to him.I think the films major third act is predictable early on and I kind of saw the events coming. Not that it wasn't done well, there just wasn't really a shock factor to events that transpire because it seems quite obvious a little of the way through. The film brings the Christmas cheers and holiday emotions in droves though and this can became a holiday time favorite for many.6/10"
559,"People are being so negative about this movie, i almost gave it a 10 to counterbalance. After years of being fed 'rom cons' that aren't actually funny like 'love actually' and yes 'crazy rich asians' (Sorry Henry and Michelle. That film was a hot mess.) how can you not fall in love with the delightful Emilia Clarke? You could see how much fun she was having in this movie bursting through the screen. Henry Golding is always yummy to look at but here he had to do some heavy lifting acting chops as well and did well. I do agree with the criticism of the film that the 'twist' almost negates the entire movie,
Which also prevents me from giving it a perfect ten. It's just such a plot hole! If he was...then how could she...WHAT?! It almost even doesn't make sense. It was comforting though to go with a girl friend and be quietly sobbing together at the end. I wish I didn't have to end the way it did, but (almost) everything else was so delightful.Two major complaints:
1) setting of brexit. Please keep your politics out of my movie. The time you wasted reflecting it could have been better spent explaining your plot hole end.
2) *SPOILER ALERT*
The gay sister. I mean, really who cares? One thing that disappointed me was not going into Kate's medical history and why she needed what she needed in the first place. The time could have been better spent on that.All in all, a pretty great film. Definitely laugh out loud funny which like I said earlier, is more than I can say for other films considered comedic."
560,"I really wanna say this. those who released this movie NOW that is almost like....TWO MONTHS before Christmas.....should be fired.
a Christmas movie to be released in early November is a nail to the coffin to the movie itself.
why do people will go see that kind of movie in...November except that if they don't in Christmas this movie may not even be around ? JESUS....
someone must inform those idiots that Christmas are on 25th of December...not November.
the movie now will fail at box office and anyways no matter how much it will make it would do double if it was released at least 1 month later.
this should be released in mid December.
as for the movie it's what u expect to see. romance.....love.....Christmas spirit but on the ....WRONG DATE DAMN IT.UPDATE...(Christmas day)Like I was saying.......2 months ago the movie was playing in like 3,000 theaters...today at Christmas day it plays only in around 200 theaters.....hope u get now the point of my review made 2 months ago.........(for those who did not or did not understood my review)"
561,Why was it like ?? It was better if they ended up happily together. Wtf was that ????I absolutely loved Emilia Clark and Henry Golding's acting but I blame the director and the writers for the stupid ending.
562,"I was expecting a lot more after all the hype with Emilia Clarke but i was disappointed. I felt i was watching a combination of ""crazy rich asians"" and ""me before you"", the acting was good at least Helen mirren was there(even though her role was semi insignificant by my opinion) but i honestly didn't feel the vibe of the movie till the towards the end of the movie(that was exhausting). In conclusion it was just an average""feel good"" and ""christmassy "" movie which i would rather not go to the cinema to watch but wait till the Dvd is availabke or anyvof the streaming sites."
563,"We have just returned from our local cinema and watched Last Christmas. It was an excellent movie and I recommend anyone wishing to see a film with a good story line and lots of festive atmosphere to catch this one now. I predict that Last Christmas will follow Love Actually and be viewed at Christmas for many years to come.
I am now going to ignore the press critics who seem to have the habit of panning good films like this and The Greatest Showman when in fact their views are the opposite from the viewing public."
564,"The main problem I had with this film was that the lead character lacked credibility. She was given lots of sardonically funny lines to deliver, at the expense of any proper character development. As a result, her spiritual journey through the film lacked any real substance. All we were left with was a plot, whose twist was both predictable and irritatingly unoriginal.All in all, a very dull experience."
565,"Beautiful movie with a great message about life and also the cast chosen was the best, Emilia as always a splendid actress."
566,"What a wonderful surprise! My best friend and I trusted this would at least be worth seeing when we read that Emma Thompson was one of the writers, and featured in a role in the film as well, but it then turned out to be one of our favorite film experiences of the year. We agreed on exit that it was a 10 out of 10 for both of us (which is rare), and also that this would be a Christmastime film we could imagine looking forward to seeing annually to help celebrate and get into the mood of the season. And what a cast! Everyone, even those in the smallest featured roles (and there are a ton of them) are joyous, committed, and clearly having a ball creating the film, and that joy spills over to us in the audience."
567,"Last Christmas was nowhere near as bad as I expected. Amelia Clarke is wonderful in all bit one scene, the story is somewhat endearing, feels current and has it's heart in the right place. It's diversity feels just right, it's not in your face, it just feels natural.However, this film has the worst plot twist I have seen in quite some time. It just didn't work at all. We've seen at least 50 films at the cinema over the last year, thanks to the Odeon Limitless pass, and this was by far the worst 'desperate' plot twist.Other than that, it was just fine. Something's don't make too much sense, there are a few miss hit jokes, but mostly, it was an enjoyable watch, even if I was the only man in a cinema with about 30 women."
568,"I love romantic comedies and when I saw trailer I thought this movie was perfect for me. After seeing it tonight, I'm slightly disappointed.I felt trough the whole movie like nothing meaningful was happening, I didn't even see an actual plot. In the end I was like what did I just watch?!Also, as a person who lives in country of former Yugoslavia (Croatia) and a person who's native language is croatian, I can say that their pronuantiation of some words and curses in croatian was poor and I think actors should've practiced better (espetially Ema Thompson, who's character is born and raised and lived many years in Yugoslavia). If we didn't have subtitles, I wouldn't understand those parts but it made me laugh. But I also think that this comedy wouldn't be so funny if I wasn't from Balkan because those parts mostly made me laugh.Considering everything, if you like romantic comedies without much romance and don't mind many naïve things in a movie and also want to laugh, I would recommend watching this movie"
569,"Slow at first, but gets better, little tearful come the end,an excellent film, give it's chance, a film I could watch over and over."
570,Loved everything about this film. The cast is perfect. I didnt expect much going into it but it really surprised me. It's a nice feel good movie to enjoy with anyone. Watched with my bf who doesn't usually go for romantic comedy but he liked this one.
571,"For an all over movie I would rate this one 8 stars, but in the romcom genre it's a worthy little nephew of Love Actually and Holiday- and worthy ones are hardly bred anymore- so therefore I give it a solid 10 in the genre.
It has all the necessary elements for a romcom but also an amazing and unexpected plot twist, and Emilia Clark is radiant as main character Kate.
If you have a open heart and mind, both laughter and tears are guaranteed!"
572,I loved this. It is pure entertainment woven around great life lessons and values. It is all about love of the heart. Kind of reminded me of Love Actually. And boy did George Michael's voice and music soar in the theatre.
573,"I liked the movie as an amazing story, performance, photography, directing and even music and songs were very beautiful. Thank you Paul Fig. Thank you."
574,"I'm really between a 6 & 7. So I really loved the tone of the first half of the film, it was great!! I loved the music throughout, thank you George Michael! Emilia Clarke is super cute and I love her playing normal people. Henry Golding is just so handsome and I would have loved to see him in the film much more!! I hope he has more movies to come, he's so charming! Michelle Yeoh was also great, she shines in a comedic role. Great casting overall! So back to the plot... I will keep it spoiler free. The first half of the movie follows Kate (Clarke) in her mess of a life. Her self-centered downward spiral has left her basically homeless, in a dead-end job and almost no healthy relationships with people in her life. She meets Tom (Golding) who starts to open her eyes to things and places that are around her. Without giving anything away, I will say that the second half of the movie felt like it was done by a completely different person than the first half. Or like a scene or two had been cut? It was a little confusing how the pace and tone of the movie seemed to change and switch gears. There was very little plot in the second half and it didn't grab me emotionally. I was hoping to be truly touched at the end because the beginning started so strongly for me. There were a few too many subplots that didn't really go anywhere which made the film feel overstuffed yet still bare overall. I needed more emotional connection! It could have really been a slam dunk but it felt short for me. I'm giving it a 7 because I want romantic comedies to still be made but I need more!"
575,Pleasant enough but lacking a proper narrative to get to the ending you're served. The actors did a good job and the George Michael soundtrack was tolerable. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were likable and had good chemistry. Emma Thompson and Michelle Yeoh were strong supports. A pleasing way to pass some time. Don't go to see this if you're expecting 'A Wonderful Life'.
576,"Even if all could be perfect at large, this movie is a desaster."
577,"I never write a review about a movie because i'm usually lazy, but this movie was so bad that I had to react and save others from 1hr 43 min of bad acting, bad directing, flat script, utterly boring, senseless, and awfully predictable movie. And labeling it as a rom-com? There is not a single funny scene in this movie, not one! The chemistry between the actors was nonexistent.
The ONLY good thing about this movie was the lead male, whose screen time probably totaled 4 minutes top. The story had potential, but everything was so badly executed, it didn't convey any emotion to the audience.
Do yourself a favor and save your time for something worthwhile."
578,"I can't even list all the things wrong with this movie. The backstory about her being from Yugoslavia when it didn't even exist in 1999, and the fact that the movie begins with that premise, a wrong fact is repelling. As a person from Serbia, I'm insulted by the accents."
579,I am now officially an Emilia Clarke fan. Fabulous film that will have you balling your eyes out
580,"There is nothing more pathetic than what I just watched. Every bad joke is forced on a lame story enforced by bad acting, mediocre at best. None of the events in the movie are thought thru, nothing sticks really and it makes you believe this was written by a 5 year old. I gave it 2 stars for the professionals behind the scenes such as camera, sound crew etc, filming this pathetic attempt of a movie. It is an insult to everyone paying to see it. It should be released for free, in prison, to torture inmates on death row."
581,"This movie is terrible. It is so illogical and absurd. Nothing makes sense. My gf wanted to see this movie bc ""Khalisi"" is in it. I said trailer even looks pointless, however I still went. After the movie she even had to admit that this movie was dumb but cute.For folks who are praising this movie; Can someone explain to me how she got into his apartment??? Come on!!! If you love this movie, then you need to only watch hallmark movies in your life. You don't need anything else since you keep the bar so low."
582,"I gave this film a higher score than it probably is actually worth, simply because I think it's been cruelly panned and scored low by critics.
Do not listen to the critics reviews the film is fun, Christmasy and has enough heart to make it one to re watch every year.
People review films based on the same criteria. You can't compare Schindler's List with Star Wars or Harry Potter with 12 years a slave. Treat each film individually and you won't be disappointed."
583,"There are actually many funny scenes, but the plot is too flat."
584,"I love Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding, and Paul Feig but this movie was just horrible. It was kind of cheesy with a predictable and depressing storyline. It's like they tried too hard to be funny and it just wasn't. Instead it came off as weird, awkward, and dumb. Just really bad writing."
585,"16 years after the Christmas masterpiece LOVE ACTUALLY the directorial debut of Richard Curtis comes an equally exceptional film.I really hope no one gives out any spoilers here as this film blew me away .Take tissues you'll need them .There are so many positives but honestly if you like ROMCOMS you'll love this - think Four Weddings , Notting Hill etc - Emma Thompson , star or Love Actually wrote and directed this but you'll honestly believe it was Richard Curtis - it's got his style all over it .The locations chosen were amazing and the back story of Brexit and immigration were on point with the current politics . Emilia even looked like Rita Ora so the back story in some ways was uncanny with the former Yugoslavia playing a part . The use of London the integration , the beauty of us all sharing this earth together , looking after one another - people getting on regardless of class creed or colour all gave a positive feel about a film set at this time of year around family and acceptance of change .I don't want to say too much or any thing about the plot itself as it will spoil the film except to say I was blown away .See it before someone else does and spoils it for youTruly amazingPad.A 10/10"
586,"Well the film is heartbreaking and i liked the twist even I predicted that tom is not real, hats off to the film message , that's why we love movies"
587,I liked this movie a lot. Great story with an unexpected ending. Music cool too. Perfect date night movie.
588,"I guessed this movie right at the beginning so there was no need to continue. I tried to watch it but it was just so dull. Every moment was boring and unnecessary. When I skipped to the end I found out I was right and thought the whole movie was pointless. The Christmas theme is a nice touch though. And Henry Golding was fun.
I suggest watching other romantic comedies because I didn't laugh once or get attached to the characters. The ending sucked and made the whole movie feel stupid."
589,Only one word just go to theatre with your family friends or love ones to watch this masterpiece otherwise you w
590,"I wanted to like this movie, but the only thing worth watching was Emilia Clarke. I found the acting overal so bland it distracted from the story. That goes for the left wing agenda as well. Seemed the whole support cast was made up of diverse wokies. There was little humour but a lot of virtue signalling. George Michael's music was nice to hear but seemed out of place in the scenes it was used in. They even managed to use the line ""last christmas I gave you my heart"" in a literal sense, which is frankly insulting to the audience's intelligence."
591,"This was a social justice film disguised as a Christmas movie. The actual love story seemed to be somewhat secondary, with the only straight white males being an immigrant and a random guy that the main character hooks up with, and is only featured for a couple seconds. Would not recommend, unless you enjoy watching an hour and a half of paid propaganda. Emilia Clarke is much better than this horror show of a picture."
592,This was undeniably one of the best uses of an unreliable narrator in the history of writing
593,"Just watch the movie and don't listen to the critics, you'll be surprised in a nice way. Wonderful actors and a lot of humour."
594,"So, apparently you have to be a George Michael fan to enjoy this movie. It's like the entire soundtrack. They play George Micheal songs for literally no reason. All the time. It is really an excessive amount of George Micheal songs. And very few christmas songs.
Aside from the annoying soundtrack, the movie itself is pretty boring. A train wreck of a girl keeps doing stupid selfish stuff and pissing everyone she knows off. That is until she meets a mysterious handsome gentleman and he helps her change her life. But wait, there's more! There's a surprise twist at the end. It would've been better if they had done a better job of connecting all the dots. But all the scenes are pretty random. There are a few funny moments though. But don't bother to see this in the theater. It's about the quality of a tv Halmark movie."
595,"I decided to give this a watch because of the cast. Going into it I assumed it was going to be your typical Christmas romcom- girl is sad during holidays, girl meets guy, girl no longer sad. But it really wasn't like that. The movie genuinely explores the main character's problems, which go beyond the surface level ""I'm perpetually single"" trope you usually see in female led romcoms. There's humor interwoven with quite serious bits. And the movie definitely goes in a direction you wouldn't expect. It's not your typical cheerful, lovey-dovey movie- whether or not that's a good thing is you to you."
596,"First of all, it was absolutely perfectly cast! The whole ensemble was quirky and wonderful. There was no indication of ""acting"" happening - each character embodies the personalities they portrayed. One of the reviews enjoyed it being predictable, but I don't think it was predictable one bit. The message in the end is perfect for any time in your life, but particularly now when I'm writing this, in 2020. We all feel a bit lost these days, and caring about each other is what will get us through. I didn't expect to be so entertained, moved, and mostly fully engaged, so this was a wonderful surprise!"
597,"Started off a bit slow for me didnt really warm to Emilias character at first. But wow what a great film. Bit of George,spotting Andrew Ridgeway was a bonus. I laughed,I cried - loved it"
598,Fantastic movie until the surprising end rips your heart out. Was feeling so good then wham.. Merry Christmas 😩
599,"I honestly was getting a bit tired of all the Christmas movies out there. 95% of all the movies had the exact same timeline running through the entire movie. This is a different take on that you need to appreciate life and pull yourself out of the rabbit hole. This is not the typical HEA, but the one it has is pretty damn great and heartful. I love having a twist that just kind of kicks you in the face."
600,"This movie is full of surprises and will surely become a Christmas standard for years to come. It is a genuine feelgood film, though many watchers will probably need to have some tissues handy. Emilia Clarke is perfect in the lead part and despite being unpopular with her landlords manages at all times to maintain the sympathies of the viewer. One of the most enjoyable Christmas movies I've seen, well worth the watch."
601,"Didn't like it much 1 St time I saw it but Seen it 3 times since , now love it"
602,The trailer gives too much away! Nothing much extra other than the big twist! Both Henry and Emilia are excellent and make it watchable.
603,"Didn't know what to expect with this at all but it's a great film. It's not too hard to watch, it's nice, it's funny, it's a bit emotional and a really enjoyable film to sit down and watch. Don't look too much in to it, take it as it's meant to be watched. We need more heart warming stuff like this. 10/10."
604,"A selfish girl, keen of one night stands, has fallen out with her mother and sister and us on the verge of getting sacked from her job in a Christmas shop, meets a kindly fellow and starts to reevaluate her life strategy.On the whole, a pleasant enough romantic Christmas film which whilst no It's a Wonderful Life, still ticks a few festive boxes. It's not remotely original and Clarke is a bit hyper and Thompson does her matriarchal thing but worth catching."
605,I wasn't sure to start with if i was going to like this movie but by the end i was crying! Such a beautiful movie
606,"Loved Emelia Clarke in GoT and she was the one saving grace in this film but even she couldn't keep my interest. The trailer sold it as a funny Christmas film, however it wasn't funny or Christmassy. It was a bit depressing tbh and not the lighthearted film I was expecting. Yes, she worked in a toy shop, but that was the only hint of Christmas. The George Michael soundtrack was wearing. Yes he recorded some great tunes but I can only assume his family were sponsoring the movie for the amount of songs they used in this. Emma Thompson's terrible acting as someone from Yugoslavia was cringe. And why bring the depressing repercussions of brexit into what was being sold as a comedy? Overall I felt this was a very strange film that can't decide what it wants to be. Disappointing, as I enjoy Christmas movies and there aren't enough new ones to watch these days."
607,"The yugoslavia part, stupid stupid girl part and I'm a good person qoute and act are so repetitive in every movie that I can't believe why I still watch any of the romcom movies. Also with parents who have such accent it is almost the most magical part of the movie that she speaks perfect British"
608,"Seriously they just wanted to make Christmas a holiday to watch drama movies too , it's just stupid no one needs to see a movie to know that if they were sick they need to move on . Just being realistic!"
609,Vomit....puke... detritus......puke...germs....Xmas.....bad script.....vomit....last Christvomit.....pain....
610,The film has good intentions. But only this. Nothing like Richard Curtis's films. Emma Thompson is the best. Emilia Clarke is just a permanent eyebrow in motion.
611,"This could have been a good romance-drama movie. The plottwist was ok, the actors were ok, the music was great. Politics in the movie were absolutely horrible. Disgusting to ruin a movie like that."
612,"It doesn't quite measure up to eg. 'Me before you', but it's still worth a watch"
613,"A nice little film with the main role played well by Emilia Clarke, all the characters were entertaining if somewhat stereotypical. An enjoyable film only spoiled by Thomson's (she wrote the story and screenplay) pathetic need to get a political statement in which was jarring and unnecessary."
614,"Just not my thing. It was predictable and rather empty. It was a film full of cliche story beats and one dimensional characters. The filmmaker has done better and this is disappointing. The film hits the third act and this is just run of the mill stuff. I thought this might be a strong if predictable film, but sadly it wasn't."
615,"Emilia Clarke is adorable, but this movie just didn't have any ""spark"". Could it be that the writers were distracted by peddling woke messages instead of just telling a story? I think so. Skip it."
616,"What more could you possibly want from a movie? Perhaps it was the general Christmas cynicism at the time of its realise that jaundiced others' opinions but watching this in the middle of March I found it an absolute delight. The light is sparkling, the dark is heart wrenching and Emilia Clarke is just brilliant. There are very few films that I will contemplate watching again but this is now definitely one of them."
617,A good story and actually a good message in this movie; and the acting is above average; but the way Hollywood insists on putting in a plug for things that I consider immoral just turns me off; so I did not recommend this movie to anyone else. Politically correct; if you are into that.
618,I was really excited for this because l love both leads! It was cute and with a good theme of opening your heart .. reconciliation and service . It forces to many jokes .. the chemistry just isn't really there for the two of them .. he is too odd and she is too selfish and immature . All the characters are too stereotypical . All the sudden magic is involved ?Watch it once .. don't expect anything life changing . Just some rom com entertainment and move on .
619,And I so wanted to love this movie but it was crap. It does have lots of promise but doesn't deliver. And when you can't stand the lead character all is lost. The use of George Michael songs in a movie sounds like a great idea. It worked for other movies but the people who chose which songs should be where should never do this again. Some of the songs sounded so random. Such a waste....
620,"Aside from the very artificial matching of iconic George Michael songs to scenes they don't belong to. The main problem is the lead character. You can't help but feel that the film would have been so much better if she got hit by a bus in the first scene. It is simply impossible to sympathize with this excuse for a human being. It's not the actress necessarily, but the script written around this miserable character is simply horrendous."
621,Storyline is weak. Hard to relate to chat tiers. Simply boring! Don't bother.
622,"I agree with Roberta from Croatia. I just would like to add that Emma disappointed me a lot with her performance. It seems that she thinks mumbling means speaking a foreign language. Well, Emma, you could put at least a bit more effort and learn to say those few sentences properly. Emilia on the other hand did a better job. Her sceen on the bus was great. She really did her homework. I also think that they could save time and money finding an ex Yugoslav living in Britan to play the father. Boris is a way too good actor... Cursing at the dinner table - terrible! It simply doesn't happen here in the Balkans.
Everything is superficial - story, plot, acting, details regarding their origin... a complete mess."
623,"Horrible movie. I can't believe Emilia Clarke played in such a bad movie. It's not romantic, it's not funny, it's not action, it's not drama. Who knows what it is !"
624,"I just love Emilia Clarke and this is one of those cute movies you can watch any time, and it keeps a smile on your face.
The Yugoslavia thing that keeps popping out in comments, I really don't think it's the point of the movie nor does it changes anything (it could be any other immigrant family). But, for a reminder to some reviewers here, Yugoslavia did exist in 1999 (NATO bombing?) and there were also Serbs from Croatia, who later had to escape, so maybe that's the case with this family...?
Regardless, the movie is bit cheesy, but in a good way and very charming!"
625,"I love this movie , don't look at the review because absolutely deserve more than this 6.5"
626,This movie is nearly perfect. I don't know who the hell could give this less than 7 stars...
627,"Fantastic acting on behalf of Amelia Clarke good on ya mate
davoe"
628,"I love Emma Thompson. I adore Emilia Clarke. I really thought this movie would be amazing, but it wasn't. I don't know what it was that stopped it from being amazing, but I think they simply tried too hard. It's very pc, which is so boring. The comedy scenes didn't work, the police women were like a bad sketch from an 80s sit com and 'boy' was simply a cringe.There were some great parts, the relationship Emilia's character had with Santa was developing very nicely. The development of the personalities of some of the homeless people was warning... Although wasted because it went nowhere. The concept was excellent, it was just delivered a little, amateurishly.We all know Emma far too well for her to play a foreigner, I will never understand why this even happens, find a decent actor who is of the nationality you want to portray, it's so much more believable. She did a great job, but for me it just didn't work.I really hope Emilia gets some better roles. She's amazing, she really is. She's so utterly beautiful there are no words, her acting is phenomenal, and as a person, as far as I've seen in a plethora of interviews and TV appearances, she's perfect. I just don't want to see her disappear in bad movies.Overall, I can't call it excellent, I'll stick with very good... Lucky casting because without Emilia I think it would have been, quite frankly, pants."
629,"Far from great, also far from bad. Good at its best."
630,"There are sooooo many incredibly bad christmas films out there that make this film look like a Top Tier christmas film (because it is).
I'm really glad to see Emilia Clarke in this sort of roles because she's fantastic in the comedy genre and hopefully, now that Game of Thrones' foot is off her neck (thank god), she'll be doing more of it. I don't care if the films are trash, I'll watch.
It's funny bc most people were annoyed at the fact that the plot twist was so obvious (I won't even put the spoilers filter in this review bc it's pointless) but I literally watched it bc I wanted to watch said plot twist executed. And it wasn't badly executed at all.
It's shallow (like all romcoms) but it's cute and funny and has a bit of heart so if you're bored and want to watch something simple I'll recommend it.Anyway, has anyone noticed how Charles Dickens went completely silent after this came out?? Curious.(also: L E S B I A N P U D D I N G)"
631,Love this movie as much as i love Then Came You.... Both of them a little unpredictable Good job Dany..
632,Great movie to watch with the missus. The tears were streaming
633,Surprisingly I did loved the movie. It has the simplicity on it but with its vibe you'll going to like it. Just watch it and dont mind the spoilers!
634,"One of the perfect movies I've ever seen in 2019, the IMDB rating is so unfair."
635,"I watched Last Christmas 3 days ago, first half in color, second half in black & white, all on a 13"" screen.For most of the movie, particularly the first half, I was pretty much in alignment with the feeling of a 6.6/10, as in the Imdb average rating. The little surprise towards the end of the film so took me by surprise, even though I had been warned to expect the unexpected.As the days go by, however, I'm repeatedly drawn to this cosmic connection between Kate & Tom. It's worth being patient with some of the melodrama of Kate's life. I never would have expected such a story from George Michael's song... in the end, it's brilliant! 8/10"
636,Thank goodness for mother of dragons she at least gave it a go.Until i watched this i referred to the wham movie but sadly the songs have been wasted. There is very little link between the music and the story. Its similarly woked like the beatles film but that was a far better film with the music front and centre playing a starring role.The funniest part was when suddenly a young white male jumps up and started shouting at a white european couple minding their own business on the bus because they were talking a foreign language. Yes that sort of thing happens every day on London buses ............. only in the minds of hollywood stars as they fly first class between roles. Its fake and just silly.So sadly a missed opportunity. Its a bit muddled bit unbalanced in the story. Looks like china played a part in funding as the dialogue between the two leads is very slowed down and pronunciated and looks dubbed. Presumably so they can sync it in asia more easily.
637,Was not expecting it to be as good as it was .a great watch
638,Absolutely loved it. The story was impressive and ..shocking!
639,"Good movie not really hard to guess the ending but still good Emilia was great in it
One bad thing they had do political brexit moment
Because of Emma Thompson who lives in a big mansion
In real life"
640,"I wasn't liking the movie until the end, I stuck it out. It didn't make much sense and seemed rushed and awkward or like something was off. The twist at the end slightly changed my mind."
641,"I went to this movie with my wife. We had heard it was a good movie and we had positive expectations. It was one of the last showings at our cinema. After a false start with the wrong movie been shown (Last Right), this was rectified by Vue and we sat on our own in the cinema to soak in this wonderful movie. I dont do 10's normally, but when I thought back about what I'd change and how the movie made me feel, I couldn't fault it. We will be buying it on DVD and watching it over many Christmas's. This is a very good movie."
642,"Fantastic movie with a great cast.
A unexpected plot twist.
Wow feeling."
643,"It is not a typical christmas movie. It does not have the happy ending you expect in the middle and it has a shocking plot twist that I am sure no one predicted before it happened. Even though the story itself could be quite sad and dramatic, the movie stays bright, positive, funny and leaves you satisfied when you leave the movie theatre. It is not the best movie I have ever seen. It is not even the best christmas movie ever. But I do not regret buying a ticket, seeing it and spend a pleasent one hour and a half. It was good.
BUT... please, please, please Hollywood I am beging you! If you decide to make a movie about another country, please learn it 's history! I could forgive a small detail but Yugoslavia in 1999? Please! Movie had a lot of historical similar mistakes and was actually full of stereotipes and pretty offensive to people, once lived in Yugoslavia. It was all just good fun for me, I am not that person who spot every single mistake in a movie and makes a scene out of it, but I would not blame people who would get offended. But it makes me wonder what history do they teach in schools around the world if noone could see anything wrong with that story. And let 's be honest, this is a movie, starring Emilia Clark, one of the biggest stars at the moment. And it is christmas movie. People will go to the cinemas and see it. People will pay for it. Is it really that hard just google Yugoslavia and read an article about it in Wikipedia?"
644,It tells a story about mending family relationship and changing character for the better. As usual Henry Golding is as charming as he was before and I saw the chemistry between him and Emilia Clarke. Perfect movie for Christmas Eve. It taught us about kindness also acceptance. I wouldn't be ashamed to admit that I like this movie.
645,"To the critics who wrote a bad review, you are nothing but a bunch of Scrooge's!! This was a funny, heart warming and feel good film that will put a bright smile on your face. The film focuses on Kate, who is a bit of a diamond in the rough. When she meets a handsome stranger, he turned her life around and begins slowly getting rebuild her life. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were fantastic as the main leads, but Emma Thompson is hilarious as Kate's overprotective mother. If you love films like ""Love Actually"" or ""The Holiday"", this is the film for you. I will add that to my essential films to watch over the Christmas season."
646,"Expected to feel Christmasy but I didn't, I cried, any film that makes me cry is a recommendation to watch!"
647,"The opening sequence, while amusing, is not particularly impressive. Kate (Emilia Clarke) with mother and sister issues (sounds familiar), tries to drown her troubles in a bar and get picked up. Waking up next morning on the nice guy's bed, she is offered a cup of piping hot cappuccino. Going out to get fresh fruits for making mixed juice for breakfast he suggests she take a shower in the meantime. Pampering herself in the shower, she hears the door open and a women's voice ""honey, I'm back early"". When later a naked (except for wrapping towel) woman bumps into the shower, screams and yells ""who the hell are you""? Kate can only offer ""I'm the plumber"". You know the drill. A run-of-the-mill rom-com, you think. But ""Last Christmas"" is not quite what you would expect.Eyeing the cast, you might say to yourself ""Not again, Michelle Yeoh and Henry Golding playing the possessive rich mother and the successful self-made son again!"" Far from it! The two of them does not even have a single scene together. And then, one would expect to see Emma Thompson as the snobbish high-class British woman and Emilia Clarke the rebellious spoilt kid. Wrong again!I am not going to spoil it, but just to give a little bit of flavour. When not drinking or picking up one-night stands, Kate works in a year-round Christmas store as the resident elf. Owner ""Santa"" (Yeoh), not her real name, is a demanding but not unreasonable boss. The relationship started well but as Kate's work attitude deteriorates, Santa gets less and less tolerant. As Kate sinks deeper into self-destruction, she beings to lose good, supportive friends. It's only when she has no choice but to go home (or be a ""homeless"" person wandering the streets of London all night) that we the audience see that ""home"" is not a luxurious mansion but a modest town house. Then, we are treated to Emma Thompson's amazing Yugoslavian accent, playing Kate's mother. The parents are refugees who, after over a decade, cannot see themselves accepted in their new country. It's this sense of insecurity that make mothers intolerable and father distant. Sister is a successful, self-made woman but she has her own situation, a homosexual relationship.Then an undauntable, cheerful young man walks into her life. Tom is not exactly prince charming but a delivery man on a bike, living in a neat but Spartan apartment. Yet, he has uncanny way of understanding Kate's problem. What follows is a series of almost surreal scenes that immediately invoke memories of a wonderful song, if you know that one ""Streets of London""""So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind"".With the reference to the Dickensian twist I mentioned in the headline, you see a Scrooge of sorts (albeit a very pretty one) whose mean spirit is magically transformed to charitable and love by the end of the movie. And this means that there are lot of support characters and side plots and reconciliations aplenty. First, there's Kate's own family members. Next comes Santa (and a cuter Yeoh I have never seen) whose romance blossoms all thanks to Kate. There are the friends that Kate makes up with. On top of that there is the whole gang and the charity hall for the homeless, where Kate eventually works as volunteer, thanks for Tom.Needless to say, I won't be so mean spirited as to close with a spoiler. I won't even mention the name of the movie but there is one, if you have seen it, that ""Last Christmas"" will surely remind you of. It stars Naomi Watts and Sean Penn."
648,"Being promoted as a rom-com Christmas movie (poster and trailer), we were expecting a happy, fun romantic Christmas movie. But this is ultimately neither a romance, nor a comedy!As a movie, in general, it is not that bad. It's a little bit fun in the first half, the chemistry between the two likeable protagonists attracts you and you hope they'll get together. There are some good scenes, that feel natural, but it does have a few other ones that ultimately feel odd (e.g. flirt scenes between the characters nicknamed ""Santa"" and ""Boy""). Additionally, I find it good, that it deals with subjects of always having positive thinking & attitude and being independent.YET, the movie has an unexpected turn that is SUCH a let-down, destroying our image of a happy & fun Christmas movie, which made it impossible for us to enjoy the movie overall. We don't recommend the movie to you! We'll actually try to forget it!Lastly, Emma Thompson's acting is brilliant, as always, yet it's disappointing to learn that she co-wrote the story and screenplay. I was also told a big part relates ""Seven Pounds"" closely, making it unoriginal.P.S. I found it great that the movie (initially) indirectly promoted the less usage of smartphones. YET, the twist of the plot destroys that too!
P.P.S We forgot it! Yay!"
649,I wanted to watch it because of Emma Thompson but the truth is that I almost fell asleep. I couldn't sympathise with the main character. It's not a terrible film but honestly I wouldn't watch it twice.
650,"I have a high tolerance for dreck, but this one was dreadful. It was a sour, unpleasant script with an unredeemably awful lead character; a twist halfway that wanted to make you feel sorry for her; and then another twist that made no sense other than being a desperate attempt to attach meaning to a charmless story. I feel sorry for the regal Michelle Yeoh and the dashing and handsome Henry Golding for being wasted here, and having never seen an episode of ""Game of Thrones"", I have no idea who Emilia Clarke is, other than she wrote a great essay on her aneurysm for the NYer. Unfortunately, my first exposure to her was a tonally disjointed mess that practically curdled on the screen. Skip it."
651,"Two recipes for success in film making for me are location and convincing roles.
Being drawn in by the catchy title and the leading actors was enough for me to reach for my Cineworld app and book the film.
Sat down and as the characters unfolded I was drawn into the film quite easily.
Being an old George Michael music lover help me to really love the characters and their roles - Emma Thompson's role was wonderful as was Michelle Yeohs good woman attitude.
I'm surprised too this hasn't got better scores but as per my title I was heartily blown away and the song Last Christmas was partially characterised through the film.
I for one lived and lived this film."
652,Typical romantic movie. kinda enjoy it But nothing special. Should be 6. Extra point cause of the eyebrow..
653,"I overall enjoyed watching this film but even the tiniest amount of sex jokes in any film makes me like it heaps less than I would've if nothing sexual was referenced to. This film was a good one to watch at the Drive In with my parents, having heaps of good jokes, funny scenes and emotion parts that really got me thinking 'who were the geniuses who made this film?' in a good way. And I really do mean it. But no more sex jokes! I'm serious!"
654,"It's interesting to see Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons playing such an upbeat, quirky character.My favorite part was seeing someone learn to ice-skate in just a few minutes. Why did it take me so long to learn how to skate? I guess she inherited that talent because . . . well. You won't hear it from me. Spoilers come later in this critique.Clarke is a great actress and I love that she can sing so well, too. Sometimes her eyebrows seem to take over the scene, but it's just me being weird about her amazingly agile eyebrows. Have you ever noticed those brows? They look like they could salsa dance across her forehead.But----she's gorgeous and fun to watch.I have a mild crush on the Asian dude. What's his name again? The Crazy Rich Asians guy. Umm. Nummy.Together I think they make quite a stunning pair.The movie is well cast. The ""Elvis"" singer practically stole the show . . . watch out for that guy in upcoming movies. Also: I think Emma Thompson chews up the scenery in such a splendid way.It's a love story of sorts, I suppose.SPOILER ALERT from here on:I loved the part about Albert's ""lesbian pudding."" Oh, my.My only gripe about this film is that it is the second one I've seen in a week where the lead character finds redemption by volunteering in a soup kitchen. Honest to Gawd. Is there some conspriracy now to try and make us all into lovers of vagrants and transients? (PLEASE DON'T WATCH ""Treasure,"" whatever you do. That is such a BAD MOVIE.)There is one moment in the movie where I about died from heartbreak. You'll know the moment when you get to it. Twilight Zone worthy stuff.And, by the way, sauerkraut is super cool. Really good for you. Go eat some now. Just be sure and eat the RAW ~ PERISHABLE ~ UNPASTEURIZED ~ KEEP REFRIGERATED
Naturally occurring LACTOBACILLI ~ Naturally Fermented sauerkraut."
655,"Nice - made me feel different at the end to when I went in. For me that difference was positive; I could balance the caricaturing, the sentimentality, the social commentary and the Christmas dressing. Don't think this could be carried off at another time of year and for some, they won't stomach the dollops of allegory.
I liked the acting and it had it's heart in the right place for me."
656,"I needed to write this down as some have mentioned that Yugoslavia was long gone before 1999. While it is true that most of the country broke up around 1991-1992, with wars to follow, Serbia and Montenegro continued together as Yugoslavia until 2003.
Hence, we can assume that the family is serbian.
Overall, an unexpectedly good movie."
657,"Last Christmas Review:Last Christmas is directed by Paul Feig and written by Emma Thompson. It follows Kate, a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn from there. Not gonna lie, I actually wanted to see it. It looked cute and all, but with a writer like Emma Thompson I really wanted to see it. I ended up seeing this later due to time constraints and the mixed reviews. Last Christmas is an enjoyable rom com, don't get me wrong. I found myself smiling throughout. The script is heartwarming and there are some funny moments. The cast does really with those two aspects. Emilia Clarke does a good job in this. She's humorous and just watching her life fall apart with her poor decision making is pretty entertaining. Then when Henry Goulding comes in, his character is likable and is helping her through everything. There's a plot point where he isn't around all the time, which I understand why he isn't there; it's to help her realize she doesn't need him all the time. The problem though was that at those points it felt a little empty, so they did kind of need him in the story. That part though kind of makes sense towards the end, but I'll get to that later. Emma Thompson does also star in the movie as Clarke's mother and she does a good job as this traditional Ukrainian mother. It sort of confused me though that she was the only one with the accent in the family and no one else had any. Overall, enjoyable characters and an enjoyable movie. Now there's a choice made in the story towards the end. It's quite the plot twist and I felt very uncomfortable thinking about everything after that. That twist seems to be dividing critics and audiences alike. It didn't really work for me and I wish they had maybe not have done that. The more you think about it, the more it sort of makes sense, however I don't think it was the best choice. Last Christmas is a fine rom com to watch for an enjoyable time. There's nothing special to it, in my opinion, and a twist that really hurt it as a whole. I will warn that to whoever wants to see it.My Grade: B-"
658,Loved Emilia Clarke in this movie! She is such a goofball of energy and it definitely shows in the movie. This movie is not to be taken serious. Just watch and relax. The plot twist is definitely a downer but something we wouldve never expected. I also liked how the soundtrack is George Michael because thats her characters favorite singer. I thought that gave the movie a bit more personal touch to the story.
659,"Last christmas song is always appears on radio on television and til now finally it is screened in the cinema . Being a new critic movie , i feel it is quite lovely for the near holiday . Paul Feig gave us overview story around Kate and Tom. The film has shown many scenes of humor, stress, romance and more than the unhappiness in life. Through the film I have drawn 3 things. firstly Christmas is something that can make your heart melt and warm others, regardless of status , 2: Love is always needed at the moment, even if you have to meet a bad day, just watch the light bulbs or walk on the street. Finally the words of the author: we will always give away and receive many words . If you are someone who likes to ring the Christmas bell, please order one and watch it doesn't cost anything and remember to follow the emotion of not criticizing because the movie is very touching !!"
660,"This film actually started off pretty bad, I can't remember how much I rolled my eyes. It was such bad screenwriting it felt that some scenes were awkwardly inserted so that the movie reaches minimum length or something.As the film goes on however, I noticed that the storyline progresses into somewhat an abstract form, with some focus, but not enough. It's like a camera going off focus then on focus, sometimes just confusing.The part going into the climax and then the ending was the part that really saved this show. The content isn't exactly original, there are quite a few other films or dramas which have similar content, but the presentation is really good.Right from the beginning until the end, the lead actress Emilia Kate really reminded me of Emma Stone, and her role in La La Land. There were some definite similarities between the 2 films as well. The other movie that this film reminds me of is The Birdman, given its abstract concepts and on-focus, off-focus style.In short, Emilia Kate really shined in this show, her performance being much stronger than any other cast, and is probably why this film is a masterpiece, like how Emma Stone shaped La La Land.Screenwriting however, leaves a lot to be desired for the earlier 70% of the film."
661,"Funny, corny, stupid, romantic, heartbreaking, heartwarming, disjointed, somewhat predictable and weird....all wrapped up with a simple but great message. I've seen this movie twice...and kind of wanna see it again."
662,"Wasn't sure at first but just because it's a bit quirky but I was soon loving it. I laughed, I cried and highly recommend 💕"
663,"It's a cute, joyous movie with the message to ""look up"". Another movie with a message to look around you or notice the little things. There are soo many good points of this movie, unfortunately they dont tie into each other well. It's like they realized they made the movie 3 hours but I could only be 1.5 hours with no refilling scenes. I'm a little upset because I was looking forward to seeing this and I'm not a romcom fan. Like she says shes leaning on him too much and shes this project he cant fix but like....literally nothing happened to lead to that. A little about politics but that was kinda thrown in. They throw so many issues and lessons and problems and resolutions but again, none of it really tied into each other. And every time it seemed like something was going to happen to make this movie awesome! They kinda dropped it. Emma Thompson surprised me by actually being serious in this role until her last scene of the standard ""comical"" way she acts and I was so upset. She almost had it. Kate's biggest lesson to overcome was her selfishness yet they ended the movie all about her..... should have broadened it a bit more to other's talents."
664,"6/10 - I expected for this to have been more of a rom-com, but it was more of a heartfelt holiday drama - still good, just not what I expected"
665,Great film but quite sad. Just an easy chick flick and good feel for Christmas
666,Last Christmas is a very beautiful heart warming film with some laughs in between.
667,"This film starts off a bit cheesy, but stick with it, as soon as Emma Thompson's character appears it starts to change.
Emilia was fab and I did not see the twist coming.
London looks beautiful, George and Whams songs are chosen well and I will always listen to the words of Last Christmas in a different way now.
Great Christmas film go see it."
668,"A mixed modern Christmas movie which just about manages to balance the heartbreak and joy amongst the not-so traditional festivities. There's good acting from the wide range of characters and lots of funny little moments to lighten up the mood, but it's very corny and the George Michael songs are more of a coincidence than an integral part of the plot."
669,"Last Christmas (3 out of 5 stars).Last Christmas is a romantic comedy film that follows its cliché roots about a young woman who does not have much luck until she meets a guy which she falls for. The film can have some dramatic turns of relatable situations. While the twist in the end does make the film very unpredictable which hits the film at an emotional level.The plot follows Kate (Emilia Clarke) a young woman who suffered an illness and has never been the same. Her mother tries to be over caring for her. She works at a Santa's elf store owned by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). She does not have much luck when it comes to disasters from meeting guys in a hook up to getting kicked out where ever she lives. She meets Tom (Henry Golding) who is confident and spirited about everything. Which turns her life around.The film plot is decent. It is nothing new. It does show the emotional impact it has on someone who is ill. Kate relationship with her parents are distant. She barely has any friends. She is trying to audition for roles which she gets rejected. Her boss at the Santa shop is annoyed with her laziness at work. And irresponsibility. But she is always giving hope and chances for her cause she still believes in her.Emilia Clarke is lovable as an actress. The role worked perfect for her and it worked well. Emma Thompson playing her mother was also fun. Henry Golding did well playing the high spirited guy that changes her perspective in life.I did find the movie to be kind of slow and boring for most of the first hour. Kate and Tom randomly bumping into each other. He is mysterious to her cause he never carries his phone around cause he does not believe in it. He volunteers at a homeless shelter at midnight. She can barely plan anything with him. Which he is trying to keep a distant?The twist in the end without giving away details really surprised me and I did not see coming at all. It did leave an emotional feeling with the characters. The soundtrack of the film with some George Michael songs being used was a lot of fun.Overall, Last Christmas is a fair film. The romantic comedy theme was over done and used. The plot is decent. The cast was good and the twist really made the film worth watching."
670,"I have never heard every single person in the cinema laugh and saw them being confused at the same time when the first scene comes on until this movie. We were all Croatians and of course we were amazed by inaccuracy of ""Yugoslavia 1999"". War was over years ago and church shown was Eastern Ortodox Church and not Catholic (not necessarily wrong, but it would have much more sense). Also, this movie would have perfect sense (it would be much, much better in my opinion and nothing would be missing) without any mention of Yugoslavia and war between Serbia and Croatia.But if we still forget about that bad start, there is an opening scene in a bar with Emilia that was awful. Their lines were short, clichéy lines and comebacks and scene was filled with poor filmed frames. I was really disappointed with the start and really hoped it won't continue like that... I hoped it will get better... And it did! Yes, some things were still silly and cringy, some were predictable, but some were funny and interesting. Tom's character pulled this movie from the bottom. He gave us many life and moral messages which caused that at some point you just tell to yourself: ""He can't be real, he is like an angel!"". But still, having that in mind, you don't expect that big twist, that moment which made this movie 2 scores better for me.
After that, as movie goes on, Christmas mood really hits you. Everything wraps up nicely and ends in a really good mood with nice thoughts."
671,"Love George Michael, love Emma Thompson, but not sure this worked as well as it could have.There is little to no subtlety at all in the plot, so even if it has been spoiled for you go along for the ride, as you'll probably be ahead of the films narrative anyway.There's not a lot of comedy here, or at least I didn't find it, and it falls into a few traps that make certain scenes very reminiscent of a generic Christmas TV movie, and more than a little cringe worthy.The decision for Clarke, Thompson and co. to be Yugoslavian immigrants seems a strange choice, but I'm assuming this might be a mirror to George's own Greek upbringing, and also allows a few soap box moments about immigration in the UK's and Brexit. The film in general seems to jam as many different nationalities in as possible throughout - I'm going to go out on a limb and say this might be the first ever Malaysian/Danish pairing on screen.All that aside, the 2 leads manage to add a bit of sparkle (Golding is charming throughout and Clarke becomes endearing as she starts to 'heal' herself), which coupled with a Christmas setting pushes you to care a little more than it deserves.As a tribute to Michael, aside from covering a few social issues close to his heart, his music is pretty much in every scene, but can feel very forced at times. Praying for Time, although completely out of context was used to very good effect, whilst Faith and Everything She Wants injected a much needed bit of life into proceedings.Clarke has a very sweet voice and it's a shame she doesn't sing more, I left contemplating if this would benefit from being more of a sung through musical, Michael's lyrics are honest and poignant, and for a film that uses his name heavily in promotion his songs are deserving of more prominence, and although Clarke's character professes to love George Michael it's never really followed through with."
672,"Although the movie was very predictable and a little cheesey at times, it was heart-warming and charming. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are well charming. It's worth a watch if you don't expect anything new or a huge surprise."
673,"LAST CHRISTMAS is a charming, yet silly, festive story that over indulges on the cheese and crackers. A wonderful George Michael soundtrack and sprinkles of feel good moments make this worth the watch but it all builds to a somewhat limp climax."
674,"As a a total Christmas freak I expected this movie to focus on Christmas and have a happy ending with a huge family reunion but in the end it was a bit sad. I don't wanna do spoilers but Christmas was like moved away. It almost didn't matter that it's Christmas which - for such a title, it should've mattered. It's not the happiest movie ever and the ending is far away from satisfying. The movie feels a little incomplete and while the concept of it is great - it's definitely not something I like seeing in 'Christmas' movies."
